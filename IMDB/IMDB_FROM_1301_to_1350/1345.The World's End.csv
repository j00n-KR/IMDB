0,MartinHafer,It's okay....,6,22 December 2013,"""The World's End"" is a very uneven film that I really, really wanted to like since I'd enjoyed the previous two films in this unofficial trilogy--""Sean of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". However, despite some wonderful twists, the film seemed like the script had some good ideas but needed to be cleaned up a bit more. After all, some of the characters behaved oddly--and I am talking about long before the film was supposed to get odd.The film begins with Gary (Simon Pegg) talking to other addicts in rehab about his 'good old days' of his youth and how he and his mates had always wanted to complete a 12 pub crawl in their home town. However, they never finished--as the alcohol finished them. Now, twenty years later, Gary has decided what he needs to do is NOT get sober but reassemble the old gang and finally finish the pub crawl. This aspect of the film was by far the weakest, as Gary was a thoroughly despicable jerk and his friends were supposedly successful members of society who didn't want to do the pub crawl--yet, completely inexplicably, they do. Why they all re-teamed was never properly established and until about a third of the way into the film, the film dragged and had few laughs.Now I will admit that a third of the way into the film, things got freaky and a bit fun. I cannot say more, as it would destroy the surprises for you. But, from here on, most of the film consisted of chases and LOTS of special effects. It lacked the humor of the previous two films and seemed more an exercise in excess than anything else. Overall, this is a mildly amusing film and nothing more--and it sure should have been. Much of this is due to Pegg playing such an unlikable guy. At least in the prior films, he was likable as were his motley assortment of friends.",The World's End
1,TheLittleSongbird,Was really great until the last quarter,7,14 April 2016,"Having loved 'Shaun of the Dead' and really enjoyed 'Hot Fuzz', expectations were high. And while 'The World's End' is not as good as those two in the end, it is incredibly entertaining mostly (if not for all tastes perhaps) and was almost a great film.For three quarters of the film, 'The World's End' has everything that made me like 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' so much, and was very close to their level in overall quality. It is a very well made film, with crisp editing, evocative scenery and costumes, atmospheric and handsome photography and often superb visual effects. The soundtrack is incredibly groovy, fits beautifully and gives off a real sense of nostalgia.Once again, Edgar Wright directs with plenty of energy and enthusiasm and does nothing to hurt the performances and chemistry of the actors (which was actually one of 'The World's End's' biggest strengths). The script, with the best lines mostly going to Pegg, has every ounce of the cracking wit and hilarity (with very few clunkers, the few that were or came close still had somewhat of an endearment) of the scripts for 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', the emotional content and development of the characters also managing to be even more intricate than those films. A lot of heart clearly went here, and apart from the one-dimensional and underused (to the extent that if she had been written out it would not have hurt the film at all) Sam the characters are interesting, Eddie Marsan's is more layered than expected. The story, apart from starting off a touch slow, is tightly paced and cleverly structured a vast majority of the time, and works just fine as a character study.The performances are strong across the board. It was a bold move reversing the typical basic roles Simon Pegg and Nick Frost usually play in their outings together, and, while they are better in the roles they are more comfortable and famous for, both acquit themselves very well and seem to be having a lot of fun. Their easy-going chemistry still shines through too. Eddie Marsan brings fun and emotion to his role, Paddy Considine is amusing and Martin Freeman brings his usual curmudgeonly charm. While her character is not as interesting as the rest and she doesn't have an awful lot to do Rosamund Pike is still solid with her comedic chops being put to much better than in 'Hector and the Search for Happiness' (another Simon Pegg film, but unfortunately it didn't live up to anywhere near the amount of potential it had). David Bradley, Bill Nighy and Pierce Brosnan (though the latter's was a tad on the silly side, but entertainingly so fortunately) make fun small appearances.Unfortunately, it is such a shame that 'The World's End' takes a complete nosedive in the last quarter. While the performances, visuals and music still continue to be good, after such a great first three quarters with only minor quibbles, 'Hot Fuzz' and especially 'Shaun of the Dead' handled the mixed genre aspect far more convincingly. The tonal shift is introduced far too suddenly to the extent that it felt like it came out of nowhere and the film just gets too ridiculous, with some overdone action (some of it is well-choreographed and entertaining, too much of it goes overboard), lack of eeriness and threat with the robots, lack of tension and suspense, a complete lack of explanation for the robots (so the film doesn't make much sense), a message that is delivered with the subtlety of a sledgehammer and the very ending is abrupt.Overall, three quarters of 'The World's End' was really great and up to par with 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' but the last quarter is a big letdown. A very solid 7/10. Bethany Cox",The World's End
2,Leofwine_draca,"As usual, a mixed bag from this team",6,29 September 2014,"THE WORLD'S END is the final instalment of Edgar Wright's ""cornetto"" trilogy, which began with SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ. These films are British comedies based around various genres; SHAUN is a zombie horror, while HOT FUZZ a cop action. THE WORLD'S END goes down the sci-fi route, specifically alien invasion, and the results are a mixed bag.I admit that I'm not a huge fan of this team to begin with. I find Nick Frost merely irritating, while Simon Pegg is overrated in the extreme; one of those ""one persona"" guys who seems to play the same character in every film he's in. As a director, Wright seems to be mildly hyperactive, and has no idea about consistence of tone. SHAUN was okay but HOT FUZZ was just way too dumb for me to enjoy.The good news is that THE WORLD'S END shows more promise than either of those two movies, perhaps because the story is more original. It involves a group of old school friends, meeting up years later for an epic pub crawl, only to run into an invasion of alien robots somewhere down the line. Bizarre, yes, but it does lead to a handful of cracking action sequences choreographed by Bradley James Allan, a guy who knows a thing about action given that he studied under Jackie Chan. These scenes make the best of Nick Frost's surprising fluidity (learned for his role as a dancer in CUBAN FURY) and are the best thing about the movie.The humour is hit and miss, generally more miss than hit though. There's some good character work from Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine and Eddie Marsan, but way too many of the gags rely on profanity for effect, which just becomes repetitive. You end up feeling that the writers have strictly juvenile mindsets. The budget is a bit bigger here, so the effects are improved, and the robotic scenes are great. Unfortunately it all falls apart in the last twenty minutes with one of the most unsatisfying climaxes ever, which is a shame because I was sort-of enjoying the middle section. Hence the mixed bag comment.",The World's End
3,SnoopyStyle,The band is back together,7,3 June 2014,"Gary King (Simon Pegg) gathers up the childhood gang of Andy Knightley (Nick Frost), Oliver Chamberlain (Martin Freeman), Steven Prince (Paddy Considine) and Peter Page (Eddie Marsan) to return home to Newton Haven to complete The Golden Mile. It's a club crawl of 12 pubs that the boys failed back in the old days. Gary is still stuck in the past while the others have moved on and grown up. Gary is bent on drinking the Golden Mile, but the others are getting more sick of him. Then it gets weird. And Oliver's sister Sam (Rosamund Pike) joins the group.The gang is back with some new friends. The first half has a few laughs but Gary has a patheticness about him. Things get weird. The jokes get funnier. I love the discourse about the meaning of words. The problem later on is that the pub crawl gets stupider and the group loses people. The final confrontation is long winded and not that funny. Also I don't like the epilogue. It doesn't make it funnier and it just extends the ending into a completely different place.",The World's End
4,nogodnomasters,SHOW ME THE WAY TO THE NEXT WHISKEY BAR,10,19 July 2018,"In 1990, in the town of Newton Haven, Gary King (Simon Pegg) leads a group of young men on an adventure down the Golden Mile as they attempt to visit all 12 pubs in one night, winding up at ""The World's End."" They never completed the trek. The group grew up and scattered. Gary has decided he needs to go back and do the 12 pub drinking trek at age 40 as a rite of passage, his life's accomplishment. He gets the reluctant gang back and off they go.The film starts out like a fairy decent comedy and then suddenly Newton turns into Stepford. In spite of their lives and the planet being in danger, Gary still wants to complete the quest as the best way NOT to draw attention to themselves. The film was funny and when the Doors started to play, I had to laugh and sing with the film.The theme of the film is about conformity as a swap of freedoms for comfort. It portrays conformists as robots of the system, all working for the common good.Good quirky comedy that will be added to my collection. Highly recommended for those who like a smart British comedy.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No nudity. Implied sex.",The World's End
5,kosmasp,Finish what you start,7,2 June 2014,"This is a different beast than the previous collaborations. It still is a comedy mind you, but the pace and the characters are more than different. Plus the relationship between Nick and Simon seems to be on the edge to say the least. But it's a much needed change in pace too. You also shouldn't even begin to compare this to the other end of the world movie (this is the end).It may seem immature (and some of the jokes are exactly that), but there is a message here about maturing and getting over things. It's not perfectly hinted at or shown off, but the movie it engulfs is more than just a shell. It does entertain all the way through ...",The World's End
6,Sleepin_Dragon,Outrageously huge fun.,8,13 February 2018,"I must start by admitting to have reviewed this previously and removed it, last time round I must have been in a bad mood, I criticised it for going off the boil, however in recent times I've gotten so into it, it's meant to be bonkers, outrageous and utterly over the top and it sure is. I think there's something incredibly British about the humour, the world could come to an end, but there's still time for nostalgia, and more importantly there's still time for a pint. It's still perhaps my least favourite of The Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, but the other two are that good, and hard acts to follow. It is clever, it's witty, and which of us doesn't know a Gary? If only it didn't have to be a trilogy, would have loved more from this successful group, it's an underrated gem.",The World's End
7,classicsoncall,"""I feel a little uncomfortable drinking this much.""",6,15 April 2021,"Here's yet another collaboration between director and writer Edgar Wright with actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, following up on their prior hilarious films, ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". I didn't think this one was on a par with either of those two, and in particular, with Pegg coming on a bit harsh with his character Gary King. The set up for the story has 'The King' reuniting his boyhood friends from the town of Newton Haven in order to complete a mission they set out for twenty years prior but never finished - completing a pub crawl calling for a dozen bars along the town's 'Golden Mile'. For this viewer, the story line had more than subtle references to a couple of sci-fi classics, the first being ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" which is pretty evident early on, along with ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" in the latter part of the picture. For a comedy, this seemed to have more than it's share of martial arts style bar room brawls, with Gary's pal Andy Knightley (Frost) leading the charge in one of them to take on the blue blooded aliens who have taken over Newton Haven. The quips and one liners come at a rapid pace, though the film loses a little steam as it nears the finish line with the alien voice making it's demands known to what's left of The King's musketeers. Rosamund Pike shares in the antics as Gary's old time gal pal Sam Chamberlain, and does her part to pull the boys out of a jam as the story comes to a close. Lending credence to the title, the last pub on the Golden Mile is called The World's End, and this wouldn't be a modern day epic if it didn't go up in flames at the finale. You can have a bit of fun with this one, but if you're not familiar with Simon Pegg's brand of humor, start off with this one to build up to the other two.",The World's End
8,lee_eisenberg,"Hail to the king, baby!",10,25 December 2013,"Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright completed the Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy with ""The World's End"", featuring Pegg as a boorish man who gathers some college buddies to do a pub crawl that they hadn't completed earlier...only to discover that they might be humanity's best hope for survival! I had never heard of Pegg, Frost and Wright before ""Shaun of the Dead"" came out, but they've proved to be a very capable team every step of the way. My favorite of their collaborations is ""Paul"", which is actually not part of the Cornetto trilogy. Nonetheless, this movie is a really fun one. It's all about living one's life to the fullest, with a lot of surprises. The end subtly looks at the risk of excessive reliance on technology. But mostly it's an excuse to party. You're sure to love it.",The World's End
9,jboothmillard,The World's End,8,7 August 2013,"This was advertised as being part of a trilogy, following Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, called the ""Cornetto Trilogy"" or ""The Ice Cream and Blood Trilogy"", the stories and characters are different in all, but all have returning lead and supporting stars, and are directed by Edgar Wright, I was looking forward to this third film. Basically Gary King (Simon Pegg) is a recovering alcoholic who recalls when he and his estranged friends were teenagers attempting to do the Golden Mile, a pub crawl drinking in twelve pubs in their hometown of Newton Haven, but all those years ago they failed to reach the last pub The World's End. He decides after nearly twenty years to try and convince friends Peter Page (Eddie Marsan), Oliver 'O-Man' Chamberlain (Martin Freeman), Steven Prince (Paddy Considine) and Andrew Knightley (Nick Frost) to get back together and return to Newton Haven and complete the marathon they failed to, and they all agree. Starting in the first of the twelve pubs, The First Post, they all have a pint of alcohol, apart from non drinker Andrew who insists on water, but they were not greeted with a hero's welcome as untrustworthy and impulsive Gary expected. Moving on to The Old Familiar, which looks exactly the same as the first, the gang reunite with Oliver's sister Sam (Die Another Day's Rosamund Pike), Gary tries to make a sexual advance like he had with her in the past, but she rejects this, and Sam has never forgiven him for sleeping with her having loved her since they were teenagers. It is when they get to The Cross Hands that things get strange, Gary gets into a fight with a teenager in the toilets, he is extraordinarily strong and agile, and accidentally taking his head off he is exposed as a robot, more of them fight the others who come in. The group are sure that many people in the town have become these mindless robots, which explains why they do not recognise them or act suspiciously, but to avoid suspicion the gang continue their pub crawl to The Two Headed Dog. There Sam becomes aware of the invasion of robots, and at The Mermaid they learn more about the robots, that they require DNA to copy and replace people, and at the next pub their former school teacher Guy Shephard (Pierce Brosnan), who is a robot, tells them to accept their fate. Oliver is revealed as a robot replacement, but despite the battles and danger Gary insists on still drinking a pint during the chaos, but he convinces Sam to get in her car and get out of Newton Haven. Steven, Peter and Andrew get into an argument and have to prove themselves not being robots as well, e.g. with scars, Gary refusing to reveal a tattoo instead bangs his head on a pillar, and when the robots close in on them in the bowling club Peter is captured. Gary is still determined to finish the Golden Mile, he reaches the next pub and gives his car keys to Andrew and Steven to make their escape, but Steven gets caught up in a fight with the machines, and the two remaining friends make a run to the final pub, The World's End. There Andrew refuses to let him drink what will be the last pint, he has never forgiven him for letting him get arrested for possession of drugs, and Gary becomes tearful saying that he has nothing in life to live for except completing the Mile. Gary ignores the pleas from Andrew and pulls the lever for the final pint, but it instead activates a hidden chamber beneath the bar, and they are surrounded by the robot replacements of the townspeople and their former friends. The alien voice The Network (Bill Nighy) explains that the replacement of humans was a process for ""civilising"" for the good of humanity, with recent decades bringing great advances in telecommunications, and they are offered eternal youth if they accept the plans, but they argue that humanity should be allowed to be imperfect. After a long argument The Network excepts that humans are more trouble than they are worth the aliens abandon the plan and leave Earth, and Sam arrives after the pub begins to self-destruct, but the destruction is growing on a vast scale. In the end Andrew recounts how the world came to a virtual end, with modern civilisation destroyed, the world is in the Dark Ages, robots reactivated and remain on Earth, without technology humanity can commute somewhat better, Andrew has had his marriage recovered, Steven and Sam are together, Peter and Oliver live their lives as robots, and Gary returned to the ruins of Newton Haven to reattempt the Golden Mile, with water. Also starring Harry Potter's David Bradley as Basil, Psychoville's Reece Shearsmith as Collaborator, Green Wing's Mark Heap as Publican, Steve Oram as Motorcycle Cop and Rafe Spall as Young Man. Pegg is brilliant being the foul-mouthed pack leader with the desperation to finish what was started, Frost is likable being the thinking one with a darker side, they always make the best duo, the supporting cast are all well chosen, with great cameos always surprising and fun to watch. It is about half an hour before the big plot of the film unfolds, with alien technology trying to take over the world, but it all woks, the witty and profanity filled dialogue is really funny, the use of mostly 90's indie and pop music is great, the special effects are terrific, the appearance of the Cornetto is well timed, and the reworking of the genre is done well for fans, it is a fantastically funny and zany science-fiction comedy. Very good!",The World's End
10,rmax304823,The Golden Mile.,6,4 August 2014,"It's a science fiction movie, though you won't know it until you're well into the story of five guys who have decided to drive to an isolated village and have drinks at ten pubs in a row -- the Golden Mile -- ending in a public house called ""The World's End."" The beginning is rather frantic and forced. Simon Pegg, who has an odd and putty-like face, is the leader of the group. He's insistent on the adventure because his mother just passed on, but it turns out that he'd grown up in the village and was trying to ""recapture his youth."" The problem is that practically no one -- except a former girl friend, Rosamund Pike, remembers Pegg. The pubs, the shops, the entire village is filled with expressionless faces. I don't think I want to get into the plot too much further because the whole nature of the film changes at about the half-way point. If you've seen ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", you'll know what I mean.What began as a quiet and somewhat silly comedy turns into an explosion of action and special effects. You've never seen such wreckage.I don't mind so much that it's two films stitched together with piano wire, but I wish the gags were funnier than they are. Everyone involved seems to be trying too hard. Simon Pegg has one defiant speech towards the end that makes a mockery of human features. It would have been nice to give him more such scenes.",The World's End
11,Tweekums,The final film in the 'Cornetto Trilogy',7,14 February 2016,"When Gary King was nineteen he and four friends; Peter, Oliver, Steven and Andy, attempted an epic twelve pub crawl through their home town of Newton Haven; they didn't make it but it was still the best night of Gary's life. Now, twenty odd years later he decides to get his friends together and complete the crawl. They aren't too keen as they have all got on with their lives but eventually he talks them round and they return to their old home town. Not surprisingly it has changed somewhat; the pubs are now near-identical; part of a homogenised chain there is something else odd; something they can't quite put their fingers on. In the second pub they are joined by Oliver's sister Sam; who Gary manages to offend. They continue their crawl until the four pub when everything is turned upside down Gary gets in a fight in the toilet and is more than a little shocked to find his opponent is a robot! It soon emerges that most of the town have been replaced and if Gary and his friends aren't to be next they will have to be careful and that means completing the crawl!This is a decent conclusion to the 'Cornetto Trilogy' which I suspect will improve on future watchings although obviously the surprise involving the robots won't be a surprise. Early on it was hard to like protagonist Gary as he come across as a manipulative loser who refuses to grow up, as we learn more about him he becomes more tragic and thus a little bit more sympathetic. Simon Pegg does a fine job in the role. The rest of the cast are good too; as well as Pegg's regular sidekick Nick Frost there are several familiar faces; most notably Paddy Constantine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsden and Rosamund Pike who play the central characters; there is also a fun cameo from Pierce Brosnan as their old teacher who is now one of the alien robots. There are plenty of well-choreographed fights and the moment the first robot's head comes off was a genuine surprise as there had been no previous hints.The film nicely captures the feeling of returning to somewhere you haven't been in years where you aren't sure if the place has changed or you have or both. The way the town's people had been replaced was reminiscent of 'The Stepford Wives' only here almost everybody had been replaced by 'better' versions. There are also obvious links to the previous 'Cornetto' films as our protagonists find themselves up against vast numbers of threatening characters in what appears to be the sort of typical English town that should be too boring to feature in an action movie. As I watched I couldn't help thinking that the odds of all twelve pubs still being open twenty years on was almost as unlikely as everybody being taken over by robots perhaps that is why they stayed open as pubs up and down the country closed! Overall an entertaining enough film.",The World's End
12,BA_Harrison,Five get drunk in Newton Haven.,7,18 September 2014,"The third film in Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright's so-called 'Cornetto trilogy' (following Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz), The World's End sees a group of middle-aged friends, led by irresponsible screw-up Gary King (Pegg), revisiting their home town of Newton Haven to tackle The Golden Mile, the twelve pint pub crawl that they failed to complete when they were young. While staggering from pub to pub, the lads discover the reason for the soul-less atmosphere in the town's once cosy drinking establishments: the place has been been over-run by aliens who have replaced the inhabitants with replicants!Part sentimental character-driven drama, part daft comedy, and part excessive sci-fi blockbuster, The World's End is an enjoyable enough piece of nonsense with no shortage of ideas and energy—ideal for a Saturday night accompanied by a few (12?) beers. And yet, as much fun as I had with the craziness, I still can't help but feel a tad disappointed, the film falling short of the genius I know the team is capable of. For each solid gag, there are several that don't work quite as well, and as brilliantly executed as the special effects-driven action sequences are, they exist at the expense of the film's greatest virtue: it's heart—so evident in early scenes, but sadly lacking once the blue goop starts flying.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for for the excellent soundtrack, which features The Soup Dragons, The Sisters of Mercy, Suede, Primal Scream, and the brilliant Inspiral Carpets.",The World's End
13,Quinoa1984,Whole lotta WTF,10,8 November 2014,"The World's End is a film about the end of the world, a film about getting f***ed up, and most of all (and it's best at) an acidic satire (at times just a full-on drama) on growing up, being asses, and male camaraderie. Add to this robots-that-aren't-technically-robots-but-they-are, and an alien intelligence right out of Douglas Adams. And all the while it's a maturing for these writers, and an embrace of the 'Body Snatcher' formula to a wonderful extent.For Edgar Wright, 'World's' is the conclusion to a very loose 'trilogy' started with Shaun of the Dead and continued with Hot Fuzz where he and star Simon Pegg write genre pieces (zombie flick, buddy cop scenario, sci-fi/horror invasion) and muck up the genres with something surprising and refreshing: honest-to-goodness characters, and some real tension, as Pegg plays a burn-out nearing 40 who rallies together his old group to finally make a go at a 12-bar pub crawl through a sleepy English town on a night where, oops, robots (I KNOW they're not robots but the ARE) are all abound and taking people over.Wright and Pegg start off with just the character stuff, and it's arguable whether this may even be the best part of the movie, just seeing Pegg, playing an incessant but almost lovable jerk, and Wright actor Nick Frost playing – harrowingly, soulfully well, this isn't just Frost playing a variation on his usual fun-bumbling self he's projected in Wright's and other films – a wounded best-friend to Pegg's character, and it's all solid comic dialog and interaction, some very awkward and some just straightforward in the approach to hardcore drinking so that when the science fiction s*** goes down, it goes down hard. Oh, and Martin Freeman. Fill in the blank on his awesomeness at playing the 'straight' man to a lot of this madness, and how he evolves...",The World's End
14,Coventry,Boys will be Boys! Until they become  something else!,7,21 February 2017,"Unlike the vast majority of the earthly population, I didn't get instantly blown away when I first saw ""Shaun of the Dead""; the first and much acclaimed collaboration of the golden British trio Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. It really took me 2 or even 3 viewings in order to fully realize it was the greatest things to happen to zombie cinema since Romero's original ""Dead""-trilogy. However, it only took me a couple of seconds to absolutely love their second effort ""Hot Fuzz""! I was an immediate fan of this film's terrific mix of sharp humor, absurd but imaginative plotting and outrageous violence. With these experiences in mind, I couldn't wait to see their third feature (and supposedly also the final chapter in their own unofficial movie-trilogy) ""The World's End""; especially also because this one stars a few more excellent guest stars like Martin Freeman, Rosamund Pike and Pierce Brosnan. Like ""Hot Fuzz"", ""The World's End"" opens with a brilliantly fast-paced and hilariously original introduction of the main characters. They are five young lads living in a dull and prototypical British village called Newton Haven, and during their high school graduation night, the self-acclaimed leader Gary King forces the rest to undertake the legendary ""Golden Mile""-tour passed the town's twelve local pubs. The evening ends traumatically for the four friends, and none of them didn't even make it until the last pub (which is aptly named ""The World's End"") but for Gary this particular night still remains the highlight of his miserable life, especially now more than twenty years later when he's living like a lonely hermit and follows group therapy. He sets out on a mission to reunite the old gang and meet in Newton Haven to complete the entire pub-tour once and for all. He bizarrely succeeds in persuading them, even though all four of them now lead successful lives and still hate Gary King with a passion for all the trouble he caused them when they were teenagers. But even though the town, the pubs and all the old inhabitants still look exactly the same, something beneath the surface has changed in Newton Haven. It isn't until their fourth drinking stop, and during a good old-fashioned fight in the loo, they discover that their hometown has been struck by an invasion of some sort. You really have to give credit to Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg for taking a concept that has been done before numerous times already (""Invaders from Mars"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Strange Invaders"", ""The Stepford Wives"") and still be able to come across as inventive and refreshingly original! It's best that you don't know anything about the plot from beforehand, so that you can get genuinely surprised and amused by the outcome of the fight sequence in the toilets, and then remain just as unbelieving and confused as the five protagonists during the rest of the movie! Although slightly less overpowering than in ""Hot Fuzz"", it's the typically dry British humor and the posh/cocky stereotypes that work most effectively, but the duo also once more prove themselves to be masters in penning down the wittiest dialogues, hilarious little inside jokes, tongue-in-cheek references and downright dumb situations that simply make you laugh. I'm convinced that many lines and absurd situations in the script of ""The World's End"" are actually inspired Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's own experiences as turbulent adolescents in a stern and uptight British community. What also works really well, and has pretty much become their trademark, are the many repetitive and rapidly edited shots of ordinary stuff (like filling a pint) and recurring punch lines (""Let's go Boo- Boo""), which empowers the fast pacing even more. I really don't want to spoil anything about the plot, but I can reveal it gets very messy, with lots and lots of blood – although not necessarily red – and violence. Stellar performances all around, but evidently Simon Pegg gives away the most memorable one thanks to his delightfully marginal, foul-mouthed and intolerable alter ego Gary King.",The World's End
15,studioAT,A weak end to the trilogy,2,1 June 2017,"If 'Shaun of the Dead' saw Simon Pegg's star rise, 'Hot Fuzz' was the peak, then this weak film is surely the decline.Yes, it has its moments, and some big names along the for the ride, but this lacks the charm of the two previous films, and therefore all falls a little bit flat.It's rude in places, too sweary in others, and the role reversal between Pegg and co-star Nick Frost doesn't work for me either.Every trilogy has a weak link, this is the weak link here by a long way.",The World's End
16,hitchcockthelegend,"Just three cornetto's, give them to me!",7,27 August 2016,"Who's the helmet without a helmet?Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright reconvene to close down the cornetto trilogy that had began with Sean of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Here we find Pegg as a card carrying alcoholic who coerces his old mates into undertaking a fabled drinking binge in their home town of New Haven. But things are not as they used to be...This simply isn't on the same level as ""Sean and Fuzz"", but that doesn't remotely make it a duffer of a film. Weight of expectation was enormous, and rightly so, but although it doesn't carry the mighty comedic gold of the first two films, it has fun, cheek and emotion in abundance. In fact its biggest crime is not being the final film so many legions of fans were hoping for. If stripping back those expectations and original disappointments, then repeat viewings bring plentiful rewards.Riffing on science fiction films, pic's story cunningly observes male behaviour, most notably the man-child effect and the refusal to let the past stay in the past, the pic begins in almost solemn fashion and ends in daring chaos. Along the way there's a whole host of sly visual gags to catch, whilst the caustic concerns for once vibrant towns brought down by soulless entertainment chains positively fizzles with poignant awareness.No doubt about it, Wright and Pegg call their own shots, which is ultimately refreshing in an era of film making struggling to keep its head above the sequel and remake swamp. Choice dialogue, some of which is very British in street core, and some laugh out loud moments, off set the more juvenile moments filtered through the plot.A super cast has been assembled, where series regulars either star or cameo to further emphasise the constant of the cornetto trilogy - that of film lovers making films for film lovers, with camaraderie of cast set in stone. The sound track choices sparkle, a mix of Brit-Pop, Madchester and era defining popsters (Old Red Eyes Is Back by The Beautiful South has never been so pertinently used). All baked in a superb period tinted pie.There's something of an action overload, while some tonal shifts have understandably proved to be confusing to some. But this still showcases - in credit - the considerable talents of Messrs Wright, Pegg and Frost. Teen angst machismo, alcoholism and hidden passions clash with Invasion of the Body Snatchers! It shouldn't work, but it does! 7/10",The World's End
17,Hey_Sweden,"""It's pointless arguing with you.""",7,4 November 2015,"As a fan of the Simon Pegg / Nick Frost / Edgar Wright combo, this viewer enjoyed ""The World's End"" to a reasonable degree. It's not as funny or engaging as their previous ventures, but it's full of spirit and hard to really dislike. It takes a while to grab hold because the central character played by Pegg is rather hard to take. Fortunately, it hits its stride with an endearingly ridiculous plot twist a third of the way through. Then it turns into a delirious blend of over the top action, end of the world sci-fi, and absurdist comedy.Pegg plays Gary King, a very outgoing adult desperate to relive a highlight of his youth, from almost a quarter century ago. He and his fellow teen friends went on an epic ""pub crawl"", although they weren't able to see it to complete fruition. Now he somehow manages to convince his friends - who've grown up more than he has - to reunite for a reenactment of that long ago night of revelry. Then at one point they realize that their old hometown has been invaded by otherworldly forces that do extreme things to keep human beings in line.Although overlong, ""The World's End"" does a likable enough job of combining utterly daft moments with a smattering of more poignant ones. As the movie goes on, Gary becomes more endearing, while events around him get progressively more insane. He becomes a man on a mission, determined to complete the pub crawl with his friends in order to keep up the pretense that they know nothing of what's really going on.Pegg plays Gary with broad comic gusto, while it's nice to see his pal Frost in the straight man role. Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Eddie Marsan likewise do a fine job of reacting to his antics. Rosamund Pike is appealing, and there's a very solid supporting cast of actors such as Pierce Brosnan, David Bradley, Michael Smiley, Steve Oram, and Bill Nighy.It would have been hard for this viewer not to dig a movie that ruminates on human nature while quoting from Roger Cormans' classic biker picture ""The Wild Angels"".Seven out of 10.",The World's End

19,zardoz-13,The Best Edgar Wright & Simon Pegg Outing!!!,10,24 July 2016,"""Shaun of the Dead"" writer & director Edgar Wright's comic doomsday thriller ""The World's End"" represents one of his most ambitious efforts with co-scenarist and star Simon Pegg. Unfortunately, most of everything that follows in this brief review reveals essential plot points. Chiefly, where ""Shaun of the Dead"" served up zombies, ""The World's End"" concerns body snatchers, as in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" If you don't know about the snatchers in advance, you're infinitely better off, but since the film has been in release since 2013 and available on home video for the last two years, you're going to find out about the surprising turn. What begins as an innocent pub crawl by a group of friends who haven't seen each other in 16 years amounts to a helter-skelter fight for survival as our quintet of heroes, accompanied at one point by a woman, battle hordes of body snatchers. Wright's idea for body snatchers is visually stimulating. They open their mouths and blinding light erupts. Most of them become robots of a sort, and when their heads, arms, and/or legs are torn off, they bleed blue blood. No, ""The World's End"" won't impart nightmares by simply watching it, but it is as much if not more fun that either ""Shaun of the Death"" and ""Hot Fuzz."" Pegg is Gary King, a fugitive from a therapy group. This may be the most obnoxious character that Pegg has portrayed, and he inflicts himself on his own friends like a disease designed to absorb them. It seems that his love of drink has turned him into a raging alcoholic, and Gary reunites with four of his old public school chums, and cajoles them into returning to their hometown, where none live any longer, to complete the pub crawl that they embarked on years ago but never concluded. Gary's friends are Oliver Chamberlain (Martin Freeman of ""The Hobbit""), Steven Prince (Paddy Considine of ""The Bourne Ultimatum""), Andy Knightley (Nick Frost of ""Paul""), and Pete Page (Eddie Marsan of ""Sherlock Holmes""). Each of them has good paying job and they appear to have succeeded in life compared with poor Gary. Initially, none of his pals want to take up where they left off all those years ago, especially Gary's closest friend Andy. After he picks them up, Gary explains what will follow as the evening's entertainment, ""Tonight, we will be partaking of a liquid repast as we wind our way up the Golden Mile. Commencing with an inaugural tankard in The First Post, then on to The Old Familiar, The Famous Cock, The Cross Hands, The Good Companions, The Trusty Servant, The Two-Headed Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive, The King's Head, and The Hole in the Wall for a measure of the same, all before the last bittersweet pint in that most fateful terminus, The World's End. Leave a light on good lady, for though we may return with a twinkle in our eyes, we will be in truth blind - drunk!"" Nevertheless, tenacious as Gary is, he discovers that he cannot control everything, and some things are not only different, but do not yield to his will. Pierce Brosnan appears in a brief role, and David Bradley is cast as a body snatchers know-it-all. Naturally, Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are pals. Wright keeps the plot moving like a supercharging escalator, and the dialogue is snappy. The ending scene is outstanding.",The World's End

21,neil-476,OK ageing lads' comedy,7,26 July 2013,"Disappointed when his school-leaving pub crawl was aborted 23 years ago, Gary Knight gathers his friends about him to try to repeat the exercise successfully. He does not, however, bank on the town of Newton Haven, wherein the 12 targetted pubs reside, having been taken over by, er, alien robots.Bracketted together with Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz, The World's End fits better as a trilogy with Paul than with Hot Fuzz, what with being a comedy about ordinary oiks, nailed to a nerd genre movie. And that is probably both its strength and its weakness. The comedy is very much as expected - foul mouthed, often but not always coarse, and quite funny - and the nerd genre material is well done with a genuine sense of jeopardy, but the two don't always sit easily together.Having said that, for the most part everything works well. I'm not too sure about Gary's big moment at the end, spouting off drunkenly - I realise it was part of resolving Gary's issues, but I can't help thinking it would have been funnier if he had been drunker. For all that, this movie is quite good fun.",The World's End
22,evanston_dad,One (or Two or Three) for the Road,8,9 January 2014,"Simon Pegg and company, the guys who brought us the nearly perfect ""Hot Fuzz"" and maybe not perfect but awfully hilarious ""Shaun of the Dead,"" don't disappoint with their latest, ""The End of the World."" The eponymous event of the film's title comes during a pub crawl, as a group of friends reunite years after their days of youth to finish what they started so many years before -- having a pint at every bar in their sleepy, dead little home town, finishing their night of debauchery at The World's End. Along the way, they notice that the town they remember is no longer quite what it seems, and that an alarming number of townspeople (Pierce Brosnan among them) are prone to losing their limbs and heads amid gushes of blue blood. Their struggle to get to the next pint becomes a struggle for survival in a mad dash of sensationally choreographed fight scenes and droll one-liners.I don't think ""The World's End"" is quite as tight a film as either ""Hot Fuzz"" or ""Shaun of the Dead,"" but it's still a fantastic comedy and is even more enjoyable for having a serious theme at its center.Grade: A-",The World's End
23,ferguson-6,Let's Boo Boo,7,7 September 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. Yes, this is the third in the unofficial Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy, and my guess is if you know that, you have already seen this one. Director Edgar Wright has previously delivered is parody of Zombies (Shaun of the Dead), his parody of buddy-cop-action films (Hot Fuzz), and now takes on Sci-Fi in this latest ... a worthy ending with the trademark quick cuts and rapid fire witty/silly dialogue.I love the premise of this one. 5 buddies reluctantly reunite after 20 years to try to finish what they failed to in their youth: 12 pubs/12 pints ... an epic pub crawl. It touches on the male transition to middle-age and also reinforces the old saying 'you can't go home again'. Simon Pegg (also co-writer with Wright) stars as Gary King, a recovering addict who is quite simply struggling with adulthood. His manic energy reunites the boys and carries the early movie. Nick Frost really shines here and takes on a different persona from the previous two movies.As I have stated many times, comedies are the most difficult genre to review as everyone's sense of humor varies. What I can report is that I laughed quite a bit at the dialogue, but didn't have much love for the sci-fi portions, despite some similarities to Westworld and The Stepford Wives. Oh, and Rosamund Pike reminded me again why I am no fan of hers (yes, I realize I'm in the minority).Hardcore fans will enjoy the steady stream of regular Wright faces, and yes, we do get the expected failed fence jump. This one won't stick with me for long, but I appreciated the laughs.",The World's End

Movie Begins.,8,29 July 2015,"The World's End (2013): Dir: Edgar Wright / Cast: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Rosamund Pike, Pierce Brosnan: Title refers not only to the name of a bar but also the reality that technology is taking over our daily lives. Edgar Wright brings back Simon Pegg and Nick Frost after giving us such hilarious comic wonders as Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. It regards five friends who attempted a pub crawl that involved twelve pubs but it never got completed. Now middle aged Pegg lives in the past and cannot move forward until he returns to his home town and complete the crawl. His four friends reluctantly join him despite moving onward in terms of careers and family. Major plot turn regards the fact that nobody seems to recognize them and the reason behind this provides not only humour but also a lot of suspense. While some of this is corny much of it is creative and funny. Structure is flawed by repetition with each pub visit and even that becomes an issue. All twelve pubs are named but it might have been more interesting had it focused on a theme in order to provide a more intriguing and amusing take on each pub. Pegg brings out the longing to correct something that hinders him to move forward. He's hilarious scheming his friends into an uncertain fate. Frost plays his best friend angered over a past incident involving Pegg. Rosamund Pike is featured as the sister of one of the guys and whom Pegg aggressively hits on. Pierce Brosnan appears as a professor whom Pegg never had much of a liking for. Exciting ending to Wright's trilogy where technology secures our end. Score: 8 / 10",The World's End
26,FlashCallahan,What the f*** does WTF mean?,8,21 July 2013,"20 years after attempting an epic pub crawl, five friends reunite when one of them becomes obsessed with trying the drinking marathon again. They are convinced by Gary, a 40-year old man trapped in the wilderness of his teens, who drags his reluctant pals to their home town and once again attempts to reach the fabled pub, The World's End. As they attempt to reconcile the past and present, they realise the real struggle is for the future, not just theirs but humankind's. Reaching The World's End is the least of their worries......Seven years after the brilliant, but overlong Hot Fuzz, Wright, Pegg and Frost complete their fabled Cornetto trilogy with this, a hybrid of the first two movies. The 'Robots' are almost Zombie like, and the village pretty much resembles Sandford.And while it doesn't hit the heights of SOTD (which nothing will for a long time), its on a par with Hot Fuzz, and its great to see the majority of the cast from both films back for very small roles, or extended cameos.But I really feel that the film will be appreciated more by the thirty to forty something crowd, because the film oozes nostalgia from the early nineties and it really took me back to my schooldays and the music is amazing.Pegg is different in this, he's the antagonist, the bad seed in the group, and although we never really know the reasons why (apart from the fact he misses his adolescence), his character oozes aggravation and sympathy at he same time.Frost is as good as always, as is Considine. Freeman and Marsan get a little bit left out, but they still have some great scenes.It takes a wile to get going, but once we hit the first pub, you will get the familiarity back from the first two movies, and Spaced.Its not the masterpiece I was expecting, but I was laughing from begging.

27,Aaron1375,Was glad I was finally able to see a Simon Pegg Nick Frost film in the theaters.,8,30 September 2013,"I once heard of ""Shaun of the Dead"" and wanted to see it as at the time I was a zombie fan in a land where being a zombie fan was rare. The film did not come to any theaters in my area, so I did not see it till it made its way to DVD. Then ""Hot Fuzz"" was going to come out and they actually advertised it so I was sure I could see it, but alas not local release for it either. I could have seen ""Paul"", but I never got around to it. Then, this year, I heard of this movie and it advertised a lot and I thought for sure it would come to a theater here. However, it did not do so initially and I was bummed out. A cool thing happened though as I saw it was coming to the theater and I rushed to see it! Good thing as it was only in the theater here a week. It was a nice comedy with some other elements to it and I enjoyed it and was glad to finally have the opportunity to see Nice and Simon on the big screen, though they were not quite the focal points as they were in the previous films.The story has a man recounting the night he had as a young lad where he and his friends tried to do a pub walk. They were unsuccessful, but that was the highlight of his life. So years have passed and he gets all his reluctant friends together to try once again to make this mythical journey. However, something is not quite right in town, though the group is a bit oblivious to this at first. After an encounter with a young man in a restroom though it becomes clear something has taken over the town. Their idea to get out is to proceed as if everything is normal and simply leave in the morning, but things get a bit to insane and they find themselves being hunted! This film does not have quite the laughs as did ""Shaun of the Dead"", but it was still funny. It contained a bit of heart and there were some interesting little twists here and there. Simon Pegg plays more of the slacker in this film as Nick Frost is more of the buttoned down professional type and the rest of the cast do a fine job too as this one is not simply Simon and Nick's film. The effects were rather good in this one too as when those people opened their mouths up, it looked rather creepy. It was also interesting that they got Peirce Bronson to be in this one as a former teacher as they had gotten Timothy Dalton to be in the last film. Too bad this film seems to be the last for these group of people, otherwise in the next film they could have nabbed Daniel Craig! So I enjoyed this film quite a lot and I am glad I had the opportunity to view it in the theater. It was also a nice change of pace that I went to a comedy and I was not totally disappointed with it. Usually, if I go to a comedy I end not liking the film much at all. It is one of the reasons I have a hard time going to comedies these days. The closest I usually get to seeing a comedy is a film like Iron Man 3 which is not a comedy in the true sense, but contains more than its share of laughs. This one though was enjoyable and not a disappointment...it could have been a bit funnier, but all in all I have no other complaints.",The World's End
28,zetes,"Fun, but it leaves something to be desired",7,25 August 2013,"The third part of the so-called Cornetto Trilogy by Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Here, Pegg and Frost, along with Eddie Marsan, Martin Freeman and Paddy Considine star as a group of old high school buddies who meet up at around 40 to redo the infamous pub crawl of their home town. The film starts off being about Pegg, a total failure as a human being, trying to recapture his youth. A good half hour in, though, it becomes a sci-fi action/adventure, as the group discovers that their hometown has been overtaken by body snatching robots. Alone with Rosamund Pike (playing Freeman's sister), they continue the pub crawl so as not to arouse suspicion -and so miserable Pegg can finally be a success at something. The film's greatest strength is that it never loses sight of its major theme, even while becoming crazy and silly. It helps a lot that Wright is an absolutely fantastic action director, as he discovered in his previous film, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (which is in the running to be my favorite film so far this decade). He's improved as a director tenfold since Hot Fuzz. The film just looks awesome. Now, unfortunately, where it fails is the comedy. That's not to say it isn't funny - it is. I must say, though, that the first half hour, the set-up, is pretty dull. There are a few big laughs, for sure, but, compared to Shawn of the Dead (which is the only one of the Cornetto trilogy - and, Hell, let's include their TV series Spaced, as well - that I have any real love for), it feels like a disappointment. A relative disappointment, of course. I still had plenty of fun with this one.",The World's End
29,siderite,And paint it red they did,7,16 October 2013,"Funny how two different movies about the end of the world seen from the perspective of really wasted people (and by that I mean drunk, high, intoxicated) found their way to the screens at the same time. One American: ""This is the End"" and one British: ""The World's End"". Both films seem to be about people partying, they get into the feelings of the people involved, then they invoke a ridiculously over the top sci-fi or supernatural ending to spice things up. And both are equally good or bad, in my view.The World's End was all about Simon Pegg trying to resurrect his youth, the magical time when he was free and full of potential. He asks, begs and tricks his old friends to join him in his quest, only to realize that everything has changed in two decades.While this film was more about the feelings of getting old and useless, increasingly shackled to a life that is very different from what one envisioned as a kid, pressured to change by the ""adults"" around, the movie wasn't really very deep. The fun part of the film was not that funny either. Good comedies are hard to come by, but Simon Pegg movies have a good track record. Unfortunately, I failed to feel the fun in this film. For me, it started as something and changed track right when it became meaningful. The sci-fi ending was innovative, but ultimately pointless.Bottom line: not a bad movie, but not a good one either. Pegg had to fill some big expectations based on his previous achievements, but it seemed to me that for this film he just felt like doing a regular middle age story. The pressure was too much, though, and he had to do something flashy. The flash did not go well, while the story remained mediocre.",The World's End

31,StevePulaski,A comedy that - astonishingly - never runs out of energy,8,23 August 2013,"The World's End is certainly not the funniest comedy I've seen all year, but it's definitely one of the most inspired. Here is a film that functions on its own merits, creates its own little world, and concocts the most asinine setups that the only plausible thing to do is sit back and enjoy the ride. It concludes Simon Pegg's, Nick Frost's, and director Edgar Wright's long-running ""Cornetto"" trilogy, which began with Shaun of the Dead back in 2004 and Hot Fuzz in 2007. I can see some walking out of the concluding, yet unrelated chapter of the trilogy confused and utterly baffled, and I see some emerging with the mindset they've seen the funniest comedy they've seen all year.To the people who belong to the latter category, they definitely have good justification. The film follows Gary King (Simon Pegg), a self-indulgent manchild, whose ultimate goal in life when he was young and, now, when he is older is to keep the party going and have a damn good time. He hung out with five close friends when they were in their twenties in their hometown of Newton Haven and planned to bar-hop twelve different Irish pubs in what's known as ""The Golden Mile,"" downing at least a pint of beer from each establishment, with the last pub being called ""The World's End."" Long story short, their plan fell through early-on, and the only one who seems to still care years later is Gary, who wants to reunite the crew.He tracks down and demands that his pals - Peter (Eddie Marsan), Oliver, nicknamed ""O-Man"" (Martin Freeman), Steven (Paddy Considine), and Andy (Nick Frost) - all go back to their hometown of Newton Haven to complete their Golden Mile and receive a sense of closure they failed to get when they were young. All his pals, however, have grown up and moved on from a life that was nothing but shallow skirt-chasing and mindless drinking. Gary, however, has failed to grow up, and still operates with the inconsequential mindset he always has. So, the five men go from bar-to-bar, only to realize soon-on that some extraterrestrial lifeform is now inhabiting the planet and they may be the only one who can stop them.The way this film goes from seemingly nonchalant to completely unconventional and out of the ordinary reminds me of last year's sleeper hit The Cabin in the Woods, which operated with the same idea of attempting to put a twist on an entire genre. The first half-hour plays in a very lax manner, getting by largely on quick-witted, rapid-fire dialog with the wry British wit its crew is known for delivering. The remaining seventy minutes are completely lawless and are predicated off of the film's desire to throw off all looming judgements and pre-conceived notions about the film. To put it simply, it defies all expectations, regardless of whether you knew what you were in for or weren't.The reigning chaos and the completely anarchic second and third act get to be a bit of a muchness. What works brilliantly well is when writers Pegg and Wright decide to continue their streak of fueling the script with banter and hilarious dialog between characters. When you have a supporting cast made up of Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan, and Martin Freeman, you've already got enough in the talent department, and this film does its part to assure the dialog lives up to the talent.I feel in order to truly understand and, above all, enjoy The World's End, you need to be familiar with the humor styles of Pegg, Frost, and Wright (which is basically to have a good time and constantly be aware that the audience should have just as much fun) and to know ahead of time what they want to do with the story and the plot. It's no secret the apocalyptic film has been done to death, and the crew behind this film realize this, just like they did recognizing the zombie plot was getting redundant when they made Shaun of the Dead and how tired the formula for buddy cop comedies was when Hot Fuzz was released. Their plan is to try and breed a new standard and a new life into the material, and whether or not they succeed is up for debate. What they do succeed at is creating a comedy that, throughout its many tones, plot-points, and events, never runs out of energy. This alone is a strong credit to a comedy, especially one doomed with an August-release in America.Starring: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsen, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, Rosamund Pike, and Pierce Brosnan.

32,MovieAddict2016,"Brilliant first half, middling second -- an overall fairly disappointing end to the so-called ""Cornetto Trilogy.""",5,8 September 2013,"""The World's End"" is receiving rave reviews from fans of the Simon Pegg/Nick Frost/Edgar Wright trilogy, but I have to wonder how much of that is based on fondness for the other two and what the overall arc of the series represents.You see, I loved the first half of The World's End almost as much as the other two, Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. But halfway through it begins to fall apart; the over-the-top comic violence (involving Stepford Wives-style robots infiltrating a small town) gets tiresome, and the big preachy moral message at the end is nailed in with a huge hammer, something the other two films (both of which also had moral messages about friendship, among other things) managed to avoid.I feel like this is, for lack of a better description, the 'geekiest' of the trilogy and the one most likely to be salivated over by the die-hard fans of programs like Doctor Who...which isn't to say Doctor Who is a bad thing by any means, but it breeds a certain sort of fanatical blind love at times, devotees of sci-fi who are so engaged in their own little world that it can be difficult for them to accept anything other than what they are accustomed to. And I feel like The World's End falls victim to indulgence and excess at the end, as well as a lack of subtlety, that perhaps some of those die-hard sci-fi fans are willing to ignore in favor or the film. I also say that it is the geekiest of the trilogy for the simple fact that, well, Shaun tackled horror and Hot Fuzz tackled action/cop-buddy genres; sci-fi inherently courts a more fanatical breed of viewer. (Just look how many people are hating on the new Star Trek movie because - gasp! - it dared to attempt to connect with mainstream viewers.) Anyway, I don't want to turn this into a rant. So let me get back on track:Honestly? I think I would have preferred the story if it placed less emphasis on the big action sequences, CGI robot battles and focused more on the pub tour shenanigans. When the story is at its most human, it is most involving; when Pegg, Frost, and others (including Martin Freeman, whom I adore as an actor) are playing characters reconvening for the first time in many years, and Pegg is for the first time possibly playing a true jerk of a character, the story zips along and is very engrossing.They should have spread that part of the film out before moving on to the comic mayhem. I think instead of the entire second half being dominated by robotic mishaps, the first 3/4 should have been more focused on the characters, and the last quarter would have been a FAR more emotional - and convincing - payoff.I won't ruin anything for those who haven't seen the picture, but the existential (borderline-monologue) discussions Pegg and Frost each have at the end of the film with another entity was where I really felt my interest waning.Ultimately this is a fair, but frustrating conclusion to the Cornetto Trilogy. I loved the first half but wish they hadn't let the higher budget they'd been afforded this go-round affect the quality of the second half and thrown their engaging character-arc narrative out the window, no matter whether it was intentionally done so to parody sci-fi invasion flicks or not. It just didn't work as well as the other two movies.",The World's End
33,lasttimeisaw,Edgar Wright is nothing but a one-trick-pony,5,11 March 2017,"THE WORLD'S END, British infant terrible Edgar Wright's fifth feature, caps the ""The Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy"" after SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) and HOT FUZZ (2007), all star the dynamo-duo Pegg and Frost. Continuing the trilogy's genre-bucking tradition (buddy comedy + violence), this time, the Pegg- Frost pair must buckle down to battle an alien-invading conspiracy theory in the present day, in company with three other school friends (Considine, Marson and Freeman), on the premise that Pegg's alcoholic Gary King convenes them to complete the ""Golden Mile"", a pub crawl encompassing 12 pubs in Newton Haven, their hometown, a feat they failed to consummate when they were teenagers in the year of 1990. Gary's nostalgic monomaniac of insisting in reaching the drinking finish line, the last pub is timely named as the film's portentous title, is played up as a recurring resultant theme of a disappointing adulthood he has experienced, since after that epic night in 1990, Gary's supposedly auspicious future never takes off and two decades later, all he hankers after is to relive that glorious moment, only this time, not all the cohorts are in the same page with him, in particular, Andy Knightley (Frost), who holds a grudge towards Gary's arrested development and nerve-racking garrulity. Still, he is somehow persuaded to get on aboard in their reunion trip (by an asinine white lie from Gary), the Five Musketeers are back in town and what a small world! Gary's old flame Sam (Pike, in her dismaying before-GONE-GIRL-spell of thankless offers), the sister of Oliver Chamberlain (Freeman, evinces a whiff of bluetooth-hooked savvy) is also visiting, although it is Steven Prince (Considine) who has been secretly carrying a torch for her all these years. Only in the midway of their four-pints-and-one-water pub-crashing (Andy is teetotal now), a blunt incident changes the gear from blokey tipsiness to alien combat, before soon they would realize the entire town is populated by extraterrestrial doubles in the form of their human hosts, a bit hokey, right? (amongst them inhabits tiny few original human beings) But the hair-raising discovery is almost instantly and jejunely diluted by the fact that the aliens are quite gawky in action and fragile in substance (basically a blue liquid filled broken-easily body), thus, purveying Gary and co. a splashy and rough-housing chance to heroically fight their way to the World's End pub in spite of being cosmically outnumbered.Wright's quirky make-up preordains that goofiness and recklessness are in the forefront, and any attempt of cerebral parsing its context would be scuttled by the heady but over-familial chase-and- rumble, squabble-and-quaffing wackiness, veritably, the ultimate weapon to demoralize the pedagogic and incorporeal alien mastermind (voiced by Nighy) is the devil-may-care cheekiness embodied by Gary, an anticlimax built on boosted egoism and utter puerility, not to mention Pegg's over-zealous performance only cause irritation to escalate, there is no charisma whatsoever in such a self-centred character. Once getting through the whole trilogy, one may get the impression that Wright is nothing but a one-trick-pony, ingratiating into the mainstream spotlight with his seemingly path-breaking pastiche of comedy and other more grisly genres, with three features repeat its rudimentary sameyness of a simpleton's fantasy and eschew a more grand scenario in favor of downmarket goofiness, thrills and spills wear thin inevitably and fatigue transpires, which makes Wright's next project BABY DRIVER, scheduled in this August, a salient testing ground for him to prove his worth, sink or swim? At this point, the former looks more likely for this reviewer's money.",The World's End

If you don't like British humor, there is a chance you might at least appreciate this movie. Now this is the 3rd film when it comes to casting the Simon Pegg and Nick Frost duo. And this one is my 3rd favorite so far. The first being ""Shaun of the Dead"" of course and second being ""Hot Fuzz"". But I enjoyed this one as well. The story starts off a bit slow but as soon as the invasion starts, it just doesn't let up. The constant bar fight sequences is also really cool and very well choreographed. Not to get this movie confused with ""This Is the End"" this one by far is the better comedy of 2013. The plot is about a guy that is going through a mid-life crisis and reminisce about his younger days with his friend. And the failed mission to go from bar to bar in town, hitting up 12 in total to accomplish their quest as friend. So now he is trying to do it again, with his best friends. But weird and crazy stuff starts to happen in the small town called Newton Haven where they grew up together. The ending however just seemed way too darn ridiculous and absurd. And just couldn't go with it, I tried to but just couldn't. Even if it gives slight messages and themes along the way, I just couldn't buy it. Overall this movie is a fun time, but isn't anything all that great or one of the top movies of the summer.

35,Hellmant,'THE WORLD'S END' is a movie that actually celebrates drinking obsessively and taking pride in it!,10,28 August 2013,"'THE WORLD'S END': Five Stars (Out of Five)The third film in writer/director Edgar Wright's 'Three Flavours Cornetto' trilogy (following 2004's zombie comedy 'SHAUN OF THE DEAD' and 2007's buddy cop film spoof, and homage, 'HOT FUZZ'). Wright co-wrote the film (once again) with actor Simon Pegg, who also stars in the movie with Nick Frost (once again). Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan and Rosamund Pike co-star in the film which is about five friends attempting to complete a pub crawl (they weren't able to 20 years earlier) when they discover their old town is overrun by aliens. The film is another great triumph for Wright and Pegg and a fitting conclusion to their 'trilogy'.Pegg plays Gary King in the film, an alcoholic who can't get over the glory days of his past. While telling stories of his youth, in rehab, he tells of a time (20 years earlier) when he and his four best friends attempted to complete an infamous pub crawl called the Golden Mile. In Gary's mind this was the greatest time of his life. So he decides to get the gang back together and try another crack at it. His friends reluctantly agree despite sour memories they all have for Gary; especially Andy (Frost), who Gary abandoned during a drunk escapade, and Steven (Considine), due to Gary sleeping with the woman he loved, Sam Chamberlain (Pike), 20 years earlier. Sam is also the sister of their friend Oliver (Freeman). Each has their own issues as another friend, Peter (Marsan), runs into a bully from his past on the crawl. Things get really out of control when they realize their hometown, Newton Haven, is now controlled by aliens and many residents have been replaced by robots. 'THE WORLD'S END' is a movie that actually celebrates drinking obsessively and taking pride in it! I liked it better before it suddenly transitioned into a sci-fi flick. I was so involved in the characters and what was going on with them that I almost forgot that it was an alien invasion movie as well. It wouldn't be an Edgar Wright flick if it didn't have a sci-fi, action or horror element though. The thing he's always best at is character development and human drama (and comedy) though. I cried multiple times in 'SHAUN OF THE DEAD' (which is my favorite film of his). I don't think this new film is quite as good as his other three but it's still a great movie. It's not quite as moving but it is hilarious and still has plenty of human drama as well. The robots/alien invasion storyline is also the weakest genre twist of any of his movies but it works. It also has stunts coordinated by Brad Allen, who's mostly just worked with Jackie Chan (prior to this film), and the bar room fight scenes were heavily influence by Chan's films, like 'THE DRUNKEN MASTER', they're spectacular. The characters (like with all of Wright's films) are really what the movie is all about and that's why it's a great film. Pegg is fantastic in the lead and he always has a great way of playing a completely different character from one Edgar Wright film to the next. In this film he's an arrogant and crude ass but he's still lovable (at least a little) and relatable.

36,thesar-2,Drink Like its 1999,5,28 December 2013,"Now, I liked From Dusk Till Dawn a lot and that was a two-movie feature. First part: sooo Tarantino while the second movie was very vampires, or Rodriguez.This ""third chapter"" in the Nick Frost/Simon Pegg trilogy is, essentially two movies in one and, though The World's End is enjoyable, it certainly is the weakest of the three. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, or the deadpan humor from Pegg or Frost, but it almost feels like overkillsince they're labeling this as the third, albeit, unofficial film in the ""series.""Basically, Gary wants to relive his youth and finish what he left unfinished with a pub crawl many years previous with his old chums. Reluctantly, they agree and off they go. Unfortunately, things have changed in both their normal lives and this small town they grew up in. Bad things. Think: Stepford Wives. Sorta.Admittedly, it's been several months since I've viewed this and most of it has left my memory. I wouldn't have a problem to revisit it, but since I remember only thinking ""Eh, nothing special"" I'm probably going to wait to have a Pegg/Frost evening to recap this.* * * Final thoughts: Honestly, I love ""End of the World"" film ideas. But, in 2013, and in recent years, there have been too many apocalyptic movies. When this was announced, or the ""coming soon"" trailer released, I was actually turned off due to the titleeven with the two stars I love (Pegg/Frost) attached. Mercifully, there's meaning behind the title and despite the ""second movie"" here, it manages to deliver without overkill.",The World's End
37,cherold,Doesn't really work,6,26 January 2014,"Billed as the third movie in a trilogy of sorts also encompassing Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, it is hard as the movie begins to see any connection. The main character is a loser who attempts to relive his high school glory days with friends he hasn't seen for years. The movie looks like it will be an uncomfortable yet mild comedy drama and you can pretty much outline in your head what is going to happen.The movie, however, eventually switches gears in a way ever bit as extreme as From Dusk Till Dawn.I hated Dusk Till Dawn's twist, mainly because I was really enjoying the movie as it was before it turned into something else. This wasn't an issue with World's End, since I hadn't found these early scenes particularly compelling. Suddenly the movie fit in with the other two, and I expected it would become as funny as they were.That did not happen. The movie has some nice action, but ultimately it's never that funny. It continues with elements of that original story, but the two parts never work together, the seriousness of the first conflicting with the outrageousness of the second.While it's not a terrible movie, it was a terrible disappointment.",The World's End

Many years later, they have all settled in to adulthood, with the exception of Gary (Simon Pegg), who tracks down his old mates, including Andrew (Nick Frost), Oliver (Martin Freeman), Peter (Eddie Marsen) and Steven (Paddy Considine), hoping to achieve what they failed to do all those years ago. Somehow, he succeeds in twisting their arms, and they reunite to give it another go as men. However, on arrival there, they find the town in the grip of something other worldly that must be stopped.This somewhat belated third installment in what I've learned Frost and Pegg have called their 'Three Colours Cornetto' trilogy (their last one was six years ago!) looks set to be the last of their collaborations with director Edgar Wright, which began nearly ten years ago with the over rated Shaun of the Dead and was followed with the slightly more enjoyable Hot Fuzz, after which the pair went Stateside for alien adventure Paul, which had nothing to do with Wright. While I'm no die hard fan of Frost and Pegg, their latest offering looked like it bore the possibility of being good fun, and to a large extent it is, but by the end it's become a long, joyless slog that gets too carried away with itself when the audience are just begging for mercy.It would have worked a lot better if the writers had just stuck with the main plot line, of old mates uniting to re-capture lost innocence and the sad refusal of the odd one to grow up and act their age. Things take a sour turn when the not awfully interesting alien story takes over, not least of which is because the townsfolk have been turned into naff, proshetic looking things whose heads just roll off and spray blue goo on the floor. From all their outings, it's clear Frost and Pegg have quite a keen interest in the sci-fi/horror genres and aren't as averse to this as they are to dealing with human drama and comedy, and in this case it hinders the film rather than helps it, because it probably would have got much better results if that hadn't even been included.The film makes itself a little more slick and glam with some glossy celebrity cameos from the likes of Pierce Brosnan, Bill Nighy and David Bradley, but scratch beneath the surface and this just highlights the desperation. In the end, the main high point is a great soundtrack from the period Gary's trying to re-live, the anthems that really gave the period it's edge, but this hardly raises the quality of the actual film and by the end you won't be caring so much if the world ends, just as long as the film does! **",The World's End

It might just be the funniest of the three, which are all easily some of the funniest films I've ever seen. Its otherworldly premise sneaks up on you, if you haven't seen the marketing, as does its incredibly deep and surprisingly sad core character arc. The writing here is incredible, not just from a comedy stand-point but from a dramatic - and kind of tragic - one, too. The feature also has some fantastic action sequences that rival the best of recent years.

43,dromasca,the craziest end of the world,8,21 July 2020,"According to the title, 'The World's End' should belong to the apocalyptic genre. The movie directed in 2013 by Edgar Wright fulfills this promise but only towards the end. It begins as a film about nostalgia and the comparison between the hopes of youth and reality. It continues as a social and character comedy to turn into a horror prank with alien invaders (or maybe robots). The last pub on the route of 12 the such institutions traveled by a group of five friends gathered to celebrate 20 years since graduating from high school is called 'The World's End' and the name is not accidental. What struck me as remarkable about the British director's film is that he manages to be credible in each of the four cinematic genres approached in succession, that the connection between them seems quite natural, and the British humor sparkling dialogues manage to maintain permanently the comic feel. This seemingly impossible mix of cinematic genres works beyond expectations.The screenplay is written by director Edgar Wright and actor Simon Pegg who is Gary King, the head of the gang of men who meet after 20 years and decide (or are convinced by Gary) to remake the route of the pubs after their prom. Him being apparently the least 'accomplished' of all, this reunion is perhaps for Gary an exercise in detoxification (alcohol? drugs? we will never know clearly). The alcohol fumes accumulated after the 3rd or 4th pub facilitate the transition from social comedy to a sci-fi film that would have shades of horror if everything was not so comical. The gradual increase in the degree of madness makes the pyrotechnic effects towards the end seem almost natural. The film has an epilogue, and surprisingly enough, that deserves to be waited on patiently.Besides Simon Pegg, I also noticed the excellent performances of Martin Freeman and Eddie Marsan. The only more consistent female presence is that of Rosamund Pike (the sister of one of the men and the romantic interest of all the others) in a role rather thin for her talent. Pierce Brosnan also appears, also under-distributed. But maybe the two simply wanted to have their names listed on the credits of this unusual apocalyptic comedy, which manages to offer to the audience an entertainment that does not avoid stereotypes of the genre but combines them with original ideas and sparkling British-style dialogues. 'The World's End manages to entertain without giving the impression that you wasted your time watching.",The World's End
44,ThomasDrufke,Nowhere near the quality of 'This is the End',4,22 April 2014,"Being it the first time I have seen the Pegg-Frost-Wright trio in film, I guess I didn't know what to expect. What I got in return is just a bland drinking movie which didn't have any standout moments. Perhaps the cast just isn't as good as This is the End being its fault, I don't know. But in my opinion the film was nothing special and a waste of 2 hours.I think Simon Pegg was funny, but I kind of expected more from Nick Frost. I think maybe this just isn't the right comedy for me. To me if your going to completely go nuts with concepts than you have to be outright funny or else it comes off as stupid. A lot of movies nail the ridiculous comedy, Anchorman does it perfectly, as it doesn't take itself too seriously. I felt like even though the trailers to this movie made it seem like it wasn't anything serious, there were far too many moments where the movie tried to make us feel for the characters and it didn't work. Rosamund Pike was a bright spot though. I think her character didn't try to make us laugh in the awkward way that other characters did. I almost would have rather had this movie just be about them trying to finish the golden mile rather than a robot-alien invasion. Have those 5 guys just banter for the full 2 hours instead of the over-the-top action sequences with blue blood.I'm still very much willing to watch the first two movies of the so-called ice cream trilogy but this one hinders my excitement. Glad that Simon Pegg didn't turn out to be Ant-Man as now that I have seen him on screen I think Paul Rudd is a much better fit among the other top notch Avengers actors.

The World's End is incredibly goofy, but in a really good way. It ends up being better than Hot Fuzz and on par with Shaun of the Dead. I love the sci-fi premise, even if goes dangerously close to treading the same ground as Shaun. But the screenplay is excellent and it enables us to feel for the characters, despite some of them having unlikable personalities. One thing for sure, Edgar Wright is a cinematic genius and not enough people give him credit.Edgar Wright's film is about a middle-aged alcoholic named Gary King who is successfully able to convince his old school friends to complete a bar crawl in their old hometown, the very same bar crawl they did nit finish many years before. The catch this time around? It happens that aliens have taken over the inhabitants of the town. While completing the bar crawl, everyone must stay one step ahead of the invading alien force.It was really clever to switch the roles of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost this time around. Pegg plays the bumbling dumb guy this time around and Frost plays the straight man. Seeing them in these roles were just hilarious. Unlikable, but really hilarious. We get great supporting turns from Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan, Rosamund Pike, and of course Bond man himself, Pierce Brosnan.Overall, The World's End is the perfect finale to a really ingenious trilogy. The laughs were always there, but as with all of Wright's films, we get ample amounts of characterization. The ending of the film was a little confusing, as it somehow seems to poke fun at Robin Hood. But I really loved the film and couldn't have asked for a better finale.

I wouldn't necessarily call this movie a laugh riot, but it definitely passes the time in an amusing way for approximately 109 minutes or so. It has a decent blend of laughs & drama that appealed to me. Simon Pegg's portrayal of Gary King isn't exactly likable. He's an immature buffoon, one that only cares about himself. I did find it difficult at times to relate to him, but he pulls it off with such vigor & hilarity, I couldn't help but like him. He's a man I'd love to party with. Those that want action will be very pleased with this film. It has many exhilarating action sequences with Gary & friends battling the robots. It also has sly nods to classic Sci-Fi films, has some great twists and turns, and many things to enjoy for huge film buffs. As great as Simon Pegg is, I felt it was Nick Frost who stole the show. It was a lot of fun to watch him evolve from a frightened turtle to a take charge kind of guy. His chemistry with Pegg was fantastic as always. The rest of the cast is great. Pierce Brosnan's glorified cameo was a hoot. It does get a little bit too conservative in the finale. I didn't buy how the robots were defeated but I did enjoy how they ended things.

Shaun of the Dead was an experimental attempt, and then the same team, motivated by its success, continued in the same style and achieved better results, crowned with The World's End. Perhaps this SF horror action comedy is not so much better than its predecessors as I liked it more for the characters I can identify with, because under the mask of fantasy, horror and crazy action hides a very realistic human drama. This movie criticizes globalization and a modern society in which it is desirable that each individual be just a well-oiled gear in the mechanism, alienation and loneliness of unadjusted, as well as self-deception of those who live seemingly perfect lives.

Now, drink up, and let's boo-boo!",7,26 January 2016,"Starting with 2004's Shaun of the Dead and following, 2007's Hot Fuzz, 2013's the World Ends, is indeed a excellent wrap up to the series of films that writers, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost & Edgar Wright has created. While, it does have some mistakes. I found the movie to be, very entertaining and worth watching. To err is indeed human. Directed by Edgar Wright, the movie follows the story of five childhood friends: Gary King (Simon Pegg), Peter (Eddie Marsan), Oliver (Martin Freeman), Steven (Paddy Considine), and Andy (Nick Frost) reuniting for one last, pub crawl in their old hometown. As the middle age- group struggle to come to terms with their problems, their friendships, and their pasts. They started to notice, that the town people around them, are not acting right. Has their town, forgotten about them or is there, something more sinister afoot? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I love the strong character development piece that this movie was going for. However, I do have to say, the whole 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" theme, this movie was going for in the 3rd act was introduce, somewhat abruptly. It really comes out of nowhere, nor was their presence explain that well. I get that that the 'blank group' is intelligence/society, has been guiding human culture and technological development since the late '80s/early '90s for more peaceful means, however it doesn't explain, the computer technological and social revolutions, we got, since the Space Age of the 1960s, and early. Also, how big was their network, because the movie made it, seem like it was small, as most of the action, takes place in one small town. I get that, maybe they control the internet, since it wasn't publicly used until the 1990s, but the film never establish that well. Plus, wasn't the internet around, since the early 1980s, too? Also, didn't the internet bring more divinity than unionization? So, what was their goal again? While, I did like the whole, everybody is turning into 'blanks' gimmick. I felt, like the 'pub crawl' plot was good enough as itself. I really didn't need, the movie to turn into a parody of Science Fiction movies. Still, the hilarious Sci-Fi aspect in this film does match well, with the tone of the other films, which themselves, make fun of action films & horror films. I also like, how all three films have a connected with each other. Not only does all three use the Cornetto ice creams colors wrapping as a hangover cure for Frost's characters, and reused certain gags like the fence joke, but the films, somewhat deals with the same themes containing that the individuals in these collective series of films are all dealing with the idea of growing up and being able to address the dangers of being perpetual adolescence. In other words, trying not to have a Peter Pan complex. Gary King is a strong contender of a character trying to fight against this, and I love, every minute of it, of him, trying new ways to prevent that. I love how Gary's surname, King, symbolizing his egocentrism, as well as his ultimate role in deciding the fate of the human race, should be. I know, a lot of people found him, unlikeable, but while, the climatic twist was a bit predictable. I do have to give the movie, some credit for creating a redemption arch for him. Another thing, I like about the film dealing with him, is how there is a bit of social commentary about gentrification, or in this case, ""starbucking""; as the friends return to their home town to see many of the pubs are gutted and transformed into a bland chain of pubs. While, polite manners, civic mindedness and community through corporate culture might sound good on paper, how much is it worth in the expense of individuality freedoms, like the freedom to make our own mistake. This is the perfect antithesis to Pegg's character. Yes, he's a screw up, but his faults is what makes him, special. Indeed, to err is human. Another reason, why I couldn't hate the character, too much, is because, I have never saw, Simon Pegg played a character, this self-centered, before, so it was something fascination and new. I also, love how Nick Frost is playing the opposite of his normal uncouth slob roles, as the repressed tight-ass, Andy Knightley. It also gave something new to watch. Andy's surname, Knightley match him, well due to his fighting skills and being Gary's best friend. The action scenes with him, are done, somewhat well, for a man of his weight and statue. Very humorous well-choreographed violence, from him. The supporting cast is a mixed bag for me. I have to say character actors like Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike were alright; however, it's Eddie Marsan's performance that really shines. The scene where he talks about, how his childhood bully didn't recognize him was very heart-breaking. You really can't help, feeling bad for the guy. I have to say, besides Simon Pegg's performance as Gary King, Eddie's performance was secondary. I definitely think, these characters will be warmer received the older, you get, as you might better identify with the characters. After all, all of us, will have to learn to deal with getting old. I know a lot of people has says, the tone of this film is too dark, or depressing due to its mature themes, but I thought of it, as a more serious and thoughtful entry. I love the dark humor, this film was going for. I also love most of the writing, full of foreshadowing, cultural references, witty and clever dialogue, and symbolism. The film is also well-shot. Every scene had a point to its madness. Overall: The World's End is worth taking ""Golden Mile"" for. A must-watch.",The World's End
54,nairtejas,"A Perfect End, But Definitely Not The World's. ♦ 69%",7,8 November 2013,"Okay, so this marked a perfect end to the Cornetto trilogy and I am quite amused by the whole idea, trust me. But, let us not compare it with the first two movies. They were, hands down, amazing. While there is enough action & a purported science-fiction element involved, it lacks comedy and drowns in its own lager.The cast is amazing but is it only me who thinks Simon Pegg looks very old? Well, the performance is good, too. I liked the first part but it tends to drag in the second half when something draws up which I hadn't seen coming. The plot gets a tad confused as to what it tries to convey. Although it had ambiguity in it, it speaks for the 2013 generation for sure. The humor is average and special mention to the pun jokes & wits at English language. I hated the character Gary King's heroism and it looked like chauvinism. Edgar Wright is a brilliant director and together with the collaborators, he has hatched up a ""cool"" trilogy.With all the high-pumping music, stunt scenes and fantastic CGI, The World's End is a perfect end, but individually a wicked attempt.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for fans. Other should the first 2 movies first.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

55,The-Sarkologist,"For those who have ever tried an epic pub crawl, and not quite finished it",8,17 January 2014,"I guess this is one of those films that will appeal to those of us how have ever had one of those nights where you have gone on a pub crawl and attempted to complete a set number of pubs before crashing out because one had simply become too wasted to continue. I know I have done that, in following my friend's footsteps who had one day decided, when he was walking back to his hotel in London, to stop off at every pub on the way and to have a pint. I must say that I didn't get to do that when I was in London (and I am not sure from where to which hotel it would have been) but I did attempt to do it in Adelaide, attempting to walk from the Royal Botanic at the corner of East Terrace and North Terrace and to walk to West Terrace drinking one schooner (I was not game to try the pints because I wanted to try at least every pub) but only made it as far as Light Square before throwing in the towel and going home.This is one of those movies, except that there is a slight twist – the protagonists suddenly find that they have stumbled upon an alien invasion, so they first try to find the best way of getting out of there (which ends up completing the pub crawl, or as they call it, 'The Golden Mile – 12 pubs, 12 pints') and then end up stumbling upon their headquarters, so decide that they will confront them.What is funny about this film is that the aliens are not exactly antagonistic, rather they are actually trying to influence Earth so as to bring them into the galactic community but the only problem is that what ends up standing in their way are a bunch of drunken fools that have had way too much to drink, who then end up convincing them that it is humanity's right to act like tools and convincing them to leave, which results in not so much as the aliens leaving the Earth, but with them leaving the Earth and taking all of their technology with them (thus sending Earth back into another dark age). This is what I found quite clever with this film, in that it doesn't actually finish as one would expect a film to finish, and that is the bad guy defeated, the heroes victorious, and everything has returned to normal. In fact, the opposite is true, though one sort of wonders if it ended up actually being better for humanity to actually take away all of their technology and returning them to the stone age.The other thing about the movie is that idea of living for the past and the idea that it never actually got any better than that night that they attempted, and failed, to complete the golden mile. The movie opens with the protagonist (if you really want to call him that) telling the story of how they attempted to complete, and did not quite succeed, in doing the Golden Mile, and it then turns out that he is in counseling, and the most unhelpful suggestion is that maybe attempting to complete it will help get his life back on track.So, the movie seems to flip between a personality drama between five old friends who are attempting to complete the Golden Mile, and open up and come to terms with their past and where they have got to in life, and the fact that they are running through a town that has pretty much been taken over by aliens, and are attempting to keep themselves alive despite the fact that the aliens apparently want to help out humanity, but have been finding that out of all of the humans out there, there are only a handful that are willing to go along with them.",The World's End

All the returning actors do a sterling job, Rosamund Pike is solid support and following on from Timothy Dalton in ""Hot Fuzz"" former James Bond star Pierce Broanan turns up and is great fun too.This is the funniest of the Cornetto trilogy for me, with several laugh out loud moments coming along thick and fast.",The World's End
57,Reno-Rangan,The return of the promising combo,8,16 November 2013,"One of the most expected British movie of the year. After donning in movies like 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' the most promising actor combo given yet another astonishing performance under the same director. The other too were acted very well. The movie begins with slow especially the opening 30 minutes were like some regular comedy drama but, later, like a wild fire it catches up the speed and ends high. Most of the people will like the second half of the movie a lot.We can call it a counterpart to multi starer Seth Rogen's maiden directional debut movie 'This is the End'. Coincidentally both movies released in the same period of time and deals with the same theme. All the above both were excellent movies which I loved a lot. Just like the characters from the 'Hangover' movies it has been about the bunch of old friends who hangouts and face the beginning of the apocalypse. I promise you won't get often fun like these two movies where all the comedians comes together to entertain us. So I recommended it to you guys.8/10",The World's End
58,paulclaassen,"Enjoyable enough, but I doubt I'll be watching it again.",5,28 May 2020,"'The World's End' is one of those movies I was never really interested in seeing due to the trailer making it look like a slapstick comedy. Having been pleasantly surprised by a few comedy horrors lately, I decided to give this one the benefit of the doubt treatment.Well, slapstick comedy it certainly is. Simon Pegg is perfectly cast as loudmouth, eccentric Gary King. It is, however, Nick Frost that steals the show (for me) as Andy. His character also undergoes the greatest character development and he becomes more of a hero than Gary. I found Pierce Brosnan dispensable as Guy Shepherd. Then there's Martin Freeman, who is also good, no matter what he does.Things start going haywire when you least expect it. But I must add the film certainly takes its time before things eventually does go wrong. Ultimately, it is just way too much (silly) comedy and drinking. Ah, and then there's the passive mannequin aliens. I think I would have enjoyed it more if they were zombies. Then again, if they were, I suppose this would have been 'Shaun of the Dead 2'.Look, 'The World's End' certainly is a unique film. It's just a difficult film to recommend. It is too fantastical as a comedy, and too comical for a sci-fi film to be taken seriously. And the film literally goes from a talkie comedy to sci-fi within a split second! The visuals are good, and the film has a fantastic ending.",The World's End
59,tomgillespie2002,Disappointing closure to the trilogy,5,2 December 2013,"Finally wrapping up the collection of films now known as the 'Three Flavours Conetto' trilogy, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright have delved into sci-fi geekdom for inspiration for their final entry, The World's End. Where Shaun of the Dead (2004) was a swan-song to George A. Romero and his gift of zombies to the horror genre and Hot Fuzz (2007) was a homage to 1980's and 1990's action movies when the law were still cool, The World's End gives us a blue-blooded alien/robot invasion, reminiscent of John Carpenter, set amidst a legendary pub crawl.Gary King (Pegg), a middle-aged alcoholic, decides that he and his childhood friends should meet up one more time to complete the pub crawl they failed to conquer twenty something years ago. The crawl consists of 12 pubs in their hometown of Newton Haven, ending at The World's End pub. Gary quickly gathers up the gang - Oliver ""O-Man""Chamberlain (Martin Freeman), Steven Prince (Paddy Considine), Peter Page (Eddie Marsan), and, somewhat reluctantly, Andy Knightley (Frost) - and they set off on their quest only to discover that the town they grew up in has become overrun by pod people-type robots.The thing that made the previous two films in the trilogy so enjoyable was the chemistry between its two leads, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. In Shaun, they were both bumbling idiots, and in Fuzz, the dynamic was changed to keep things interesting, with Pegg playing the straight man, and Frost his starry-eyed but worryingly dim sidekick. Here, things are changed again with Frost becoming the straight man and Pegg the loutish idiot. Frost's Andy drinks water for the majority of the film and holds resentment for an unspoken event, therefore heightening the drama and adding dimensions to their relationship, but nevertheless steps on the comedy. With the chemistry missing, Pegg's Gary becomes slightly annoying and Andy is just a drag.And here lies The World's End biggest problem - it just isn't that funny. Until the robots show up, there are only a handful of scenes capable of raising a smile, and the movie is actually quite slow. Shaun and Fuzz (this will be the last time I mention these, I promise) were packed full of visual and wordplay gags that benefited from repeat viewings, but The World's End was such a drag the first time around that I doubt will ever feel the need to watch it again. The supporting cast barely register, with only Considine's Steven getting a sub-plot, involving Oliver's sister Sam (Rosamund Pike) and some unspoken love.But when the robots show up, the movie does pick up the pace. Although it's hardly a ground-breaking idea (it's pretty much The Body Snatchers with lager), watching Nick Frost t**t a horde of robots with two bar stools could never be anything but thrilling. Most of the charm of the film comes from it's distinctive Britishness, and the out-there climax offers a surprisingly insightful commentary on what it means to be British - flaws, belligerence and all. These are some relatively minor achievements that manage to save the film from disaster, in what is ultimately a disappointing, unconvincing closing bookmark to what could have been a modern landmark in British comedy.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The World's End
60,Thanos_Alfie,Hilarious...,7,11 January 2019,"""The World's End"" is a Sci-Fi - Comedy in which we watch five best friends returning to their home town in order to achieve a very old goal of them, their epic pub crawl. As they return to their hometown they understand that something has changed but they cannot figure out what. After many strange things and a lot of observations by them, they figure out that they are the only ones who can help humanity and save the Earth.I liked this movie a lot because it was very interesting and funny, with many hilarious scenes and a very interesting plot. I also liked how it combined humorous moments with some dramatic moments and romance with comedy. Regarding the direction which was made by Edgar Wright, I have to say that he did an excellent job, something that is obvious in the whole duration of the movie. About the interpretations, it has to be mentioned the outstanding performance of Simon Pegg's who played as Gary King and he was simply amazing and Nick Frost's who played as Andy Knightley and he was equally good. Some other interpretations that also have to be mentioned were Martin Freeman's who played as Oliver Chamberlain and Paddy Considine's who played as Steven Prince.To sum up, I have to say that ""The World's End"" is a great movie with many humorous moments and a very interesting plot. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and you are going to have a lot of fun. If you have already watched and liked some other movies like ""Hot Fuzz"", ""Shaun of the Dead"" etc then this is the movie you should watch next.",The World's End
61,poe426,Intergalactic intervention...,8,24 June 2014,"THE WORLD'S END gets off to a slow start- so slow, in fact, that I mistook it for a pub-crawl comedy instead of what it turned out to be. The bathroom brawl caught me by surprise. (It reminded me of the over-the-top barroom brawl in FROM DUSK TO DAWN: it comes out of nowhere after a carefully crafted first half that promises more than the second half delivers.) Once any notion of subtlety is abandoned, the movie devolves into routine unfunny action and special effects sequences that only serve to undermine the set-up. It's DR. WHO by way of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, with a bit of Pink Floyd's HIGH HOPES thrown in for good measure. I must admit that I loved the ending: after listening to Pegg's drunken ramblings, the Alien leader gives up on any notion of helping the Human Race with the classic, ""F*** it."" The ending made the whole thing worth it.",The World's End
62,leonblackwood,Watchable! 4/10,4,15 December 2013,"Review: This film was watchable but not that memorable. I didn't find the jokes that funny and once you have seen Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz, there isn't that much difference. Compared to the other movies, you can tell that there budget is a bit bigger, but they went a bit far with the aliens and the complex storyline. It also takes some time to get going, and the ending was over the top. On the plus side, Nick Frost looked pretty impressive as a big guy kicking ass, and the chemistry between the cast was realistic. If you have seen the other 2 movies in this series, you know what to expect. I personally stuck with the movie because the characters were quite interesting and I'm glad that the director gave each individual person a history, but I just didn't find it that amusing. Watchable!Round-Up: Simon Pegg & Nick Frost are a great partnership when it comes to making movies, and it will like to see what they come out with next, now that this franchise is over. The problem with this movie is that they tried to rationalise the robots/blanks, which seemed pretty far fetched and ridiculous in places. It makes me laugh how the robots/blanks, don't really shock any of the gang of boys and they all seem to have become Kung Fu experts overnight. Anyway, if you don't take thus movie that seriously, then you will enjoy most of it, but I personally think that they could have closed the franchise with a better movie.Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $47millionI recommend this movie to people who were fans of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. 4/10",The World's End

64,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A fitting trilogy ender that borrows the best of its predecessors and offers new twists,8,31 January 2014,"The long overdue final installment of Edgar Wright's ""Cornetto Trilogy"" that began with ""Shaun of the Dead"" in 2004 and continued with 2007's ""Hot Fuzz"" has arrived. ""The World's End"" is the most ambitious film in the trilogy featuring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and the most creative.Pegg stars as Gary King, who was the coolest cat in all of Newton Haven back in 1991, when he and his four closest friends, Andy (Frost), Steven (Paddy Considine), Oliver (Martin Freeman) and Peter (Eddie Marsan) attempted The Golden Mile, a legendary crawl of 12 pubs culminating in a pint at The World's End. Unable to complete it as young men, 20 years later King is desperate to relive his glory days, so he rounds up the old gang to give the crawl another shot. They soon realize, however, that something is amiss in their old stomping grounds.""The World's End"" follows the outline of the ""Cornetto Trilogy"" in that a group of survivors find themselves pitted against hordes of zombies, odd townspeople or — in this case — ""blanks."" Violence then abounds in comical yet impeccably stylish fashion. What makes ""World's End"" unique from the previous films is that it doesn't play off a genre as ""Shaun"" and ""Fuzz"" and creates its own rules.Another key difference is the relationship between Pegg and Frost's characters. The two play vastly different roles than in the previous films. Pegg turns sharply away from playing the straight-laced character — he's a manipulative, self-obsessed alcoholic living in the past. Frost, on the other hand, is a lawyer and a recovered alcoholic with no tolerance for immaturity. Even though these roles differ from their norm, the dynamic between the actors is still spot on, and their bromance gives the film a pulse.Pegg and Wright have created a brilliant concept. A comedy about friends recreating an epic pub crawl alone wouldn't be enough to sustain an entire film on its own, but the way everything changes when an alien robot conspiracy unfolds is the kicker. Suddenly the dynamic between the five friends, which they build a solid foundation for, shifts into new territory, yet the reveal of said robot alien conspiracy doesn't completely detach the movie from a sense of meaning. ""World's End"" also sacrifices no style for substance too. Wright's patented quick-cutting closeups add as much suspense to the film as they did in ""Shaun"" and ""Fuzz,"" and the action scenes utilize more brilliant fight choreography that's just over-the-top enough to avoid being taken too seriously. Clearly, these middle-aged nobodies aren't capable of shattering robot heads with their fists, let alone holding their own in any sort of fight, so this is all for pure entertainment purposes.The only challenge of the film is that the story doesn't lend itself well to good script pacing. A crawl consisting of 12 pubs makes sense in the real world, but that's a lot for a one movie. The lore of this pub crawl that the film really builds up turns out to be a slight letdown. Going into the film, you'd expect reaching The World's End to be a glorious moment, but it's just another stop on the railroad of ridiculous sci-fi carnage that the movie turns into in its final act. As the final chapter in a cult trilogy, ""World's End"" delivers a good number of easter eggs for ""Cornetto"" fans, with the more memorable ones being plays on the trilogy's penchant for hedge and fence jumping. The way the film combines the action of a band of friends on the run from masses of mindless creatures and a small-town conspiracy, it's the perfect fusion of ""Shaun"" and ""Fuzz"" into the ultimate conclusion.Its ambition gets the better of it at times, but ""World's End"" is wildly entertaining, a comedy that both honors and borrows from its predecessors yet does plenty to show that Wright, Pegg and Frost didn't just want to follow their proved blueprint for success — they wanted to explore new territory while being faithful to the tone of their prior films. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

66,southdavid,It's here. King Beer.,8,16 March 2021,"The Cornetto trilogy concludes with ""The World's End"", another film of Edgar Wright's that I have a weird mental schism about, always thinking that it's my least favourite of the three when I'm always pleasantly surprised when I watch it.Five school friends, Gary King (Simon Pegg), Andy Knightly (Nick Frost), Oliver Chamberlain (Martin Freeman), Steven Prince (Paddy Considine) and Peter Page (Eddie Marsan) return to their hometown to undertake a pub crawl they failed to finish twenty years earlier. Though initially the reunion is mostly about working through Gary's mental and substance abuse issues, the threat becomes external when they realise that all in Newton Haven is not as they left it.For some reason, between viewings I get it into my head that ""The Worlds End"" is the one of the Cornetto Trilogy that works the least, but watching them this time, I actually think I enjoy it more than ""Hot Fuzz"". Maybe it's that I think Gary King is a better character for Simon Pegg than Nick Angel, maybe it's just that I've seen it a few less times, but I definitely found ""TWE"" funnier this time than I had thought it was. Maybe it has something to do with my age, I'm 40 now, so the idea of seeing what my old friends have made of themselves is equal parts interesting and horrifying. I do like to go back to my old village every few years and take a look around though.The writing uses the themes that Wright and Pegg have established for themselves with the last few films, highly specific foreshadowing, repeated lines and the fence gag all return. It has great music too, a phenomenal collection of 90's Indie. We are in the dynamic prime of Edgar Wrights directing her, fast cuts and edits.Yet again the movie surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. I'll try and keep it in mind going forwards.",The World's End
67,Vartiainen,Just as good as the previous Cornetto films,7,8 May 2014,"There's something magical about the trinity of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and about British comedy in general. Three times now they have managed to produce one of the best action comedies of all time. First with Shaun of the Dead, with its crazy and hilariously bland take on the zombie apocalypse, then with Hot Fuzz, with its bizarre buddy cop clichés and murder hijinks, and now with The World's End, where urban idiocy has to face the end of the world, both literally and figuratively.Simon Pegg once again plays the leading role, with Frost in the main side character/secondary main character role, and they're pretty much as good as they've always been. Yet their characters have always been vastly different from one movie to the next, and this one is no exception. Pegg's Gary King is a great character, both sympathetic and pathetic, according to the needs of the scene. In this movie he is joined not only by Nick Frost, but a whole cavalcade of big name actors, including Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan and Rosamund Pike. All bring their very best into play and their dialogues are pure hilarity.But, as stated, these films are action comedies, and the twist in this film is especially surprising and comes straight out of nowhere, but in the best possible way. I can't really talk about it without spoiling everything, but trust me when I say you won't be bored watching this film.If I had to name one nitpick, I'd say that the humour, while funny, doesn't have that razor sharp edge and speed Hot Fuzz had. It's still one of the funniest films I've ever seen, but Hot Fuzz might just be THE funniest, so it's still a great compliment that this one comes even close.Have you loved the two previous Cornetto movies? Then you're going to love this one. It has it all, the character moments, the humour, the action, the visuals, the heart. I want them to make this into a quadrilogy.",The World's End
68,elshikh4,When Edgar Wright isn't Right !,5,28 May 2016,"If you're a fan of Edgar Wright, like me, you have to frown. In his movies, there are always rapid-fair pace, snappy funny lines, impressive camera-work, and - in the 3 Flavours Cornetto trilogy - numbered good guys vs. evil society. This round, I think he was a little bit as his leads, namely.. drunk!The fun isn't the same. The lines aren't comedic as they were, or should be; based on your confidence in Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's writing. The matter of ""We must go to the world's end bar"" was flimsy. In other, more solid, fantasy tales, the leads should be searching for something. The idea of the drug dealer as the only chivalrous around is disturbing. The bad language was torrential, sickening, and more than the funny lines (or rather easier to write than them!), the nudity - in general - isn't comedic; it's rather disgusting, so what's here to laugh at?, or the question must be: what's here to not feel sick of?! Let alone that Pierce Brosnan is in it for like less than a minute; I'm not whining about him as a favorite actor of mine, he isn't, I'm whining about a supposedly important character that wasn't taken care of!Then, we have a third act that shots the movie in the head. Wright and Pegg could have avoided a lot by modifying that act alone. It is messy, perplexing, and - worst of all - impairs whatever was right before it.Let's see, Gary King (played by Pegg) is lost, and has nothing serious in his life. And in the fight scene, with nearly his opposite Andy Knightley (played by Nick Frost), it's superbly underlined what King's problem is, and how to solve it. Yet right after it, in the climactic debate with the Network, King sees that he, along with the human race, doesn't want to be told what to do! Well, it can't get more incompatible than this. But to my surprise, it can!The movie was about 2 kinds of people: The decent and rational adults (the 4 working leads), and the indecent irrational kid (Gary King). And simply, it's about balance; where the 4 adults need some immaturity, and the kid needs some maturity. But then, a third kind of people is introduced: The very decent, very rational adults (the inhuman robots), and there must be a battle with them, as the products of the modern big corporations; which execute individualism, force molding and spared senselessness. Hmmm, that's another movie already, and it's about freedom this time. See how incompatible this movie is!Even if we assume that it's originally about freedom, and battling the capitalism's fascism ""Starbucking, man. It's happening everywhere""-somehow that substance fractures in the climactic debate. For instance, King is the last man on earth to defend the human race's freedom. Look at what his freedom made of him (in fact, he seemed needing that ""betterment"" the most!). And with the rest of the leads assuring his words, it's a refusal of fascism and - also - the system; as if all of them turned into one Gary King! So, accordingly, the apocalyptic ending comes too harsh and erratic, where the message is so loud: ""We don't want the system, and the Stone Age is better""! Moreover, that didn't conclude the leads' dramatic journey, where everybody would learn something, and change a little. To wind up as an ending for another movie, or something Wright wanted desperately to do, however did it in the wrong place!To add more fuel, the movie doesn't tell us, or maybe doesn't know, when or how Oliver ""O-Man"" (played by Martin Freeman) became a robot. The Network's scene went on forever. Steven Prince (played by Paddy Considine) suddenly disappeared before it, to suddenly appear in it! I couldn't buy that the leads' defense alone was capable of shutting down the Network, and convincing for it to leave earth. And the last scene was nonsense. You have to feel as if someone pressed a button on your remote by mistake, and switched the channel to something else what you were watching! You really wouldn't understand why King was hanging out with robots, or what he was doing exactly, and how he changed for any better??!! Which - along with all of the above - imprints the movie eventually as meaningless, and evinces that Wright and Pegg weren't very sober while writing it!I loved the running car sequence in the end. Editor Paul Machliss was almost perfect there. It's better than the annoyance he did in the final fight of Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), and reminded me of the geniality of his fellow editor Chris Dickens in Wright's Hot Fuzz (2007). Although it got forced later on, but the 12 pubs crawl's plot was fair. Despite that the soundtrack wasn't that creative or rich, it did fine. The cast preformed wonderfully, however could have been more comedic, and obviously it's the script's fault. Just Eddie Marsan looked old, hence miscast. And it comes down to the action and the CGI as the movie's sole complete treats. So when I read that the movie didn't earn any money, I think it should, because it's the least among Wright's movies. True that Scott Pilgrim vs. the World lost more money, but it's still more strong and less confused than The World's End. And while Scott Pilgrim doesn't deserve its commercial failure, this one does!Edgar Wright is mostly right, but not this time. I believe that he has constantly something excellent to say in respect of crazy visuals and comedy, while maintaining a pretty sane substance as well. Therefore, I'll learn to forget this clutter of a movie, and wait eagerly for his next project. Granted, after the world's end.. there must be life.",The World's End
69,BeneCumb,Witty twisted anti-utopia,8,20 October 2013,"This century has shown that names like Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a sign of quality - both jointly and separately. The film in question is the last in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, being a kind of social science fiction where several painful issues (e.g. growing up / letting go, alcoholism, childhood stress, principles vs. stubbornness) are dealt through hair-brained events and actions. The film has several odd but witty twists and turns, leading to twisted ending scenes which is the 3rd different part of the film. Before this, plenty of strange events, chases, reasonings, remarks when viewers can giggle and assert: What the heck was this? Moreover, the title has at least double meaning... The cast is evenly strong, but Simon Pegg has the biggest and most versatile role - and wow, his performance is so much different from e.g. in Star Trek or Paul. But all the characters are funny in a superficial way only, deep inside they all have issues and internal struggles. Thus, fun has often bitter angles and even torpid fights bring forth references to general human issues.Well done, again! Recommended to all those fond of talented British humour and character actors.",The World's End
70,jamesrupert2014,Demented fun,8,7 April 2019,"The last entry in Edgar Wright's excellent 'Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy', finds ne'er-do-well Gary King (Simon Pegg) trying to relive the high-point of his life by recruiting his estranged high-school buddies to recreate an epic, one mile, 12 pints, pub crawl that they had attempted as teenagers on their last day of school. Despite reservations, the four friends join Gary in their home town only to find that placid Newton Haven harbours deep secret. The opening is a bit weak but otherwise the film is a frenetic montage of clever dialogue and great sight-gags that set up first an abrupt and unexpected plot-twist in the 4th pub, and then a lunatic race to stay alive long enough to finish the crawl in the face of an existential threat. The cast is uniformly excellent, as is Wright's edgy, rapid-fire directing. A great finale to a very funny triptych of British millennial comedies.",The World's End
71,generationofswine,An Honest Review,6,9 July 2017,"Let's start on a positive note...the fight scenes were brilliant, certainly the funniest parts of the movie. A bunch of drunks that can kill robots...not robots with action movie style and professional wrestling moves is almost too funny to watch.Seeing Pegg and Black's characters interchanged was fresh as well, especially since Black pulls off the lovable Pub king and Pegg does a good job of looking like an old alcoholic.And the last determined dash to hit the final two pubs was classic......but not of the same caliber as the previous two in the unofficial trilogy.The alien thing was too...meh. Invasion of the Body Snatchers with an awkward Dreamcatcher vibe and it didn't work.In fact, for the most part, a lot of it just took away from the humor as a whole. The build-up was a bit of a downer and by the time the comedy hit, the audience was gone.The fun came too late in the film and for a long time it seemed like a drama with an amused grin and not the comedy that you'd expect.",The World's End
72,freemantle_uk,A fitting finale to the Cornetto Trilogy,9,28 July 2013,"Over the years we have enjoyed the comedy, drama, parody and the blood splatter that Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz had to offer. But all things have to come to an end and Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's Cornetto Trilogy conclusion comes in form of the very entertaining and wonderful The World's End.Over twenty years ago five friends, Gary King (Pegg), Andy (Nick Frost), Steve (Paddy Considine), Ollie (Martin Freeman) and Peter (Eddie Marsan) attempted to complete the Golden Mile, a pub crawl of twelve pubs in the town of Newton Haven on their last day of school. Despite being unable to complete the pub crawl it was the best night of Gary's life and he has been living in the past ever since. Gary attempts to recreate the night and complete the pub crawl, despite the rest of the group having jobs and families. The pub crawl is complicated by Andy being a non-drinker and hostile towards Gary, Steve trying to win over his school crush, Sam (Rosamund Pike), Ollie's sister and the town's residents being replaced by robot copies in a very Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Stepford Wives and They Live fashion. But Gary is not going to let these little nuisances get in the way of his drinking.The World's End will easily satisfy fans of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, as the film rounds up the entire trilogy. The World's End is constantly funny throughout its running time, with many types of humor on display; we get witty lines and jokes, character interaction and dialogue, visual gags and physical humor during the action sequences. It has everything you would want and expect from a comedy and from this team.Pegg and Frost have a role reversal to their previous two films in the trilogy: Frost is now the straight man who has a dead-pan style and he is playing a successful corporate lawyer whilst Pegg is basically a man who has not grown beyond 18 and wants to recapture his youth, including keeping his car (the Beast), playing a mix tape Steve made him and keeps trying to score with Sam. He is especially the popular kid at school who did not adjust to the adult world. He is a character who'll manipulate and black mail people, but there is also a sadness to him and Pegg portrays him to what he really is, a loser.All the characters are well defined, with distinctive personalities and characters. We get to know all five of the group really well and they have a great rapport with each other. Wright and Pegg realize they are getting older and they play on the idea with the character being middle aged as they are ageing and moving on with their lives. But they all still have some sort of demon in their past, from Steve's divorce, Andy's refusal to drink and Pete being bullied at school.Like Wright's previous films The World's End is a fast paced and shows his amazing abilities with comedic timing and action. He continues to bring his kinetic energy and he brings very fast and fluid actions sequences. Wright works really well with cinematographer Bill Pope, his Scott Pilgrim vs. the World cinematographer but he is best known for his work on The Matrix Trilogy and Spider-man 2 and 3. Pope's visuals are evident with his high angles and camera movements during the fight sequences.As well as being well choreographed fight sequences, they all have plenty of comic visuals during them. All of them are highly entertaining, particularly the third major fight where during the mayhem and fighting Gary try to consider his precious pint. But due to the characters fighting robots, the level of violence is toned down and it is substituted with more swearing: the 'C' word was used twice.The scale for The World's End is much bigger then Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, despite the small town setting. There is much more use special effects and CGI, particularly in the final third and the film has a budget of £20 Million (around $30 Million) and that is a massive budget for a British production.Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were both very different to each other, but The World's End does share similarities to Shaun of the Dead, from the large number of enemies, the use of pubs and the strange air in the town. The World's End still have a very British favor with it setting, jokes and even commentary about chain pubs taking over independent watering holes.The World's End is a very funny, action packed and entertaining film. It is a fine conclusion to the Cornetto Trilogy, even if it does not quite match the heights of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz as its parody is not as cutting. But it is still a very distinctively British comedy that will please the majority of audiences.8.5/10 Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",The World's End
73,dfranzen70,Woot! Most excellent!,8,1 September 2013,"In The World's End, five grownups who should know better return to the town of their youth to complete an legendary pub crawl, only to find out that the fate of the world rests in the balance. It's definitely one of the funniest movies I've seen this year. It's visceral comedy at its best, full of raunch and wit.Back in the day, the lads were at the top of their game and thought they could do it all. Led by Gary King (Simon Pegg), they attempt to hit twelve pubs in their town in one night. They don't make it. Now, many years later, Gary brings them all together so they can finish what they started. Among them are Steven (Paddy Considine), Oliver (Martin Freeman), Peter (Eddie Marsan), and Andy (Nick Frost), Gary's former closest chum. The years have been kind to them, but not to Gary, who's an addict of all sorts and stuck in the past - complete with the car and audio tapes he owned in 1989. Clearly, someone needs closure.And so it begins. The men move from pub to pub as they remember their last effort. The bartenders don't seem to recognize them, which makes sense to everyone except Gary, who always felt he was a bit of a celebrity in the town. Each pub seems to symbolize a moment from their earlier journey, so in a sense it's a metaphorical journey as well as a physical one, somewhat like that of Burt Lancaster in The Swimmer.Old quarrels are reignited, and the lads run into people from their past. But something seems a bit, well, off about them. A former flame (Rosamund Pike), Peter's sister, turns up as well. Former teachers and other barflies nod and murmur greetings, but little more. Something's up in this town, but is it more important than getting to Pub #12, the titular World's End? Not according to Gary.The movie gives us another great reason to love Simon Pegg. Here, he's a degenerate lowlife who never grew up, a man with many demons and no intention of exorcising a single one. It's not Pegg's normal role, and yet he aces it. Sure, this is an Edgar Wright comedy, thus putting Pegg in his wheelhouse, but the character is so un-Pegg-like that's a wonder to behold. Just as Gary was the driving force in high school, so is Pegg the driving force - literally, in some scenes, as he drives his friends into town - of the film. There are many conflicts. Gary, although he doesn't really show it, battles himself. He firmly believes that it's important for his own psyche to complete this crawl, that the closure may ease his mind, maybe make things better. Then there's a conflict between Gary and Steven, who each had a thing for Peter's sister. And of course there's a conflict between Gary and Andy, who haven't spoken in years. Each of these conflicts is irrefutably believable, and the cohesion of the cast really seals the deal.And then, a little more than midway through the movie, something happens that dramatically changes the whole point of the pub crawl. Well, for everyone except Gary, anyway. You may have already read about the MacGuffin somewhere else, but I'm not going to spoil it here, because it's really funny when it makes its appearance. Even with this new arrival, the tone of the movie doesn't change dramatically - it's still a comedy with plenty of action. Blistering, electric action, as a matter of fact. The fight scenes depart from normal action movies by being actually comprehensible - one can discern who is fighting whom or what. For me, there were plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, many of them related to Gary's blissful lack of self awareness. Pegg's comic timing remains impeccable, and his chemistry with Frost remains deliciously strong and vibrant. Frost and Pegg make this film a raucous, uproarious, devilish chucklefest, and you can quote me on that.The World's End is an electric comedy, replete with stinging barbs that singe but do not cause permanent injury. It's truly a one of a kind movie of a journey into weird, illogical, and confounding waters.",The World's End
74,stevendbeard,Fitting End to Trilogy,7,23 August 2013,"I saw ""The World's End"", starring Simon Pegg-Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead; Nick Frost-Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead; Rosamund Pike-Jack Reacher, Die Another Day; Eddie Marsan-Jack the Giant Slayer, Sherlock Holmes-2009 and Pierce Brosnan-Mamma Mia!, Die Another Day.This is the third in the 'The Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy' series, at least according to Simon Pegg, who had a hand in the writing chores-the first two were 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'. Simon said that Cornetto, an English treat, is used in all three movies and you will see a red Cornetto in 'Shaun of the Dead', a blue one in 'Hot Fuzz' and a green one in 'The World's End'. Anyway, when Simon was a young lad-his early 20's-he and his good buddies tried to hit twelve drinking pubs, all in one day. They failed by only hitting ten of them. Flash-forward to twenty years later, Simon-now in his 40's-wants to gets his old drinking buddies back together, all of which have moved away to different cities, to try to finish hitting all twelve bars. Nick and Eddie play some of his old buddies and Rosamund is Eddie's sister, whom Simon had a thing for in the past, and would like to rekindle old feelings. Pierce plays one of Simon's old teachers. The name of the final bar of their drinking marathon is 'The World's End', which proves more prophetic when they find out what has taken over their hometown, in their absence. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and some sexual references and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. This is a funny movie and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",The World's End
75,dee.reid,"The end of the world, in ""The World's End""",9,19 November 2013,"After a somewhat slow beginning, ""The World's End"" kicks into seriously high gear, the likes of which hasn't been seen since its two predecessors - ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) and ""Hot Fuzz"" (2007). Like those two previous films, Edgar Wright's ""The World's End"" is an interesting hybrid of British comedy combined with something else (in this case, science fiction), while ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" played up zombie-horror and action movie clichés, respectively. ""The World's End"" begins in earnest as it details the comic mis-adventures of five life-long best friends - led by Gary King (""Shaun"" Simon Pegg) - as they attempt to conquer ""The Golden Mile,"" a 12-pub stretch of drunken debauchery in a single night. An alcoholic free spirit, Gary is accompanied by his four bros, each of whom has grown up and have put their drunken hi-jinks far behind them - Gary's best friend Andy Knightley (Nick Frost), Steven Prince (Paddy Considine), Oliver Chamberlain (Martin Freeman), and Peter Page (Eddie Marsan). In the middle of their nightly fun and games, the quintet accidentally stumbles upon something that threatens the (relative) safety & stability of the entire world, in a plot that mixes various elements from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1978) and ""The Stepford Wives"" (1974).I honestly hope that I didn't spoil the film's big surprise for you, but that's why we have this stuff on IMDb.""The World's End"" is a laugh riot. While not as skillful or as funny as ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""The World's End"" proves that British comedy does not have to resort to stupid toilet humor and sex jokes to be funny. They understand that the greatest laughs come from trying to apply logic to situations where it's not relevant: How do five drunken Brits - plus one lone token female, Oliver's sister Sam (Rosamund Pike) - face the Apocalypse? Any which way they can, and needless to say that they don't always succeed in that department.""The World's End"" is a fantastic conclusion to an epic British comedy film series that you don't want to miss.9/10",The World's End

Shaun of the Dead is on Another Level.",6,16 December 2013,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost return to their most fertile territory, the comedy / action hybrid, with mixed results. A spiritual successor of sorts, The World's End is funny, manic and sincere in many of the same ways as Shaun of the Dead, but to far lesser degrees. It stretches for Shaun's emotional depth, but a thin, superficial set of characters can't match it. Its early action scenes are wild and entertaining, so excellent that I simply couldn't wait for the next variation, but that goodwill is quickly wasted when subsequent brawls merely rinse and repeat. Even Pegg's irreverent leading role, often relied upon to carry an iffy scene, doesn't carry the same weight he did in Hot Fuzz or SotD. In fact, in many ways he's repellent, even when a shining moment of truth seems poised to descend upon him against his will. Ultimately we're all rooting for him, but it's just by proxy and not because we genuinely want to see him triumphant. The first two acts are solid, if not excellent, but the plot's resolution rings hollow and its follow-through seems more like a dream sequence punk-out than an honest farewell. A mild disappointment.",The World's End
78,alindsay-al,A fantastic addition to the cornetto trilogy,9,8 September 2015,"I've reviewed Shaun of the dead and now I'm going to review the world's end which is another fantastic movie.

The premise of this film sees this group of guys attempt to rekindle their youth by going back to there hometown to complete the pub crawl they never finished. Until they find out that there's something wrong with the citizens of their hometown and their the last hope. Now I love Simon pegg, I actually think he is one of the best actors in the business today. This may be my favourite Simon pegg role of all time. He plays such a different character in this film, he is such a man child who is the only one that cares about this crawl. He was hilarious and added the necessary heart that this narcissistic character needed. Nick frost is also in this movie and just like pegg he plays a different character in this film too as the serious one. He was really good in this movie, he added allot of heart to the film mixed with great jokes especially with pegg because their chemistry is amazing. Martin freeman is one of my favourite actors and he was really funny in this film. He was really proper but I liked his character unwinding as the film progresses. The other two guys who's names I can't remember also did a really good job with the chemistry between the group being really good. The story is decent with some really good themes about life in there that surprised me and some great heartfelt moments. However, I felt like the reasoning behind the robots was pretty ridiculous and not thought through enough. The script is utterly hilarious, the dialogue had me really laughing. Also the emotional scenes were all done very well. The style was great, the British pacing obviously works for me and all the action scenes were filmed really well.

79,estebangonzalez10,The Cornetto trilogy comes to a satisfactory end,7,13 November 2013,"""And here we go! Just like the Five Musketeers!""Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and director Edgar Wright's final installment of the Cornetto trilogy is a very entertaining and funny film. Just like its predecessors The World's End works as a comedy although this time the focus is on the sci-fi genre. Shaun of the Dead was based on horror, Hot Fuzz on buddy action films, and now The World's End makes fun of the apocalyptic science fiction films we've all seen. However the films all work best as a comedy considering Wright carefully constructs them and builds momentum at the right moments. The fans who pay close attention to the script will catch several of those small elements he includes in the comedy. Pegg and Frost also deliver great characters and have a solid supporting cast. If you enjoyed the humor in their previous films then you will be very satisfied with this film because it follows the same premise and has several of the same actors involved once again. The script is witty and the direction with the fast edits, slick camera angles, and well timed action sequences works really well. It might be a slightly more mature film than its predecessors, but it still includes all the key elements that made the first two such likable films. My personal favorite of the three will still be Hot Fuzz, probably because it was the first film I watched since I had never seen Shaun of the Dead, but I still enjoyed all three films. The humor in The World's End isn't the cheap kind, the jokes are well constructed but I understand that its humor isn't for everyone. The characters are all very well developed and each one has his or her own personal traits defined. It has a nostalgic vibe to it as well considering the characters all seem to lament over their lost youth, and are trying to live out those memories for one last time. It's a very satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy.The film centers on five friends from a small English town that decide to get together 20 years later and finish what they never could during their teenage days: complete an epic pub crawl known as the Golden Mile. It consists of drinking one pint of beer in all 12 Newton Haven pubs in the course of one day. Gary (Simon Pegg), who was the leader of the group, decides to round up the crew and accomplish this goal. He is very self centered and doesn't treat his friends really well, but somehow (probably from a sense of nostalgia and trying to relive the best year of their lives) they all still decide to tag along. The group consists of Pete (Eddie Marsan) who was bullied upon during his youth, Steven (Paddy Considine) who is currently dating a young fitness instructor, Oliver (Martin Freeman) nicknamed O-Man because of a birthmark he had on his forehead that resembled a 6, and Andy (Nick Frost) who used to be Gary's best friend before they had a fallout and became estranged. As they begin their quest for the Golden mile they run into Sam (Rosamund Pike), Oliver's sister, with whom Gary had a one night fling when they were young, but Steven is the one who has been in love with her all his life. They are surprised to discover that the people in the town have changed and are behaving strangely. What begins as an apparently innocent and fun night might end up being a nightmare as they begin uncovering a conspiracy that threatens all of humanity. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost sort of switch roles from the ones they played in Shaun of the Dead. This time Nick plays the much more mature character, while Simon is the childish one. Pegg is really unlikable at the beginning of the film, as he manipulates and completely ignores his friends, but his character soon grows on us as we identify with his sense of nostalgia of the past. I think that the scenes between these group of friends hanging out in the pub was probably the strongest part of the film considering that the sci-fi scenes were a little too over the top (although some action sequences were really entertaining). The way these characters interact with one another is what makes this film worth seeing. The satire and slapstick also mixes really well with this smart comedy. I still think that Scott Pilgrim is Edgar Wright's best film to date, but he always delivers fun and entertaining movies.",The World's End

So naturally I went into 'The World's End' with pretty low expectations. Expectations that were exceeded for about 2/3 of its running time. But it over-stays its welcome and runs out of steam long before its disappointing finale.The cast is fantastic, riffing off of one another with consummate skill.

81,jimbo-53-186511,"I thought it started out great, but fell apart slightly in the second half",5,29 December 2013,"I'd been looking forward to The World's End for some time having enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. I thought that both of those films were excellent parodies of their respective genres (particularly Hot Fuzz which I own on DVD and still maintain that it is one of the funniest films made to date). So how does the World End factor for me in the Cornetto Trilogy? Well as you'll gather from my rating I found it mediocre; I liked the idea behind this film; 5 old friends getting back together and trying to re-live their youth. I even liked the fact that we get a narrative from Gary King (Pegg) giving us background information on all of his 4 friends. This meant that we can identify with each of the characters and relate to all of them.We quickly learn that Gary is the slacker of the group (he still behaves like he's 17, drives round in the same car that he's owned since 1989 - even though it's had every body panel replaced and has pretty much no original parts to it whatsoever). He takes drugs, he lies constantly and cares about no-one but himself and basically he never grew up. This is why he wants his friends to join him on a pub crawl on the Golden Mile (a pub crawl of 12 pubs within a 1 mile radius). The trouble is his friends Andy Knightley (Frost) Oliver Chamberlain (Freeman), Steven Prince (Considine) and Peter Page (Marsan) have all grown up and moved onwards and upwards. Initially they all aren't keen, but Gary manages to persuade his friends to try one last time to complete the Golden Mile.This film began with all the trademarks of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz; witty dialogue, humour, largely funny interaction between its characters, but for me the film fell apart in the second half. It almost felt like scriptwriters Pegg & Wright forgot all of the wit, humour & intelligence that they'd created in the first half. The problem wasn't really with the script (the apocalypse was explained fairly well, but for me the problem is that there was a distinct lack of humour in the second half). Our protagonists were running round killing the 'robots' from the apocalypse, but that was it, there wasn't much else to it. The only other running gag for the second half was Gary's desire to go to the next pub with him seemingly not bothered about the robots taking his friends out one by one - that was quite funny, but it wasn't really enough for me.Then we come to the acting - I like Simon Pegg as an actor and for the most part he was good in this film, but I felt he was a bit OTT at times. I felt that Rosamund Pike was particularly good in the role of Oliver's sister Sam. The rest of the principal cast put in reasonable performances.In summary, I liked the idea behind the film and certainly liked the approach; all the characters were well developed and there was plenty of humour (as far as the first half goes), the problem is Pegg and Wright failed to keep up the momentum for the second half which ultimately left me disappointed.",The World's End

Obnoxious, lost in his glory (high school) days from 20 years ago when he was ""The King"" and refusing to grow up or change.I assumed that over the course of the ""epic"" pub crawl he would redeem himself. But not to be. Instead, World's End turned into a Dr. Who type sci-fi, as he and his mates ran around fighting Barbie doll type robots with blue blood as their pub crawl continued.I'll admit it was fun watching the 5 childhood friends get drunk and I wish they'd just expanded on that more but there seemed to be too many story ideas all thrown together.

You love it or you hate it. But I must admit that this movie pleased me after a while. The first 15 minutes you have to go through persistently because it seems to go nowhere and it looked like it would be a boring movie. But as soon as Gary King starts to get going it was tremendously funny and absurd sometimes. Some conversations were hilarious. The fact that he is suffering from a temporary memory deficit all the time. Also the camera-work began to surprise me with the special transitions and the way of filming.As more alcohol is consumed, the conversations were even more absurd. And then it went for me beyond the limit of the absurd into utterly ridiculous.The moment the ""as ink pots filled"" alien duplicates appear on the scene and were beaten to shreds by the four bar pendants, the level dropped a bit and it was all a bit too surrealistic. It was like a flashback to a Dr.Who episode on television years ago. The aliens who appear to have swallon a flashlight look totally crappy and ridiculous. The only thing that retained were the absurd conversations of the roguish 4. And thus I still do find it a palatable film by Simon Pegg and his companions.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",The World's End
86,questl-18592,End of the Beginning of the World,7,3 July 2021,"Why oh why does this have to be the conclusion to the Cornetto Trilogy? Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, I actually think it may even be underrated... On its own. You put it up against Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz though and this is just nothing. The first two movies are masterful homage twists on genre pieces, this is a fun sci-fi romp. Hot Fuzz may be the greatest action-comedy of all time, this is... good. The World's End is a perfectly watchable, enjoyable movie that just vanishes in the shadow of it's predecessors. Still absolutely worth watching, but lower your expectations.",The World's End

Turns out, quite a lot...Pros: starts strong, albeit predictably enough, with the middle life crisis of five guys. One of them - Gary King (Pegg) - thinks that the failed pub crawl they had twenty years earlier was the best night of his life. Then, all went downhill for Gary. A pathetic alcoholic, Gary sees the successful completion of the pub crawl as the only goal in his life. He enlists his reluctant four friends and they start what seems a silly pursuit of lost youth.Cons: what could have been a decent story, in the mould of Transporting 2, turns into a bizarre Sci-Fi / Invasion of Body Snatchers parody. Half way in their pub crawl, Gary and co. discovers planet Earth is being taken over by the ""Network"" and they decide to ""resist"", by continuing getting drunk... The plot derails completely, because the decision to continue drinking is totally illogical.Besides, the whole plot is given away at the start of the movie, the ""reunion"" night duplicating the events of the first.Also, the fast, funny, sarcastic dialogue of the first half sizzles out in the second part. The unlikely romance between one of the gang and the sister of another looks like filler and the apocalyptic ending is totally silly.",The World's End

89,jadepietro,A World Without End,7,13 January 2014,"(Recommended) British film director Edgar Wright has made the equivalent of the American-made apocalyptic comedy, This is the End, both in its tone and concept. The film begins as a funny little comedy of friendship and looking back over one's life before detouring into sci-fi territory and losing some control in the script department with one too many action sequences. Before all the chase and off-the-cuff commotion upstages the less-than-festive mood one can easily associate with reunions, the film enjoys a nice camaraderie between the characters and their present day situations and struggles. Largely due to an accomplished cast, led by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, The World's End follows the escapades of five boyhood buddies as they try to relive old times by continuing an unfinished bar crawl from 20 years past. (The rest of the wayward quintet includes Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, and Eddie Marsan, all talented actors.) Their banter is quick and clever as written by Mr. Wright and Mr. Pegg, and the fight scenes are well staged and choreographed. The plot however becomes slightly derivative as complications ensue. Still, the film is highly entertaining and just plain fun. GRADE: BVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",The World's End

92,larrys3,Terribly Disappointed,2,24 November 2013,"After reading so many glowing reviews of this movie, I thought I would be treated to a hysterical comedy. Instead what I found was unfunny, repetitious and rather lame. At least I'm glad to see that some reviewers on this site feel the same way, as I was expecting to be alone on this.Of course, the plot revolves around the wise-cracking and irresponsible Simon Pegg, as Gary King, trying to reunite his former school buddies to complete the Golden Mile, in Newton Haven, England. It's many years later from when they were in school, and the Golden Mile is a series of 12 pubs in close proximity in the town. Their goal is to be able to drink at all 12 pubs and complete the cycle, something they failed to do years before.However, one ""small"" problem emerges when they realize the town has been taken over by robotic aliens, who take human form and are looking to eventually take over Earth. To me, without being too caustic it just seemed like a poor imitation of the classic 1950's film ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" Anyway there's lots of talent here aside from Pegg, including Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan, Nick Frost, and Martin Freeman as Pegg's school chums. Also, the talented Rosamund Pike joins the group as Freeman's sister Sam.Unfortunately, I felt this talent was wasted in this disappointing and rather overrated film.",The World's End
93,brando647,A Bittersweet End to the Three-Flavours Cornetto Trilogy,8,4 April 2014,"We come to the bittersweet end of Edgar Wright's unofficial ""trilogy"" of films that began with SHAUN OF THE DEAD in 2004 and continued with HOT FUZZ in 2007. The series, dubbed the Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy (or the Three-Flavours Cornetto Trilogy), is a trio of films bringing Wright's signature style of humor to three genres of film beloved to Wright and collaborators/friends Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. The third and final film, THE WORLD'S END, is their dip into the world of science fiction while, at the same time, an exploration into the themes of growing up and letting go of the past. It's probably the most emotional of the three films with moments that dive into some dark places while never forgetting that, at it's core, this is a comedy and a hilarious one at that. The movie opens with an introduction to the five friends we'll be following: Gary King (Pegg), Andy Knightley (Frost), Oliver ""O-Man"" Chamberlain (Martin Freeman), Steven Prince (Paddy Considine), and Peter Page (Eddie Marsan). In their final year of high school, they'd engaged in an epic pub crawl around their hometown of Newton Haven but never saw it through to completion. Years later, Gary's determined to finish what they started and gets the gang back together for another attempt but things have changed. His friends have grown up and moved on and there's some underlying tension between Gary and his former best buddy, Andy. After starting their crawl, it becomes apparent that the friends aren't the only thing that've changed over the yearsNewton Haven has developed a sinister secret that these men are about to discover.THE WORLD'S END is one of those movies that, the more times I watch it, the more I grow to love it. I wasn't as keen on it when I first saw it in theaters but I think that's because I was expecting some more ""laugh-out-loud"" hilarious in the vein of the first two films. This movie is more subtle with the humor, choosing not to slap you across the face with gags. All of the best laughs come from the fast, funny dialogue and the excellent line delivery from the cast. Everyone here rolls out with the comedy at their best and the chemistry between our team of leads is spot-on. These guys, buddies in real life, carry over their friendship on screen and gives some credibility to their interactions. Those of us familiar with the other two films of the ""series"" are also in for a nice twist as Pegg and Frost swap roles for the film. In SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ, Pegg has always played the (somewhat) straight-man to Frost's comic foil, usually some half-wit with stunted maturity and a big heart. THE WORLD'S END has Frost in the role of the mature, successful Andy who has moved on to a normal adult life while Pegg is Gary, the emotionally immature party animal who hasn't let go of that one magical night when he and his best buds attempted the Golden Mile pub crawl. Of course, it's more complicated than that and I've got to give the movie credit for creating a rich back-story between these two men.My favorite part of THE WORLD'S END, and any Edgar Wright film, is the extensive amount of foreshadowing her scatters throughout the movie. It's almost a game, trying to piece all of the clues together as the movie progresses. THE WORLD'S END is the first of his films where I actively tried to piece it together from the start, beginning with the names of the twelve pubs on the Golden Mile: the First Post, the Old Familiar, the Famous Cock, the Crossed Hands, the Good Companion, the Trusted Servant, the Two-Headed Dog, the Mermaid, the Beehive, the King's Head, the Hole in the Wall, and the World's End. Some are more obvious than others but it adds an extra element of fun to figure it all out. Wright's movies are a blast and THE WORLD'S END is no different. I understand that some people were put off of the film because it does have a good bit more serious content than Wright's other movies. Gary King is a tragic character and his motivations in the film are fueled by the emptiness in his life. Go into this movie expecting more than your average zany Wright genre adventure and you should find plenty here to enjoy. The sci-fi elements are fun, pulling a lot of inspiration from body-snatcher films and commenting a bit on the values placed on maturity as adults and balancing them with the ability to go wild once in a while. To that end, THE WORLD'S END is probably Wright's most mature film and it's been fun watching his films evolve since SHAUN OF THE DEAD. It's disappointing that we've reached the end of the Three-Flavours Cornetto Trilogy but it's awesome that it went out on a high note, and I hope to see Wright, Pegg, and Frost collaborate again in the future.",The World's End
94,moviexclusive,"Mixing equal parts of laugh-out-loud comic action and sublime introspection, ""The World's End"" is a thoroughly enjoyable take on the issues of adulthood and friendship",8,15 September 2013,"Five friends, 12 pubs, one night: the famed ""Golden Mile"" is a pub crawl consisting of hopping from one bar to the next downing pints, and Gary King (Simon Pegg, star and co-writer) is determined to complete it with his best buddies after failing to do so 20 years ago. That's the basic premise for ""The World's End"", also the name of the final pub in the crawl. Director and co-writer Edgar Wright's British sci-fi comedy is the third installment of the ""Three Flavours Cornetto"" trilogy, rounding up 2004's ""Shaun of the Dead"" and 2007's ""Hot Fuzz"".Back in 1990, when all-black leather outfits and Britpop were still cool, Gary was the breezy leader of a rat pack (consisting of Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman and Eddie Marsan) in school, but now he's a forty-plus alcoholic with nary a career. The only one in his clique still decked in the same get-up he wore back then, he even drives the same car with a cassette player. It's all indicative of how little he's progressed since, especially juxtaposed against his friends' power suits and careers in real estate, law and sales. They're all juggling family commitments and other adult responsibilities. Barging into their routine lives, Gary successfully convinces them to reunite for a single night in their sleepy hometown to complete the Golden Mile, going so far as to quiet the violent objections of his closest mate Andrew (Frost) with a white lie about his family.The journey across town through the 12 pubs (with epic-sound names, too: The First Post, The Old Familiar, The Famous Cock, The Cross Hands, The Good Companions, The Trusty Servant, The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive, The King's Head, The Hole in the Wall, and The World's End) starts off fairly innocently, with Andrew being the only one who initially refuses a single drop of alcohol amidst man-child Gary's antics of trying to rekindle the nostalgic memories of his youth. So desperate is Gary to complete the crawl that when he's willing to down half-drunk glasses of beer outside a pub he was banned from years ago. The rapidfire exchanges between the five buddies are entertainingly comical, while revealing that their bonds of friendship haven't aged as much as they have. In spite of that, minor conflict appears in the form of the beguiling Sam (Rosamund Pike), whom Gary and Steven (Considine) both loved at some point in their lives.After the halfway point, things take a paranormal turn and the film ups its over-the-top hilarity. No spoilers here, but be prepared to be slack-jawed or just to laugh out loud at the fight scenes which are interesting permutations of a typical toilet-in-bar brawl. Audiences who've caught the previous two instalments will be none too surprised by the film's tone. The action scenes unveil unexpected athleticism from the five main leads, in particular Frost's physicality and ability to intimidate.Yet all this apparent silliness is a veneer for more complex issues. There is more to this film than watching a few middle-aged men down pints. ""Starbucking"", a term used to describe the erosion of individuality and novelty by convention and commerciality, is seen as a negative, an affront to Gary who is clearly obsessed with a perhaps over-glorified past. ""The World's End"" also explores the issues surrounding the instinct to fight adulthood, highlighting the necessity of shedding one's juvenile past – however tightly one may want to hold on to it – in exchange for personal growth and societal success.Except for the somewhat uneven pacing, the story feels fresh, the script is smart, and for the most part, Pegg's Gary is genuinely likable despite his obnoxious immaturity. Pierce Brosnan makes a cameo as a high school teacher who reinforces the resentment that comes from 'not knowing what you want to do with your life'. The ending will focus on exactly that, delivered in a way that is unexpectedly moving.",The World's End
95,denis888,"Fun, But Still Rather Tiresome",5,5 July 2014,"British films (and I am using here a purely British term, films, instead of more common to my ears word movies) are a weird flock. Strange breed. When you're watching a contemporary British film, like Hot Fuzz or Shaun Of The Dead, or this one, you will most certainly expect all the usual things they love to add to their works in greater quantity - profanities galore, crazy tempo, terrible and very quick change of genre from horror to comedy to thriller to drama and back again. And what is on top of it all, nothing is being taken seriously or deep. This film is funny, actors are good, Paddy, Martin, Simon and Pierce all do good job, but then, almost 2 hours of this film render more we can chew or swallow. Then, after some time, the film gets on nerves and starts getting very noisy, tiring and draggy. Goo-goo and ploddy, too. Then, you only wish it were over as soon as possible. Honestly, I found the film amusing and some jokes cool, that is why I gave it 5, and then I did not get the main point of the work and will surely never come back to watch it at all times.",The World's End
96,Sergeant_Tibbs,Fine for a throwaway comedy but it doesn't stand up to Shaun and Fuzz.,6,13 August 2013,"With just three films in ten years, Edgar Wright has already made a name for himself with his quick and slick homage films. Shaun of the Dead was the beginning of a lot of young film fans obsessions, including mine, and his followup Hot Fuzz did not disappoint, even if it doesn't hold up as much on rewatch. It's great that when he branched out away from the Pegg-Frost team with Scott Pilgrim vs. The World that not only was it a really entertaining film but it was his best yet. Here, polishing off the ""Cornetto trilogy"" with The World's End, I can't help but feel disappointed that it's just not as sharp as his other three. It makes for a decent comedy but it doesn't have that same immersive magic that make Shaun or Fuzz so unique. The problem is that it's rarely convincing, struggling to integrate its concept into the drama. Sure, at its design, it's a homage to science-fiction films so it's not meant to feel real, but there's no sense of that fun foreboding atmosphere or momentum that made Shaun so compelling, especially with the overuse of Wright's editing style.Although I love the ensemble, it juggles far too many characters and none of them feel like they're 40 years old when the point of the film is that one of them is still living like he's 20. Perhaps this is because they're dealing with their least sympathetic protagonist, with Simon Pegg's Gary King. Unfortunately, Pegg is at his most forced and a lot of his punchlines feel cleverer written than spoken. However, pleasantly, Nick Frost is the comedic and dramatic highlight. He's the character with the most interesting emotional depth to him and he's used far too sparingly. I wish that his relationship with Pegg was the heart of the film, much like the other Cornetto films, rather than sidelined for the uninteresting romantic interest. The film does has its moments where gags do land and it is otherwise entertaining, but it's difficult not to put it on the same shelf as Shaun and not compare. The World's End is just too silly, feeling like its just filling in different content for the formula, and lacks those personal tender moments that could make it special. Still a good throwaway comedy with friendly faces. I hope Wright can redeem himself with future projects and make something with the discipline he's demonstrated previously.6/10",The World's End
97,rivertam26,Worthy Successor,7,29 August 2013,"Those hoping for another Shaun of the Dead will be disappointed but this one fares much better than hot fuzz. Not to say any of them are bad at all. This one centers on a group of friends reuniting to do a legnday pub crawl they couldn't accomplish in their younger years. But upon returning they discover the town has been overrun with alien robots. Many laughs ensue as well as touching on thoughtful, emotionally resonant themes like friendship, growing up, and discovering ourselves. It really is a mostly great film almost perfectly engaging until a strange drawn out secondary finale unfitting the material and it's direction. Still it's a solid flick that boasts more laughs than most of the films this year. The second best comedy of the year behund this is the end. ***.5/5",The World's End
98,Troy_Campbell,Wait for DVD,6,8 August 2013,"Nine years after director Edgar Wright and comedic duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost teamed up for zombie p*ss-take Shaun of the Dead and six years on from their buddy-cop parody follow-up Hot Fuzz, comes the long awaited finale of this thematic trilogy (known by most as the ""Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy""). Part three turns its attention to sending up the alien invasion flick as a bunch of ex-school mates get together for a pub crawl but are ultimately forced to fight for their lives against a passive-aggressive race of blue-blooded androids. Sounds bonkers? That's because it is. Hilariously so? Unfortunately not. Where Shaun and Fuzz were actually quite clever in their humour and drew out consistent belly laughs, The World's End seems unrefined and rushed; the gags are more smile-worthy than laugh-out- loud. It also feels forced, both narratively and emotionally. The friendship between Pegg and Frost in their previous Cornetto outings (as well as with their American adventure Paul) was utterly genuine and subsequently generated an affection to go along with the comedy, however the relationship here is too overt in its efforts to gain poignancy and doesn't earn it as a result. Despite it's many flaws, there is still a plethora of reasons why fans will get their kicks though. Firstly, the leads have wisely surrounded themselves with terrific actors including Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Rosamund Pike and - with a show-stealing turn - Eddie Marsan, whilst the cartoonish violence is again highly entertaining and a bathroom-set rumble that pays loving homage to The Warriors is one of the best brawls of the year. By no means a failure, but waiting for the DVD wouldn't be a bad option.",The World's End
99,pyrocitor,Gary - you're free,10,1 January 2016,"The Smashing Pumpkins may have mused that 'The End is the Beginning is the End,' but Edgar Wright knew better. He knew that for his beloved 'Cornetto Trilogy,' he would need an ending that could somehow tie up all of its strains of manic, voracious genre pastiche, savage wit and silliness, and, most importantly, its symphony to the reluctant aging of the schlubby, post- Shaun adult male. He knew he needed to do something special.So, in the words of Shaun, ""what do you mean, DO something?"" Well, getting the old gang together for a nostalgia-fuelled 'one last job' pub crawl, charged with more emotional weight and subtext than meets the eye should about do it. In this regard, Cornetto #3 is by far the most personal, mature, reflective, bittersweet and cognizant film in Wright's oeuvre. It knowingly winks at his past works (don't forget to say hi to Brian, Marsha, and Tires, listen for the fruit machine, and enjoy an appropriately sly Cornetto cameo), while introducing some of his most hysterically snappy wordplay yet (""maybe it's a windoor...!""). And, as no Wright film could ever be that straightforward, it's also, naturally, about the end of the world. Duh.To some, The World's End will be a cracking sci-fi pastiche - Invasion of the Body Snatchers handled with the chilly British terseness of The Day of the Triffids. To others, it's a riotous, boozy action-comedy with a kickass set of tunes, and prime viewing before hitting the pub (or several) with your mates. All of these things are true. But for me, it will always be a film about growing up. A film about finding closure, and purpose. A film about coming home and moving on at once. A film encouraging the Gary King in all of us to make peace with friends, the past, the future, and ourselves. It's the perfect filmic encapsulation of playing James Bond video games in my adolescent basement. And it's a film about pursuing your dreams, even - nay, especially - if your dreams are pointless, idiotic, and involve a sh*t-ton of drinking.Things get going at an almost ponderously slow and repetitive pace, forcing the viewer to be bludgeoned by Gary King, alongside his estranged high school buddies, into going on his quest with him. The tone is fun, but with a bit of an edge, Pegg bravely playing obnoxious at full tilt, keeping it unclear as to whether you can or should like him. But, upon arriving in the impossibly quaint Newton Haven (and here Wright coins the most on-the-nose term for cultural assimilation and the dearth of family-run local business: ""Starbucking"". Remember that theme; it'll come in handy later), things pick up, and then some. Here, King's raucous enthusiasm becomes almost worrisome, especially in contrast with his bemused buddies, all more content to act their ages. Thankfully, the sci-fi framework comes to the rescue right when King is on the cusp of having to be serious. The solution, like fellow extraterrestrial alcoholicomedy Grabbers? Keep drinking - to ""blend in"", of course. And, as the Doors kick in, that's where the fun really begins.Wright's characteristic swish-pans and dynamic sound effects, paired with some of the most intricately crunchy fight choreography seen in ages make The World's End thrilling in the most visceral sense. There's no purer cinematic joy than a long-take tracking shot of Pegg weaving in and out of a chaotic robot throwdown, stepping on bar stools and counter tops, sipping his pint and throwing the occasional like a tipsy Buster Keaton, and it's impossible not to share in Wright's glee. The robot designs are eerily simple, the pace and physical slapstick are howlingly perfect, while the grim, sepia lighting is perfectly atmospheric for the intensifying sci-fi peril and slurring melodrama unfolding. And the climactic, belligerent belch of a speech demanding agency on behalf of the human race? I dare you to find more galvanizing words.Gary King is a courageously different Simon Pegg than has been unleashed before, and his manic energy, boundless but strained charisma and desperate arrogance make for his most achingly human (but still hilarious) creation yet. Nick Frost also digs into unforeseen dramatic meat, pairing his juggernaut physical comedy with real pain and hard-won regret, all the funnier for being so truthful. There's also a gag involving him (literally) punching a clock which may be the funniest in Wright's oeuvre. Paddy Considine and Martin Freeman collectively ace the two sides of the middle-aged-hipster coin (post-meathead athletic emotional sensitivity and antiquated, bluetoothed tech-speak respectively), while Eddie Marsan finds both huge laughs and the most raw hangdog pathos in the sweetness of Peter Page. Sadly, in the film's only real fault, Edgar's boys club has no proper room for Rosamund Pike, and it's a real shame, as she's on typically superb form, and amiably hilarious to boot. As this instalment's former-007-turned- villain-with-uncomfortable-facial-hair, Pierce Brosnan tweaks his debonair charm and silky Irish accent to their most calmly sinister, while the inevitable Bill Nighy is deliciously bemused as a big lamp who just won't f*ck off back to Legoland.The World's End (or, as everyone should henceforth refer to it, 'Smashy-Smashy-Egg-Men'), is not only a stupendously satisfying Cornetto resolution. It's perfectly paced, technically flawless, thrilling, hugely fun, and bravely emotional romp. It's arguably the funniest and most real mediation on friends, homecomings, and befuddled male aging to date. It's a belligerently, obstinately, chaotically, damn good film. It's something truly special. So hop into the Beast, blare those Soup Dragons, and ride Wright's beautiful disaster all the way to the bitter end. Or lager end. Because, be honest: what could be a more heartfelt answer to Primal Scream's recurring query - ""Just what is it that you want to do?""-10/10",The World's End
100,Jeremy_Urquhart,A smashing sci-fi/action/comedy film,8,18 August 2013,"I was a huge fan of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, as I'm sure most people are. They're both really good movies that do such a fantastic job of spoofing a genre (zombie movies in Shaun of the Dead and cop movies for Hot Fuzz) while being legitimately good films in those genres (Shaun of the Dead becomes a legitimately intense zombie film in its final act, while Hot Fuzz has a good number of great action sequences and some genuinely surprising plot twists towards its climax). So, I was really looking forward to The World's End. My expectations were high enough for the film to probably be one of my most anticipated of the year. And, thankfully, my expectations were met. This is another really good film by the team behind the two previously mentioned films (Wright/ Pegg/ Frost) that might just be almost as good as the team's previous two efforts. So, the plot? Well, it's there, but it's not really too important or complex. Pegg plays Gary King, a rebellious teenager who never really grew up. After a prologue showing his teenage years, we see a forty year old Gary disillusioned with life, and longing for his glory days. In an attempt to recapture his youth, he gets together four of his closest school friends (who have all successfully moved on in life) together for a 12-stage pub crawl that they attempted but never finished on the night of their final day of high-school. The others are reluctant, but Pegg's character gets them all into it, and then we have our movie.I'd hate to give away any more of the plot than that, other than I will say that there is a strong science-fiction element that comes into the film during the pub-crawl (this information was in the trailers, and is probably in every plot synopsis of the film). And, like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, The World's End successfully manages to parody and make homages to the science fiction genre while itself being a solid science fiction film. There are also some really well-done action scenes that reminded me a lot of the ones from Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World, another Edgar Wright directed film (albeit one without Pegg or Frost, who I think were off doing Paul without Wright). The special effects won't blow your mind, but they do their job just fine for the most part.The humour's just as sharp here as it was in the other Wright/ Pegg/ Frost films, and I can almost guarantee that if you found those two previous films very funny then you'll get quite a few laughs out of this one too. It's all very British humour- lots of quick exchanges of witty, often sarcastic banter, some very well-executed scenes of slap-stick comedy, a little bit of absurd humour, and some sharp parody. And yes, we do get a jumping-the-fence gag, as well as a Cornetto cameo, as is to be expected from the films in this sort of ""Blood and Cornetto Trilogy,"" which The World's End officially ends.Simon Pegg is great in this. His comedy is perfect, but he actually gives a genuinely good performance throughout the film, even in (maybe especially in) a few of the film's more serious scenes. His character turns out to have a fairly dark past which he tries to hide under his cheery, rebellious attitude he projects, and the scenes where his flaws are looked at are actually fairly emotional. But, as mentioned before, when he has to say or do something funny, he completely and utterly delivers. Nick Frost plays a character who's not nearly as goofy as either of his ""Simon Pegg side-kick"" characters from the previous films, and this concerned me at first, because I found his performances in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz hysterical. Thankfully, when he starts to have a few drinks (it takes him a while) he is hilarious. And he too, like Pegg, really sells a few of the more serious/ emotional scenes towards the film's end. Supporting cast are all good too- no real stand-outs, but definitely no let-downs either.My one real problem with the film? Kind of the last ten to fifteen minutes. There's some weird stuff introduced in one of the film's final scenes that I was kind of okay with to a point, but the weirdness was oddly dragged out for a very long time, leaving me a little confused and restless. Then we get a sort of epilogue that I didn't really feel gelled with the bulk of what came before. Some people may enjoy it, but it wasn't really as satisfying as I hoped. Maybe I was expecting a great ending, seeing that this is kind of the final film in a fairly loose trilogy, but unfortunately the final scenes left me a little disappointed. Still, slightly lackluster ending aside, this is still a really really good film. I may like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz a little more, but this one is an extremely close third. If you liked those two films, you'll almost certainly get something out of this one. Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz got even better for me on repeat viewings, so I'm sure I'll watch this one again when it comes out on DVD/ Blu-ray- speaking of watching this movie at home, if you can't get to the theatres to see this one, it's not the end of the world (haha, no pun intended- seriously, only realised I typed that as I was proof-reading my review)- you're not going to lose much if you don't see this on the big screen. Although, if you can somehow get to a popular screening, then I would recommend going to the movies to see it- it's a great movie to watch with a crowd that are really enjoying and laughing their way through the movie.",The World's End

This is a very fun, energetic, entertaining film that very closely resembles their earlier films but is sufficiently fresh in terms of plot and originality. Those who enjoyed 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' will definitely like this film too as it is more of the same.Personally I don't think the plot of 'The World's End' is as good as Pegg and Wright's previous films, and judging by the ratings it seems most people agree. That said, the same formula that made those films such a success can still be found here and it is still a great piece of entertainment.'The World's End' is another great comedy film from Pegg and Wright. Same formula but it works at treat. If it ain't broke...",The World's End
103,proud_luddite,Good story even without the science-fiction,7,10 November 2019,"Five Englishmen who were high-school buddies reunite twenty years later to do a pub crawl in the town where they grew up. Halfway through the film, they are met with a very unusual science-fiction surprise.This film is very intriguing thanks to the snappy directing by Edgar Wright and the energetic lead performance by Simon Pegg. Both men are also the film's screenwriters. Pegg plays a man-boy who is not a person you'd want in your life but one could easily enjoy spending an evening with him.The first half was quick-witted with a well-written storyline of what happens when the middle-aged are forced to look at their past while evaluating their true satisfaction with their current lives. The second half is good but the plot twist might not have been necessary. I hope some day that these fine filmmakers make a parallel film in showing what might have happened in this story without the sci-fi twist.",The World's End
104,brchthethird,"Not as good as the previous two, but still enjoyable in its own right",6,14 November 2014,"THE WORLD'S END is the final entry in Edgar Wright's Cornetto Trilogy, and it has the same elements which made the previous two enjoyable: sharp dialogue and chemistry among the leads, a sense of fun, a good soundtrack and Edgar Wright's flashy directing style. However, the results this time are a bit more of a mixed bag.The story this time is about Gary King (Simon Pegg), who gathers his childhood friends together to finish an epic pub crawl that they failed to complete over 20 years before. Starting off with the positives, the chemistry between the actors is as strong as ever and the trademark British humor is in full force. Simon Pegg clearly had a fun time making this film, and it shows in his performance. There were also some nice twists and turns in the story, although where the story ends up going takes everything off the rails. While the previous two films worked primarily as parody/homage, this one takes it a step further and actually tries to shoehorn a message about letting go of your past and growing up. The others were meta in the way they dealt with their respective genre clichés, but this one felt meta in the sense that the group of people making it were making some sort of statement about their professional lives, at least as far as their collaborations go. Basically, it was their way of letting go of the past and moving forward. This is an admirable sentiment, but it also didn't make for the funniest film at times.There was also some issues with character development. Each character had a few different qualities which distinguished themselves from the others (and were different from previous characters they played), but most of the development came from exposition which I felt was rather weak. Finally, the biggest single problem with the film (as with the last one, only worse) was the ending. Here also, it felt like they could have ended the film at a couple of places, but for some reason it just kept going, as if they didn't really know how they wanted to end it. So as not to spoil any surprises, I will stop there. Suffice it to say that a good 10 minutes could have been trimmed to make a more streamlined film.Still, as a collaboration between a solid comic team and an excellent director, I enjoyed it. It doesn't quite stand up to the previous two, but those set an impossibly high bar anyway. Overall, if you enjoyed the first two you should definitely check this out. You might not be as impressed, but it's still like having some laughs with old friends.",The World's End
105,Joxerlives,Enjoyable but ultimately the least of the Cornetto trilogy,6,29 June 2014,"Huge fan of Spaced, big fan of Hot Fuzz, really liked Shaun of the Dead so it was pretty much inevitable that I would get around to The World's End for the sheer sake of completeness. Watching it I think it's probably a good thing that they decided to finish it here. The Good? Great music, very much of my era so I really appreciated it especially when the characters would quote the lyrics, the 1990s sensibility of individualism compared with the modern world's ethos of globalisation. Always fun to see Nick Frost and Simon Pegg together (which I think we may never see again considering all the success Simon Pegg is having in Hollywood). A great performance from Pierce Brosnan very much playing against type and the 'Marmalade Sandwich' in their school disco schoolgirl uniforms are achingly sexy. The 'I need you inside me' gag is funny but perhaps a little misogynistic. Lovely to finally see Mark Heap in one of these films, another Spaced alumni. The Bad? It just all seems to lack the verve and energy of its' illustrious predecessors, perhaps because the Blanks are just that. Also the lead character comes across as a deeply unlikeable and self-centered jerk! It beggars belief that The Network would make its' blank drones so delicate that they literally smash apart with a single blow? All the characters seem remarkably good at fighting when they don't really strike you as the martial arts types?Interesting ending, very much reminding me of Joss Whedon's 'Cabin in the Woods'. The characters make what is arguably a selfish yet very human choice which pitches humanity into a catastrophe that it struggles to recover from. We've been forced back to the Victorian era but hey, we now know the path we have to follow. Plus 1990s technology wasn't bad, we had cellphones (about the size of a brick), video tapes, non-satellite TV, paper letters, video games etc (which may seem a strange thing to say via the internet?). So good but you get the feeling that they're starting to run out of steam a little.",The World's End
106,thekarmicnomad,"Surprised once, Disappointed twice",6,2 January 2014,"I am a massive Simon Pegg and of Sci-fi so I couldn't wait to see this.At first I thought I was watching the wrong movie as there didn't seem to be any apocalyptic happening or aliens or anything really interesting. Instead I got a story about some old school friends getting back together; one of them having some unknown troubles and obviously hadn't 'moved on'. I was a bit disappointed at first but within minutes I was engrossed. The characters are great, the acting great, it is funny, charming and captivating. The English quirky nuances that become so important when you hit a certain age are explored with great skill. I felt like I had found a lost, extremely good, episode of 'Spaced'. Then the Sci-fi hose was turned on and the movie spins on its heels and dives straight down the toilet.The carefully crafted characters spend the next (very long) forty minutes in a Tom and Jerry cartoon, twating people over the head with frying pans and diving through windows. Where the physical elements were well handled and funny in 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' here they are just puerile and tedious. The film has no where else to go so the characters just shout a lot, this some how brings a conclusion to the film.Great front end, rubbish back end.",The World's End
107,phubbs,The World's End,6,21 September 2013,"The third film in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, this being the green mint choc chip flavour to represent aliens and sci-fi (green aliens? get it?). Yep the ragtag bunch of scruffy oddball Brits are back with more outlandish comedy the likes of which the Americans can only dream of. First time it was a horror parody/homage, second time an action parody/homage and now this time its sci-fi as said, I wonder if we'll get a fourth in say...the epic/historical genre.Plot wise its a combination of clichéd unoriginal rip offs from certain sci-fi films, at the same time its also an utterly farcical comedy chock full of toilet humour and childishness that solely revolves around drinking as much beer as possible. This is the main thing that surprised me actually, the main characters are all off to complete the task of the golden mile (a pub crawl through their hometown) and that's the entire focus of the film. Half of the plot, dialog and runtime is solely about drinking and the mindless banter that goes with it.The writing is excellent no doubt, the squabbling and all male mockery of each other is first class and brings back many memories of my school days. But it was well after the halfway point, deep into the film, when I thought to myself, is anything actually gonna happen here or is this just about a pub crawl?. Eventually something does happen of course which involves aliens that are taking over the human race, sorta. Actually it feels more like an idea from 'The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy' as the aliens are preparing us for integration into the galactic community and making us more civilised, something like that. This includes replacing some humans with clones or robots to carry out the transition a little more easily.This is when we start to see the action and sci-fi elements of the film which to be honest I didn't think were all that good really. The way they have gone about this is visually pretty dull and highly unoriginal really, its not meant to be scary or intimidating but its just rather bland I thought, didn't really get me excited as it all kicked off. The funny thing about it is during all the carnage as the plot gets action packed, the main goal and focus for the main character is still to complete the golden mile and get a beer down his neck in every pub!. Admittedly amusing but pretty loopy as it also numbs the intensity of the fighting really, I was wondering what the point of all this was, just so the characters can complete the golden mile?? is that really it?!.The entire concept of this film is very retro, very old school which I did like, watching all the characters meeting up, going to 'New Haven' and going from pub to pub were easily the best sequences (how many pubs in this small town??!). It plays out like a typical rude British comedy, very familiar. The characters themselves are good too, well set up in their teen years and then well portrayed as adults by the cast. Did anyone else notice a slight 'David Brent-ness' to Pegg's character? the way he spoke and cracked his lame gags? seemed as though he's taken some inspiration from Gervais there if you ask me.By the way anyone else notice that Pegg also slowly turned into his character from 'Ice Age 3'?, the 'Jack Sparrow-esque' weasel 'Buck'. No? am I alone on that one? the voice and stupidly heroic overreactions?. Still, Pegg's character was by far the best of course, the other guys just make up the gang really, they don't really contribute very much at all. Especially Martin Freeman's sister character, I'm not sure why that character was even included, take her out and nothing changes, wouldn't miss her. Must mention that I hated Nick Frost's role reversal here, the obvious thing to do for freshness of course but it just doesn't suit him, comes off as an unlikable character.I just felt slightly underwhelmed as the film reached its peak and made its way into the home stretch for the finale. Nothing is really fully explained like where the aliens come from, what they actually look like, were those big thin metal looking things the aliens? what's the ultimate purpose of their penetration of the human race etc...I know its not meant to be a serious sci-fi but the whole thing does actually feel like it was conjured up on a night out to the pub, a bit flimsy, not entirely thought out. Like one moment a robot/clone can be destroyed very easily with a punch, the next they remain in tact with a chair across the head. And why exactly do any of them even agree to carry on drinking after the robots have been revealed as if its just an annoying snag in the evening. Surely you'd be rather stunned and wanting to leave, plus I'm still not really sure why Pegg's character is SO obsessed with completing the golden mile after what is revealed. Drunk or not you'd notice stuff like this isn't quite right/normal.This could easily be a new Monty Python flick, the plot is crazy and the filling that takes place leading up to the plot core is just a sheer celebration of drunken British middle aged men acting the fool and talking nonsense. That is literately it for more than half the film, drunken schoolboy banter, a guilty pleasure sure but somewhat light in imagination perhaps?. Its still a good fun film for the most part, I personally didn't enjoy the sci-fi element as much and I don't think its as clever as people are saying. In short the first two films in the trilogy are far superior in my humble opinion but this is still a reasonably solid comedy.6/10",The World's End

This is perhaps as strong as their break out movie; although I don't think it comes close to being a better, funnier film. The characters are finely crafted and well observed with plenty of heart in there along side the sharp writing and strong comic performances. But on a down side the ending just isn't as good as the rest of the film, as it just goes a little too far within in its already stretched reality. They clearly have a lot more money to play with now than they did before, and I just hope that the big money factor does not get in the way of good comedy in their next film together.",The World's End

The film follows five friends who gets back together again for a life-changing pub crawl.It's the third and final film in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, I loved every single one of the films. Shaun of the Dead is my personal favorite but The World's End is the best of all three, also the most funny. I literally laughed my ass off and there aren't many movies that are that funny. Edgar Wright's direction is superb, he's a fantastic filmmaker. Normally the fast pacing, quick cuts and all that isn't really for me. But it fits this movie so well as at least I got immersed in the film, as the film is about a pub crawl. Again, super funny film. I was actually not expecting there would be any action sequences but I'm happy there were, they were also great choreography to them and how it often were one takes was so entertaining.But why this film works so well is of course the cast and the chemistry they all share. Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Martin Freeman are really good friends in real life, and they are great together in this film.

The formula is now beginning to feel a little worn out and even this great cast struggle to keep it going. Before the supernatural elements are introduced, the film is actually working quite well as a middle-aged reunion story. Simon Pegg slips into David Brent a little too often but is generally very good at the whole mid-life crisis stuff. Unfortunately, as soon as the 'blank b*stards' appear, everything gets a little chaotic and tiresome, culminating in a fairly dreadful ending.

These homages were great fun and this is another in that vein, but this time it struggles to pay off for me.This sci-fi homage sees our dysfunctional lead take his friends to relive and complete their old drinking route they never completed as youths (a pub crawl). Aliens/robots/blanks etc are though trying to take over the town which kind of puts a spanner in the works.This 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' homage is fun and the jokes fly around, but the film is baggy and could have been better if shorter especially the start which drags. Simon Pegg's character is not one you can empathise with, and this can make viewing a task although good to see he didn't just rehash same old characters. It's all just missing some tidying up. There is some clarification of points in the film's denouement which is welcome, but it's quite a wait till then.Must add a good point for the soundtrack which will definitely resonate with those who grew up as youths during the early 90s. Some great nostalgic British tracks there.It is different and fun, but I left the film underwhelmed.

A group of middle aged guys reunite to do a famous pub crawl that ends up in the World's End pub. Gary King (Pegg) has to do a bit of arm twisting to get the others to agree to the reunion, but once they've agreed they soon fall into their old routine.

This one is just as much fun and even more action-packed than 'Shaun of the Dead' or 'Hot Fuzz'. The beer-guzzling buddy movie garners gut-busting laughs from start to finish and features impressive fight choreography, amazing one-liners, and one hell of a group performance by the cast. Its B-movie homages and mid-life crisis themes are also done flawlessly. You'll want to watch this over and over again.Similar to 'From Dusk Till Dawn', 'The World's End' seems to be two movies rolled into one. On the one hand, a group of former high school friends get together again twenty years after graduation to conquer the ""Golden Mile,"" a pub crawl that consists of drinking 12 pints of beer in 12 separate pubs – a feat they failed to achieve back in high-school. The group is led by Gary (Pegg), who was one able to charm anyone into free drinks or sex, but is now in group therapy. While Gary is eager to relive his high school glory days, his friends (Pegg, Frost, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan and Paddy Considine) are initially reluctant to join him, since they've all grown up and have families and jobs. One doesn't even drink anymore.Halfway through the film, things kick into a different gear when heads and limbs start to fly. During their crawl, the five buddies realize fairly quickly that their old hometown isn't quite what it used to be. When Gary is attacked by a group of young men, an epic fight ends with the thugs spewing blue blood. Soon, the friends realize that the entire population of the town isn't human anymore. As they run from glowy- eyed, murderous beings, Gary feels that their only hope for escape is to go from pub to pub, even having a drink at each one, which leads to an amazing climactic finale.From start to finish, the film will have you either laughing your ass off at a brilliant line from Pegg or Frost, or sitting on the edge of your seat with the fast-paced suspenseful thrills that unfold before your eyes. The results will leave you in stitches. Pegg shines as Gary. He makes us laugh, but also has a sweet side, even if he comes across as an idiot. He means well and just wants to be with his friends one last time.If you choose to see one film to end your summer, make it 'The World's End' and have a pint to go with it.

A promising comedy-drama sort of runs out of steam once the aliens are introduced - they prove a distraction to an interesting set up with interesting actors. Simon Pegg bravely plays a bit of a dick-head, and does it very well. A guy who can't move on from his adolescence, he invites his old school mates to repeat a pub-crawl they never finished as teenagers, with the final pub the titular World's End. The reluctant adults are practically dragged along, and quickly realise that the town they left behind all those years ago is not what it seems.The standout is Nick Frost, playing against type, he quickly displays superb ninja skills when called into combat! David Bradley has a great cameo but Pierce Brosnan is wasted. As sci-fi the movie isn't original enough and while funny it would have been better to carry on in the same vein as the opening half-hour.So it's reasonably enjoyable, but does not quite succeed.",The World's End

Here are some of the apocalypse comedies that have come out recently: Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, Rapture-Palooza, This is the End. Now, at the end of the summer, Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost reunite just in time for a miracle of a comedy called The World's End.This is the third time these guys have done a movie together, but the fourth time for Pegg and Frost (they did the mediocre 2011 movie Paul). When these three work together, they usually bring out comic gold, and that is just what The World's End is. Not only is it comic gold, but it's also a total blast from start to finish.Pegg plays Gary King, a middle aged guy who lives in the glory days. In fact, he's so nostalgic, that he persuades his childhood friends (played wonderfully by Martin Freeman, Frost, Paddy Constantine, and Eddie Marsan) to join him on a pub crawl they started when they were teens (but never finished). Besides Gary, the rest of them are grown up and are skeptical about the journey. But they do it anyways. Only to discover that their hometown has been overthrown by robots.The World's End is incredibly dumb, but in a good way. The kind of way that This is the End worked. The World's End has some big laughs and even when it is at its dumbest, it gets pretty intense. Sort of like... Shaun of the Dead.

This is thanks in large to excellent performances from a top class British cast. For me the true test of any film is it's re-watch value and having just watched this for the second time, I probably enjoyed it more on second viewing. It's maybe not as good as it could have been but there is more than enough here to keep you entertained for 100 minutes.

It's such a weird idea but incredibly funny and entertaining.Whenever these guys get together they produce a really good inventive film.

120,anselmdaniel,A fantastic end to the blood and ice cream trilogy,9,25 December 2018,"A fantastic end to the blood and ice cream trilogyThis review contains spoilers.The World's End premiered in 2013. The movie is directed by Edgar Wright and written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. The movie is the third and final movie of the blood and ice cream trilogy that featured earlier installments of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. The movie follows an alcoholic named Gary King as he reconnects with his school friends to complete a pub crawl. Amidst the journey the group encounters an alien invasion.The World's End is an incredibly fast paced movie. The running time of 109 minutes flew by so quickly from awesome performances from Simon Pegg, playing Gary King, and Nick Frost playing Andy Knightley. The movie does great whenever it focuses on these two characters. As shown from the last two movie in the unofficial trilogy, these two actors have good chemistry both on screen and off-screen. It was also fun to watch the role reversal of Nick Frost playing a serious character and Simon Pegg playing the buffoon. The story's greatly aided by this change.The plot of The World's End is by far the best of the entire blood and ice cream trilogy. This movie does so well in both the concept and execution of the plot. The movie has a theme about growing up and fulfilling life's aspirations. This is absolutely exemplified by the two lead characters of Gary King and Andy Knightley. Gary King flips the noble goal of fulfilling an aspiration on its head with his plan to embark on a hedonistic desire to drink. Andy Knightley has a goal to be loyal to his friends and family. These themes are tested across the pubs that the group visits. The pubs are an excellent way to setup the story as each of the school friends are tested and changed from their experiences at each pub.The other side characters are also great and add much to the movie. Martin Freeman as Oliver ""O-Man"" Chamberlain deserves a special mention for portraying the friend turned android during one of the pub visits. The shift from human to android was fun and funny to watch. Likewise the appearance of Pierce Brosnan as Guy Shepard, an old school teacher, brought the theater to laughter. This movie had so many great moments like these that are great for the plot and for the comedy.The directing deserves are much praise as it has so much to do. The action scenes with the characters fending off the robots is incredibly well done. These fight scenes do are choreographed incredibly well. In addition to being a treat to watch, they are also funny to watch. It is fun to watch Gary King and his group drunkenly try to fend off the robots.The World's End is highly recommended from me. This movie is an incredible experience. The movie is easily my top movie for 2013.Grade: A",The World's End
121,griffolyon12,A Step Down,6,18 December 2013,"For me personally, Hot Fuzz was one of the single greatest comedies ever made, so anything that follows it would be a let down. The World's End fails to live up to the prior highs that the trio of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost, managed to give us with Shaun of the Dead, and most importantly, Hot Fuzz. In the film, Pegg portrays Gary King, an obnoxious sort who simply wants to relive the glory days with his four childhood friends, who have all moved on in life without him. How does Gary plan on doing this? By completing the epic pub crawl that he and his friends failed to complete when they were teenagers. However, when they return to their hometown, they find it has been taken over by robots bent on world domination. It's a premise that seems ripe with potential, and as far as the character arcs go, co- screenwriters, Wright and Pegg, make it work, but there is a serious lack of memorable moments. There was never any line of dialogue or moment that topped anything that the trio had previously done in their other two films together, and that's the thing, The World's End just feels like a tired exercise. Not to mention the fact that the film takes far too long to finally get to the most enjoyable parts, which is the robot bashing action, with us not getting our first clue about the bots till over a half hour into the film. All in all, The World's End is well made, and you can't help but laugh at what this trio have concocted, but it is a let down.I give The World's End a 6 out of 10!",The World's End
122,asda-man,"Last orders, the end of a terrific trilogy",9,26 August 2013,"Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz are two of the best British comedies ever made. Shaun of the Dead is obviously the best (although I may be biased due to being a horror hound) but Hot Fuzz is also brilliantly funny with a clever screenplay full of colourful and memorable characters. So you can imagine my excitement when The World's End was announced. And it top it off the final instalment of a consistently hilarious trilogy didn't disappoint. The World's End doesn't quite reach the heights of Shaun of the Dead, but I'd probably put it on par with Hot Fuzz. There is no greater mixture than Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Cornetto. It wins every time!You know you're in safe hands as soon as the film begins. The same snappy editing and pastiche graces the screen as we're introduced to the characters we're going to be spending the rest of the film with through a flashback. It's a great comic sequence looking back at youth. Of course immature alcoholic, Simon Pegg wants to recreate the pub crawl he and his friends did. Trouble is they're all grown up with families and careers under their belt. Somehow they all end up going on the pub crawl and constant hilarity is assured. I would've been perfectly happy with this film without the aliens, because even when they're not there in the opening of the film it is still constantly entertaining with hilarious lines and great characterisation.Once the aliens come into play the film becomes something more. I loved the scene where we first see them in the pub toilet. It's both hilarious and thrilling to see everyone do battle with mannequin-like creatures with bright blue blood squirting out. These action sequences are actually really well shot too. It normally annoys me when action sequences are shot too close, but here it worked thanks to the lack of quick cutting. It also emulated the claustrophobia of fighting so many aliens in such a closed environment. I loved how the film got progressively weirder as it went on, almost mimicking what it feels like to get more and more drunk. One could even say that the whole film is just in the drink-sizzled heads' of the protagonists'?The characters are developed more and more as the film goes on. Towards the end there were even quite a few surprisingly emotional moments that worked really well. It's fantastic when you can really feel for the characters because they are so likable. I also liked the whole element of not knowing who had been replaced by an alien, like in The Thing. I even think that this idea could've been utilised more to get a feeling of paranoia, but it's no huge deal. The World's End is also never boring thanks to its fast pace and unpredictability. There's no way to predict what's going to happen next, because there are so many secrets to uncover. It almost reminded me of The Cabin in the Woods in the way it got crazier as it went on and all the more unpredictable for it.It's sad that the trilogy is over, but at least it didn't end on a duff note. The World's End mixes sci-fi and action, but never forgets its most important genre, comedy. It's always funny and never takes itself too seriously either. It's full of wonderful characters who you grow to love as the film progresses and actually feel sorry for when they kick the bucket. The World's End left me feeling incredibly happy and raring to see it again. It's a clever ending to a clever trilogy that I'm sure will be sorely missed. So pour yourself a pint and watch with glee.",The World's End
123,SquigglyCrunch,Lot's of Fun and Plenty of Laughs,7,2 January 2016,"The first time I watched this movie I enjoyed it, but I found that it was better remembered than anything else. So I decided that a re- viewing was in order, and I'm glad that I decided to do so. The World's End is not a movie to be taken seriously. Despite the fact that the movie does become serious at multiple points, it never feels like it goes too far. There's always the reminder of the fact that everyone's completely drunk and that everything they do is due to both their stupidity and lack of ability to think clearly.The plot of the movie is rather simple, yet it's done quite well if you ask me. However, I felt that the characters were, as usual, the driving force of this movie. With all three of the Cornetto movies by Edgar Wright I've felt that the characters were the driving force, and The World's End is no exception. They are developed through humor and heart, and that turns out, as always, to be a great combination. Without even realizing it, you've fallen in love with the characters, and every dramatic, non-humorous exchange between them never feels forced. You may not be able to perfectly describe the characters afterwards, but the movie sets you up to care about them nonetheless. In every Cornetto movie I've felt that they've struggled with the ending, where it wasn't satisfactory or just didn't make a lot of sense, I was often left with a bitter taste in my mouth after the credits had rolled. This movie is no exception, but I felt that the ending left a better taste in my mouth than the other two.Overall The World's End is a great addition (and conclusion) to the Cornetto trilogy. With a non-serious but still good plot and great characters, it's a worthy addition to the trilogy, and possibly one of the best. In the end I would certainly recommend The World's End to anyone looking for a laugh or just a lot of drunken fun.",The World's End
124,ronakkotian,It's out of this world!,9,18 March 2021,"The first two installments of Edgar Wright's unofficial Cornetto Trilogy rank among my favourite films of all time and I'm happy to say, The World's End caps this trilogy off in a very satisfying and entertaining way.The World's End follows five friends led by Gary King who reunite to complete The Golden Mile, an epic pub crawl set in their hometown of Newton Haven. As they arrive, they slowly realise their town isn't what it used to be.I don't think Edgar Wright has had a single misfire. There's so much creativity, wittiness and fun to be had with his films and The World's End is no different. This film is incredible in so many ways. With Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg took on the zombie and action genre but now they visit the sci-fi genre with The World's End and having a pub crawl as the basis for the story makes it even more fun considering the characters get more and more drunk as the film gets crazier and crazier. Even though this is the third script Wright and Pegg have written together, they haven't ran out of steam. The dialogues are incredibly funny. I was laughing consistently all the way through and with every rewatch it amazed me how some jokes were set up and then brought up later on in the film. It goes to show how much thought and care both of them put into their screenplays. Not only that, there are many hidden visual gags and easter eggs that Wright leaves in the frame. The action scenes are exhilarating as they're shot beautifully and with precision. Wright's usual style of clever transitions, zooms and cuts make the pacing extremely fast as well as set up a few neat visual jokes. For its low budget, the visual effects are actually really good and the range of colours used in the lighting of some scenes not only make the film look gorgeous but are also significant to the story.I loved how they switched the dynamic between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Frost plays a more serious character here compared to the previous two films and is absolutely on form here. Pegg is on fire in the film. His character was very interesting and Pegg owns every single scene he's in. It might just be my favourite performance from him. Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan and Rosamund Pike are all amazing and have great chemistry with one another. Pierce Brosnan is also here and does a good job.Whilst I do think The World's End is the weakest out of the three, I find it to be the most entertaining out of them. I've seen this film more times than the other two and haven't got bored of it yet. Each time I pick up on something new that makes me appreciate it even more than I already do. As the final entry of the trilogy, I'm more than satisfied with The World's End.",The World's End
125,christophe92300,Not better than the previous ones,7,15 December 2013,"This last opus of the Cornetto Trilogy is a notch below the two first, indeed it seems we're dealing with a rehashed version of a remix between Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.The movie relies on the same elements (incisive dialogues, off-the-wall humour, refined mise-en-scène), but this time, it doesn't do the trick as well as before because the plot is too predictable and too redundant. There is no element of surprise anymore and sometimes the story even drags on not helping to keep the viewer's attention.Still, even though it is not exceptional, it's undeniable that The World's End is better than most of comedies and it ends the trilogy on a rather positive note.",The World's End
126,TheSquiss,"A dull thud to end the trilogy. Someone forgot the plot, originality, humour",3,2 August 2013,"The trailer for The World's End, the final installment in Edgar Wright's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy wasn't the best start to the experience. Hadn't we already seen this story with zombies in Shaun of the Dead? With low expectations, but still some hope, I completed the trilogy.The cinema was probably 60% full. More worryingly, it remained 90% silent until a guffaw from the back row in the final act. The good news is that it wasn't a complete retelling of Shaun of the Dead with aliens. The bad news is the trilogy has continued its decline in quality and enjoyment and will not be completed on my DVD shelf. Shaun of the Dead exploded on the scene in 2004 as a perfect companion to that year's Dawn of the Dead. It was original, occasionally gory, a little horrific and very funny. Hot Fuzz was a reasonable sequel that had the right level of violence and was almost as humorous. The World's End is little more than a dull thud.Simon Pegg returns to the Wright fold as Gary King, the teenager who never grew up, in a stagnant yarn about a group of school friends who endeavor to complete a pub crawl challenge they failed twenty years previously. Quite why Andy (Nick Frost), Oliver (Martin Freeman), Peter (Eddie Marsan) and Stephen (Paddy Considine) agree to join Gary is a mystery; none of them really like him any more, none of them is interested in consuming that much alcohol and all of them have lost touch. Let's put it down to pity.When the quintet returns to Newton Haven to complete the task of drinking at every pub on the golden mile, finishing at The World's End, they find a very different town to the one they left two decades previously: aliens have taken over the bodies of the townsfolk and, apparently, only consuming twelve pints each will save the world.With The World's End, director Wright has attempted to inject Invasion of the Body Snatchers with a good dose of anarchy and hilarity but managed to completely miss the body with his hypodermic needle. What we have instead is a tragic overdose of exposition as Gary fills us in for five minutes at the beginning, The Network (Bill Nighy) takes a turn and then Gary has another long session at the end before giving us another dose at the real end. What happened to the script editor who was supposed to notice the great blocks of dreary monologue and insist on a proper screenplay that tells the story with the characters, the dialogue and the action? Wright has gathered together a fun cast that includes Pierce Brosnan as Guy Shepherd, the quintet's former teacher, and Rosamund Pike as Sam, one-time conquest of Gary and sister of Oliver. Both add colour to the film with Pike taking the job perhaps a little more seriously than Bosnan.But the cast isn't the problem. While there's nothing spectacular on display here, it's reliable and pleasant to watch. Pegg steps away from the slightly inept plonker he plays so well and serves up, well, the polite way of saying it is that Gary's a nob. And that works. It's fine, if not terribly funny. Frost, too, plays against the norm, playing Andy as a 'grown-up' to Gary's perpetual child. Freeman plays his standard Bilbo/Watson/Tim/Mike as usual while Considine enjoys a less serious role for a change and Marsan is as reliably complete as ever.The problem, no, tragedy, is the frankly god-awful script and the wayward direction. What was Wright thinking? Did he hold any test screenings? If he'd sat in on our screening, he and the producers would have seen the dire need for a complete rehash of the script and a substantial reshoot.There are some moments of subtle humour to enjoy in passing: the identical layout of the first two pubs, the 'substance' of the aliens and the fight sequences. The choreography is wonderful for the most part and is more than a nod towards the best of Quentin Tarantino with the Samurai swords of Kill Bill substituted with barstools and limbs. Relish those extended bar brawls when they arrive, as that's the best of it.The World's End is disappointing. Its school report would read ""Could do better!"" It should be. It should be clever, funny and original. Instead it ate my Thursday night and left me with a void in my memory. It's not a case of 'Avoid like Movie 43 or This is The End', just don't bother.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",The World's End
127,RevRonster,Great end to the Cornetto Trilogy...,8,14 November 2013,"I love ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz."" They are hysterical comedies that are both paying homage and lampooning the genre they take place in. Once again Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg hit this high note with their alien invasion/apocalypse film.Granted, I didn't think ""The World's End"" was as funny as the last two movies and I did find Simon Pegg to be a little annoying in his portrayal of Gary King but I still had a lot of fun watching it. The special effects are great, the presentation is just as slick and flashy as the other films, the story is just classic sci-fi and the cast is great. And once Simon Pegg's character starts to develop a little more and progress, I found him less grating than when the film started.Finally, the fight scenes in this movie are better than some action films and I found them refreshingly surprising and very exciting. Overall, the movie is just a great action comedy that looks great and is enjoyable to sit through.Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies! So much so that I made a blog where I review whatever film I am watching at the time. You can read a more in-depth review of this film (and others) at revronmovies.blogspot.com.",The World's End
128,t_atzmueller,"If you enjoyed ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"", you'll most likely be disappointed",4,17 February 2016,"To be honest: when I rented this, I didn't know anything about this movie. Nor was I aware that this, after ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" was to mark the end of the so-called ""Cornetto-Trilogy"". Just saw Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, figured it might be a fun way to waste two hours and took it to the counter.Had a bad gut-feeling after the first quarter hour: Pegg plays middle-aged alcoholic (!) Gary King, who plans to rehash ""the best time of his life"" – a pub-crawl with his pals through some back-land-hamlet, somewhere in the English countryside. For this he needs to assemble the old crew, who (unlike Gary) have all settled down into mundane, middle-class life-styles and became businessmen. Being roughly in the same age-range, I expected a mix of wise-cracking, Peggs typical overacting, a ""way-back-then""-storyline that would eventually descend into sentimentality. Until the alien-robots turn up halfway through the movie and the whole affair becomes a rehash of ""Shawn of the Dead"" (with robots instead of zombies).The film has many flaws which, in my opinion, outweigh its merits. For one, I find Peggs comedic appeal slightly limited, with a tendency to become annoying after a short while. Especially when he plays a man-child, the only one of the bunch firmly stuck in the glory-days (presumably when he was around 16), unable to comprehend that his buddies care more about their work, family and mortgages than getting wasted, listening to Rock music and scoring weed. More weak links are the supporting cast: Apart from Pegg and Frost, we are left to wonder why we should particularly care about their pals (Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine and Eddie Marsan). Neither is particularly interesting and, more importantly, very funny. Again, this is more frustrating than entertaining, considering we probably all know the awkward situation of spending time with childhood-friends, with whom we have not only lost touch over the years, but all common interests and chemistry, making you feel like your chatting with a stranger on the train.And, as said, the sudden twist toward ""The Stepford Wives"" and appearance of alien robots doesn't make the whole thing much better. Sure, there are a few chuckles to be had here and there, but they're too few and far-between in order to save the story. The final hour proves only one thing: that zombie-blood and guts is thicker than (blue) robot-blood.Another reviewer compared this flick to the third part of the ""Godfather""-films. Perfectly put, to which there is little to add.A conservative 4/10",The World's End
129,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Dusk Till Dusk,7,28 August 2013,"Simon Pegg's Gary King seeks out four childhood friends to hit twelve pubs, attempting to drink a pint of beer in each – leading to THE WORLD'S END, a location with (it turns out) an extremely literal name.The sequence where King recruits each friend for the ritual quest, who are now stuffy grown ups, and as the first few pubs, altered from the past, are revisited, the characters fit like old comfortable shoes. Then, after the progressive buzz of getting uncomfortably reacquainted, the plot erupts like a thunderous volcano... You'll almost wish the robotic humanoid aliens with gushing blue blood didn't enter the story so soon, turning the get-together into something resembling INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS meets FROM DUSK TILL DAWN with director Edgar Wright's SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ as an obvious springboard. Pegg's confidently immature/unapologetically sarcastic King is the life of a party that died long ago, and his rogue personality, clashing with his stuffy friends – especially Nick Frost's stubbornly normal Andy Knightly – is the real stuff here. When the story turns from character- driven to action-based, with repetitive fights reveling in bombastic blows within each smashed-up interior, something personal gets lost in the mix. The over-explanation about who's taking over the Earth and why could make this a difficult (if futile) second viewing, yet it's a journey that will keep you entertained. Pegg, despite the talented supporting ensemble, is a one-man show: The neon bright theme about becoming a mature adult, along with the stubborn determination to visit each pub despite the many intrusions, human or otherwise, remains entirely his own.",The World's End

132,PyroSikTh,"Different, but equally as good.",9,31 July 2013,"As soon as I saw the first proper trailer, alarm bells started ringing. It was riddled with shots of people just stood there with blank expressions not too dissimilar to zombies. What happened to the idea of making each film a vastly different genre? However after having seen the movie, that was maybe the point. The plot is a general amalgamation of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, combining the threat of apocalypse with a whole village being against them. On the surface this comes off as a bit lazy, but when you look deeper it all seems to fit.The World's End revolves around the previous two movies in many ways. Rather than satirise the movie genre it's made in, it's a satire of humanity itself. It's altogether more thematic in it's approach. Pegg and Frost endure somewhat of a role reversal with Pegg being the loser this time around and Frost being the sensible one. To also fly in the face of the others they don't have the whole buddy thing going on, quite the opposite in fact. You could argue that the film pokes fun at it's own trilogy in doing this, although it's easy to see why the joke might be missed by some. Tying this altogether is how the film is, essentially, about reflection. The characters look back on their pub crawl twenty years previously and try to complete it, much in the same way that Pegg, Frost, and Wright are reflecting on Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and go back to complete the trilogy.Furthermore the amount of homages and references to the previous two movies are uncountable, from fence-jumping to cameo appearances and everything in between. It almost becomes an exercise in spotting all the in-jokes that have built up over the movies. In keeping with the rest of the trilogy there are plenty of nods to other movies. The one that had me in stitches (and by the sounds of the rest of the cinema, I was the only one to get it) was Nick Frost lifting a blank in the air and dropping it on his knee breaking it's back, a la Bane breaking Batman's back. There are many of these little things dotted about that are easy to miss if you're not familiar with what they reference. The other thing (for me at least) was cameo appearances from previous cast members, both big and small. Rafe Spall is a prime example of this, being the worker in Shaun's shop in Shaun of the Dead, one of the detectives in Hot Fuzz, and someone looking to buy a house in this film. There's even a hugely surprising appearance from another ex-Bond actor. It's a small role, but hugely entertaining nonetheless.Comedy on the whole is an unbridled success. I'm not one to laugh out loud, especially not in cinemas, but I just couldn't help myself. I found a hilarious joke almost every few minutes, from the references I've already mentioned, to witty dialogue and banter, to running jokes, to plain old slapstick. There's a little something for everyone here and it's all very much in the same vain as the rest of the trilogy. In the humour stakes, The World's End definitely fits in perfectly. Highlights include Frost using two barstools as hands in a fight, the group constantly pointing out good names for bands, and Pegg asking what WTF means.Acting was, I must admit, a huge surprise. I've never doubted the greatness of these actors, both in their comedy talents and their more serious works, but even then the level of work here exceeded my expectations. Pegg laps up every moment he gets as the down-and-out loser. You can tell he had a lot of fun switching up the stereotypical dynamic he's held with Frost all this time. Frost is equally as spectacular in a much more serious character. He gets his funny moments in true Frost form, don't worry, but altogether his character is a lot more straight- laced and serious. There's less of the silliness, less of the slobbiness. In fact in The World's End he actually looks pretty beef (rather than just fat). What surprised me most, about both of their performances, was how emotional the whole movie became. Of course part of that is down to the writing and fantastic development of the characters, but I put most of it down to their brilliance together. Their heartfelt moments are genuinely heartfelt, and they both tear up on a couple of occasions for genuinely emotional scenes. Also the way they can both balance these serious moments with the uplifting comedy straight afterwards is brilliant. You would think it would feel jarring or off-putting, but it isn't. It strangely works and flows really well.I'm going to wind this review up now before I start rambling uncontrollably. It's hugely entertaining and just as funny. If you liked the previous two movies I'm fairly certain you'll enjoy this one too. It's a fitting end to the trilogy in every regard, both in humour and thematically. It's genuinely hard to think that these three might not come together like this in the same capacity again. They have been consistently great. I must admit I need to view it a couple more times to solidify my rating as I'm still unsure about the slight change in format. I was expecting a poke at the sci-fi genre and instead I got a somewhat less original form of satire. It's currently sitting halfway between an 8 and a 9, but I'm fairly certain I'll enjoy it even more on a second viewing when I know what to expect. With that in mind I'm going to give the film benefit of the doubt and round it up to a fantastic 9/10.http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/",The World's End
133,MovieHoliks,The Second Act Was Unnecessary...,5,17 June 2015,"I just saw ""Hector and the Search for Happiness"" off Netflix the other day, and then last night watched this movie (also featuring Simon Pegg) off HBO GO! Five friends who reunite in an attempt to top their epic pub crawl from 20 years earlier unwittingly become humankind's only hope for survival. Rosamund Pike (blonde British girl-??) I think (??) was also in the other film-?? Well, anyway, I really enjoyed the set-up for this film- getting these five old 40-something pals back together- seeing where they were in their present-day lives, and how they relate to each other in the current day. However, that being said, the film doesn't deliver on it's promise, but instead ventures down the supernatural route. I see this is the same director (Edgar Wright) who made ""Shaun of the Dead"" (not a fan of that film, sorry, I know it's a popular one, just not my thing). I would've much rather seen the film we were promised in the first act of the film- these five friends finishing their epic pub crawl, and the drama/comedy that ensues along the way. But I will give it a marginal recommend if you're of fan of SOTD, otherwise, watch at your own risk... Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan and Paddy Considine also star.",The World's End

135,Al_The_Strange,Best pub crawl ever!,9,31 August 2013,"For many people, there's that certain phase in life where they're crazy, sloppy, reckless party animals. It comes, it goes, some people move on and mature, but others don't and perpetually go back to the clubs and bars to have the time of their lives. The World's End starts off with a simple premise - four older gentlemen reuniting to re-attempt a pub crawl they conducted in their youth - and it takes off from there in pretty wild directions. The film blends in familiar plot elements from the other two films in the ""Cornetto Trilogy"" - Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz - but with its firm focus on the most epic pub crawl ever, the film delves into thrilling and amusing new territory.The comedy in this film is generally good: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and the rest of the cast continue to manipulate sharp dialogue, witty word puns, crazy situations, and strong characterizations to illicit decent laughs. It takes a little while for the main action to pick up, but even when the big brawling scenes aren't taking place, the film maintains consistent pacing all the way through.I was personally pleased with the story though: it takes place over a single night, but it crams in so much characterization that it's rather compelling. The core story borrows from Invasion of the Body Snatchers, swapping out the ""pod people"" with machines (or ""blanks"" as the case may be) that remind me so much of the Suzuki robots from Gantz. It's the characters that drive the story though, not only through their discoveries and conflicts, but also with their rich backgrounds and psychologies, which dig up some very strong themes regarding friendship, maturity, aging, and being human overall. From the middle of the film onward, it struck me that much of this film is about the differences between those who live wild and free and those who don't - or perhaps the squares vs the rebels, or literally, the robots vs people. Regardless of how you look at it, the final message is that humans can't be inherently conditioned or reprogrammed to be obedient or conformist slaves. The ultimate conclusion is that ""we wanna be free, we wanna be free to do what we wanna do, and we wanna get loaded and we wanna have a good time!"" Even for a square like myself, I found this message most inspiring.If there's anything wrong with this movie, it's just that things get a little incredulous. The fight scenes seem a little out-of-place, with the unassuming characters busting out crazy robot-slaying moves at every chance they get. I started to wonder whether or not these events were truly plausible in modern times. It's also a little incredulous to believe that these guys would actually continue through all 12 pubs in their crawl, even though they sense danger from #6 onwards (I can understand their initial intentions, and Gary's ultimate obsession, but you'd think they'd try to escape town for the last act). But, in the words of a certain character, ""Oh f**k it.""This film uses decent photography - it gets a little jittery during the fight scenes, but it is solid everywhere else. Editing is decent. Acting is top-notch: Simon Pegg is at his most outrageous here, and steals the show throughout. Nick Frost flexes some decent acting muscle, portraying a decent range of emotion, without sacrificing the comedy. Everybody else is good. Writing is loaded with great lines. This production uses authentic-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are generally okay. Music is pretty good.This film surpassed my expectations and delivered a rich story to accompany its rich comedy. It comes close to being my favorite of the three movies these guys have made (Hot Fuzz still being my favorite), and unless you're some kind of soulless machine, it comes recommended.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)",The World's End

Only Gary King leaves only in body, not in mind or spirit, they remain in Newton Haven.It's got simple, British gags, sight gags, subtle little moments. It's got sentimentality, and heart, it might be a bit much but it's nonintrusive. It's got the scifi of Douglas Adams by way of 50's social scifi. It's got hilarious vibrant action akin to Laurel and Hardy.Out of all of the Cornetto Trilogy it has aged the best and in it is Pegg's best performance of all time; a layered and complex and raw act with a script of some of the most amazing dialogue and ensemble actors that play off eachother so perfectly. These heavyweights add arcs and depth and the evolution relatable and recognisable.Soundtrack is smart and banging, the directing most professional, the callbacks and references witty.

There's only one Gary King (or is there? Should there be?

140,diac228,The Final Satisfying Taste of the Cornetto Trilogy,8,24 August 2013,"The final entry in the awesome Cornetto trilogy tastes a bit different from the other flavors.It doesn't have the satirical and spoof bite. It doesn't have the low-budget texture.The World's End lacks the indie backyard persona we have come to expect from Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. The movie feelscomplete. It feels like it had an unlimited budget like a blockbuster. It feels more grown up, more mature, and more established as a pure film and not a mere wink and a nod to the genre it's representing.But the movie works, as its deviating shift in tone establishes the themes of nostalgia that's heavy within its crazy 100 minutes. It increases the sentimental value while at the same time still delivering a very unique movie full of witty dialogue, full of hilarious moments, and contains plenty of action done with flawless direction by Edgar Wright. This movie excels on all cylinders from the writing to the acting to all the nitty gritty details that requires multiple viewings to catch—the shots, the sound effects, even the names of the bars are connected in a subtle way.The best and worst thing about this movie is how it's drastically different from Shaun and Hot Fuzz. It keeps you on edge; it keeps you guessing, and pulls the carpet from under your feet. It almost feels like the cast that had participated in the previous entries had matured and had calmed down, even if they are playing totally different characters. And for that their performances deserve heavy praise, especially Nick Frost and Simon Pegg whom were playing characters that are very different to their usual niche.Lastly, the final act is quite possibly the ballsiest final act you'll see in a movie all year, as it purposely refuses to wrap up the package in a pretty bow, instead giving you curveball after curveball and leaving you analyzing what you just saw. While this will definitely turn off some viewers, one has to admire the effort to refuse to adhere to a typical finish.The World's End lacks the whimsical pop of the previous entries but overall it is a well-structured film with more humor, action, and creativity than your average blockbuster. Consider it to be the dark chocolate cornetto of the trio; mildly sharp, mildly bitter, but overall satisfying to the very end.",The World's End
141,rooee,Danger on the edge of town,7,23 July 2013,"Five pre-middle-aged male friends are drawn to Newton Haven, the site of their failed dozen-pub crawl as students in 1990. They're led by Gary King (Simon Pegg). He's the one who couldn't move on from that night; couldn't get a job like them, or get married like them. Reluctant revelry and bad-tempered banter ensues, before the gang discovers that the residents of the town have changed. That is, they have BEEN changed...The World's End is considerably better than the ostensibly similar This Is The End, a super-indulgent American comedy which mistook f-bombs for humour and name-dropping for satire. Edgar Wright's film is indulgent also, but at the service of audience enjoyment, as opposed to the enjoyment of the players. The script is surprisingly dense and intricate, many of its jokes arriving bittersweet. In an era when so many comedies are heavily (and lazily) improvised, it's refreshing to watch a tightly woven story unfold for once.The action scenes are given equal attention, lovingly choreographed like some kind of slapstick dance. Chief pugilist is Andrew, our sort-of-hero, played by Nick Frost with remarkable agility. This instalment is far less bloodthirsty than its predecessors - more Scott Pilgrim than Shaun.The rest of the group is made up of Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan, and Martin Freeman. The performances are all top-drawer, although it takes time for their individual personalities to emerge. But then, the fact that they are now practically indistinguishable may be the point - for all their disapproval of Gary, they are the ones playing it safe.What's most impressive about The World's End is the fact that it's actually about something. Nostalgia is easy to indulge but difficult to deconstruct, but this film genuinely aspires to explore the idea of selective memory - as with a bad hangover, our memories tends to return in subjective spasms, and the truth is only accessible by gathering multiple witnesses. And the truth isn't always what it cracked up to be.The World's End is, for me, the best of the ""Cornetto Trilogy"". Highly recommended.",The World's End
142,cat_ranchero,A 'SOTD' Clone?...,8,15 September 2013,"Very well made with all the usual tropes you expect from and Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg script. There are an awful lot of references to their past work and very subtle nods to other films along the way. I guess you'd have to watch it many times to get them all. All the performances were excellent with Frost and Pegg taking centre stage (of course) but with the talent on show, nobody could really put a foot wrong. Oh, and I have to mention Rosamund Pike who plays the female lead, Sam Chamberlain, I thought she was excellent as well. So was it just a clone of 'Shaun of the Dead'? Well, it has many similarities but the characters are all different and the antagonist is also different. So not a direct clone but you can see where it came from. Over all, I liked it, an entertaining romp well worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.7/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",The World's End

This time it's friendship and dealing with adulthood. It was kind of sad once or twice and touched upon some things I could relate.Regardless, it's a good time, the special effects are great, it features a lot of satisfying moments. Maybe the first half and some of the romance elements were a bit lackluster. But that's only because Pegg's other movies are so high in my eyes, anything below absolute 100% perfection can feel a bit dull.By all means compared to anything nowadays this is a great movie you should watch. Maybe not Pegg's best but I'm sure he's not done yet. I'm not really into British humor, culture and celebs but Pegg is really always involved in some amazing things.",The World's End

But the group's plans are interrupted when they have to deal with killer robots who replace humans. Now,Gary and his friends have to stop the killer robots while still trying to get to...The World's End.The World's End is an amazing and truly hilarious movie that is the third and finale film in Edgar Wright's Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy that began with the first film Shaun Of The Dead,the second film Hot Fuzz and now with the third and final film The World's End,a movie that is probably the largest and most ambitious of the three films and also has the trilogy go out with an explosive,funny and over the top bang. If Shaun Of The Dead was a send-up on Zombie films and Hot Fuzz was a Spoof on Action movies then The World's End is a movie that tackles Science Fiction. Right from the very beginning The World's End is a film that pulls into an unforgettable experience that is funny,wild and full of great energy and a film that is bizarre and in a world on it's own where you don't what is going to happen next and you as a viewer are along for the ride. The Comedy and laughs in this film is hilarious and fun whether it is from the characters,the dialog or situations that happen throughout the film and the laughs and jokes in the movie are done with great wit and creativity that is memorable and fresh as well as non-stop. What I love about TWE is how the first 20-30 minutes of the film is about a group of old friends reuniting and drinking at pubs but later takes a turn when the SCI-FI element comes into play. The way Edgar Wright tackles the SCI-FI genre is hilarious and ingenious with TWE making great references to Science Fiction films from the 1970s such as Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and The Stepford Wives while at the same time establishing it's own world and rules. The SCI-FI in this film is handled with an oddball and weird sense of Humor and is done with style and substance that is dazzling with madcap fun that goes on and on. The screenplay by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright is brilliant and is filled with great dialog and Humor that never misses and beat and will have you roaring with laughter and in stitches. If the character Shaun in Shaun Of The Dead was an unlikely hero that had no ambitions and Nicolas Angel in Hot Fuzz was too serious about his job as a police officer,then the character Gary King in The World's End is a guy that is in a funny way trying to relive his teenage years with his friends. Gary is a hilarious and interesting character because despite being a struggling alcoholic Gary still wants to hang with his friends and complete the mission by trying to get to the pub The World's End and wants to do it even if there are killer robots after him and his friends. The relationship between Gary and his friends is funny and feels real because although Gary hasn't seen his friends in over 20 years and Gary's friends have problems with Gary himself the group all care about each other especially when they have to deal with dangerous killer robots. The killer robots in this film are truly psychotic,wild and funny all at once because they come in big numbers and want to take over the world no matter what happens and when Gary and his friends confront and fight the robots many scenes and situations are unpredictable and insane and you never know where the film is going to go. The Action and fight scenes in TWE are amazing and exciting and will have you in awe because with each Action scene there is a great pace,thrill and attention to detail in each scene that Edgar Wright does really well. The Action scenes are brilliant,nonstop and will just blow your mind. The ending of TWE is excellent,explosive and will have you on the edge of your seat mixing laughs and over the top SCI-FI insanity that will stick with you after watching. The ending is a outstanding conclusion to this film and to the entire Three Flavors Of Cornetto Trilogy and will have you cheering and smiling.The whole cast is great in their roles. Simon Pegg is excellent and hilarious as Gary King,with Pegg bringing great laughs and a manic energy to the role. Nick Frost is brilliant and funny as Andy,with Frost going against type and playing the role straight while still being funny. Paddy Considine(Steven),Martin Freeman(Oliver)and Eddie Marsan(Peter)also do terrific jobs as Gary and Andy's friends. Rosamund Pike is fantastic as Sam,Oliver's sister and Steven's longtime crush. Pierce Bronson is wonderful in his small role as Guy Shephard,Gary's old schoolteacher.The direction by Edgar Wright is brilliant and stylish,with Wright always moving the camera with a great pace,style and over the top energy while also doing a great job with the Action and fight scenes. Amazing direction,Wright.The score by Steven Price is great,intense and fits in well with the film's Action. A wonderful score,Price.In final word,if you love Edgar Wright,Simon Pegg,Nick Frost,SCI-FI,Comedy,Action,Shaun Of The Dead,Hot Fuzz or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see The World's End,an excellent and hilarious SCI-FI-Action-Comedy that you won't soon forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The World's End
150,jackasstrange,"Great, smart and funny film, the best of the trilogy",9,13 January 2014,"The last chapter of this great trilogy is perhaps the best one, therefore, is a great film. The humor here is cleverest than in the previous two installments, Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, it takes itself more serious, and yet his society's commentary is even sharpest than in the previous films. It's frequent, in fact, the theme of people being alienated in the trilogy, there are brainwashed, robotized or even people turned in zombies to Edgar Wright make his metaphor about the modern world. His critic is always toward the fact that everything is becoming patronized, weird, soulless, in name of a 'greater good', which is the survival and the advances of the humanity. If you don't understand that critic (that is blatantly obvious), so you really didn't get the films at all (don't want to sound pretentious, but it's the truth) and in the ending of the films the humanity triumphs (in both Shaun of the Dead and in Hot Fuzz this happen), with all the 'typical' stupidity of humans prevailing. But 'The World's End' manages to make the things a bit more ambiguous. Firstly, the replaced fake humans didn't terminate, and then, after the global 'technologic apocalypse' the humanity not seems at all so much better than these uninvited robotic beings. Then is where you start thinking: The world would be that much of a better place without our technologies, without our organized 'robotic' system and all the 'rules' we created, and in exchange having a world where everyone do what they want to, without any rules or advances? Looking at King's fate in the end, it becomes a even more difficult answer. By the ways, I really liked Simon Pegg in this film. The 'King' role definitely fit him. Also liked Martin Freeman, excellent as always, playing the ***spoilers*** semi-villain _if that exists_ of the film. Really couldn't finish the review without talking about the art- direction, the late night visuals were beyond great. In my honest opinion, this film is a masterpiece, and I hope that people in a near future will look back and see that this film is not a dumb comedy, neither a comedy pretending to be smart or something(just like millions of others). It's a honest film. Definitely worth checking it out. 9.2/10",The World's End

Still entertaining to watch and relatively smart at times, even though most of the reflections made here are only relatable if you lived long enough to taste the bitterness. I personally loved the post-apocalyptic ending and Gary and Andy's final confrontation at the World's End.

152,gavinp9,"Fun, witty, enjoyable comedy that works well as a sci-fi film too!",8,2 January 2018,"I find it very odd that identical film concepts always seem to appear within a few months of each other, even if they were conceived totally in isolation - 'Olympus Has Fallen'/'White House Down', 'Deep Impact'/'Armageddon', 'This Is The End'/'The World's End'. In this case, although I liked 'This Is The End', I enjoyed 'The World's End' much more. It is faster paced, has more laugh-out-loud moments, a better soundtrack and a more satisfying conclusion.Yes, it's the end of the ""Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy"", but hopefully only the middle of Wright/Frost/Pegg's working career together, since 'Spaced', 'Shaun of the Dead' & 'Hot Fuzz' have all been great. This film takes plenty of time to establish the characters and give them each a backstory. Once they eventually discover the ""blanks"", they're a quarter of the way through the pub crawl - ""The Golden Mile"". Best quote - Pegg to Frost: ""A man of your legendary prowess drinking rain! It's like a lion eating humus!""From there on, it's a battle - literally, with the Pierce Brosnan-led ""blanks"" - and verbally between the ""five musketeers"", as Pegg tries to get them to all twelve pubs, despite their dire circumstances. There are plenty of throwbacks to 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', and the action really ramps up in the last 30min. The best bit is probably Bill Nighy at the end, with Pegg & Frost arguing with him and using the refrain of ""Because I'm free, to do what I want, to be what I want, any old time. And I'm free, to be who I choose, to get my booze, any old time"" which has been recurring since the start of the film (from the Soup Dragons' 1990 cover, not the Rolling Stones' 1965 original).",The World's End

154,flingebunt,Definitely not the end of the world,7,7 August 2013,"The World's End is another gem from the mind of Simon Pegg. This time he plays Gary King, an aging guy who dreams back to the great time of his youth when all he did was drink and sex in the disabled toilets with random girls.His mates have all moved on but he hasn't. He convinces his mates to return to the town they grew up in for the purpose of reliving their glory days and completing the golden mile, 12 pints in 12 pubs in one night, something they had failed to do previously.Have they changed so much that the town seems odd, or has the town changed. The answer is, as seen in the trailers, yes it has, aliens have been replacing people in the town the replicants or just coercing them into following the alien programme.A brilliant commentary on the process of gentrification and starbucking of tradition places around the world.This movie starts slow, but once the humour and action starts it begins to get interesting.Some of the action scenes tend to be a little long and hollywoody, making them seem a little out of place in the film, the main characters lack anything really special about this (which I believe is by design) but the morally ambiguous ending will leave you to make up your own mind as to whether it is better to submit to the invasion or reject it and live free.",The World's End

While his friends are initially reluctant, the lure of nostalgia gets them going. When the start the drinking marathon, they realise their old town has been overrun by aliens.While not quite as ground-breaking as SOTD and Fuzz, 'At World's End' is still a fantastic adventure, and a thousand times better than the other apocalyptic comedy of 2013 'This is the End'. Directed by Edgar Wright, it features all the elements from the previous films, including the understated British humour (there seems to be limitless British words for getting drunk), over-the-top violence and plenty of swearing.

But this ones insane style puts it into an entirely different league from the others. Though I suppose that's the point.First off, I have to admit to being a bit disappointed with the films lack of funny gags. There are just about enough laughs in its whackiness to get by, but ""Shaun of the dead,"" and (more-so) ""Hot Fuzz,"" were way funnier. Though this one excels in other ways. It does something completely different with the actors than what we're use too, has plenty of action, surprises, and is so wildly unpredictable that I had a smile on my face throughout most of it.I didn't really get what I was expecting from the trailer, but the trailer didn't show everyone the entire plot of the film before seeing it, so I suppose that's a positive in this case.

I still rank Spaced the best from them, it's just amazingly good and creative. Shaun of the Dead is the second best, Hot Fuzz third and this newest installment falls a bit behind.The movie is highly enjoyable and fun with just the right amount of drama and the sci-fi thing is quite amusing. The whole mix maybe a bit off this time, since I didn't find the characters quite as relatable or interesting than who these guys have previously put on screen. Pegg's character as a goth is quite an interesting choice. I don't mind, but I can't see many relate to him. Also, funny and extrovert are features that I wouldn't stereotypically connect to a goth. Rest of the cast is quite dull and similar actually, I don't know if there were too many of them. I would've dropped Paddy Considine's character from the script to begin with. Eddie Marsan was quite good, his back story was sadly a bit under developed. Martin Freeman seemed to float through the movie by just reading the script as any professional actor would - not a very interesting character either. Nick Frost was good, yet also a bit under developed. Rosamund Pike's Sam didn't appear very interesting either.Characters aside, the story itself is quite fun. Both the pub crawl and the sci-fi plot.All in all, I wouldn't say this is their finest hour nor is it the ultimate ""old gang gets together"" movie either. I hope the trio will return with plenty of other movies tho. A spaced revival would be fun to see!",The World's End
161,ghost_dog86,"Not nearly as funny as ""This Is the End""",6,30 August 2013,"Most critics are going to try and tell you that if you liked ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"", then you will like ""The World's End"". Well, I loved ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"", but ""The World's End""ehhhh, didn't really do it for me. In other words, the ""final installment"" in the Cornetto trilogy (I guess that's what people are calling it now) is the worst one.Synopsis: Five friends (Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan and Paddy Considine) reunite to take a second crack at a legendary pub crawl, which they failed to complete in their youth. And then, weird science fiction-y stuff happens.While the quirky idea of a pub crawl may capture the attention of American hipsters, this premise may not be enough to entice the rest of us. That said, in defense of this movie, director Edger Wright does know his way around an action sequence, so even the most ludicrous ones still look pretty cool. Not to mention that there are some beautifully edited montages, as the gang ventures from pub to pub. And as for the acting, even though Pegg plays against type (playing the obnoxious friend, rather than the ""straight"" character) he is probably the best part of the movie. Not to say the rest of the cast isn't funny, but this might be Pegg's most complete performance, ever.It's the execution which fails them: It is my opinion that the best thing the trio of Pegg, Frost and Wright have always brought to the table isn't their comedy (even though I believe that ""Hot Fuzz"" is a hilarious spoof on Michael Bay films and ""Shaun of the Dead"" is one of the funniest movies to come out of the last decade) but instead, brilliant plot structure. They both contain incredibly slow set ups, but in the end that never mattered since in the second and third acts the payoffs were so masterfully implemented. In the case of ""The World's End"" however, there is a distinct flaw in execution, which in turn causes the film itself to fizzle out instead of becoming steadily more and more entertaining as it pushes forward.Sadly, the problem with this installment doesn't lie in its slow set up (which I had already anticipated) or its second act, which is actually very funny, with a lot of poignant observations about change and maturity. I didn't even have a problem with the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" aspect, which did seem a bit forced, or the countless melodramatic sequences. My issue with ""The World's End"" lies almost entirely with its ending. Though I won't spoil it, here's what I will say: In Cornetto's past, endings consisted of a superbly choreographed culmination of setups to jokes which had been told an hour beforehand. This movie climaxes in a very snarky, very British and rather anticlimactic argument. And while post misguided climax, Wright does implement his idea of an apocalyptic spoof, for me, the final minutes go too far off the rails, dropping its pants and delving into the realm of the asinine.Final Thought: The only people who are going to unequivocally enjoy ""The World's End"" are people who loved the ending. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing whether you fall into this category or not without watching the movie. So, just take my advice: Even though I am recommending it, in the case of ""The World's End"", wait for DVD.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland",The World's End
162,mistoppi,Manages to be both funny and deep!,9,24 March 2016,"Like with Hot Fuzz, The World's End has a similar twist that you don't see coming - except you do, because it was shown in the trailer. At least I think that's how I knew about the robots. The only thing I knew about The World's End was the plot - very roughly - and the robot thing. Still The World's End manages to surprise me and a lot of other viewers, I'd reckon. I like the way this movie starts. It starts immediately, Gary King telling about his youth and his friend. It's fast, sure, but it's effective. It's risky, because it might alienate the audience. Who are they? Why should we even care about these people? But if it works, it grabs the audience, and the viewers are with them right from the start. And in The World's End it does work.What's the greatest difference between The World's End and the rest of the Cornetto trilogy? The World's End pays more attention to the characters before the action starts - and yet manages to make the characters stand out even during all the action. It's like a well- written drama with the characters. You almost analyze in your mind why Gary King wants this so bad, even though it's quite clear to the viewer from the start. To the other characters? Not so much. But there just is so much to the characters, it seems like an improvement. And in a lot of other ways also, The World's End seems much deeper than Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. It's different, but let's be honest, all of these movies are very different. After Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz I was already quite impressed with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, but after The World's End I can truly see their skills. Of course The World's End is a comedy, but they manage to keep some seriousness in the characters. It's admirable. And there are times when in a comedy the seriousness of the characters feels fake, but in The World's End I believe it whole-heartedly. Frost and Pegg and the other cast members of course do one hell of a job!Like in Shaun of the Dead, the weird robots are terrifying. The movie manages to make you wonder if they are even going to get out of it. Those thrilling scenes are extremely well done!One amazing detail is how the main characters are drunk. You notice obvious things and they don't, and it's so frustrating! So The World's End is different from the previous two, but if there's anything you can expect from The World's End it's exactly that. The World's End is funny and filled with action, but they haven't left out important deep stuff either. It's a film worth watching, like the whole so called Cornetto trilogy.",The World's End
163,nesfilmreviews,"Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright has been one of the biggest success stories of British cinema of the past decade.",8,23 August 2013,"The movie-making team of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright has been one of the biggest success stories of British cinema of the past decade. With ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) and ""Hot Fuzz"" (2007), the trio demonstrated originality, ingenuity, and most significantly, capable of drawing a large, appreciative audience. Now they're back with the long-awaited third movie of what's become unofficially known as the ""Cornetto trilogy."" Like it's predecessors, director Edgar Wright loves paying homage to American cinema; ""Shaun"" pays its respects to George Romero, ""Fuzz"" nods its head to over the top action, buddy flicks, and ""World's End"" takes a page from our classic American sci-fi films.In ""The World's End,"" 20 years after attempting an epic pub-crawl, five childhood friends reunite when one of them becomes hell-bent on trying the drinking marathon once again. Once convinced to stage an encore by Gary King (Simon Pegg), a 40-year- old man trapped in the mindset of his mid 20's, drags his reluctant friends back to their hometown, and once again attempt to reach the fabled pub - The World's End.""The World's End"" plays on the notion that any time you return to your old stomping grounds, changes are inevitable. Upon returning to their small town roots—a place so boring it boasts about having the first roundabout in all of England—the crew notices that things are a little strange. As it turns out, the town residents are now blue- blooded alien robots. Pretty soon, the group of friends find they are not only fighting to recapture who they once were, but to preserve who they are.""The World's End"" follows similar thematic and structural paths as the other films in the trilogy. While it is definitely intended as a satirical spoof on one level, it also works just as well as a fully functional sci-fi story. You have elements of body snatching, invasions, and more than a few overt nods to John Carpenter's classic ""They Live"" (1998), in the way the aliens integrate into their society and take over. It's satire in such a loving fashion that it comes across as infectiously charming.If there is anything to criticize here, maybe it's that the genre is a bit more skewered and less defined than in its predecessors. However, ""The World's End"" does cap an unofficial trilogy, and the grievance is overly critical given the nature of the movies. Long-time fans of the trilogy will appreciate the reversal of roles, casting Pegg as the selfish screw-up, and Frost as the one who has it together. This allows Pegg to fully unleash his gift for gab, and for Frost to show off his considerable skill for physical comedy.With great gags, better fights, and fan pleasing cameos, ""The World's End"" is exactly the sort of British-accented, genre-blending pleasure we've come to expect from its creative trio, and we can only anticipate to what the future holds.",The World's End

Review GOOD FOOD. FINE ALES. TOTAL ANNIHILATION. ""We are going it to make to the world's if it kills us"" The final chapter in Edgar Wright's Cornetto Trilogy is considered the weakest but I fine it it to be the most fun. You like beer or ice cream? Either way you should love this movie. The film is set twenty years later after their first attempt,the five musketeers reunite to complete the ultimate challenge-one night,five friends,twelve bars-a boozy quest on which only the strongest will survive. They soon realize that reaching their final pub,The World's End,may be the least of their troubles. They're having the time of their lives,ready to take on the world...but tonight they might have to save it. This film is a cornetto film at heart but it spends more time on it's satiric look on science fiction and it's characters first. We still get those fence jokes,a cornetto reference and lot's pf pints. The satiric story is original,fun and makes for the funniest film in the cornetto trilogy,I mean I laughed hard more times in this then I did Hot Fuzz. The characters are easily the best thing in this movie cause you probably know someone like them. Everything you could want in a comedy is here,the action,the laughs,the love,the cartoonish stuff going on if you want to grab a group of friends and have a good time I recommend you go to The World's End,which I'm giving a five out of five.",The World's End
166,rgblakey,Prepare to take on the yellow mile and aliens in The World's End,10,23 August 2013,"After Shaun of the Dead took the world by storm with its brilliant comedic take on the zombie genre Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost became instant house hold names and have been making their mark on the industry ever since. After Shaun of the Dead they teamed up again for their action comedy Hot Fuzz to bring their own unique vision of action and proved that they were a force to be reckoned with. Now they are back together once back again for the final chapter of their ""Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy"" with the alien action comedy The World's End, but will it pack the punch needed to stand up against the previous films and continue their dominance in the industry? The World's End follows five childhood friends who reunite when one of them becomes hell bent on trying the drinking marathon again in an attempt to reach the fabled pub, The World's End. As they attempt to reconcile the past and present, they realize the real struggle is for the future, not just theirs but humankind's. As we all know Shaun of the Dead and Hott Fuzz are great fun, but this film steps things up big time. The storyline is simple, but allows the actors to take on some of the most in depth characters they have gotten to play in these films to date. In addition they have switched up some of their normal personas to deliver something fresh and new. Everyone is great in this film and they all play off of each other perfectly to create all of the needed comedy, friendship, anger and emotion that bring these relationships to life and evolve in the direction needed for this film to work. There is plenty of action here and it top notch with each fight getting better and better. We all know they are no stranger to action, but Frost and Pegg deliver all their own fight scenes that are perfectly executed and to the level of something you would see in a Jackie Chan movie, which is no surprise since the man behind them is from his stunt team. The effects and direction of the second half of the film delivers a simplistic yet brilliant approach meshes perfectly with the science fiction aspect.This film keeps all the humor and fun that fans have come to expect from these guys, but delivers probably the most complete film to date, really showcasing their growth as filmmakers. Beyond the fun action, comedy and excitement of this film, make sure to not forget and see if you can find the Cornetto reference somewhere in the film, but you have to pay attention. They have mentioned that this is the end of the trilogy, but let's home it is just another stepping stone to more greatness from these guys and we will see them together yet again.",The World's End
167,kooleshwar,"Crazy in a way only the British can be, epic in the right setting..",7,26 February 2014,"Disclaimer.I watched this movie ""happy high"", i may even have had a beer or 2 extra under the influence of the rampant alcoholism in this movie, and as such my experience from this movie was much better than my rating suggests but i have scaled it down by knocking of a point, in dedication to sobriety.I recommend watching this movie with lots of beer and a few guys, this should push this movie into epic zone.The combination of the British accents, absolute lack of political correctness (minorities in the English country side, i think not, PG-13 rating *&^% that), and content that only those who Don't have access to big studio money and demographics can put in their movies, Make for a truly Different and Refreshing movie experience.It isn't a teen comedy,sex comedy or rom-com, is about a bunch of guys, in a mid life crisis, getting drunk, and that's exactly the kind of portrayal that this movie depicts, profanity et-all.There's a well documented twist, that borders on predictable depending on how many movies you've seen (i get them always, Yes!! im humble).Where this movie goes wrong is1)The premise takes a back seat, despite remaining integral to the script even after the twist. This caused me to become less attached to quest and its finale.2) The movie has constant feeling of deja-vu, there's really no epic scene, and the ending lacks the feel good factor that you come to expect from a movie like this, the ending as we 30 yr old internet generation call it is just blah.What it does have is excellent acting, an ensemble cast by British standards,its great technically (refreshing to see animatronics). Lots of good recurring themes and jokes (love the dead mum track, and andy's sister).Sorry for stating the obvious but this movie isn't for everybody, you have to be a lover of crude irrelevant comedies to like (or even love if its the right setting) this one.",The World's End
168,CleveMan66,"""The World's End"" is a hilariously off-beat twist on a common experience.",9,17 August 2015,"So, you go back to your old stomping grounds to relive some memories and renew some old acquaintances. You're hoping that everything and everyone will be exactly as you remember, but it's just not so. Who can't relate to this scenario? It's this type of experience that is the basis for the British comedy ""The World's End"" (R, 1:49).Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who previously joined forces in ""Paul"", ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""Shawn of the Dead"", and Martin Freeman from ""The Hobbit"" movies, are the cast members with the most familiar faces, but they're joined by some great character actors you may or may not recognize, along with a former James Bond, who is fun to watch in a minor, but important role.Pegg (who also co-wrote the film) plays Gary King, who as a teenager, was the de facto leader of a group of school chums who graduated together, but have gone their separate ways in the 20 years since. The others have moved on with their lives and become pretty successful, while Gary is the very definition of arrested development. He lives to have fun, so it's no surprise that he comes up with the idea of getting the gang back together to revisit their hometown and complete the locals' traditional pub crawl that they attempted when they graduated. Back then, they made it to the first nine in a series of twelve pubs (or bars, as we yanks call them), the last of which is the pub which lends its name to the movie. Gary's trademark (and infectious) devil-may-care attitude and characteristic manipulation get his old mates to go along with the plan. They know what he's like, but they all did have a lot of fun together back in the day and they each still seem to have some residual affection for the old boy, so they agree.As the gang progresses through the pubs of their hometown's ""Golden Mile"", it becomes obvious that the townspeople have changed – more than you'd expect. The film's trailer shows more than I'm willing to reveal here. Let's just say that completing the pub crawl becomes the least challenging thing these ""blokes"" do this night (along with one ""bird"" who joins them – a very fetching Rosamund Pike), and the pub at the end of their journey just may live up to its name. Of course, as the pints and the challenges both mount, the gang's need to be on their toes becomes greater, just as their ability to do so diminishes. Hilarity ensues – much hilarity.Simon Pegg has never been funnier and the outrageous circumstances that unfold before our eyes are a lot of fun to watch. ""The World's End"" taps into universal themes of fond memories, regrets, friendship and the desire for independence, but the plot is wildly original, the story is just plain wild and the writing and the actors who get to say the lines are very, very funny. I give their efforts an enthusiastic ""A"".",The World's End
169,RichardSRussell-1,"Better Than the American Equivalent, ""This Is the End"", Funnier, Less Raunchy",5,5 September 2013,"The World's End is kind of like a British version of This Is the End, an American buddy comedy featuring a gang of raunchy male actors from the Judd Apatow repertory company. In this case, it's Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Eddie Marsan as high-school buddies who tried to perform a heroic pub crawl — the Golden Mile, 12 pubs in a single evening — on the night of their graduation but didn't make it all the way to Pub #12, The World's End.Now, 23 years later, head provocateur and wastrel Gary King (Pegg) wants them all to reunite to have another go at it. A subtle joke (too subtle for the blatant barf and fart humor this movie basically appeals to) is that all the family names involved (respectively King, Knightley, Chamberlain, Prince, and Page) are titles you'd find in a royal court, not among the commoners. Things start to go awry 4 pubs and 35 minutes into the movie when they discover that true bluebloods, human-like androids (""Don't call us robots""), have essentially taken over the old home town of Newton Haven and are gradually replacing all the actual humans with simulacra. This being a dark comedy centered around drinking more than alien invaders, our 5 lads decide to carry on with their quest even as the situation deteriorates around them.The movie, despite having some good moments, never really quite clicked.

170,loco_73,What ...No Flava?!,7,30 August 2013,"""The World's End"" is the final instalment in what has been dubbed ""The Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy"", featuring the main team of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. The previous entries in this trilogy of sorts were ""Shaun Of The Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" respectively. I will say that for me personally that ""Shaun Of The Dead"" takes first place in this trilogy without a doubt.While each movie tackles different subjects, beyond the obvious connection of the three protagonists of the trilogy, they also share a certain affinity in the type of humour and gags they each inherently embody.The type of nihilistic and absurdist humour accompanied by preposterous gags seen in ""The Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy"", certainly belongs to the fine tradition of British humour, embodied so fittingly by many a great British comedian or actor, but perhaps most prominently by Monty Python. Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are clearly alumni of that great school of humour which has produced some remarkable talent over the years.""The World's End"" is actually the one that most embodies the ""pythonesque-like"" approach to humour and its usually ridiculous outcomes.Though the movie is enjoyable and has its high-comedic moments, it is also lacking and lagging behind its counterparts ""Shaun Of The Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". While it retains the core elements also seen in the previous movies, ""The World's End"" feels flat and at times oddly uninteresting leaving its audiences with a ""who cares?"" after-taste.If nothing else the movie suffers from bad timing as far as its release. The summer movie season was already populated by ""The Hangover-Part 3"" and ""This Is The End"". Actually for some movie viewers the titles might even be a bit confusing ""This Is The End"" versus ""The World's End""...not to mention the set-up and scenario in both movies, which are quite similar in certain aspects. Then there might also just be a general tiredness in regards to this type of comedies with audiences having reached saturation after being bombarded for the past few years with them...While it is usually not a good sign when the release date of a movie changes and said movie gets pushed back, I think in this case it would have been advisable to perhaps release ""The World's End"" later in the fall.All in all, a decent comedy, decent cast...decent direction....decent script...and not much more. ""The World's End"" is the one with the least flavour from this trilogy....""This Is The End"" versus ""The World's End"" and ""White House Down"" versus ""Olympus Has Fallen""!

171,tr91,Good comedy but would've preferred without the 'twist',7,1 October 2013,"'The World's End' is about Gary (Simon Pegg) who reunites with his friends to go on a pub crawl, trying to beat their previous attempt 20 years earlier.It started off really well, Simon Pegg was fantastic as Gary, there was plenty of hilarious one liners and genuine laugh out loud moments as he talked about the past and then reunited with his friends, who unlike Gary, have all changed.Then we get to the pubs and the laughs continue, the other characters become more involved too. The first 45 minutes or so of this film is as good as any comedy I have seen. Then came the twist.....The first scene in the toilets of one of the pubs was a very good scene, the action was fast paced and still funny at the same time. But after 20 minutes of seeing these people with blue stuff pouring out of them after a beating it did become a bit boring. It started to get really dragged out and just a bit silly in general. The ending was also very weird, I kind of lost interest and didn't really get what was going on.I knew this film had a Sci-Fi 'twist' before I started watching it so I can't be too annoyed about it but I feel this film would have been much better without the twist. This could have been a great comedy if it was just a pub crawl.Overall, the first half of the film is brilliant. The 2nd part is good for a while but then starts dragging.

Five schoolmates gather after a very long time to complete a challange that they attempted but failed 20 years ago. It consists of a pub crawl involving 12 differents places. The script is original but somewhat analogous to the second film Hot Fuzz (2007), that is, the people they encounter in the pubs don't seem to be who they are and strange events begin to occur. Technically speaking, Simon Pegg is totally overacting at the beginning of film. He makes quite a fuss upon meeting his old friends which is completely unnecessary. On the other hand, Pierce Brosnan's cameo is a nice surprise. Overall, although not perfect and still blended with loads of cold English jokes, this one is slightly better than the previous two films.",The World's End
173,Brucey_D,"UK's first roundabout, built circa 1909",8,9 December 2018,"This film, part of the 'cornetto trilogy', celebrates both the boozy UK tradition of 'the pub crawl' and the fact that some folk don't ever grow up, quickly reverting back to teenage behaviour in the right (wrong) company. So Gary King (Pegg) -a prime example of arrested development- attempts to recreate a home town pub crawl from about twenty years earlier. His teenage friends have all grown up and moved on, and only reluctantly participate. However things take a strange turn; their home town isn't quite the same as it used to be....This film is basically quite a lot of fun. However there really is plenty going on and you might not pick it all up first time round. As well as celebrating some of the things about British life that are slightly frowned upon or just taken for granted, there are plenty of little pokes at things along the way, for example that nearly all pubs look the same inside these days (and lots of people are happy with that), that some suburban towns in the UK are almost completely anodyne, anonymous, interchangeable, and that there is a strong (but unwritten) expectation of conformity in many such places.So you can just take this film as a jolly romp, with a well-crafted script, a banging early '90s soundtrack and a really good cast, or you can do that and take some social commentary away with it too.Many of the external scenes were filmed in Letchworth and Welwyn, both so-called 'garden cities' built in the twentieth century to relieve London of its increasingly poor housing conditions. They are pleasant enough places to be sure, but if you subscribe to the idea that environment shapes behaviour, then some sort of conformism seems the likely result.The sign that says ""UK's first roundabout, built circa 1909"" is real; this is commemorated in Letchworth, exactly as in the film.Well worth watching this; all good fun and it contains a vignette of late twentieth century suburban life that wouldn't exist otherwise.",The World's End

176,Bravesfan17,Entertaining and Hilarious Film,9,30 August 2013,"I enjoyed the collaboration between director Edgar Wright and actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost with hilarious 2007 film Hot Fuzz. Though not directed by Wright, Pegg and Frost were entertaining in their 2011 film Paul. This time around, Wright has reteamed with Pegg and Frost with their new comedy film The World's End.Gary King (Pegg) is at a rehab group in a hospital where he talks about when he was younger, he and his four best pals were trying to accomplish the mission of the Gold Mile. The Gold Mile was a mission in Gary's childhood town where they would get a drink at each of the 12 pubs, with the twelfth one being The World's End. However, when Gary and his friends were younger, they quit after the ninth one and never finished their mission. Now nearing 40, Gary wants to try for all 12 one more time. However, all his friends have grown up and moved on. Steve (Paddy Considine) is now a construction manager. Peter (Eddie Marsan) is now a partner at his father's business. Oliver (Martin Freeman) is a real estate agent. Andy (Frost) is a working man and happily married. However, Gary has ended up convincing each one of them to come with him to Newton Haven to retry their pub crawl. Along the way, Oliver's sister Sam (Rosamund Pike) shows up. Sam rejects sexual advances by Gary, and Steve has always had feelings for her. Gary also notices how people in Newton Haven have changed when he tries to talk to a high school kid who doesn't speak, and his suspicion is confirmed when the kid's head falls off and blue liquid comes out. On their way to finishing the mission to The World's End, they find out that the people have become ""civilized"" by being replaced with perfect imitations and are after the DNA of humans.The World's End is a fun action, adventure comedy from the brilliant minds of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. Wright has shown his knack for action comedies before with Hot Fuzz and Scott Pilgrim and shows his talents as a director here by keeping the story fresh and interesting and wanting us to cheer for these guys as they work to finish their quest of completing The Golden Mile.This is a great cast Wright has put together with Simon Pegg at front and center and the MVP. Pegg is best at making Gary entertaining and making us wonder what Gary will say or do next. Pegg has made Gary into a well fleshed out character who is wanting to do The Golden Mile for more than what we know. Nick Frost is fun in his role as the stuck up Andy. My favorite supporting player is Paddy Considine as Steve, who does a nice job as Gary's friend and has a great moment with Sam of sharing his feelings for her. Marsan and Freeman also do fine in their roles. I also quite enjoyed Rosamund Pike in her limited role as Sam.The best technical parts I enjoyed in this were the camera work, editing, and the soundtrack. Overall, the film is entertaining and hilarious.",The World's End

Its a complete mess of a sci-fi film which ruins what would have been a classic trilogy.
It doesn't resemble the previous two movies in quality. re-watchability or tone.
Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have made a career out of nostalgia for pop culture and this movie deviates from this formula.
Whereas Spaced, Shaun etc looked to the shared past with their audience with affection, The Worlds End is basically taking a dump on the whole idea of nostalgia.
The message of this movie seems to be that reminiscing about the past is pathological, which is very odd considering that Spaced was basically an entire series of mainly cultural references from the past?
This is problematic for the trilogy as it attacks the very heart of the success of the previous movies.
The Worlds End conflates alcohol misuse with looking back on your past. One is pathological while the other is fairly normal.
Recently Simon Pegg reported that he himself experienced alcohol issues and that this character in the movie was basically him. Its seems that in order to exorcise these demons that they have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. So much for therapy.
The problem is that again this is a significant deviation from the Cornetto template, he is a very unlikable person and is very grating to watch. This doesn't suit Simon Pegg as he is best cast as a likeable nerd which again was one of the main draws of the cinematic series.
Another issue is that he embodies nostalgia, in his musical tastes and belief that his teen years were the best of his life, funnily enough many people feel these were so to attack this idea is extremely clumsy and has alienated a huge chuck of the Cornetto audience.
What is strange is the use of 90s music which is obviously used as a tool to hook in an audience who grew up in the 90s, which is a nostalgia trip. The movie then spends its time stamping on its audience telling us that that this is wrong. It sends out very mixed messages.
If you loved Shaun and Fuzz then you will probably hate this, the people who seem to like have either never seen the others or actively dislike them.
The final Cornetto flavour is a very bitter one and its no surprise that fans of the first two movies simply couldn't stomach it.",The World's End
178,elenaphysics,What a terrible movie,1,13 March 2017,"This movie is terrible. I wasted my time watching it. from the beginning it seemed pointless. A loser, gathering back his old friends in order to participate in a beer marathon. Afterwards it becomes much worse , with aliens taking over the place and transforming humans into robots and dispose the human bodies. I do not know if there was even one funny joke in the movie. If it served its purpose as a black comedy let's say. I truly want to say how awful it was. Of course I have watched even worse movies in my life. But this is not the point. The whole thing was not watchable, boring, not funny, bad scenario, bad acting and overall it was weird to watch. The main actor was terrible too. If he was not so antipathetic , maybe the whole film would be a lot easier to watch.",The World's End

They should be justly proud of this trilogy parallels.",7,14 August 2013,"Gary King has issues, his life never turned out as he wanted and as he approaches the 2nd half of his life with a burden of regrets and remorse behind him all he wants to do is complete the task that he failed to complete when he'd just left school and finish the monumental pub crawl, 12 pubs over the space of one mile in his sleepy home time of Newton Haven, but will Gary and his four childhood friends be able to finish what they started this time or will shadowy events overtake them AND be mankind's undoing?I guess like many people I was excited and nervous about how the ""Blood and Cornetto"" trilogy would end, initially when it was devised it was meant to be a British comedic homage to the ""Three Colours"" trilogy but did it pass the test? For me, The World's end felt almost like ""Shaun of the Dead"" reprise, in that we have a big end-of- the-world style apocalyptic event occurring and while the story was different to ""Shaun"" there was still a feeling of ""we've been here before"" that I just couldn't escape.This isn't to say the film isn't enjoyable, fun, funny, well-observed and well acted as it is, and all of the leads, in particular Nick Frost and Paddy Considine, are impressive throughout, but it did feel a bit ""done this before""-y. So as for comparisons to trilogies for me ""The Blood and Cornetto"" trilogy actually is probably more like a comedic version of ""The Star Wars"" trilogy (original!!!). ""Shaun"" is the groundbreaking first film that actually changes movies, in this case by creating the sub-genre that has since taken off, the zom-rom-com, then comes the best of the bunch, the second film ""Hot Fuzz"", a tour-de-force that no-one expects to be as good as it is, and then finally the wrap-up film that feels sort of similar to the first except that it's on a bigger budget and grander scale.Worth seeing for anyone that has watched the other two and has taken this journey through life with Shaun, Nick and now Gary. 7 out of 10.",The World's End
180,ajit2106,An ingenious end to the Cornetto trilogy,8,9 October 2013,"Edgar Wright strikes at the heart of the viewer and accompanies it with the belly aching from laughter until the End of the World in other words it is hilarious, brilliant, zany, exciting & extraordinary.20 years after their last meeting, five friends get together and try to do the work they left unfinished during adolescence : complete the Golden Mile , which is the path that leads to the pub 12 The World's End , local historian where none of them has ever visited before.Edgar Wright concludes the amazing 'Cornetto trilogy' with The World's End. It all began with 'The Shaun of the Dead' and continued with 'Hot Fuzz'. In this extraordinary context, Edgar Wright falls once again for its ordinary characters alongside Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, the constant companions of the director, there are other familiar faces from British cinema: Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan and Paddy Considine . This cute quintet is accompanied by sweet Rosamund Pike, charming Pierce Brosnan and David Bradley. They strictly stick to their style, which is as usual a successful blend of comedy, British understatement, good characters and a good dose of self-irony. Instead of bringing a flippant by saying the others are allowed the film also some serious moments to bring the viewer's closer to the characters or to fans of the series to bless people by insiders.The key is the physical component and action of the film. The five main characters are seen more involved in physical ""encounters"" that put them to the test and we see them, surprisingly, up to the most complex stunts and the most violent fights. Speaking of characters , they are played by real sizes of the British film world , and so it is no wonder that Eddie Marsan ( "" Sherlock Holmes,"" "" Hancock "" ), Martin Freeman ( "" The Hobbit "", "" The Office"" ) and Paddy Considine ( "" The Bourne Ultimatum "", "" Cinderella Man "" ) all deliver a remarkable performance and share a great chemistry.Thoroughly recommended. 7.6/10",The World's End
181,bushtony,The World's End Delivers,8,9 November 2013,"The third and final in what Pegg and Wright have dubbed ""The Cornetto Trilogy,"" the preceding two being SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ. This final film is the most personal and probably the one with the most emotional resonance. Gary King (Pegg) is an eternal teenager. Stuck in a time-warp and never moving on from what he imagines was the best ever time in his life – the day he left school with his mates and embarked on a never-completed pub crawl in their home town. As a result of a group therapy session, Gary hatches a harebrained scheme to change his life, a plan to reunite the old crew and replicate the pub crawl reaching the final fabled hostelry ""The World's End."" Pegg is centre stage throughout and acts as a lightning rod conducting the emotional electricity at the heart of the film. The audience identifies with Gary because he represents both what and where we might have been had we never grown up and moved on. He manifests the same impact on his friends as they slowly come to realise that buying into the benchmarks by which society measures success – houses, marriage, kids, careers, work – has not rendered them any less unhappy, unfulfilled and unsatisfied with their lot. Pegg delivers a masterclass of hyperactivity, rapid-fire patter, selfishness, bravura and poignantly fragile optimism. By sheer force of will and persistence, he cajoles manipulates and cons his friends into taking part in his adventure. This is Pegg's career best performance to date and his Gary King stimulates both the funny-bone and the heart-strings in equal measure.Kudos in the characterisation stakes also goes to Nick Frost as Gary's former best friend Andy. At heart, Andy is a hulking, alcoholic bruiser squashed into a suit and working as a teetotal corporate stuffed shirt. The relationship between Gary and Andy is beautifully acted and the two performers resonate off each other with masterful interactions defined by bittersweet sensitivity and precise timing. Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan and Paddy Considine provide engaging support as the other three members of ""The Five Musketeers"" and Rosamund Pike is achingly lovely as the token female. But really, the focus is the Pegg/Frost double act – as it was in SHAUN and FUZZ. And that's the way it should be. The plot line proceeds to inject elements of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, STEPFORD WIVES and THE TERMINATOR into the narrative, but in spite of this manages to evolve into something that is presented in a wholly original way. Everything powers along at a snappy pace with fights, chases, explosions, slapstick and comic stunts arriving one after the other. Although the gang realise that something sinister is afoot and that people are no longer people rather alien machines, they decide to go with Gary's plan to continue the pub crawl as a means of escape. Thus giving the impression to any onlookers that they don't know what they know. However, the drunker they get the more they employ alcohol-challenged and terminally cracked logic to reason and strategise their way out of the nightmare which in turn leads to ever escalating destruction and disaster. THE WORLD'S END is cool, entertaining, funny and an impressive and fitting way to wind-up the trilogy. Fans of SHAUN and FUZZ are unlikely to be disappointed and although it isn't quite as good as the first film, for me it just edges ahead of the second. Pegg and Frost are at the top of their game, the sfx and pyrotechnics are a gas and the CGI doesn't intrude to the point of overkill. Genre fans will especially get a kick out of train-spotting the subtle and good humoured references and in-jokes; the MAD MAX/ANY NUMBER OF POST-APOCALYPTIC MOVIES inspired epilogue is a satisfying cherry on the cake. Those expecting a sustained barrage of crass, crude, foul-mouthed, egocentric Hollywood mega-bloat like THIS IS THE END will probably feel short-changed. If, though, expectations are more for something developed with prominent consideration and care, thought, witty satire, good humour and a heart and soul whilst also including some decent thrills, action and suspense, THE WORLD'S END unconditionally delivers.",The World's End
182,JPfanatic93,"Wright, Pegg and Frost: a world comes to a close",8,1 December 2013,"The triumvirate of Wright, Pegg and Frost deliver their final aria (for now) with this conclusion of their 'Three Flavours Cornetto' trilogy, a threesome of films connected only by their own presence in front and behind the camera, the cameo appearance of the famous ice cream brand and the great fun and delightful British humor throughout. Whereas the previous installments (Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Hot Fuzz (2007)) addressed the horror and cop drama genres respectively, The World's End tackles science fiction, the creepy secretive alien invasion sort to be precise (think Invasion of the Body Snatchers, It Came from Outer Space and Day of the Triffids). Thankfully, it does so to the same hilarious effect their predecessors did. While he played a police sergeant in Hot Fuzz, a token of societal responsibility and virtue, Simon Pegg this time gets to play a character the complete opposite named Gary King, devoid of responsibility and virtue, who prefers to focus his life on drinking, doing drugs and other assorted hedonistic endeavors. Once the centre of a close group of childhood friends that largely revolved around him, he never left childhood, while his friends (Nick Frost, Martin 'Bilbo' Freeman, Paddy Considine and Eddie Marsan) grew up and embarked on an ordinary, mundane lifestyle with all the perks (family life, decent jobs) and downsides (boredom) that came with the territory. When Gary reemerges in their life after an absence of a decade, they soon find themselves drawn to revisiting their high school town, against all of their better judgment, in a second attempt to complete the epic pub crawl once left unfinished, all the way from the First Post to the World's End. Twelve pubs, sixty pints total (at the least!), five former comrades who have grown apart mostly because of Gary's never ending irresponsibility, one long night in store for all of them... Especially when they discover – in an epic, instant classic gents' bathroom brawl – their old town has become the center of an alien invasion that has slowly but surely replaced the village denizens with robots. Can these ""five musketeers"" halt this impending Apocalypse, armed only with beer, mutual dislike and an old car with the silly moniker 'the Beast'? More importantly, can Wright and co. deliver another comedy that is on an equal level with their duo of previous 'blood and ice cream' movies? The answer is an undeniable 'yes, they can'! The World's End is at least as witty, fast paced, catchy and thoroughly funny a film as its forebears, but also appropriately borders on melancholy as its creators make us realize they've grown up as actors/directors themselves, and this film in many ways is an end to their cinematically cohesive world they have caused us to come to love. Though there's bound to be more joined projects on their part somewhere in the future, in terms of subversive, all-English comedy poking fun at specific film genres, this is a definite conclusion and it feels as such throughout. It doesn't stop them, or us, from enjoying themselves as they continue to do what they did best so far once more, as The World's End is loaded with extremely snappy gags, great one-liners and excellent comedic timing from all involved. Wright again concretely illustrates the fact he has a cinematic style all his own, which is marked by fast dialogue, dynamic editing and visual and thematic parallelism, which underscores The World's End status as a part of a trilogy tonally if not narratively. And despite all the hilarity, there's room for a moral message that never gets overly preachy or in-your-face: you can walk a path between growing up and staying young without losing your identity to society's norms, if you stay loyal to your friends and family. But if you opt for downright immaturity, you might just find the world exploding in your face. In the case of The World's End, the latter is all the more enjoyable as the Cornetto trilogy comes to its grand close.",The World's End
183,FilmMuscle,"While not as enjoyable as the previous entries, it's still a fun ride nonetheless!",7,25 August 2013,"Here we are- at the finale of the ""Cornetto Trilogy."" Cue Simon Pegg responding with a shocked ""What?!"" I loved Shaun of the Dead and, especially, Hot Fuzz as both proved to be amazingly enjoyable films in their respective genres. Instead of the zombie comedy or the mystery thriller, The World's End takes the sci-fi approach, again showing us that Edgar Wright is fully capable of providing fresh experiences. Now, I can't be the only one tired of the horrible comedies that American audiences find funny for some apparent reason- Bridesmaids, Ted. Yeah, give me a break! Finally, a new brand of comedy arrives: British humor, which I find far more refreshing. Just like the first two, The World's End doesn't disappoint with its hilarity as Simon Pegg and Nick Frost bring their A-game once again, filling me up with ecstatic laughs every step of the way. Can I just say that I love Simon Pegg and hope he's inserted into more films in the future? He's basically one of the best comedians in the film industry right now (just putting it out there). Nick Frost is great as well and plays a completely different character this time around when compared to the earlier entries in the series. This time, he's the modest ass- kicker, and Simon Pegg is the loud-mouthed asshole. No, but seriously, as much as people claim that the main character is fairly unlikable, these personalities, on top of the multiple others- their friends (played by Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Eddie Marsan)-, create an incredibly enjoyable ride, fueled by wild fun. It all starts with Gary King (Simon Pegg) trying to convince his fellow friends to join him on the ""golden path"" to finally advance through all twelve pubs after failing in their teenage years. Once they all agree to embark on such a journey, things start getting wacky as the village of these pubs feels a littledifferent. Anyways, I had plenty of fun witnessing these friends insult each other, fill themselves up with beer, and take on mysterious foes. On top of that, as usual as it is with Edgar Wright films, The World's End has terrific editing and sound effects with fast-paced cutting of camera shots and the loud, immersive sound of the mugs being filled up with booze. During its action sequences, the camera wonderfully captures the pace and intensity of the fights. I mean, let's just give a hand of applause to the amazing choreography of those scenes. It literally looks like the actors are dancing all while delivering brutal shots at each other, and that's a good thing if you're asking. In fact, a lot of the comedy comes from the way these characters engage their formidable enemies with sweet shots to the balls and having heads brutalized through sinks (it's really less violent than it sounds). All while these chaotic events are transpiring and turning into something worse, for the first time in the series, some particularly touching themes are introduced, such as the unfortunate evolution from individuals' youthful years to their adult/aging times. This definitely led me to quite a bit of sadness all while commemorating the final entry in the series since we'll probably never discover such spectacular comedies with such spectacularly comedic actors ever again. With that being said, as much as I enjoyed The World's End, it unfortunately never lived up to the satisfaction I received from the first two installments, but then again, this is all a matter of opinion and pure preference. I already expected slight disappointment since I'm a much bigger fan of thrillers and mysteries than I am of sci-fi flicks. This movie's second half delved deeper and even deeper into the sci-fi realm where aliens and robots became more prominent. Yeah, I just wasn't a big fan of all that content because I simply don't find it as appealing as attempting to solve a complex mystery in a strange town. In addition, the ending seemed to drag on for far too long as was the issue I had with Hot Fuzz's unnecessary ending. The apocalyptic action towards the remainder of the film proved to be less fun than Hot Fuzz's last act even though there were a few bits that still cracked me up. Another feeling I possessed through a considerable portion of the film was that of its slightly repetitive nature. Unlike the unpredictability of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz where the audience had no idea what settings and events lay ahead of its characters, during The World's End, the moviegoer already knows that these characters will be progressing from one pub to the next until they finally reach the final one, which I'm sure you can guess is where the climax of the story occurs. While the journey was absolutely amusing, the sense of repetition still existed. Overall, The World's End is definitely one of the best, if not the best, comedies of the year and definitely one of the better films, especially in the summer- yes, it's better than This is the End. The film does a fine job of mixing charming humor with great action and exceptional fun. If you're looking for something new that isn't your average superhero or action blockbuster, The World's End is certainly a hilarious thrill!",The World's End
184,ssvfolder-1,Didn't get the hype,6,28 September 2013,"I must confess with personal affection towards British comedians in Hollywood movies. In my opinion Simon Pegg (who broke into mainstream long ago), Nick Frost (His partner in crime), and the newest hobbit - Martin Freeman are simply incredible, I love seeing all of them, wherever they act, so I was looking forward for this one... and got a bit disappointed. There are some funny monologues, but the roles were a bit off - especially Simon's. I just can't really receive him as a funny-cool leader of the gang that is locked on his own mission, so that felt a bit wrong. Another thing is the plot - could have been better. The ending simply isn't good enough. In conclusion, worth to watch if you really have nothing else to do.",The World's End
185,IndustriousAngel,"Funny, witty, and some feeling too!",8,16 September 2013,"We had a blast with ""The World's End"" last night - it's not wholly, but nearly on the level of Hot Fuzz, with some outstanding performances, a lot of wit and feeling too, and of course good timing and beautiful music for an oldtimer like me. The ""message"" - if you care for such things - is about the same as before: Those quaint little English towns are just a little too perfect to be true (didn't we know it?).Pegg and Frost are irresistible anyway, even if they're playing out of their usual ""comfort zone"" here - which is actually a good thing, two very good performances! But here they're just part of the fun. Pierce Brosnan makes for a ""villain"" nearly as likable as Timothy Dalton, Freeman is nice as always, Pike and Considine have good chemistry, but it's Eddie Marsan whom I liked best - between this and ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" he's having a good year and I hope he'll get some bigger roles in the future - he's such a fine actor he's really wasted on Lestrade or similar side characters. We'll definitely rewatch this soon - recommended!",The World's End
186,The_Dead_See,Not as good as Shaun or Hot Fuzz but still good fun.,6,23 August 2013,"The wife and I just walked out of The World's End a tad disappointed. The previous two films in the Cornetto trilogy had set such a high bar. They were two of the tightest screenplays in recent memory, with satisfying character arcs and a lot of careful thought woven in amongst the humor. In hindsight it was probably too much to ask for that The World's End live up to such standards for a third time, but we hoped anyway...The World's End does have a lot of good things going for it. The rapid fire humor is still there and funny as ever. The special effects are stunning. The fight scenes are where TWE really comes alive, with just enough kinetic energy that you feel involved but not so much shaky cam that you can't tell what's going on. Nick Frost is a surprisingly convincing fighter - clearly enjoying his Jackie Chan style choreography. (I'd like to see Wright turn his talents towards a serious action movie sometime in the future. I'm betting he'd turn out a very solid piece.)The choice to switch the loser and serious roles between Pegg and Frost is interesting but ultimately loses something for the movie. Pegg makes a good loser, but maybe a little too good. Frost can play loser while still adding something lovable into it but that's mostly missing from Pegg's character in TWE. He evokes distress and sympathy but never hits the lovable nature of Ed or Danny in the previous films. Paddy Considine is woefully underused. I was hoping he'd get a bigger part in this movie than the others, and in a way he does but he's still a distant third to Pegg and Frost and not really allowed to shine in his unique way.I also missed the gore. Not that a film needs gratuitous gore but the first two movies set a precedent for some great bloodletting and this one is completely bloodless. I can't help but think that a little grue would have added some edge to it all. Speaking of edge, the antagonists in both the previous movies definitely come across as more sinister and dangerous than the robots in TWE, which ultimately don't have a completely sinister intention and come apart like Barbie dolls. In Shaun and Hot Fuzz I felt like the characters were in genuine danger, but in TWE I didn't get that same sense of investment in their safety. The biggest let down though, was the tightness of the script. I've come to expect a screenplays from this team to be not only rock solid but also extremely clever. Think of how many tiny seeds were laid throughout both Shaun and Hot Fuzz that came to fruition later in the movies. And at the end of both films the arcs completed and things came back around to a sensible and satisfying bookend. TWE *almost* succeeds in all of this but never quite gets to the heights the other two did. Eh, too much griping though. It was still a lot of fun and it still had the signature style of the Cornetto Trilogy. I think I might well enjoy it more second time round now I know what to expect. If you go into it not expecting quite as much greatness as the previous two films, you'll likely have a good time with it. 6/10.",The World's End
187,MUFCOK,A film of two halves,6,22 September 2014,"Simon Pegg & Nick Frost films usually seem to do a very good job of dividing opinions, they seem to be a case of love or hate. For me, I have enjoyed their previous movies: Shaun of the Dead was fantastic, Hot Fuzz was very enjoyable and Paul – the weakest of the three – was still a decent comedy. I was aware of the concept of ""the World's End"" and I wasn't too eager to see it. I left it a year or so and finally watched it on Sky Movies this weekend. The director, Edgar Wright, who directed Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz returns to link up with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost again to direct The World's End. I do like his style and when watching it, it is clear that it is the same director.The movie starts with Simon Pegg's character during a group counselling scene, talking through a time when he was a teenager. The scene shows the 5 lads as teenagers attempting to complete a pub crawl, which covers 12 pubs. They fail to complete the crawl and pack it in at the 10th pub. A woman suggests that to get 'closure' he could try and complete the crawl with his mates – 20 years later. There you have it – the film is set up and ready to go.The film starts very strongly, the scenes when they are sat around drinking, talking about nonsense are very entertaining. It had a real light hearted, feel good feel to it and I was surprised how enjoyable it was when I was watching it. Simon Pegg's character surprisingly grows on you throughout the movie. He is a tragic, depressed, self-absorbed alcoholic with fantastic wit and perfectly timed one-liners. He is a character you certainly love to hate.There are certain aspects of this movie though which I have problems with. It feels far too similar to Shaun of the dead. Change Zombies for Aliens & change one pub for twelve pubs. The 'action' scenes are far too long winded and over the top. The problem was that the action scenes suffered from pointless, almost effortless fighting. Swarms of aliens/robots would fight 5 drunken men and the men would just defeat them with ease. You never felt that they were in any real danger, therefor not really letting the viewer connect with them in any sort of way.What made Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and the first 45 minutes of this film so special was the script. The witty, black comedy is hilarious. Another big hit in the films is the chemistry between Pegg, Frost and all the supporting actors. As I have said, the first half of the film does this perfectly and also scenes throughout the second half are good, there are just few and far between. The final scene leaves a lot to be desired and makes you feel like they really rushed it and pretty much gave up.Overall I did find it entertaining but ultimately frustrating as it really could have been so much better. Worth a watch if you are a fan of the previous two films but don't expect anything near as uplifting. 6/10",The World's End
188,Michael-Hallows-Eve,Just as good as 'SHAUN OF THE DEAD' and 'HOT FUZZ'.,8,28 July 2013,"This is the third movie in the ""Cornetto"" series of films by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Its about five childhood friends that go back to the town they lived in over 20 years ago to complete a pub crawl they never finished while living there. But things have changed in the town, and things don't go to plan for them. I loved the first two movies, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, so I was looking forward to this ever since I heard about it last year. I wasn't disappointed either. It had the same humor, the same chemistry with the characters, and the same ""far out"" story - which these guys have perfected. I laughed out loud while watching this film, and so did most of the audience watching it on the day I was there. If you haven't seen the trailer or if you don't know what this movie is about, then I won't ruin it for you. Lets just say you aren't expecting what happens. But in true Pegg and Frost fashion the movie has an underlying story which you find yourself caring about more than you think you would. And I liked the end to this movie too, wasn't expecting it to finish how it did. It is a great comedy/horror as usual for them, and I will see it again. It will be a cult movie like the other two are in the future. I give it an 8.5 out of 10. Recommended.",The World's End

What could go wrong with that? Unfortunately, everything. This movie has it all – good guys, bad guys, mystery, twists, music, laughter. You'd think with this all going for it, this would be a phenomenal film, wouldn't you? Truth? It wasn't bad. In fact there were some laugh out loud moments. It was better than Hot Fuzz, not as good as Shaun of the Dead. I suppose this will be part of a cult trio eventually that will result in marathon watchings. Without giving anything away, however, I will say that the very end left me disappointed. It was as if the writers ran out of creativity and ideas, leaving one of the characters with a pretty lame finale. Granted, a movie like this isn't meant to make a whole lot of sense, but in a weird way it did, so his fate just didn't feel right. Might have been some goofy idea that jumped out at someone and they grabbed it like rope lowered to haul them out of a hole. Well, you'll know it when you see it and you can decide for yourself.

Things are weird though and soon they find out its been taken over by aliens. The concept sounds pretty dumb but it's hilarious and the 5 main characters are all very good.The action scenes are also very well choreographed and that was a pleasant surprise.

191,jburtroald95,Fuzzy Shaun and Paul's Hot Dead End of the World,6,22 December 2013,"The World's End marks the fourth time that Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright have delivered an endearing comedic story about a handful of flawed but likable characters dealing with mundane problems who are plunged into unexpected, otherworldly, life-threatening situations. Unfortunately, this screwball comedy also marks the first time that most of us are likely to really notice the narrative similarities between the darkly witty Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Hot Fuzz (2007) and the equally exciting but less popular Paul (2011) in which Greg Mottola took on Wright's role as director. That said, the realistic character complications of Pegg and Frost's script are still distinctive enough and manage a level of poignancy that lies somewhere in between Hot Fuzz and Shaun in terms of sincerity. We begin our story by following the pitiable folly of the irreverent Gary King (Pegg), an adolescent in the body of a middle-aged man who hopes to reunite his old gang of boyhood friends for a second chance at pub-crawl that they tried and failed to complete in their youth. Gary gradually manages to drag his old buddies out of their stable, mature private and occupational lives – under a false pretence created to attract their sympathy – and throws them into his cavalier lifestyle that remains unchanged from the nostalgic revelry of his youth. The stark realities of the swift passage of time, and the people and places that time can leave behind at the mercy of modern progress and cynicism, are displayed bluntly without cloying sentimentality and with pleasingly sharp wit. Pegg is clearly enjoying himself playing the plainly ridiculous Gary who is both easy to loathe and easy to love and pity. We know that the amoral buffoon simply doesn't know any better, and this is something that the other characters soon come to realise as well. Gary's closest friend, Andy (Frost) is continually giving him chances but slowly learns that Gary is unlikely to change in a world that has no qualms at all about changing. Frost, in his turn to play the straight man while Pegg plays the comic goof, is as convincing as Pegg was in Hot Fuzz and it is quite impressive to see how easily the two of them can swap roles within the archetypal clown duo. The other characters who are trying to make it to the last pub, the evocatively title The Word's End, range from the straight-talking, dryly witty Martin Freeman, who more or less plays himself, to shy, gentle, soft-faced Peter (an adorable Eddie Marsan).After a fairly generous amount of time spent alone with our main characters, our fantastical subplot arrives and tries to wrap itself rather awkwardly around the human story. While, to the movie's credit, the entrance of our otherworldly antagonists is as much a genuine surprise as the introduction of time travel to Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris, I didn't find myself getting quite as excited or amazed by these particular creations as Pegg and Frost seemed to be. It is with them that the creative team's wonderful recipe for success starts to feel like a formula, especially since they are a cross between the epidemical, gleefully gored zombies from Shaun and the morally superior, ethically corrupt town council from Hot Fuzz, with a sci-fi element slightly akin to the Paul thrown in as well. Unlike the hooded killers from Hot Fuzz, the ferocious zombies from Shaun or the merciless men (and woman) in black from Paul, these latest bad guys simply aren't scary enough to offset the screwball humour. Without a freshly thrilling sense of danger, the energetic jokes, which also feel somewhat tired this time round, are comic relief with nothing to relieve us from. Many audiences felt that the poignant personal story of middle age was disappointingly underdeveloped and prematurely diverted from. I know the routine by now and so I was never expecting the character's personal lives to be the sole focus of the movie. Personally, I felt that I was instead robbed of a satisfying climax, given the riveting third acts of the team's previous three films. Their latest creation makes its way towards a disorderly anticlimax and a decidedly clichéd conclusion, neither of which the underwritten comedy could justify.Perhaps it was inevitable that one of these uses of the seemingly infallible recipe would fall slightly flat. Nevertheless, there are quite a few laughs to be had, Pegg and Frost's acting efforts are much more effective than their scripting, and I was somewhat enthused by the unearthly villains of the piece, just not nearly as much as I was expected to be. Other fans of the movie's creators might be similarly disappointed with their latest offering, but new audiences may be perfectly well entertained by it.",The World's End

193,themissingpatient,Proper Use of Lens Flares & Excellent Fight Sequences,9,18 November 2013,"Simon Pegg is Gary King, a sad, boorish 40 year old alcoholic who drags his high school friends back to their home town to try to finish a pub crawl that they were unsuccessful at 20 years before. Gary's friends include Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan and Nick Frost as Oliver, Steven, Peter and Andy. Much tension has built between Gary and his friends, most notably with Andy, over the years. But their personal drama and pub crawl are interrupted by blue-blooded androids that have taken over the small town.Edgar Wright is a powerful force to be reckoned with as a director. Somehow, despite all the fun special effects and comedy, he is gifted with a unique ability to not let it take away from the emotional core of the story. His last film, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, proved this. He could be considered a super director, as if he fused the directorial talents of Sam Raimi and Danny Boyle with a sense of humor derived from Terry Gilliam and Adam McKay.The World's End is the third installment of the Cornetto trilogy (or Blood and Ice Cream trilogy, as it's know in the US), which also includes Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz. All three films are directed by Wright and co-written with Simon Pegg, who always stars along side Nick Frost and other familiar faces. Unlike the first two films in the trilogy, The World's End is a much more mature film. In fact, the film didn't need the android invasion. It could have just continued on as a dramatic comedy with a very real, emotional plot twist at the end and it still would have been a great film. However, being the super director that Wright is, he is able to balance the dramatic comedy with a sci-fi action thriller all in a single film.Some audiences will be displeased with The World's End, wishing it had more action, as it doesn't deliver as much bloody violence as Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz did. It also lacks in both the shocks and laughs that we've come to expect thanks to the first two film in the trilogy. The ending is also somewhat anti-climatic but it is suitable for the ending of a trilogy.Overall, The World's End is still a great film. It may not live up to the excellence of the previous films but on it's own, The World's End is better than any other big budget, high-concept film in recent years. Other directors should be taking notes and learning from Edgar Wright. The World's End contains proper, effective use of lens flares and some of the best directed fight-sequences put to the big screen in the last decade.",The World's End
194,Lomedin,These guys always do the same,4,4 December 2013,"This movie brought back good memories of my times of pub hitting and nights out and it seemed alright until, in fact, when the supposedly ""cool"" fiction stuff starts to happen. Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and even Edgar Wright always do the same, same type of films, same type of action, same type of jokes. At least, when they get together. Perhaps this one in particular is not so bad as, let's say, shawn of the dead, but still.The movie gets worse the closer the ending is, although I'll admit that I liked the final critique to the human race.Anyway, another overrated one (c'mon, bring the ""your review was not helpful"", kiddies).",The World's End
195,drew_atreides,Pegg and Wright can do no wrong!,9,29 August 2013,"...before Shaun of the Dead, i had no idea who Simon Pegg, Nick Frost or Edgar Wright were..After ""Hot Fuzz"" i still really had no idea who Edgar Wright was.After ""PAUL"" and ""SCOTT PILGRIM Vs. THE WORLD"" i FINALLY knew who Edgar Wright was...More specifically, the lack of Wright on PAUL (still a decent film, but not anywhere near the other Pegg-Frost entries) and the level of awesome that SCOTT PILGRIM had, i realized how critical Wright was to the entire Pegg-Frost experience.It was SO nice having the trio re-united for ""THE WORLD'S END"". What a tremendously witty, imaginative flick.The most incredible part about this film is that it actually deals with some heavy hitting, emotional subject matter AND it actually manages to have a fairly positive commentary on the human condition.Only Pegg and Wright could mix this recipe into such an astute and entertaining elixir. Good job, boys!",The World's End
196,Mike_Noga,"If you haven't seen the movie yet, stop reading the reviews!",9,23 August 2013,"I've missed out on some fun because I knew too much about a movie before seeing it. So I've made it a point to avoid all the reviews and movie news about films until after I see them. I went into this one knowing only that it starred Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and Wow, at a certain point, this movie blew the top of my head off. If you don't know what to expect there is a twist( and that's putting it very lightly) that you'll never see coming. So from here on in Here Be Spoilers!For the rest of you, who I assume have seen the film, WHAT A BLAST! Oh man, when Gary got in a fight with that teen and the kid's head shattered in a spray of blue ink! Holy Cuh-Rap! From the first half hour or so I thought I was in for something like Wild Hogs, except, you know good. I figured the boys were making a comparatively relaxed comedy about reaching middle age and not attaining your dreams blah, blah, blah. Not too bad but nothing to write home about either. Then they dropped the bomb and all bets were off. What a ride! It was a comedy, but it also had some pretty effective thriller moments. And there was some social commentary, which I figured they borrowed from Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but the movie doesn't bog down in it, not for a second. The comedy, the suspense, the commentary, it's really well balanced. I really appreciated that the creators never forgot, and never let the audience forget, that this movie is primarily a comedy. It has laughs galore. There are multiple little jokes crammed inside of bigger jokes. This is the comedy version of the famous Russian nesting dolls. Might I also add that I've never seen beer filmed so lovingly before. Each pint that Gary drinks looks like the Platonic Idea of A Pint. Seriously, when I left the theater I wanted only two things. To talk about the movie with my friends, reliving the laughs, and to hit 12 pubs for 12 pints, the beer looked that good. As P.G. Wodehouse might have put it, I required a strengthening tonic.Actually there was one other urge I felt after leaving the theater, an intense craving for a Marmalade Sandwich.Smart, exciting, at times gut-wrenchingly hilarious, this is the kind of movie that makes you leave the theater on a pure movie high.",The World's End
197,WasiReviews,A Lot of Fun Even for a Teetotaler Like me,9,21 March 2021,"In case you're wondering what a teetotaler is it means I avoid alcoholic beverages like the plague. Let's get something straight before you get into this movie, no; Edgar Wright did not have a 200 million dollar budget to create some kind of Independence Day blockbuster (God I wish they would give him 300 million to make a blockbuster action film). So when you see the aliens don't expect little green men with cool exo-suits, although the way Edgar makes the Aliens fit into the plot was incredible. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost brought their natural charm and friendship for the third (and possibly final) time. You can tell that despite The World's End not having a 200 million super-budget blockbuster it still manages to hire an impressive cast featuring Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan, and Pierce Brosnan (in his second film of the trilogy). They fitted Rosamund Pike (from Gone Girl) well into this film. Some people argue that this is the worst of the trilogy and I agree, however in terms of entertainment this is a solid A. Without spoiling anything the ending is arguably the best of the trilogy I can't wait to see the rest of Edgar's filmography as a director.",The World's End

After ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" there was no doubt in my mind that this was going to be a good film. The question was if it was going to be as good as the previous two. Unfortunately in my opinion it falls short, but in no way does that cloud the fact that it was a fun film.The Star of the show was Simon Pegg. You get this feeling - because of how real ""The King"" comes across - that this is how Mr Pegg would be on a night out on the town. And i for one was rather envious that i wasn't participating in the Golden Mile. Everyone else played their parts well and it made for a really good film. Wasn't the best comedy I've ever seen but i do recommend it.",The World's End
199,CriticalOfEverything,"Surreal, funny and bat***t insane.",7,23 March 2018,"This is definitely the weirdest movie in Simon and Edgar's trilogy and it's also the weakest. But, it's in no way a bad movie. It's very funny, has decent action scenes, a great cast and Simon and Nick's great chemistry. This movie is definitely weird though. It goes from a casual comedy about replicating a pub crawl to ALIEN INVASION. Yes, aliens have take over the town and they have to keep doing their pub crawl to make sure they don't notice that they know what's up. It's weirder than Shaun Of The Dead, for sure, but probably because we've never seen an alien invasion story using this sort of plot before. We've all seen zombie stories before so that's probably why it's weirder. Anyways, it's a good movie and a great way to end the trilogy.",The World's End
200,StonedMagician,Excellent: 9.5,9,27 July 2019,"After seven years, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have returned to finish the Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy. Starting in 2004 with Shaun of the Dead and continuing with 2006's Hot Fuzz, the beloved series has finally come full circle. But was the wait worth it? In short, yes. Like its predecessors, The World's End is gleefully violent, distinctly British, and thoroughly entertaining. The film follows five friends who choose to retry a pub crawl they attempted two decades prior, only to find the town they come back to infested by robots. What follows is a disarmingly emotional and funny film whose writing puts any modern American ""comedy"" to shame. The chemistry between the large number of cast members really sells the idea that they have been friends for thirty-plus years. The result of all this is a film that starts out hilarious, before taking a darker turn in the middle, and concluding in a spectacular fashion - and never slows down. I left the theater immensely satisfied - and with the thought that I might have seen the best film of the summer.",The World's End
201,YJLcool,A decent British sci-fi action drama comedy film to watch,7,8 September 2013,"As the final installment of the so-called The Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and now the World's End - Each film in the trilogy is connected to a Cornetto ice cream, with a Cornetto of the appropriate flavour to the theme of the film appears), it's not the typical Hollywood American sci-fi action drama comedy film (It's a British film). The comedic elements presented in the film is quite different, which highlights the English-American divide in comedic sensibilities. It lingers more on the characters' conversations and interactions to provide the comedy or jokes.Although it's not advisable to watch the trailer as it spoiled the unexpected twist in this film, but I guess most people would have done it anyway by now.The story is about a group of childhood friends in their 40s: a hopeless, jobless drinker/drug addict(Gary), a real estate agent (Oliver), an architect (Steven), a lawyer (Andrew) and a car-seller(Peter) - who decided to reunite together and return to their hometown, Newton Haven, to complete the unfinished Golden Mile of 12 pubs to drink 60 pints of beer (for 5 guys) when they're young.What ensues is an unexpected plot twist that re-examines each character's past, rekindle severed friendships/relationships and possibly, save the world.It's quite refreshing and admirable to see that there's considerable effort being put by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright to not follow the normal successful formula that normally comes with this genre.There's also an interesting theme to think about in The World's End - to have the choice of being free as a human, to be able to do what you want, despite the human imperfection in the world.But, the running gag involving garden fences, the pub brawl action and chasing scenes are quite similar to the past films.The finale presented near the end of the film feels unsatisfying as it ends abruptly without a good resolution to some of the characters.Nevertheless, it's still a decent, enjoyable character story that's worth a watch.Rating: 7.5/10 http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/09/movie-review-worlds-end.html",The World's End
202,Franklie,They keep getting worse! Where's the old Simon?,1,30 May 2014,"It is hard to believe that the same minds who wrote such clever stories as Spaced and Shawn of the Dead could also write The World's End. It was SO slow and boring! And there was hardly any wittiness about it. Instead of fun perceptive vocabulary, we are bombarded with one mundane foul word after another, actually, is mostly the same one over and over. Really? Simon Pegg and company are SO smart, why do they lean more and more to the mainstream banal crudeness? They're better than that. We know they are. We've seen it. We've heard it. And the storyline this time was very very flat and moved at a snail's pace. Usually they have characters that we care about and back stories that add flavor and the action clicks along. The World's End came out flat flat flat. Maybe Simon is slowly being taken over, movie by movie, by robots.",The World's End

A bit of poignancy in that, one of the lads, talks about how he was bullied when he was younger by the lad who came over to ask for the seat. It went really through him. So when Gary goes to the gents, he encounters very strange behavior in that the crowd that ""he couldn't recongise"" all attempt to attack the musketeers.The ppl are all looking at the guys very strangely.

When they arrive, the towns people don't recognise em, and hence when the action begins. As it happens, the townspeople have been converted to Robots. Some have specified that Robots are ""slaves""Overall the film was fantastic. At first I was a bit apprehensive at first. In that I thought it'd only be just about drinking and getting drunk. Then at about a half hour into the film, it started to get excited. You'd have to feel for the Gary character as he's an alcoholic. But you'd have to admire him for one thing.

204,cleary-joshua,How to complete a trilogy...,9,5 March 2015,"How do you complete a trilogy that contains two of the best-loved and funniest British comedies of recent years? This is what Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg must have been asking themselves when writing ""The World's End"", very aware that everyone would be comparing it to ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". I think it's no wonder that the film polarised people, most of whom expected it to be very similar to the previous films. Sure, it does share ideas with the other two, but it manages to feel very original at the same time, covering a lot of new ground. And most importantly, it's a consistently funny parody of science fiction, lead by a brilliant set of performances.Simon Pegg plays Gary King, a man who never grew up, still trying to live out his teenage dream of completing the ""Golden Mile"" pub crawl in his home town. The four friends with whom he once attempted the challenge have all moved on from that life, going into suit- wearing professions and ending up on very different paths to the one Gary has chosen. But Gary is determined to finish the Mile, so brings the other four back together to complete it once and for all – however, as is expected from a Pegg/Wright comedy, not everything goes to plan.The film manages to convey the eerie sense of returning to a once-familiar place, seeing how much has stayed the same, and also making a point about the bizarre nature of modern life – all the pubs are owned by chains and look the same, ""youths"" are patrolling the streets, technology is now everywhere. We get through four pubs, and you can see the reluctance of everyone but Gary, who is convinced that he's some kind of local hero. We discover more and more about why the group separated, what Gary did and how he's ended up like he is, and behind all of the jokes, it's a really interesting character study. And then the tone changes with a fight scene in the toilets of pub 4, when we discover the reason why the town is like it is – androids.While ""Shaun of the Dead"" was very obviously a zombie film, and was explicitly marketed as such, I don't know if ""The World's End"" made its secrets so obvious, so the scene when we suddenly discover that the film is now sci-fi does come as a bit of a shock. Such an enormous change of tone could have been the end of the film, but thankfully it keeps at its heart the most important thing – comedy. The ending is unexpected and tends towards preachy at times, but it never, ever stops being funny.Wright's style should now be familiar to his fans, and is in full swing here – at times his methods seem a bit like a dark Wes Anderson, but he knows how to make them distinctive and original. The performances at the centre of the film work perfectly, with each of the main 5 characters providing great on-screen chemistry with each other, not to mention a great performance from Rosamund Pike. Obviously, Pegg and Frost steal the show, adding a slight twist to the relationship that we've seen between the two actors in the past. What makes ""The World's End"" so brilliant and fun is that it's nuanced and subtle underneath all of the broad comedy. It slips in clever references that you'll want to look out for, and is rewarding for both long term fans of the filmmakers, and viewers with no previous experience.",The World's End
205,Alex_Hodgkinson,Favourite Cornetto Film!,9,18 August 2013,"Easily the best Cornetto film in my opinion! They just got better as they went along, Shaun of the Dead was excellent, but somehow topped by Hot Fuzz and now topped by this! This is my favourite film of the year by far! The film has great character development in each character, a rather good story (not excellent, but better than many others...) and it somehow manages to still be absolutely hilarious! I loved it so much that I watched it twice at the cinema, something I have never done before now! If you enjoyed any or both of the previous Cornetto films you'll definitely enjoy this one! I don't know how they did it, but Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg managed to make three films that are not connected, but feel connected, and are all as funny as each other with brilliant plot lines chucked in!The only part I felt uncomfortable with is the ending, which feels over the top and silly. But I think that bit is just a parody of end of the world films, just like the ending of Hot Fuzz is kind of like a parody on police films. That's the one thing I wasn't too keen on. Nothing else. Kind of says something, doesn't it?Gary King is definitely the king and is now one of my favourite characters! This film is a hit that finishes the amazing Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy...",The World's End
206,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - The World's End,7,1 December 2013,"First I would like to address this film as a third installment in a trilogy: the Cornetto trilogy is a trilogy in name only. As far as I can see, the chief link between Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End is Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Edgar Wright and the fact that they are all stories about friendships between men. There's nothing in The World's End's story or theme that forces any finality or closure.The core story between the five friends dealing with being forty was compelling and heartfelt. It's nice seeing Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman and Eddie Marsan play bigger roles in a commercial film and a fresh turn seeing Nick Frost playing the most competent character. The story with Simon Pegg's Gary King is genuinely the darkest and saddest territory these films have ever ventured.When the genre stuff kicks in, it was quite the surprise. The first time around I couldn't tell how exactly the core story about the five friends fit with the sci-fi genre elements that cut in the middle. The film simply operates too much on a thematic level. For example, the fact that the twelve bars they visit are all thematically named after points in the story seemed more on the nose than ironical. The humor itself is less blatant than in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz; it's more akin to laughing at the thematic irony of the situation rather than laughing at funny zingers. It is all very clever stuff, but it may take multiple viewings to really digest its heavy ideas along with its spectacle. I had to watch it again before writing this review.Now admittedly, out of all the three films, I knew least about the films that The World's End is referencing. Audiences familiar with Invasion of the Body Snatchers and John Carpenter films will probably have a different experience than me. But at the end of day, science fiction or not, watching five men on a pub crawl just isn't as cinematic as a zombie outbreak or a midday gun battle.The fight choreography, although they are drunk bar fights, have a nice martial arts rhythm to them. It seemingly is an aesthetic Wright has brought from Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. They were visually theatrical and matched the film's ironic tone.I take issue with the epilogue as the story ended on a rather cold morbid note that seemed mean to its characters. If only The World's End was the second installment in the Cornetto trilogy, it would have relieved itself from following up on the more comical light-hearted expectations from Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, I probably would have liked it more as the darker second installment of the trilogy. That said, it's dense and the film probably will grow on me with subsequent viewings.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",The World's End
207,dregj,A Good Simon Pegg Film? must be the end of the world,8,25 June 2014,"The movie is very funny from start to finish. Pegg plays a incredibly selfish loser from the start but still manages to make him a sympathetic character. It even manages to mix moments of emotional drama with comedy not an easy task.Its a film about growing up and the ramifications about holding onto youth ,and is the first grown up movie pegg has ever done.Far too dark for the normal cornetto morons,who apparently hated it,probably hated watching a movie that wasn't just prat falls and tomfoolery .Pegg may finally have turned a corner with this movie its good to have him actually being funny again",The World's End
208,byrann_gowan,Total annihilation,8,1 September 2018,"The Golden Mile. A quest that only the bravest, most noblest souls can endure. It is a quest that entails drinking a pint of beer at 12 pubs, ending in the fabled Worlds End. It's a quest that Gary King (played by Simon Pegg) has wanted to accomplish since the night they finished High School and attempted to conquer it, but couldn't. 20 years later, he decides to bring the gang back together in order to finish what they had started. Old wounds come out and the friends star to question why they are doing the pub, but it's the least of their worries. Something is completely wrong with the town and the boys have to decide: should they run and hide or finish the quest and save the world?I remember on the old Siskel and Ebert show that when they were reviewing Ghostbusters, the movie combined two genres that usually did not work: Sci-Fi and Comedy. Not that this movie is as good as Ghostbusters, but it is safe to say that The World's End pulls off a similar feat. In a way, the plot is actually kind of similar to Ghostbusters, in that a group of friends get together and try to defeat evil forces that are not from this world. Director Edgar Wright, who has been with these guys since Shaun of the Dead, knows his way around a comedy; in his Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy, he aptly blends comedy with another genre for each film - horror (Shaun of the Dead), Action (Hot Fuzz) and sci-fi (this one) - and he does it brilliantly.Also the characters in this film are extremely hilarious. Once again, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost prove that they are the Abbott and Costello of this generation. They play off of each other hilariously, and they very clearly love working together. Rounding out the films main cast is Golden Globe Nominee Martin Freeman, BAFTA Film Award Winner Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan, and Academy Award Nominee Rosamund Pike. Needless to say, every single one of these actors delivered hilarious lines and I for one enjoyed my time with them.All in all, go and watch this film! A great film!",The World's End
209,velvoofell,Stand By Men,8,19 July 2013,"Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have yet again concocted a movie comedy drawn from both's immersing roots in observational ""geek"" comedy and sci-fi-fantasy tropes. The so-called ""blood and ice-cream"" (jokes about gore and cornettos, the UK's uniquely homely ice-cream cornets) cycle, as well as their landmark TV show 'Spaced' have invariably included exploration of interpersonal man-boy issues born of Pegg, Frost and Wright's generational joys and trials. Married to horror, action or sci-fi plots, the movies took the work of Kevin Smith one step further, in a way the technical handicaps of Smith could never do, mounting the real world geek trials amid deft Hollywood spoof.'The World's End' sees Pegg as the mysterious Gary King, the former teen alpha of a group of geeks and misfits who has mythologised his crew's half-completed 1990 end-of-school-last-night of drink and drugs pub crawl to become an unfinished, near Homeric, quest. Rounding up his gang after more than twenty years, the manic (and, as we discover, manically depressed alcoholic) King returns to Newton Haven where a local old conspiracy theorist's prophecy of alien takeover of the town becomes an apparent reality.Where Pegg's protagonists - in his and Wright's previous films - have been an emasculated couch potato (Shaun of the Dead) and workaholic superman (Nicholas Angel in Hot Fuzz) Gary King is like a pub-dwelling pied piper, a nice version of Jack Torrance in Kubrick's 'The Shining'; an avuncular version of Ledger's 'Joker'. While his friends joined the ranks of professionals and home-makers, Gary remained the eternally partying Pied Piper he had been in his late teens. His mental illness almost provides a plot twist that could have been sobering - but there is no ""it was all a dream - you're still in a ward"" ending. Determined to complete his quest of a pint of lager in every one of the town's numerous pubs, regardless of riotous fights amid invincible robots posing as humans, King leads his reluctant crew, ultimately forcing his teetotal friend Andy (a kinetic and career-best Frost) to become his drinking buddy-cum-bodyguard and fellow (sort of) saviour of Earth. Rather, there is a near Douglas-Adams-with-tourettes finale which also, rather too quickly, gives a peek at a potential sequel-spawning adventure. The plot, ultimately, is less engrossing than that of previous Pegg/Wright efforts. Their first was a (very successful) Hollywood calling-card. Their second a technical firework display showcasing Wright's comic and action credentials. Here, the joy is in reveling in Pegg and Wright's repertory of masterful acting chums and repertoire of dramatic and comedic trick box. A lesson to fans about the need for reality checks on fantasy-obsessed lives but a love letter to the unique souls who embrace such lifestyles.The possible sequel implied by the closing scene might feed into an altogether better film but as a parting gift to Pegg and Wright fans, this is a delicious morsel.",The World's End

Shaun Of the Dead I saw about a month ago.Maybe it's because I had no idea where this was going and totally surprised me hut I loved this movie. It was hilarious. The chemistry between the characters was excellent. They really acted like they had known each other since youth.My only gripe is Simon Pegg's character gets irritating a few times but I'm sure that was the point.Such a good movie and I will be watching it again very soon.,The World's End
212,NicolasCostoglou,Close encounter of adulthood...,8,18 December 2016,"The third movie of the, so called, Cornetto-Trilogy now tackles, instead of Horror or Action, the Sci-Fi-Genre, and with very good results as expected.This film also deals with excepting adulthood, which is mirrored in the filmmaking itself, this one feels less energetic and fast paced in comparison to the previous two, which works well, but it's kinda disappointing for me personal...The cast is great as always, all the regulars are back and bring their characters to life expertly.The special effects and the look is also great as always, and the bar fights are amazing.Also the comedy timing is perfect, but that was also clear from the get-go...All in all a nice end to a great ""Trilogy""...",The World's End

Theses two perfect duos have perfect chemistry.Their's no one else better than them. Hand-clap for Simon and Nick for giving out a awesome performance once again.The World's End is comedy gold, Simon Pegg delivers a character so awesome he's very likable from the very beginning wearing a long black jacket with newly slick black hair making him a total hard-core dude. On the other hand, Nick Frost is priceless who really steps up stealing the show at some points. The other characters are marvelous not boring a little nor annoying either. All theses guys are trying to make to 12 pubs when their's so much chaos going on its ridiculous yet, hands down awesome. It totally works theses type of movies. Even the fights scenes are phenomenal way better than Hot Fuzz and Shaun. ""The World's End"" is a movie that's gonna make you laugh out of loud. It's equal as ""Hot Fuzz"" but a little tiny bit less than ""Shaun of the Dead. Although, this movie is definitely not disappointing at all. Everything in this movie is fresh and clean.

215,LordJiggy,"Fun movie, but they didn't know how to ""End"" it",5,9 September 2013,"Offbeat English comedy, which might best be described as ""British High School ReUnion meets End of the World movie.""The film had a nice inventive energy, with a cast we're already pre- disposed to like (Pegg, Frost, Freeman, and Pike), with other character actors (Paddy Considine and Eddie Marstand) whom we've previously seen as very unlikable characters being given a chance to show a softer, more appealing side.The film does take a little while to get going, comedically and plot- wise, revealing how much the friends have changed while their leader, Garry King (Pegg) continues to cling to his long-gone glory days.Once the ""World Ending"" problem is uncovered, the action/comedy really picks up, and many well-known SF films are given gentle homage, while there is some real poignant emotion revealed between the characters.Yet...once the film ""ends,"" there is a weird coda that seems strangely tacked on, which is very unsatisfying. I don't want to say more, lest I ruin it for someone, but it felt strangely self-indulgent, even amateurish. It left me deeply disappointed.",The World's End
216,DjfunkmasterG,Great Conclusion to the Cornetto Trilogy,8,7 September 2013,"It all started with a little Zombie movie called Shaun of the Dead, a romantic comedy with Zombies, then forwarded to a high octane British take on BAD BOYS, known as HOT FUZZ, and now comes full circle with a zombie-esqe, Invasion of the Body Snatchers meets Village of the Damned Sci-Fi flick known as, The World's End.If you became a fan of Shaun of the Dead, and followed the work of Pegg, Frost and Wright, you automatically should know the supposedly last film in the Cornetto trilogy would come full circle buy embracing elements of all the films, and The World's end does just that and more.When 5 friends get back together to re-take a pub crawl they were unsuccessful at completing 20 years earlier, at the behest of their sort of leader, rebel, burn out friend Gary, they get more than they bargained for when they return to their hometown of Newton Haven.While 4 of their friends have embraced adult hood, Gary, has lived the free lifestyle of partying and living life as close to the edge as possible, however, during a stint in rehab, and re-telling of their famous crawl tale, he is asked by one of the other patients if he regretted not finishing the crawl? Of course this sets off the idea to form a re-union, which turns into a surreal living nightmare when the 5 friends return home and find things aren't as they seem. A cosmic alien galaxy group known as the network is trying to civilize earth, which is described as the most self destructive, and uncivilized planet in the universe. Our 5 friends learn slowly how much has changed and the overall plan, and when they should bail, Gary insists they finish the pub crawl, hoping it keeps the NETWORK from learning that they know what is taking place. Do our 5 friends save the world from becoming slaves or do they free humankind so they are left to their own devices?One great thing with any Edgar Wright film is if you pay attention, you will learn the entire plot through dialog based foreshadowing, something famously done in Shaun of the Dead, and done in The World's End, with great fan fare.What I enjoyed about The World's End is that it took elements from the first two films and blended them together. Specifically with the residents of the town, which has zombie like tendencies, but are just known as blanks, robot replacements for the humans who didn't want to go along with the plan. The Blanks, as they're called, bring the viewer back to fond memories of Shaun of the Dead, and the re-programmed citizens found in Hot Fuzz.While The World's End is doesn't live up to the great first film, Shaun, it delivers and to this reviewer, entertains at a higher level than Hot Fuzz. Why you ask? because it brings back an emotional involvement in the characters I felt was lacking in Hot Fuzz. You connect with the 5 friends as you learn their history, you make a connection with each of them, where as in Hot Fuzz plays out much like a BAD BOYS film, all action no connection.Personally the Award for best comedic performance should go to Nick Frost. While he and Simon make a great team, you can see he just has the talent to carry the moment into fits of laugh out loud comedic antics that Pegg hasn't captured since Shaun.TWE, also introduces us to PUB-FU, a fighting style designed for the film based on the pub environment. Well shot and staged, the action sequences entertain and keep flowing at a great pace.I think everyone who loved the first two films will enjoy The World's End, and if you're not a fan of Hot Fuzz, like me, you will still love TWE as it has that Shaun Vibe wrapped up in its own story.I haven't been this entertained in theaters since IRON MAN 3, and prior to that it was Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, So TWE is worth the admission and more and will get miles upon mile sin multiple repeated viewings once released on Blu-Ray and DVD.8.5 out of 10.",The World's End

I find it has the best pace as well, as it definitely takes time to build up to the ending. Most of the acting is great, with Pegg and Frost switching roles from Shaun of the Dead. Pegg presents his character as extremely childish but has a genuine reason to act this way. Wright also managed to make his style blend a lot better in this film in my opinion. The shots and cinematography seem more perfected. However, sometimes the antagonists are a little dull. Overall though a fantastic action film.",The World's End
220,lucas739,Not the best.,5,22 November 2013,"I'm a big fan of Pegg and Frost but this film seems to be treading old ground.There is no real chemistry between the five 'friends', it all feels a bit constipated.Pegg fails to deliver as the swashbuckling failure, he's always better as the anti hero. You get the feeling there won't be any surprises and there aren't any. The introduction of the robots lacked wow factor and just added a cheap zombie element. The confrontation with the alien entity at the end was a piece incredible naffness. Of all the characters Nick Frost comes out on top, he lifts this film from being poor to something just about reasonable. I had high hopes for this film and, save for one or two genuinely funny moments, it was a bit of a letdown. You'd be advised to wait for the DVD release (its not worth investing in the bluray version).",The World's End
221,carlo_simone18,The Cornetto Trilogy Ends on a High,10,10 March 2018,"Having really enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz I was looking forward to how Edgar Wright and co. would parody the sci-fi genre. And it didn't disappoint.What I liked most was the theme of recapturing your youth, with how Garry King tries to desperately bring back his group of friends in order to relive one crazy night just after they had finished school. The dynamic between these five was so great that they really did feel like a group of friends that had reunited for one last hurrah. This really sold the film to me.The comedy was top notch once again like the two previous films in this trilogy and had me consistently laughing throughout. What surprised me though were the genuine heartfelt moments amongst the madcap plot which were very effective. Discussing Peter's bullying, Garry's alcoholism and Andy's wife leaving him were all moments of sincerity which were ironically quite sobering.The aesthetics of the film were visually-pleasing, the cinematography to a good standard and all the performances were solid. The one criticism I have is that the narrative suffers from a real lack of structure at times but aside from that this is another effective comedy from Edgar Wright.",The World's End
222,jjgooner,Embraces its stupidness with open arms,7,30 July 2013,"The World's End*** (out of 4)109 mins/ 15Cast: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, Rosamund Pike, Steve Oram, Darren Boyd, Rafe Spall, David Bradley, Mark Heap, Michael Smiley, Julia Deakin, Mark Donavon, Pierce Brosnan, (voice) Billy NighyDirector: Edgar WrightPlot: Five old friends unite to complete the ultimate pub-crawl, only to have to escape an alien invasion.JJ's Verdict: Wright, Pegg and Frost have done it again. After the very funny Shaun of the Dead and the sublime Hot Fuzz, this epic conclusion to 'The Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy' is epic. It is probably the weakest in terms of storytelling and characters but god; it is funny.Desperate to relive the days from his youth, Gary King (Simon Pegg) reunites four of his old schoolmates so that they can complete the ultimate pub-crawl that they failed twenty years earlier. Although they have changed and moved on, the four (Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, Paddy Considine) realise that Gary hasn't changed one bit and is still stuck in the glory days of the past. After the first few pints, the group find out that their old town of Newton Havenhas been taken over by blue-blooded robots. Despite their huge differences, the group are forced to carry on the pub-crawl so it looks like the robots don't know that they know. In the first two films it was Pegg who played the reserved and more mature character and Frost who played the outgoing and shameless character but in The World's End the pair switch roles. In a plot which is a mix of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, this is a welcome freshness to the story, which gives both actors great space to improvise. And the best thing about it is that it works. Pegg is brilliant as the outrageous and selfish Gary trying to relive his youth and Frost shows of his acting depth as the reluctant and very angry Andrew, but still gives us the old Frost we loved as he gets drunker and drunker.The interplay and banter between the five leads is absolutely hilarious with everything from arguing about how many musketeers there were and random birth marks, to what to call the 'robots' (they end up as 'blanks') and having to deal with calling your old teacher by their first name. Although we know that Pegg and Frost can do comedy, Eddie Marsan and Paddy Considine have perfect comedic timing and create well-defined characters. Martin Freeman is probably the weakest of the five but this is probably because of his lack of screen time or focus on the character. Like its predecessors the action is brilliant – I mean, who ever thought Nick Frost doing Matrix style jumps and smashing robot's heads open with barstools could be so funny. The CGI is also pretty good for a comedy, if used very weirdly. Also like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, The World's End has some superb cameos and small roles from a host of stars. Rosamund Pike, David Bradley, Rafe Spall, Pierce Brosnan and Billy Nighy all appear in some shape or form. Because of the role swap for Pegg and Frost, the characters they create aren't anywhere near as likable as those in Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. You still want them to survive but the fact of the matter is that for the majority of the film they're just not nice people. It does sometimes border on depressing and it's ending is surprisingly downbeat, but The World's End embraces it silliness and stupidity to the point that the ending doesn't matter because you're still laughing so hard from something that happened five minutes ago. Its themes of growing up and change are well brought up and mixed together incredibly well with Pegg and Wright's witty script. This is pure comedy from the heart and Pegg, Frost and Wright have created the best comedy trilogy of all time (although there aren't actually that many to rival it!) Also watch out for a divine Cornetto wrapper towards the film's end.",The World's End
223,paultreloar75,Good but no flake,7,20 July 2013,"The World's End completes a trilogy apparently, the end of a sequence of movies that followed on from the TV series Spaced, which I absolutely loved. I've enjoyed the precursors and I enjoyed this, in the main. It starts a bit clunky, and the unconvincing construct nags a little throughout. Yet, once the public houses start appearing and pints start sinking, you find yourself laughing more and more, and getting sucked in to a conspiracy theory, which may be true or it may be....??? The cast are great, in particular Nick Frost I thought, the snappy edits and musical accompaniments are as crisp as one would expect from Pegg and Wright. She said it was Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but I also felt there was some Day of the Dead kind of things going on as well, almost in reverse.The end is also a bit awkward and it's certainly a production of it's kind, the cultural reference points aren't anywhere near as intimate as someone like Tarantino does it, and I think Attack the Block was a fresher and younger take on a similar theme (albeit younger characters). I'd still highly recommend this, it's a straightforward enjoyable pseudo-sci-fi romp, you'll laugh a lot, sigh a little, and never look at a Cornetto wrapper without smiling again.",The World's End
224,joben-525-633946,"A funny film, too extreme for children",6,9 August 2013,"Duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost return to the big screen alongside director Edgar Wright to round off 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' into 'The Cornetto Trilogy.'Simon Pegg is the loud mouthed boozer who fails to have matured in his adult life. As a late teenager, he and his five childhood chums decided to have a crack at the Golden Mile (down a pint at eleven pubs before drinking the twelfth at the World's End Pub at the end of the line). After gathering the entire group together once more as middle aged adults, it is clear that they are now developed adults and don't share his ideas of fun. However, when the on - screen collaboration of Pegg, Frost, Martin Freeman and company discover their childhood town has been taken over by inhabitants from another road, they attempt to finish their drinking challenge whilst praying they make a safe exit.'The World's End' is in truth rather funny and in that respect remains on a par with its predecessors. The first half an hour to forty five minutes use up some humorous one liners and there is a witty bitchiness between the gang of childhood friends and Pegg's deranged character Gary King. When the action side kicks in their is plenty of slapstick comedy and black humour however I would like to state this is not a children's comedy; there is a lot of violence (if unrealistic anyway), but more notably Simon Pegg takes on the role of a swear-o-holic as well as an alcoholic.On the downside, 'The World's End' lacks the originality and freshness of 'Shaun of the Dead' and the actually intriguing plot behind 'Hot Fuzz.' Also, I feel Pegg is much stronger as the serious more sensible figure and not more ridiculous character. That role is much more suited for Nick Frost - as shown in 'Hot Fuzz.' Still - in conclusion - the summer of 2013 doesn't really have the enormous blockbusters of 2012 and 2011; it will certainly raise spirits (no pun intended) and it frequently keeps you chuckling. Worth a watch for that fact if little else.",The World's End
225,TimMeade,Amusing Throughout,6,5 August 2013,"This is the final episode in the very loose trilogy from director Edgar Wright, and writers and co-stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost following on from the extremely funny Shaun of the Dead and the highly amusing, if patchy, Hot Fuzz.The story centres on five male friends, now approaching middle age, who have gone their separate ways, and all enjoying some degree of financial and domestic success but for Gary King (Simon Pegg) who has resolutely failed to grow up and has a drifting, casual drug-using lifestyle. He mocks his one-time friends for their domesticity mistaking his wastrel ways for freedom. He nonetheless persuades them all to reunite to complete an epic 12 pub crawl in their small home town of Newton Haven – a leafy, well-heeled conurbation in the stockbroker belt of southern England.On returning to Newton Haven the men discover that the residents of the town harbour a shocking secret The World's End is at its best in the first half of the film. There is more than a little poignancy as the group of friends get together on what they tacitly realise will be for all of them a last hurrah in trying to recapture their youthful excesses; ahead of them waits only old age and grandchildren bouncing off their knee. The film also has a less than sly dig at soul-less and homogenous pubs owned by corporates with no sympathy to local traditions.The film is less successful toward the end when the town's secret has been exposed and the friends battle for their lives, never really sure who amongst them is for real; the group's decision to continue their alcoholic binge once the truth is exposed stretched suspension of disbelief beyond all credulity and from this point the storyline unravelled a little. The film's ending is particularly disappointing and brought to mind TS Eliot's line 'This is the way the world ends: Not with a bang but a whimper.' Nonetheless, there are several laugh out loud moments from the ensemble cast and in the main the film is amusing throughout, even in the weaker scenes. (For me, Nick Frost delivered one of the best lines and I was surprised to find myself the only one in the theatre laughing at it – I later established the term 'punch your lights out' is not prevalent in Australia, so the joke was possibly lost in translation.) There is also a welcome role for Rosamund Pike as an erstwhile girlfriend who does a good job breaking up the male-dominated story.Special effects and CGI are more than adequate for a film of this genre and the action scenes from Edgar Wright were nicely handled. The film is more professionally produced than the first two in the series and there were nice deferential nods to The Village of the Damned. The film has a good soundtrack – Blur, Pulp, The Soup Dragons - and it was particularly nice to hear The Housemartins and The Beautiful South once more.",The World's End
226,lwio1960,Not that good,5,20 May 2018,"I have just watched this on Netflix, thank goodness I didn't go to the cinema to see it. 
Maybe it's my age but the whole premise of a pub crawl with unwilling participants, on tea total, which turn up anyway was a bit far fetched. 
Then we had the village with 12 pubs, how do they make any money? Taken over by androids with some higher motivation of galactic good or was it evil, who knows or even cares. 
So it was really just an excuse for 5 actors to badly act drunk and destroy a lot of zombies, sorry robots in ridiculous fighting scenes.

227,jan_kalina,"""There's only one Gary King!""",10,6 September 2013,"There is only one Edgar Wright , only one Simon Pegg and only one Nick Frost. Nobody makes films like these guys. Now they have set out to complete one of the most unique and awesome trilogies ever with The World's End. The World's End stars once again Simon Pegg as the main character. Pegg plays Gary King, a man living in the past who tricks his four former best friends (Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan and Martin Freeman)into heading back to their hometown, Newton Haven. There they will attempt an epic pub crawl called the Golden Mile: twelve pubs, twelve pints, one night. Along the way they find out that not everything is as it seems. They find out that the town folks have changed radically.From all three films in the Blood and Ice Cream trilogy The World's End is definitely the most mature and also the deepest. But that doesn't mean at all that this film isn't fun. Quite the opposite. This time the jokes don't come at such breakneck speed as in the first two, this time they are more subtle. Of course the silly humor and the fanboy eagerness to make films is still here. This is an Edgar Wright film to the bone. Synchronized turning, characters moving in sync to the music that's playing, the trilogy's running gags (jumping over the fence), fast and furious cuts, the atmosphere of a small town where strange things will happen. It is all there. And perhaps even better than ever. Edgar Wright is a genius director who can make any genre although he is for now making comedies, but those comedies are more than that they are blending different genres into one. Shaun of the Dead is zombie romantic comedy, Hot fuzz is an action comedy. Both of these films make fun of the genre but in the same time paying tribute to them and showing how much Wright and Pegg love the films that they are making fun of. The World's End breaks this pattern a little. Wright and Pegg aren't making fun of any sci-fi clichés but they made has so much to say. The film is mostly about friendship, how you can be betrayed by a friend but it is also about homecoming and hard that sometimes can be. Any good science fiction book or film should feature some social commentary, tells something about the humans. The third act reminded me a lot of the works of Douglas Adams. Mostly of his most famous book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy (My favorite books, by the way). But perhaps they didn't inspire themselves with Douglas Adams, perhaps this mind set is encrypted in every Englishman's DNA. The film does stand up to its title, you do get the promised apocalypse but you can't even imagine how things will go down.Simon Pegg is typically hilarious. Both Simon Pegg and Nick Frost give one of the best performance of their careers. The new addition to the cast: Eddie Marsan, Rosamund Pike, Paddy Considine(he is also in Hot Fuzz) are just hilarious and most surprising is Eddie Marsan who finally gets to show his true comedy potential. There's deliberate foreshadowing in all three films: In Shaun of the Dead, Ed foreshadows the entire rest of the film in his conversation with Shaun after Lizzie dumps him; in Hot Fuzz, Danny asks Angel if he's done a bunch of dangerous big city cop stuff in London, all of which they end up doing in the film, and in The World's End, the name of the pubs foreshadow plot points. There is very funny role reversal throughout these films. What I have noticed throughout the trilogy is the increasing and decreasing role of some actors. Martin Freeman doesn't even say one line in Shaun of the Dead, he is there just for a moment. In Hot Fuzz he is the Sergenat who tells Nicholas Angel to go to Sandford because he is making other officers look bad. Finally in The World's End he is one of the main characters. On the other hand the lovable Bill Nighy, who always plays an authority figure who challenges Simon Pegg's character in all three films,gets most space when playing Shaun's step father, in Hot Fuzz he gets just two scenes a Chief Inspector and in World's End you just hear his voice.Edgar Wright has already proved that he is one of the best directors of this generation. He tops himself with each new film. The fight scenes are just beautifully choreographed and filled with so many ideas (Gary strives to finish his drink during the fight, Andy uses bar stools as brass knuckles to fight off the enemies.) Seriously the most inventive cinematography of this year.If you are fan of British comedies, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and their crazy humour stop reading this and go immediately to watch this film in the cinema. I don't think there will be funnier film this year.P.S. Thanks to Simon Pegg for introducing me his favorite band The Sisters of Mercy since the first time I've heard them during the last scene I can't stop listening to them. Of Course there is an excellent soundtrack just as usual with Edgar Wright film",The World's End
228,Atomic_Peace,World's End,10,22 September 2013,"Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are this generation's equivalent to Monty Python, we all know it's nonsense, but it all works out because somehow it smoothly fits the story they are telling. Compared to all of the other ""comedies"" we are being force-fed by today's media, (e.i InAPPropriate Comedy and everything else Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg have oso thankfully offered us,) Wright and Pegg come out on top. We have directors coming out nowadays saying they want to pay respect to the types of films they grew up with, a prime example being Quentin Tarantino. He rapid fires so many visual and dialectual references at once, film fans have to take a breather, while a normal theater going audience will sit there resting their faces in the palm of their hands, because they just don't understand what is happening. But, when Pegg and Wright come forth and say they want to pay homage to what they grew up on, it's also the stuff we grew up on or what we are still growing up on, stuff like Star Wars, Star Trek, or other classic films like Dawn of the Dead or Bad Boys 2. They let all of us have that moment of no-gravity happiness, and that's really hard to accomplish in today's media.The World's End tells the tale of the child-at-heart, middle aged Gary King, on the anniversary of their infamous bar-crawl, he rounds up his old gang in hopes of tying up the one loose end from his childhood. The problem is, all of his friends have now grown up and have moved on since then, but somehow, he manages them to reattempt to the crawl with him, and what starts off as an innocent bar-crawl soon turns other- worldly.The thing is, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright write these characters and situations so well that you could have just sat there watching them attempting this crawl without the other-worldly offerings shown at all, you still could've walked away happily, and it just amazes me to be saying this in our current age of film. The World's End is almost novelistic that way, a conflict will arise later, but you are so taken in by these characters and dialog it's only when the sh*t hits the fan you realize what you really bought your ticket for.I'm going to buy The World's End on Blu-Ray!",The World's End

230,Dfschohr-532-549658,The Worlds End Review,9,22 October 2013,"The Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy or better known as The Cornetto Trilogy, consist of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and now The Worlds End, a sci-fi spoof that everyone must see. The last half of the film is quite genius. The Worlds End is a story of five friends that head back to their hometown of Newton Haven to recreate an epic pub crawl that they failed to do when they were eighteen. If your wondering why it's called The Cornetto Trilogy, its because each film has a flavor of ice cream assigned to it. Shaun of The Dead is Strawberry, Hot Fuzz is Original, and The World's End is Mint Chocolate Chip. Cornetto is the brand name of the ice cream. Gary King (Simon Pegg) is stuck in his old drugged out ways, nothing has changed for him, not even his clothes, literally. Now out of the blue, King decides to reunite his old gang. All of the friends have their own problem with King for various reasons. Simon Pegg is becoming one of my favorite actors. This role is completely different from Shaun or even Sergeant Nicolas Angel. Gary King is a deeply flawed human being who cant get his life on track/ Then Nick Frost's Andy is the well off one, with a good job, a wife and kids, but he's still missing something in his life. Frost and Pegg captivate us and capture the silver screen and deliver both of their best performances. The film has an impressive supporting cast featuring Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, and Eddie Marsan along with some great cameos. Edgar Wright keeps showing is his crazy uniqueness as a director. Wright is truly one of a kind, and will soon be one of the industries top directors, along the lines of Spielberg. The World's End is absolutely my favorite of the trilogy, and it's all because of it's last twenty minutes. I give The World's End a 9 out 10",The World's End

I was aware of the previous attempts of Pegg-Frost duo (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) and the story line was well known from the trailer and hence there was nothing much of a surprise from it, but the kick you get after watching the Five musketeers (not a typo error, that's how they call themselves) booze to the death in 12 different pubs over a period of whole night will make even a thirsty guy to go take a leak.Peg, Frost, Freeman rendered their natural performances and turned the funny story line into an outrageously hilarious screenplay. In terms of comedy this is one of the best pictures in recent time. The lead actors would be competing among themselves for the Oscars when the Academy decides to open a new slot for the Best Performance in a Comical role.Unlike other adult-comedy oriented movies (American Pie, Van Wilder) this movie delivers a delicate and yet a very important message about co-existence and civilization.So, a thoroughly enjoyable movie, highly recommended stress buster.",The World's End
232,AdultAudienceMember,Just not funny.,5,27 August 2013,"I kept waiting for it to be funny. What you get is St. Elmo's fire with robots, 4 grown up friends and 1 stuck in the past, and the end of the world as we know it....except not entirely. As a buddy movie, it barely connects. As science fiction it's not imaginative. It wasn't a complete loss, though. Because I saw it at Cinemark and I had purchased the refillable cups and popcorn tubs earlier this year, the wife and I got two large drinks and two med popcorns for a total of $6. Sadly, that was the highlight of the film. Just as I waited for The Butler to even remotely connected to reality, for Two Guns to be anything other that an insulting caricature of Texans, and Gangster Squad to be anything other than gun play, I waited in vain for The World's End to get really funny. It didn't even get more than slightly humorous.",The World's End
233,Degree7,A very funny farce!,6,27 August 2013,"Probably one of the best comedies of the summer, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost & Friends return for what is supposedly the conclusion to their trilogy of parodies that satirize the horror, action, and now science fiction genres.On the anniversary of their final night out on the town as teens, five aging yuppies decide to once again take their local village by storm and complete the pub crawl that they started 20 years ago. But of course, as usual in these Brit comedies, things take a turn for the bizarre as it is revealed that nearly all the townsfolk are systematically being replaced.The plot isn't especially clever, but that doesn't matter, because the film never takes itself too seriously. What makes it work is the clever script and improvisation, the great chemistry between the leads, and the slew of amusing cameos that add life to what could have been a dull retreading in your average comedy. But here, the jokes are raunchy and politically incorrect, so it gives the viewer an excuse to kick back, relax, and have a fun time at the movies.That's not to say its entirely disposable. There is a fair amount of heart to it, as characters comically argue about the merits of things like who wrote 'The Three Musketeers' and the history of their personal relationships with girls and their friend's sister (I bumped into her in the public bathroom, where I bumped into her again!). And finally, there is a keen note of observation on the nature of what it means to be human, even if it should be taken with a pinch of salt.While not the near classics that are 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', this entry marks a return to form for Pegg & Co. I look forward to see their next offering.Thumbs up!",The World's End
234,R-P-McMurphy,A cool Sci-fi Comedy about being stuck in the past.,10,11 September 2013,"Energetic and very fun to watch, but a little too silly when compared to the other two films in the ""Cornetto Trilogy"". Gary King (Simon Pegg), an alcoholic, reminisces about the past when he and his four friends decided to do a pub crawl called ""The Golden Mile"". 20 years later, he decides it's time to give it another try and convinces them all to do it, but they soon find out that their home town is being invaded by aliens.I enjoyed it thoroughly, but I realized that the humor was a little childish, as if Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have now become accustomed to American humor after doing ""Paul"" instead of doing their old ironic and dry British jokes. A bar named ""The Famous Cock"" would've never appeared in ""Shaun of the Dead"", it's something more of a movie like ""American Reunion"".If I try and leave my critical baggage behind and try to see the movie on its own, it was pretty entertaining and funny, I enjoyed all the performances in it, specially Simon Pegg's as the electrifying Gary King. Nick Frost was hilarious as his character, I couldn't stop laughing during the over the top fight scenes.Technically the movie was very stylish, the editing was brilliant as expected from an Edgar Wright film, using his trademark frame wipes. I can really understand Simon Pegg's character, he makes you feel the excitement and nostalgia he feels for being reunited with his friends, maybe he and Stifler from ""American Pie"" should hangout sometime.Now bringing back my baggage, the movie sticks with the themes of friendship that the other films in the trilogy also dealt with and like them ""The World's End"" is also a great hangout movie (and maybe even a stoner comedy). It doesn't achieve the level of greatness of ""Shaun of the Dead"" or even ""Hot Fuzz"", but it might just be even more fun to watch, and I can bet it will hold up when revisited as well as those two.I had a big problem with the last 5 minutes, they did to the movie what ""Back to the Future Part III"" did to the first two Back to the Future movies, but I can't be too harsh on it after getting to see Rosamund Pike drive a car like a badass. When compared to similar movies that came out this year, like Grown Ups 2, I can't complain, it's definitely one of the best comedies of the year.I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy, specially if you liked ""This is the End"", ""After Hours"", ""Harold and Maude"", ""The Graduate"", ""Just Friends"", ""Young Adult"", ""Attack the Block"" and/or ""Django Unchained"".",The World's End
235,GB65,No. Just no,5,22 July 2019,"Whilst liking Simon Pegg and a lot of the things he does, I find the almost fawning adoration he receives for just about anything, especially here in the UK, rather puzzling. I've never found any of his films more than just a bit entertaining but some seem to be revered in an almost cult-like status. This film pretty much follows the same vein; daft storyline that delivers no more than the occasional laugh with a very talented cast but fails to deliver anything more than mediocrity.",The World's End
236,siobhanmckibbin,The World's End of an Era,7,25 July 2013,"Once again the hilarious duo of Pegg and Frost and fantastic direction from Wright has brought to our screens another genius comedy, which as usual is quirky, action packed and of course entertaining.The story centres around a group of childhood friends, who now in adult life have gone their separate ways. Gary 'the king,' has not moved on from his youth and his ultimate quest is to reunite his friends and attempt an epic pub crawl which they failed 20 years earlier. Their goal is to reach The World's End, the last pub in a long list, but as they reunite together in Newton Haven, it soon becomes apparent that finishing the pub crawl is the least of their problems. Beer swigging King becomes frustrated that no one seems to recognise him, which leads them to discover that their home town is now accommodated by a robot race and it's up to them to save the world.In typical style the humour is dry. What is ironic in the script writing is that the characters struggle with what's happened in their past and present but ultimately they are faced with dealing with what is going to happen to their future. Additionally, I really enjoyed their attention to detail in bringing all 3 movies together and also the continuity used. They used themes in this movie which also appear in Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead such as the noise of the fruit machine, cornetto's and not forgetting short shot montages, which is a fantastic technique which Wright has mastered. Although I'm not a fan of the naughty C*** word, somehow they put it into a funny context which is hard not to laugh at.Whilst this is not the most stand out comedy I have ever seen, it was enjoyable and the soundtrack used was not only clever, but the upbeat songs just put a smile on your face. I have always enjoyed watching Pegg and Frost acting together and it was nice to see a role reversal, in that Pegg's character is the loser and in fact their relationship at the start is less heartwarming than it has been in previous movies.It's a perfect mix of science fiction and comedy and well worth checking out.",The World's End
237,CSHaviland,Barely tolerable,6,31 August 2013,"Normally I really enjoy movies written by Simon Pegg. I especially liked Shaun of the Dead and Paul. This movie really stumbled.Remember that scene in Shaun of the Dead in which they decide the best thing to do is head toward a pub and defend themselves from the zombie horde from there? This movie makes that idea its central theme, changing the zombies into some sort of alien robots, and multiplying the pubs. That's it.Paul had me laughing out loud every minute or two, and I never get tired of watching it. The World's End gave me just a couple of chuckles throughout the film. And I almost nodded off several times.The setup before the robots appeared was too long and tedious, and after the robots appeared I couldn't quite understand why our characters kept running from pub to pub. And worse, I didn't much care.It just wasn't silly enough, witty enough, or clever enough to hold my attention.",The World's End
238,v_haritha_in,"Good Film but Not a Fitting Final for the ""Cornetto Trilogy""",7,4 September 2014,"Five friends in the small-town of Newton Haven, decide to go on a pub- crawl after passing out of high-school but are unable to complete the run. Twenty years on, they have all moved out of their home town and are well-settled; all except Gary King (Simon Pegg). He lives a wayward life and insists that that day was the best in his life. He uses his persuasive skills on his four friends and convinces them to come to Newton Haven to have one more go at the pub-crawl. They arrive against their better judgment. At first the town seems to be as sleepy as it was when they left it but there is something odd about its inhabitants.This is the final film in the ""Cornetto"" trilogy, the other two being ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". Each of these films parodies a different genre: horror, action and Sci-fi respectively. The film starts off on an entertaining note and keeps the fun going for most part. There are a lot laughs and the action is deliberately funny. But the ending is a let-down. An alien involvement is haphazardly introduced at the last moment and it feels like it was put in to simply tick the Sci-Fi box. Pegg is easily the best part of the movie. He has played three very different characters in each of the films and he is just brilliant in all of them, with each performance topping the other. Nick Frost too is back as one of Pegg's buddies, but as opposed to the other films, he plays the up-tight character and Pegg the rapscallion.It is a good movie but not up to the standard set by the other two movies.",The World's End
239,sunshinebeachcinema,"Raise a pint glass to The World's End, as it heads towards its cataclysmic finale.",8,3 September 2013,"The third flavour in Edgar Wright's Cornetto Trilogy is The World's End, is a pub crawl set against the backdrop of the apocalypse. This plot sees five friends return to their home town of Newton Haven to complete The Golden Mile, a grand tour around the town's twelve historic ale houses.They've all come a long way since their school days. All that is, except one. Gary King (Simon Pegg) the instigator of this nostalgia trip has not moved on a day. The perpetual sunglasses and leather duster that made him the coolest dude in school twenty years ago are now the bedraggled clobber of a washed-up borderline alcoholic.Where previously Pegg played the more driven character, with Nick Frost his stalwart, yet bumbling companion, in The World's End, the roles are switched. Here, Pegg is still the lead, but the idle Gary King is much closer to his character in Edgar Wright's sitcom Spaced. His old chum Andy (Nick Frost) is the complete antithesis, a successful lawyer, teetotal and married. The two have had a ""frosty"" relationship since school, if you'll pardon the dreadful pun. The laughter flows as quickly as the pints, with sharp and hilarious dialogue. The action is well choreographed by Brad Allen, a member of Jackie Chan's famous stunt team who worked with Wright on Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010).The film is a masterpiece of conception, with strength is in its attention to detail (resist reading further if you want to avoid spoilers). Of note are the character names, which subtly reveal their group dynamic. Self-appointed leader Gary King, ambitious rival Steven Prince (Paddy Considine), dedicated combatant Andy Knightley, managerial city slicker Oliver Chamberlain (Martin Freeman) and the submissive Peter Page (Eddie Marsan). The larger group takes a while to develop, drawing the focus away from the familiar Pegg and Frost dynamic. They characters chew the fat over the first few drinks, but each gets their moment in the sun.The perfectly generic Newton Haven was filmed amongst Hertfordshire's garden cities (The UK's first roundabout is indeed a real place in Letchworth). Thus the fictional town manages to represent the epitome of Britishness, but with an atypical vibe of city planning. For The World's End is a comment on the homogeneity of modern British towns, and this is the ultimatum delivered by the mysterious intelligence behind the alien invasion, whose brutal utilitarianism seeks to bring humanity in line with the rest of the galaxy by any means necessary.The film also dissects nostalgia by drawing attention to our own selective memories. The gang's first attempt at the mile, all those years ago, was an unfinished ramble of illness and conflict, participants dropping like flies as the evening progressed. Yet it is remembered as the perfect night, the culmination of a wonderful youth. The characters are later offered the chance of a return to this youth, the recollection of twenty years' pedestrian adulthood polished to perfection by cutting out all the bad bits.The name and design of each pub has been elegantly constructed to reflect the events that take place there; some are more subtle than others, but the stops on The Golden Mile are certainly open to rich interpretation. Again, stop now if you want to work it out for yourself; but read on if you think you've sussed it. While the journey concludes at a pub named The World's End, which would be a fantastic end to an epic pub crawl under any circumstances, the first pints are consumed at The First Post, a victim of systematic pub re-branding. The Old Familiar is all too familiar, its interior a carbon copy of The First Post. It also lives up to its name with the introduction of Sam (Rosamund Pike), Oliver's sister, and an old flame of both Gary and Steven. Next, after a lack of recognition in the first two pubs, Gary King puffs himself up at The Famous Cock, and indeed the landlord does remember him – he's barred.In The Cross Hands, the motley musketeers discover the town's awful secret, and cross hands with their foe for the first fight. After a shaky rekindling of their friendship, they finally reach the next stop, The Good Companion, as good companions. At the sign of The Trusty Servant, King and court encounter their old drug dealer, known as The Reverend Green. He's still human, but has been reduced to a nervous Stepford smiler by his oppressors. By this time, our heroes' adversaries are hot on their trail. Next, they fight the assimilated versions of Sam's old school friends (the twins) at The Two Headed Dog, and the enemy tries a different tactic at The Mermaid – a siren's call of seduction.Upon reaching The Beehive, the chaps run into their old teacher, the aptly named Mr. Shepherd, marking the second time a former James Bond has appeared in an Edgar Wright film. Shepherd elaborates on the nature of the threat, encouraging submission to the alien hive mind. After a frantic scramble through town, numbers dwindling at The King's Head, the King decides to go it alone, his desperation to finish The Golden Mile winning out over the severity of the situation. And (almost) finally, anyone who's seen the film will know why the brief, penultimate pit stop is called The Hole in the Wall.It's a tall order to replicate the success of the Cornetto classics without retreading old ground, but The World's End manages to keep moving in unexpected directions. At heart, The World's End is a bittersweet endorsement of humanity, celebrating not only our faults, but the individuality and freedoms that come with them. It also inspired me to indulge in a pub crawl of my own. So I, for one, will be raising a pint glass to The World's End, as it heads towards its cataclysmic finale. I suggest you do, too.",The World's End
240,postmortem-books,The Cornetto trilogy melts down at the last,2,21 July 2013,"Having enjoyed ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" I came to this last part of the Cornetto trilogy full of high expectations but sadly the film goes into meltdown very quickly. Attempts to make allusions back to the other two successes (Jumping the fence gag and the inclusion of the second ex-James Bond as the ""baddie"") only highlights how dismal and protracted this film becomes. I'd say the main problem lies in the Simon Pegg character with whom it is impossible to empathise. Whereas in the previous two films he was someone who was either put upon or fooled here he is a loud-mouthed, lairy, drunken git who drags his old school-mates back on to a 10 venue pub crawl. Whatever charm or fascination he may have had as a teenager has been dissipated by years of heavy drinking. The copious use of swearing - including the ""c"" word - only serves to highlight the paucity of the script in what eventually melts down into special fx for the sake of it. I couldn't wait for this film to end which is a sad reflection on the strength of the previous two which I am happy to watch over and over again. It is most unlikely that I shall bother to see ""The World's End"" ever again.",The World's End
241,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,This Cornetto is an acquired taste...,6,26 August 2013,"This, the 3rd and final movie in the ""Cornetto Trilogy"", a.k.a. the ""Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy"", shows Gary King (Simon Pegg), 20 years removed from graduating high school, returning to his hometown, gathering his old buddies, and trying to complete the epic pub crawl that they couldn't finish in their youth. It's a movie about growing up, and the struggles involved when adult life isn't as epic as your youthful days.Oh, and there's robots and aliens involved, too.As with the previous two movies in this trilogy, World's End has a sort of acquired taste to it – fans of Simon Pegg's comedy will be very happy, while others may find all the back-and-forth banter to be a turn off. One thing stands out – there is a surprising amount of GOOD action in here.Pros:-Simon Pegg and friends all keep pace with their usual antics. The fast- talking characters are all very witty and funny, and I'm sure we can all relate to having a friend just like ""Gary King"".-Did I mention the action? There are some DAMN GOOD fight scenes in here! And they continue a trend that I've been trying to tell you since the Sharknado review – BAR STOOLS ARE THE INVINCIBLE WEAPONS OF THE FUTURE.-The clever nods to the previous films in the trilogy will make fans smile in approval.Cons:-As I said, Pegg and friends aren't for everyone. The banter-heavy comedy might be a bit of a bore to some.-If you're not paying attention, the plot can get confusing as hell towards the end. Overall, I was pleased with the clever writing, and impressed by the great fight scenes. But I didn't laugh anywhere near as much, or as hard, as I did with ""We're The Millers"". It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.The World's End scores a 3 out of 5 on the BDBOS.(Hey my friends, thanks for reading.

242,bm2759,Fun and silly film,6,24 July 2013,"In Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz it becomes obvious rather quickly these are silly and fun films. There's a story being told if stereotype characters that you want either like or dislike. The same continues with The World's End as I believe there is a common theme in the Cornetto Trilogy - sit back, forget to think, have a laugh and enjoy.I personally can relate to Gary (Simon Pegg) in that he wants to just have a good time and wants to reminisce our careless youth. On top of that he's an incredibly irritating and arrogant individual which Pegg does very effectively. Well done. And the four lads are just fine in their roles as well, as is the rest of the cast.Living in Britian the jokes about pubs losing their identity and boring country towns was great. Especially when we see two pubs one after another looking exactly the same - he's looking at your Wetherspoons and Taylor Walker.Story wise it has a fun premise, and whilst possible, the execution is too far fetched to be believable. But we understand that given the tone of this film. However as a complete contrast we get an ending much too serious. I didn't like it but once again it's a silly film meant to be enjoyed and not critiqued too seriously.If you're keen to see it go for it. If not see it on DVD.",The World's End
243,tyreeewebster,Retro Reviews- The World's End (2013),10,16 October 2013,"After slaughtering zombies in 'Shaun of the Dead' and shootin' it up in 'Hot Fuzz', Simon Pegg, Nick Frost & Edgar Wright fight against an alien invasion in 'The World's End'.The film is about 4 childhood friends (Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman and Eddie Marsan) who begrudgingly reunite with their alcoholic friend, Gary (Simon Pegg) to reattempt an epic pub crawl they tried to complete in their teens, along the way, our 5 heroes must fend off against (big shock)... AN ALIEN INVASION!! When 'Hot Fuzz' reached cinemas back in 2007, a lot of Wright/Pegg fans thought that they out did themselves, considering that the police comedy was better written, better acted and well, just funnier than 'Shaun of the Dead', which in itself, was also just as good. Thankfully, it seems that they saved the best flavour for last with the final part of the bizarrely named 'Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy', or 'Cornetto Trilogy', or whatever you want to call it.PROS: This comedy is one of those very rare comedies where you are thinking about the characters and their different emotions, as well as laughing along with the story and situations at the same time, whilst watching this I was really thinking about Gary and the rest of the gang, and where life could go wrong, it is definitely a ""social science fiction"". The performances from all of the actors, are some of the best British performances I have ever witnessed in a sci- fi comedy, Eddie Marsan, who is known for his tough guy roles, really shows his innocent side in this as Peter, and is absolutely hilarious in the role. Simon Pegg is great as lead hero, Gary, who plays the role of the friend you love to hate to perfection, making us feel disgusted at his outrageous comments, but making us feel for his character at the same time, especially towards the end of the film which I won't dare to spoil! But, the actor who steals the show is Nick Frost, who really shows his acting chops, as well as his action chops! He plays the part of Gary's best friend Andy, and he plays it honestly and sincerely.The story is brilliant, and it is made better by the great characters and their respective actors, and the action in the bar fight scenes are some of the best choreographed, tense scenes in the entire movie! But the real tense scenes are actually nearer the end of the film, so I won't say a thing.Overall, 'The World's End' is awesome. It's heart- felt, it's exciting, it's emotional and, most importantly, it's hilarious. This may just be the most important film of the year.Directed by: Edgar Wright Written by: Edgar Wright & Simon PeggProduced by: Nira Park, Tim Bevan & Eric Fellner Starring: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan & Rosamund Pike",The World's End

Well, surprise, surprise: the film was actually better than anything I could have expected. Sitting down to watch this movie is as close to watching a movie, sitting on a couch in your underwear, as you can get in a movie theater.

The whole concept of the movie wasn't elevated much throughout until the end and the tone kept being too dark to be fitting all throughout as well.
A bit like Shaun of the Dead but worse.I, as probably many movie goers, longed for something uplifting about the characters throughout the whole movie that would've made things actually funny and not just uncomfortable and depressing.However without giving anything away, had the ending just been handled better, funnier, more chathartic, more lighthearted... i dunno, a different directors cut maybe?... this whole movie would've received two/three more stars.

247,LivBrumei,It's funny but it didn't work very good to me,6,6 July 2014,"A very funny world end, yes it is but I was expecting more from this gang. It was no the first movie I watched with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and a couple more, so yes I know they are really funny and usually I pretty much enjoy the characters they create. The movie isn't bad but maybe I set the expectations too high and this movie didn't reach them.Why it's worth seeing? 1. Like I said, the movie is funny indeed. You will have a nice time watching and get some laughs; 2.The actors have done a good work and created funny characters, not too much stereotyped and with a good dynamic between them (special Simon Pegg, it was a surprise for me, I had never seen him with this sort of character); 3. BIG REASON. It has a very strong message behind it. How many of us young kids wonder how adult life is going to turn out? I'll risk saying 99%... and how many of those who reach forties feel that they've accomplished what they wanted it and feel like life was what they had dreamed? 10%? 6%? I haven't reached my forties but I'm starting to guess that life isn't the dream we dreamed. When we're young everything seems possible, but the more we grow the more we realize it's not that straight. In this movie we get to see a perfect example of someone that had these thoughts but somehow for him was not easy to accept and deal with the fact that it couldn't always do what he wanted and kept thinking he was still the same kid. That's what starts the whole action and leads us to the end. So yes, it has an interesting idea behind the kids craziness.So why didn't I enjoy it that much? Honestly because of the too much fiction/action scenes that it had. It just sort of lost the point for me in the middle of so many fights. I guess those fights are probably what give the movie a more relaxed point of view: we're talking about a serious issue but in a funny, playful way. This isn't a bad thing for me and I'm sure many people will appreciated better this way, however it doesn't work so much for me.So I guess if you should or not see it depends on what you like, but no matter what it is a nice movie to watch.",The World's End

251,ryandannar,"A smart, funny, and very human take on Apocalypse tales...",9,6 September 2013,"""The World's End"" is a smart British comedy starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and directed by Edgar Wright. This is easily the most fun movie I have seen in 2013. Not only that, but it also features the smartest and most ingenious science-fiction premise I've seen in a movie in years! This is pure cinematic goodness -- enthusiastic, irrepressible, full of heart, kind of genius, and crafted with a jeweler's precision.I think Edgar Wright is one of the smartest and most quick-witted directors working today. If you've seen ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Hot Fuzz,"" or ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World,"" then you're familiar with Wright's ability to mix heartfelt themes about friendship and modern life together with slapstick comedy, satire, and rapid-fire verbal wit.But there's something else about Wright's work that's in short supply these days, especially in comedy: This guy truly crafts his films. He composes intricate scripts, then directs them with a sculptor's eye for detail. Every shot and every edit is exactly right, underscoring the impeccable timing of his actors to truly sell each beat.""The World's End"" begins as a sympathetic portrait of a washed-up loser. Simon Pegg stars as Gary King, an alcoholic has-been who still clings to the remnants of his high-school days, when he was the center of a group of friends who idolized him. Gary has recently been fixated on one particular event from his youth -- an epic pub-crawl that he and his mates embarked upon just after graduating high-school. Dubbed ""The Golden Mile,"" this was an odyssey involving all 12 pubs in their hometown of Newton Haven, starting with the appropriately-named ""The First Post,"" proceeding through pubs with colorful names like ""The Famous Cock"" and ""The Beehive,"" and culminating at ""The World's End."" This was, in Gary's recollection, the finest night of their lives. He has been plagued by the feeling that everything has been a steady downhill procession following that evening. For him, it has been. For his former mates, however, things have been different. See, they kind of actually grew up. While Gary stayed firmly entrenched in his childish fantasies of rebellion and rock-n-roll, his friends moved on with their lives, got married, became lawyers, real-estate agents, doctors, and had kids.So, when Gary decides it's time to get the gang back together and return to their hometown for a reprise of the infamous pub-crawl, his former mates are less than enthusiastic. And yet, they find themselves grudgingly swayed by Gary's irrefutable upbeat charm.This is how the movie begins, as a story of old friends re-uniting to wax nostalgic over some pints, while re-creating one of the seminal events of their youth. It's fast-paced and witty, as we accompany Gary on his manic quest to re-unite his former brethren. But interesting, weighty themes also emerge. Gary, we realize, is stuck in life. His friends realize this. Gary, on the other hand, sees things differently; he quietly accuses his friends of selling-out, of becoming the kinds of people they all derided in their high-school days. And to the film's credit, neither viewpoint is seen as been wholly right or wrong.The film also views nostalgia with a wry, satirical eye. For instance, when the group begins their pub-crawl, they begin to notice that many of their former haunts have been (presumably) purchased by a larger corporate entity, and made to look identical. ""They've been Starbucked!"" one of the guys observes.This, in turn, plays into a larger theme about the interconnectedness of modern life, and how it tends to encourage a kind of vast, homogeneous monoculture.About halfway through the film, a science-fiction story emerges. I won't say much about it, but I will observe that it works beautifully because it's a natural extension of the themes the movie has already been developing. Instead of derailing the film, the sci-fi story codifies everything that the movie has, up to that point, been trying to be about.No movie is perfect, and I have some minor quibbles about this one. For instance, it becomes increasingly harder to believe that the gang would keep on with their pub-crawl plans as events get crazier. Also, while the ending of the film is flat-out freaking BRILLIANT (and ironically hilarious), I have some pretty big questions and/or problems with the final scene, which is a bit too much of a head-scratcher. Simon Pegg walks into a bar and... what exactly is going on in that scene? It feels like a few too many questions are being raised.""The World's End"" forms the final third of Wright's jokingly-named ""Cornetto Trilogy"" -- a thematic trifecta of films starting with ""Shaun"" and ""Fuzz,"" and concluded here. These films aren't connected narratively in any way, but they all benefit from the casting of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in the leading roles, and there are certain thematic elements and running gags threaded throughout. If you've seen ""Shaun,"" you'll recognize ""Cornetto"" as the brand-name of the ice-cream confection a very hung-over Ed requests that Shaun bring home from the store. This reference comes full-circle in a funny, tossed-off joke in ""World's End."" It's a shame that the movie's title is so easily confused with ""This Is The End,"" that buffoonish Seth Rogan stoner-comedy which opened a couple months back. That was not a very good film. This one very much is. Will ""The World's End"" be overlooked because people confuse it with the Seth Rogan film? I guess we'll see.",The World's End
252,danren121,A load of utter...,1,16 January 2016,"If your idea of a good film is to take a potentially good idea, add a cast with zero chemistry, a throughly unfunny and annoying lead character and a terrible script then this might be the one for you. The opening few minutes are both humorous and engaging but unfortunately thats about it. Soon the film starts to happen and the only thing the viewer can do is try to work out how it manages to be so bad. I know humour is subjective but in comedic terms this was like watching an emu trying to fly. Unfortunately if you are paying to watch this you might not be so philosophical. The main reason the film refuses to be funny is that it seems like the cast, bar Pegg, play their roles in a pretty straight way which really doesn't do anything for the greater comedic good.",The World's End
253,jamiecfc1,Not brilliant...,5,20 July 2013,"I have to admit that I really didn't get the adulation that Shaun of the dead received, I thought it was an OK film but not anything that really bears repeated showings. Hot Fuzz on the other hand was great, as have been several others Simon Peggy has been involved in (Run Fatboy Run being a good example). I was looking forward to this film with its theme ringing pretty true with me (looking back to the past...etc). As it turns out I was overall disappointed with the film, but what really annoyed me was the overuse of profanity, I don't have a problem with a couple of swear words for ""effect"" but this seemed to use them at the expense of anything meaningful and therefore detracted from the movie. The film is not unique in this - it seems to be a general trend these days - but it honestly adds nothing to the script. For ideas - 8/10, but lose 3 marks for lazy scripting and a general flatness for much of the film. A great shame.",The World's End
254,ollie1939-97-957994,A fantastic conclusion to the Cornetto trilogy.,9,19 July 2013,"I didn't think this trilogy could get any better. However it somehow exceeded by expectations. With fantastic direction from Edgar Wright,smart writing from Wright and Simon Pegg and hilarious performances from Pegg, Nick Frost and everyone else the World's end is a great way to end the trilogy. The story focuses on a group of childhood friends who go back to their hometown in order to repeat a legendary pub crawl that ends with a pub known as the World's End. However they realize that their whole town has been taken over by robots and it's up to them to stop them from taking over the world. I will admit that my only criticism of the film is that it does start off a little slowly. The jokes felt a little stiff at times with their execution and most of the humor was coming from Pegg's character. However once the robots come in the movie does pick up the pace and lives up to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz The performances are very funny with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost actually switching roles. Pegg is more of the bumbling idiot whereas Frost is the straight man. The other performance are also good with Martin Freeman,Paddy Considine, Rosamund Pike and Eddie Marsan. I also loved the ending which has probably the best ending out of any of the Cornetto trilogy movies Overall the movie is incredibly funny despite having a slow start. It's a perfect mix of comedy and science fiction. I hope there's more to come from these very funny and talented guys.",The World's End
255,garbanzo5,Good One!,7,26 August 2013,"This is the final instalment of Wright's Cornetto trilogy and it is the most out-there movie of them all. The World's End is an action-sci-fi-comedy where a number of familiar faces return to help Simon Pegg complete the 'golden mile' by hitting 12 different pubs.There are a lot of references to the other movies which I think hurt the film a bit. It's making too many nods to itself instead of just being a good comedy in its own right, not to mention that people who haven't seen the other films just won't ""get"" all the references and in-jokes.Still it's a pretty funny movie that is well worth seeing! But you should definitely see his other films first or you'll be missing a lot of jokes.And it promotes beer drinking which is always a good thing!",The World's End

257,t-hf,Who else could have thought of intertwining impending intergalactic doom with a small-town English pub crawl,10,27 July 2013,"This is it, the finale of the absolutely fantastic trilogy by geniuses Simon Pegg and Nick Frost based around the motif of aptly flavoured ice creams, and it truly delivers. I entered this film waiting for the ice cream punch line, but by the time it was over I had completely forgotten about it, having witnessed some of the funniest dialogue, most explosive action and fantastic characters that I have ever seen from Pegg and Frost. While maybe not funnier than Shaun of the Dead and not as explosive as Hot Fuzz, it delivers a touching and hilarious story about friendship tested through time, 2 pub crawls, a small English village and the odd robot/alien invasion. Pegg and Frost of course play the comedy dream team of an unlikely duo at the centre of the action, always-entertaining Martin Freeman plays second fiddle, with hilarious Paddy Considine and lovable Eddie Marsan providing friendly support. All jokes aside, the main attraction of the film is its deep underlying story about 5 friends and their quest to get annihilated, even if it kills them.I cannot fault this film, nor can I praise it enough. I thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing almost every minute.",The World's End
258,TomTomH,"Hilarious, Insane, Thrilling, Twisted and Powerfully Entertaining in the bitter end of the last Cornetto on sale at the Pegg/Frost/Wright ice cream van!",7,24 August 2013,"Well there was one thing I knew about 2013, there would be two apocalypse comedy movies coming out. One is acclaimed apocalyptic sci-fi comedy spoof-like 'This is the End', where celebrities such as James Franco, Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel play themselves and are forced to survive against an apocalypse. As for the second, it is a gang of guys getting involved in alien annihilation. That film is titled 'The World's End'; Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's latest outing where they're not against zombies or bad guys; they're against pubs, pints and alien forces!'The World's End' tells the story of five blokes, Gary King (Simon Pegg, the ringleader as always), Nick Frost, the sidekick (usual in their films), Oliver (The Hobbit & TV's Dr. Watson: Martin Freeman), Steve ('Tyrannosaur' director Paddy Considine) and Peter (Eddie Marson), who all reunite to return to their hometown to try to make it to the bitter end (Gary refers it as 'lager end') with the ultimate pub crawl, code-named The Golden Mile, which they failed 20 years ago. They journey to drink 12 pints at 12 pubs, including The Famous C***, The Kings Arms and finally last but not least, the big one: The World's End. On their way they bump into old face Sam (Rosamund Pike). But other than that, they encounter a pub crawl is like no other...This is an idea that the other Pegg/Frost movies haven't pitched yet: Sci-fi apocalyptic madness. But yes, like their previous films (except for 'Paul'), all involve pubs. Unlike in 'Hot Fuzz', Pegg's character, Nicolas Angel, get's the duty of kicking teenagers out of a pub; in this one there's no kicking out, there's battle. Yes, not with teens though, but with alien robots! Yep there's plenty of head-smashing and blue blood to come along. Their rather crafty at first, but as time goes on; everything gets really strange and creepy. Now with 'unstoppable' forces around them to prevent an ultimate pub crawl, the gang are up for a night of running, head-smashing, drinking, swearing and fence-jumping in the biggest, most violent and insane pub marathon yet!This marks the third collaboration between Pegg, Frost and director Edgar Wright (six years since Hot Fuzz) and the fifth between Pegg & Frost (two years since ""Paul"", but without Wright - the directorial credit taken by ""Superbad""'s Greg Mottola instead). This film is part of The Cornetto trilogy, a movie saga which involves small England towns, jumping over fences, and blood (which is blue and which they refer to as 'ink') that splatters everywhere. With only three flavours to rule them all; Cornetto flavours that is. The trilogy was born with romantic zombie(?) comedy 'Shaun of the Dead' which was released in 2004, presenting a theme of an ice cream with a strawberry tang to represent the blood and gore in the film. Lovely!Secondly was 2007's 'Hot Fuzz', a buddy cop film at its finest with its successful comedy, good entertainment, furious action and unexpected James Bond kick-off: Timothy Dalton. Themed of an ice cream as a blue original cone to represent the police material in the film.And thirdly,now 'The World's End', one of 2013's Hollywood sci-fi apocalypses is a finale to a funny-flavoured film saga! An ice cream with mint chocolate chip to end it all, but what's the purpose of the theme I wonder?The VFX are good, but they're not up to 'Star Trek into Darkness' standards. The aliens look alright except their blood which makes you wonder if it's just blue paint or if it was all just completely computer-generated. Could be right; could be wrong.Remember in my 'Star Trek into Darkness' review I said Simon Pegg would hopefully be funny in this? Well thankfully I was right. He succeeds. Actually he's probably one of the funniest things about this film. Also,despite the usual serious character and tone he has in his films that he stars with Pegg in, Nick Frost succeeds as well.This is actually based on a true event Edgar Wright experienced in the past. When returning home from Art College he had a plan: to take on a pub crawl, calling it 'The Golden Mile', on all his taverns in his hometown (which were 15 he states). But unfortunately it had only made it up to 6 pubs which didn't break a possible world record.So what happens next? Up for Wright next is Ant-Man in 2015, his break from comedy to switch to superhero. What's up for Pegg and Frost? And what will Wright do after Ant-Man? Will the Blood and Ice Cream (the other title for the trilogy) gang reunite for a fourth time in the future? After it all started with 'Spaced', a long-gone comedy show that began the long-time relationship between Pegg and Frost, and continued with three more movies that started the relationship with Edgar Wright. But the question is, where does the journey end? Has it ended? Will it continue even without Cornetto in place? It might happen. You never know. I would be surprised if they did. Hopefully an article will appear someday on the internet to explain a pleasing next project that fans will be waiting for. I know someone one day will send a tweet to one of the trio to ask what's next after their upcoming flicks. Don't get any ideas from this, readers!But last out of all, to bring this review down with a bang just like the film, 'The World End' never fails to disintegrate the formula of the Cornetto trilogy's sensational glory. Just like the previous outings, it gives you laughs, madness and blood and violence! My first 15-rated film at the cinema was a perfect choice. Not to be missed, especially by Pegg/Frost fans!",The World's End

263,ScottGentry,"Enjoyable and witty, but nothing compared to it's predecessors.",7,5 August 2013,"""The World's End"" (15) Director: Edgar Wright. Starring: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, and Eddie Marsan. Rated: 15 for containing very strong language and strong sex references. Running time: 109 minutes. Out now in UK cinemas.Twenty years ago, five friends attempted the golden mile. A famous pub- crawl in which they would visit twelve pubs, starting with ""The First Post"" and ending with ""The World's End""; with the incentive to become annihilated. The only flaw in their plan was, they never made it. Now, in the present day; Gary King (Simon Pegg) a suicidal alcoholic (who still believes he is a young teenager at heart), is attempting to bring the once close friends back together once again, to finish the golden- mile. The only thing that stands in their way is a race of robots, hell- bent on claiming the Earth for their own possession. Now it's up to five friends on a night out, to stay sharp and stay alive, otherwise they may face, a very bitter end. It was Friday, the 19th of July and after six years of waiting, mine and (my friend) James's expectations were finally going to be fulfilled. Or so I thought. ""Shaun Of The Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" are two of the most celebrated comedies in British history. Any film following those, is going to have it's work cut out. That is one of my main problems with ""The World's End"". The film-makers seem to have tried exceedingly hard to produce a script, that is funnier than their last installments. I'm not going to lie,they don't seem to have succeeded. ""The World's End"" is in many ways a disappointment. It has however, focused on the storytelling aspects and the relationships between the five friends. The film has it's moments and at times tells some laugh out loud jokes; but not as many as it's predecessor. Expectations were considerably high and perhaps, pressure is the reason why the film has failed on some aspects. The acting is good to watch, with Nick Frost finally stepping out from his normal roles and into a serious character. Simon Pegg is an enjoyable character, but after a while he becomes a little played out. The rest of the cast is fantastic, with cameos from Pierce Brosnan and Micheal Smiley popping up all over the place. ""The World's End"" is really a complete retro festival, the little references here and there to bands such as ""The Soup Dragons"", are delightful; a soundtrack to cherish in many ways. The chaotic bar fights are a nice recollection to the days of ""Shaun Of The Dead"", with scenes such as when Gary is trying not to spill and drink his pint, whilst fighting hordes of psychopathic Robots. There are twists and turns throughout the film, but it just doesn't feel the same way as ""Shaun Of The Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". Perhaps on repeat viewings, I may pick up parts that I didn't see before and could become pleasantly surprised. I'm not saying ""The World's End"" is an awful film in any way, as a final chapter to the famed trilogy, it delivers; but could be improved.7 stars out of 10.Written by Scott Gentry.",The World's End
264,jeffrey-utley,A Good Action/Comedy Mix,9,25 August 2013,"This is the third installment of the unofficial trilogy starting with 'Shawn of the Dead', then 'Hot Fuzz', then 'The World's End'. I haven't seen 'Shawn of the Dead' or 'Hot Fuzz', so I went into this film with fresh eyes, and out of it wanting to see 'Shawn of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'.How was the acting? The acting was very, very good in this film. Simon Pegg was great in it. From beginning to end he portrayed Gary King beautifully. Nick Frost did very well playing Andy Knightly. There were three other main characters in the film. They were Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Eddie Marson. All three of them did well, too. How was the writing? The writing in 'The World's End' was also very good. It had many comedic elements to it that brought many humorous moments. The screenplay was written so that there could be some good action sequences and many humorous moments. There were also aspects of the characters that caused them to do things with their type of reasoning behind it. That was good how character's actions reflected on how the characters were built. Did it have an interesting premise? Yes, the premise was interesting. The fact that there was something going on causing some characters to want to leave and some stay was very good. It was also done well through the directing and writing. There were also good characters. Some were sane, and some were crazy. Some were easy to relate to, and some were outrageous, but in a good way. The film mixed these characters together and it well. I also liked many of the events of the film other than the ending. The ending was a bit of a letdown to me. I can't really say it's bad, but it's not good or mediocre either. It a somewhat over-the-top ending that I didn't think belonged. I'll say it was a little-below-average. The rest of the events, though, were surprising to me. I didn't guess any of the plot points, and many aspects of the plot were good. Was it entertaining or boring? Other than a few dull moments, this film was entertaining. The dull moments were around the middle of the film. There weren't too many of them, but it would've been best if there weren't any dull moments at all. The moments were supported by the fact that the scene had been lasting too long and was the same the whole time, the scene was exactly like the one before it, or the scene containing moments that were supposed to be intense, but were mostly boring. Another ""problem"" I have with film is that it could have been more enjoyable than it was. This film was enjoyable, but I didn't love these things about it. The good things in the film were not incredible. It could have been more funny, the humorous moments could have been funnier, the times where there were no action sequences or comedic moments could have had elements that made it very enjoyable, and had people get into those moments. The film did hold itself together until the dull moments and after the dull moments, though.. The action sequences were thrilling, and the comedic elements stopped the scenes that would've been slow from being slow. The film was also able to sustain the substance and enjoyable elements due to the mixing of characters that differ from each other. How was it overall? 'The World's End' had very good writing, very, very good acting, an interesting premise, good story, good characters, and for the most part was entertaining, but had a slightly bad ending, some dull moments, and could have been more enjoyable than it was. This film was overall really good and would be worth seeing in the theater. On the grading rating scale, I give it a B+. Do I recommend this film? Yes, because this film was enjoyable for the most and I didn't very many true flaws with it, I would recommend going to see 'The World's End' even at full ticket price. Will I buy this film? No, because of the main fact that it could have been much more enjoyable than it was, and the flaws I had with it, I would not buy this film. I can't see myself watching buying it and watching it again.",The World's End

I don't know how this will age but the acting of all the players has definitely matured.This isn't a laugh out loud comedy though there are a few places where it hits that way. This will be a letdown for those expecting Shaun of the Dead part III. It is way more 'wry' and hits the theme of delayed adulthood with a sledgehammer. As other reviewers have said it loses steam when the alien theme gets introduced but I still found it really well done. I think there were two movies here, one with the childhood friends years later examining their lives and another with the post apocalyptic scenario. The two parts don't entirely mesh together seamlessly, I had to kind of mentally force myself to accommodate the transition when the movie went into sci-fi mode. I found the different characters and their personalities well defined and interesting and it was very cool to see the arc they each went through.

I've seen both several times. I can name several things off hand that I loved about those movies. I can't name anything about this one. Only things I liked were Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike. That's it. Nobody else did anything much for me and the plot if you can call it one was not engaging and was stretched out too far. The movie was lacking in much of the humor that made it's 2 predecessors shine. I failed to find much that was funny in TWE. The shoestring plot of a grown man finally deciding to complete some trivial beer drinking game years later with his estranged friends seemed extremely forced, like Edgar Wright was treating this as more of a contractual obligation he wished to get over with so he could finally have a Cornetto Trilogy. It all reeks of a director who lost passion in the project he initially was enthusiastic to do. The second half with the robots was truly awful. It was so ridiculous and nonsensical and the effects looked B movie level poor. The ending was even worse. What a waste of the 4 good cast members they had managed to get from a dismal selection of forgettable actors and a terrible third entry. I recommend never watching this movie. It's extremely disappointing. Just stick to the first 2 movies and skip this one. It's essentially The Godfather 3 of the Cornetto Trilogy. I'm likely to never watch this again.

The theater had a good, raucous turnout, but for the first half hour or so, I barely heard any laughs. It seems everybody kept waiting for the humor to flow, but the funny bits were few and far between. The basic premise was great, but maybe there was too much plot to get in the way of what was marketed as a comedy. Perhaps much of the problem was Simon Pegg played a very unlikeable character. There wasn't much sense of wanting to root for him. Sad to say, I mostly wished he'd have gone away. For most of the movie, there was much animosity between him and Nick Frost due to a major event in their past. Talk about a buzz-kill. What a shame, as they are such a blast when playing friends on speaking terms. Heck, if I'd wanted to see an angsty English drama about relationship problems, I could have turned in my man card and watched Jane Eyre instead.

I just always wonder about movies like this: Wasn't there any script doctor involved? Nobody they could run this through?

270,acutler,Almost brilliant,8,2 December 2013,"In some ways this is the strongest of the ""Blood & Ice-cream"" trilogy, but it a serious flaw. The setup - which takes nearly half the film, is just not very funny. It's important, and it does pay-off, but it really lacks pace - 'pace' missing from an Edgar Wright film? Can it be true? Yes it can. The jokes are two sparse in the pre-alien part. And that's nothing to do really with the sci-fi element, and all to do with holding Nick Frost back.There is a key-point in which the film suddenly comes together, and it is the heart of all three films - it is when Nick Frost's character ""Andy Knightley"" realises that he has to give in to Simon Pegg's ""Gary King"" no matter how stupid that decision seems. It coincides with the first proper fight scene, and from that moment on, the film is easily the best of the trilogy. Nick Frost shows how the Hulk should really be played and the force of nature that is unleashed it the real marvel (pun intended).The epilogue is also slightly unnecessary, but I love the Mad Max (without the cars) vibe it gives off - so I'll forgive it.Still it's a solid 8/10, because, as with ALL of Edgar Wright's output it has endless details that reward multiple viewings. If this film demonstrates anything - it is the sheer talent of Nick Frost and how much you don't want to hold that back.",The World's End
271,Sahl_95,A Great Finish to a Great Trilogy,9,21 December 2014,"The movie is about Gary King (Simon Pegg), a 40 year old whose best days ended in his teens. He reunites his gang - Andy Knightly, Steven Prince, Oliver Chamberlain and Peter Page (Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman and Eddie Marsan) - to finish a pub crawl from their youth and along the way, strange stuff happens.The movie does start a bit slow while you get to know the characters, but it is still enjoyable. For me, it really got going when you found out why everything was weird. From then on, the movie was awesome. It got a lot funnier and the action scenes were brilliant. The humour is great throughout and a lot of the smaller characters have great scenes.The main cast is great. All five do a great job and are all funny and badass in their roles. The secondary cast are awesome too.Even after a re-watch, this movie was still very funny. Although I had mixed feelings about the ending (I did however love how the main threat of the movie was resolved), this is still one of my favourite comedies and is a great end to a great trilogy.",The World's End
272,edgereviews,The Three Flavour Cornetto Trilogy ends on a high note,9,4 August 2013,"I am a big fan of Shaun of the Dead, and I freaking hate Hot Fuzz with a passion. I am also a fan of Edgar Wright's other movies (Scott Pilgrim Vs The World) and I really like Simon Pegg. I was excited for The World's End because it looked to be more like Shaun of the Dead than Hot Fuzz. Not only is The World's End better than Hot Fuzz, I would say it's on par with Shaun of the Dead.The writing is very well done. The story is extremely original, and I would say it's funnier than the other movies in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy. One of The World's Ends strongest points is it's directing, which is extremely well done. The action in particular is brilliantly executed, which got me excited for Ant Man, because if Edgar Wright does the action the same way in Ant Man it should be very solid. The World's End also manages to juggle a lot of genres very well. It has sci-fi, comedy, drama and action, and the actors deserve a lot of credit for this as they manage to perform very well in all of these genres.I was particularly impressed with Simon Pegg in The World's End, as we see him in a very different role to what he normally does. Nick Frost is also great, and like Simon Pegg his character is very different to his others in the trilogy. The supporting cast including Martin Freeman, Rosamund Pike and Pierce Brosnan are very good as well.With great comedy, brilliant action scenes and a very original storyline, The World's End is one of the most solid movies of the year so far.",The World's End
273,sandiglendinning,Let's Boo Boo!,7,25 July 2013,"Middle aged small town bad lad Gary King decides to get his old school bros together to complete a legendary 12 pub crawl back in their old stomping ground Newton Haven. The top falls off the mountain and chaos ensues when the boys discover that something dark and sinister is going on in the town. King Gary and his gang must survive the night, battle hostile robots and unravel an alien conspiracy in order to reach the eponymous World's End for a 12th pint in order to complete the epic quest of a lifetime!Here we have more of what Edgar Wright is bloody great at, namely the snappy, hilarious dialogue that we all know and love just like in Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Great characterisation and believable relationships between characters are as ever features to be applauded. If I were to try and explain the story I could only describe it as the bastard lovechild of The Inbetweeners and Invasion of the Bodysnatchers.For Generation X-ers like myself, there are a troupe characters in this film who are very easily relatable. Anyone in their mid 30's-40's is going to find themselves feeling as though they are in the middle of an inside joke with a bunch of old friends while watching World's End. This nostalgia quotient is enhanced to the max by an unapologetically 90's soundtrack second to none. All of this adds up to a hugely enjoyable and strangely sentimental experience which is very entertaining.Themes are focused upon friendship, (im)maturity and growing up (or lack thereof!) which gives the film a good range of appeal. Effects are hilariously over the top, fights are plentiful and furious. The second half of the movie is arguably utterly ridiculous. However, Edgar Wright has carefully balanced serious adult themes in order to bring his trilogy to an emotionally satisfying conclusion which should leave fans satisfied.You'll probably enjoy World's End if you're a Gen- Xer, teenagers are bound to love it as well though as will anybody young at heart. Sci –fi and Horror fans are also sure to have fun watching this film as well. Get out there and watch it and prepare to laugh very hard.",The World's End
274,rahmannoodles22,The World's End - Noodles Review,8,19 December 2013,"Just when I thought summer was over, I get a fun movie to put an end to it. I had mixed expectations for The World's End; I expect it to be funny and witty, but from an initial look, it's seems too similar to this summer's earlier apocalyptic comedy, This Is The End. I was a little worried that the familiarity and similarity would leave a bland taste for me. This Is The End was probably one of the funniest movies of the year (after Despicable Me 2, of course), so I was hoping the jokes wouldn't be too similar. However, The World's End isn't only a lot different from This Is The End, but, in my opinion, a lot better. The World's End is the unofficial conclusion to what is known as the Three Colours Cornetto Trilogy, which is comprised of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and this. They're all directed by Edgar Wright, written by Wright & Scott Pegg, and all star Scott Pegg & Nick Frost.They don't really have anything else to do with each other, other than they're similar British comedy. If you're a fan of the first two, then you'll probably enjoy this one. I personally loved the wit and jokes of them, so The World's End was a lot of fun for me.In this movie, the five main characters, led by Pegg's character Gary King, partook in the Golden Mile as teenagers; which is a pub crawl challenge from their hometown in which you have to drink a pint of beer from each pub on this mile-long stretch, ending with the pub called The World's End. The gang wasn't able to complete the Golden Mile back then, so after like 20 years now, they come back together and head back to their hometown to take another crack at it. However, upon coming back, the crew realizes that the town they grew up in has been replaced with alien robots. It sounds ridiculous, right. It is explained competently, but the ridiculousness of this film is one of the best parts. And among the chaos brought upon by these robots, the gang continues to go on the Golden Mile, and the further the film progresses, the more drunk the guys get. And they play it so well that it's believable and hilarious. Simon Pegg kills it in this movie as the self-declared leader of the group. He's a complete loose-cannon and everything that comes out of the guy's mouth is comedy gold. The rest of group, too, are all great in the movie. They've all moved on in their lives. One's a lawyer, another's car salesman with a family; they all just feel like real regular people and seem like they all know each other so well as if they were really best friends as kids, which adds to this film because you relate to them and care about them. My personal favourite was Martin Freeman's character, Oliver (or as he hates being called, the ""O-Man!""), the real estate agent with the bluetooth who always says the acronym ""WTF."" The acting and character writing of this film are on point, which is possibly the main reason it's so funny. What I also liked about the comedy is that it's cleverly written. There's a lot of jokes that develop in the movie to be funny, and then there's also the subtleties that a lot of people will miss that are really hilarious.The comedy and entertainment of this movie is also due highly to the direction. Edgar Wright has his own style of direction in which he does quick cuts, cool zooms, long takes, all mixed together. And the choreography of the fight scenes were fun, too. An example is when the gang is in one pub brawling against a bunch of robots and Pegg's character keeps trying to finish his glass of beer, while also being preoccupied by the ongoing fight. Just as well, it has some dramatic scenes that would otherwise be really cheesy in any other movie. However, the relatable characters and clever writing make it fit right in. My only gripes for this movie are that the last third aren't as strong as the the first two. It's still good and entertaining, don't get me wrong, but I feel like it's not as fun or engrossing as the beginning; it got more action. That, and the movie's not really for everyone. A lot of people really wouldn't find the British comedy as funny; and there are those who won't understand some of the more clever jokes. But for me, this was laugh-out-loud",The World's End

277,Mikheil-H,Why do I keep coming back?,8,25 January 2021,"The third entry into Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's Cornetto Trilogy, The World's End is commonly seen as the weakest chapter of the three, usually being overlooked in comparison to its cult classic brothers. Despite this however, The World's End is the one I return to more frequently than the others and initially, it is difficult to see why.Out of the three, Hot Fuzz is the greater (good) film. All the jokes land, the action is relevant to the story, the characters are iconic, and the plot is intriguing for a first watch and only gets better with each subsequent viewing. Shaun of the Dead is the funniest, with so much parody-based humour mixed with original ideas that even thinking about them puts a smile on my face (ie: The Plan). The World's End doesn't reach the comedic heights of Shaun of the Dead (the fence gag being a huge missed opportunity) and the story involving a robot (sorry err, blank?) invasion while certainly engaging, is wrapped up poorly in my opinion. So, was it naïve to believe that The World's End could match the greatness of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz? Almost definitely. However, it is my belief that The World's End earns its place in the trilogy and deserves to be viewed on parr with its two counterparts.My first source of reasoning revolves around Edgar Wright, the trilogy's director. What a genius! If you have seen any Edgar Wright film you will know that there are few who can match his energy, pacing and eye for detail, and all of that and more is on full display in The World's End. This is exemplified in a frantic pre-titles montage giving us not only an introduction to our protagonists, but also a summary of the film's events before they have even happened (yes this also happened in Shaun of the Dead, but it's fully realised here with Wright recreating numerous shots from the montage). This level of detail continues throughout the film with everything, from one-off lines, to set designs, to even clothes hinting at what is to come or calling back to something prior. But this is all classic Edgar Wright, so how do we know The World's End is not Starbucksing itself and just copying what came before?Well one aspect Wright definitively changed was the action. Before Mission Impossible 6, The World's End probably had the greatest fight scene ever... to take place in a bathroom. The action is gritty, fluid and stylised whilst also being used for character development and occasionally comedy (ie: Gary struggling to down a pint during a Blank onslaught but stopping only to protect a friend). Furthermore, with the music keeping time and the camera weaving around individual character skirmishes, it all feels like Wright practising for Baby Driver a few years later. But action isn't everything and besides, Hot Fuzz can arguably rival The World's End's action with its final shootout. So why do I re-watch The World's End more than the other two?The answers are in the characters. It appears that both Wright and Pegg put in great effort to make each of the 5 musketeers well-rounded and at least somewhat relatable characters. Each have their own mini arcs, with Oliver starting shrewd only to later enjoy himself and life (and then get brutally mulched and replaced). Pete who remains anxious and avoids conflict at all costs, who, upon facing a childhood bully, gets a cathartic and violent release (but is then also brutally mulched and replaced). Then also Steven who finally escapes self-comparisons to Gary and gets the girl of his dreams (and as a bonus, doesn't get mulched!). However, the real stars are Pegg's Gary King (his best performance to date) and Frost's Andy Knightley. The duo is at their most beautiful and heart-breaking best here. This is exemplified with scenes such as Andy, the smartest of the group, risking his life multiple times in an effort to save Gary and show that despite what's happened in the past and present he still cares for him and will follow him to the end of the world to prove that. Then there is Gary who although initially appearing to be a narcissist, ultimately is revealed to be the most human of them all. Throughout the film, he withholds his reasoning for bringing everyone back to Newton Haven until the end where Andy discovers the suicide attempt and stands there in shock as a distraught Gary reveals that the start of his life never happened. That it never got better than that last night as teenagers and any help he received belittled him, effectively causing him to revert back to his youth, relive the past and feel free again - ""They told me when to go to bed!"".I must have re-watched The Worlds End at least once a year since 2013. It's not perfect. As stated before, the resolution to the Blank story, while thematically appropriate, feels weak, but regardless the blanks serve well as antagonists and driving forces for our leads. But that criticism does not matter as upon each re-watch I have come to identify more and more with both Andy and Gary. Their relationship feels real. They act as two sides of the same coin, further proven by Gary's revelation which forces you to re-evaluate his actions in a new light. The theme of wanting to relive events in your past is a wish that so many have and through that theme and their bond, The World's End elevates itself to become more emotional, rich and cathartic than the rest of the Cornetto trilogy. As such, over time I hope it gains the appreciation it deserves.",The World's End
278,RTTerry,Fun and entertaining - see it with a group of friends!,7,30 August 2013,"It wasn't 'hilarious', nor was it probing and overly imaginative. It was fun and entertaining and that's exactly what I expected out of it. It became a little too over-the-top and almost 'huh?' 'wh-at?' when trying to explain itself in the last fifteen minutes, but even that wasn't enough to dampen the spirit of the overall experience. I was happy with the movie and recommend it, especially if you're going to see it with a group of friends – trust me – there are dozens of scenes you and your friends will absolutely relate to and start elbowing each other over! Good enough for anyone in their late teens and older. Teens will have something to look forward to – and those of us past our thirties, will get embarrassed reliving the same stunts we used to pull, or associating with friends 'just like some of those guys'.",The World's End
279,jesse-hitzroth,A Fantastic Apocalypse,8,10 September 2013,"A little late with this review. I saw this the weekend it came out but did not have time for a review until now. The world's end marks the third film in Nick and Simon's trilogy. This time around the boys are battling an army of killer robots. Simon and Nick have switched roles for this film in which Simon plays the bumbling idiot. Simon recruits his old high school friends to conquer an epic night of drinking that they failed to do years prior, however now everyone is grown up except for Simon's character who still lives in the past. However they soon realize the town has been taken over by a sinister robot army. Basically if you enjoyed either Shaun of the dead or Hot Fuzz you will love this film. Hot Fuzz is my favourite comedy of all time so far, however i would rank this movie right up there with Shaun of the dead. The humour in this film is very subtle compared to their previous two films. They try some new things with this film and the result is a crazy mass effect inspired ending. This is a great film to end the summer, and while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it will surely be a cult classic in time.Rating: 8/10",The World's End
280,jessicareid,An enjoyable British comedy,7,30 July 2013,I don't think this film was quite on par with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz however it was still enjoyable in its own way. One thing I did like about this film was how different it was from the others and yet it had familiar aspects in it. The main characters were all amusing and interesting in individual ways and when they came together it worked really well. The story line isn't the most amazing and it wasn't the funniest film but it still had its moments and it was subtly funny throughout the whole thing. Towards the end of the film it did start to get really silly but that's what I expected and I think this type of film is good to watch for a change from serious ones. There was quite a deep meaning within this film which made the humour of the whole thing more interesting. Overall I think this film is worth a watch and as long as people are prepared for the weirdness of it then they will enjoy.,The World's End
281,will-schwartz,Amazing to the bitter end...or lager end.,10,3 September 2013,"""The World's End"" is the final hysterical thrill ride in Edgar Wright's ""Cornetto"" trilogy of films. The first two of these being ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". Wright's fast-paced directing shines through Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's legendary comedic duo that nearly always presents audiences with gut busting laughs. Keep in mind that even though this is the conclusion in a trilogy, each of these films have had new characters, new plots, but the same cast and crew. For example, Martin Freeman and Bill Nighy have both had cameos in the two previous films and they manage to fit in here as well.In this film, Simon Pegg leads his reluctant, old high school friends on a pub crawl in their home town of Newton Haven. Pegg plays Gary King, a self centered, nostalgic, jerk wad who will go to any means necessary to complete ""the golden mile"" of twelve bars. Nick Frost plays Andy, the opposing force and complete opposite of Gary King. He keeps to himself and only comes on the trip because of Gary's trickery and lies.So as the pub crawl commences, the group and Sam (Rosamund Pike) begin to notice strange happenings around the town. About forty-five minutes in it is discovered that the peaceful village has been taken over by ""robot-aliens-that-aren't-really-robots"" referred to as ""blanks"" by the gang of friends and enemies. But the most entertaining aspect of all this is that as the stakes begin to rise, the group of friends become more drunk, and more ridiculous, and more hilarious.The film takes no time to breathe and every frame is colorful filled to the brim and nothing feels boring or convoluted. Edgar Wright's fast transitions and writing keeps the film alive and exciting. The action sequences are the best I've seen in a long time surprisingly due to there always being something bad-ass or comical to gaze lovingly upon. The emotions that flow through you aren't just pure hysterics, your actually attached to the characters and the actions they make.The last 20 minutes of the movie surprisingly address some unexpected underlined messages about technology and human behavior. It confuses you temporarily and may dull the finale's impact for you, but I was able to look past the rushed flaws of it and grin. It still seemed heavy handed to me however and didn't seem to fit the mood of the rest of the trilogy. But I applaud Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg for taking that risk with their script.In short, ""The World's End"" is the funniest comedy of the summer in this reviewer's opinion. It's snappy script, eye-widening cinematography, and impeccable acting from Pegg, Frost, and everyone in-between, always keeps you entranced and in endless laughs.",The World's End
282,btnthx,Please don't let it end,10,22 August 2013,"Everyone remembers the best night of their life. The one thing we all have in common with our best nights is that you never wanted it to end. You and your friends all have those stories, the ones we tell about that perfect night. Well I am going to assure you, that you and your friends don't have a story like this group of guys. Well unless your story can top saving the world, all while making a pub run didn't think so.Gary (Simon Pegg) was the cool guy in High School you wanted to be like. Good looking, fun, and didn't care about what anyone thought of him. Gary had a group of friends who followed him; there was Oliver (Martin Freeman), Steven (Paddy Considine), Peter (Eddie Marsan) and Andy (Nick Frost). In 1990 they tried to do the golden mile, a trip to twelve pubs ending at The World's End. They did not make it, but it was still one of those nights you won't forget. Flash forward twenty years later and Gary wants to finish what they couldn't finish twenty years earlier. Things have changed though, only Gary has remained the same, somehow he convinces the group to get to give it another try, and they head back home to finish the golden mile. Something about the town is different though, and not the normal time passage different, it is more like the town has been taken over by robots different. That doesn't stop Gary from wanting to complete what he came to do. All he and his friends have to do is fight the evil robots and make it to The World's End.What is the perfect trilogy? That can be an easy question to answer, if you think of a trilogy in the normal sense. Yeah you have trilogies like ""Star Wars"" ""The Godfather"", and ""The Matrix"" series, but what about the 'Cornetto' Trilogy? Some of you may be asking what the 'Cornetto' trilogy is, well let me tell you. It is ""Shaun of the Dead, ""Hot Fuzz"", and the grand finale ""The World's End"". The series gets its name from Cornetto Ice Cream, which makes an appearance in all three films. The other thing all three films have in common is that they were all written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg and directed by Edgar Wright. You hope this is not the end of this perfect partnership, a partnership that goes back to 1999 on a great TV series called ""Spaced"". It is really hard to not enjoy a movie like ""The World's End"" a movie that provides you with everything you need, it is like the perfect balanced meal. It is easy to say ""Edgar Wright has done it again"", but he really has. I implore you to go to your local cinema and watch one of the best movies of the summer and would make any day a perfect day. In fact the only thing that could make it any better, would be to enjoy a Cornetto, while you watch the perfect way to end the Cornetto Trilogy.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",The World's End

285,dhruvbehl24,the end of trilogy is not good enough i expected,7,8 November 2014,"the film started like every other Corneto film, allowing us to get attached to our lead characters, learning a bit about their backgrounds through comical contexts! The film follows our five leads, portrayed by Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy and Eddie, whom 20 years after a failed pub crawl, reunite to repeat the crawl and return to their hometown, Newton Haven, to do so. However, all is not what it seems. Over the due course of the night, the gang began to discover that the town has been taken over by robots attempting to ""reform humankind"", completing the crawl becomes the least of their worries. The film is clever, like Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz they have mixed two genres, this time Sci-Fiction and Comedy, to create a film on par with the rest. From the first pint all the way through to the ""bitter end.. or lager end"" the crew have to use their wits to avoid being detected and caught by the pursuing robots, all of which ends with devastating consequences. It is a must-see if you enjoyed the other two. Edgar Wright's trilogy has come to a good end! Its good but not better than Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz.",The World's End
286,nfrankis01,The golden mile fell a few yards short,8,1 August 2013,"Sometimes when I watch a film it can take a little time to digest it for me to say that I either liked, loved, disliked or hated it. This was one of those films!........ I love Pegg, Frost & Wright from Spaced onwards. Shaun of the Dead...awesome, Hot Fuzz...what's not to like ....but The Worlds End took some time to come to conclusion on how I felt....how did you feel? I hear you ask.....well I liked it. It certainly is the weakest of the three in the Cornetto Trilogy but can still stand up straight and be counted as really good film. It took some time to get started and from the off you can't really bond with Pegg's character.....but perhaps that's a good thing as he is pretty much a loser. There are some generally funny moments/lines in this film but none that I can see being quoted like in Shaun or Fuzz. I have to admit the bit where Gary King (Pegg) confronts the entity whilst surrounded by the 'smashy smashy egg men' was kinda stupid and left me thinking was this the best that Pegg & Wright could come up with.....that said the fight scenes were really good and the special effects were awesome. I loved the fact that Nick Frosts character wasn't the side kick and for a big guy could quite move when kicking ass (or arse depending on how you want to say it). The final scene was a great homage to the post apocalyptic films and was quite uplifting to see that even though King was a loser before now he was back on top. All in all an enjoyable film but if you we're going to have a DVD fest with the Trilogy I would watch them in reverse order ending on the best last.",The World's End
287,BlairMcLovin,"Solid comedy, and even solid der conclusion to the cornetto trilogy",7,2 August 2013,"The premise of The World's End fits comfortably into where the filmmakers find themselves at this point in their career. Wright, Pegg and Frost have all had successful in films despite the absence of one another and here they are reuniting to close out the trilogy and try to recapture the fun of their earlier work. While I'd say the film on the whole is less successful than Shaun of the dead and Hot Fuzz in its execution and hilarity, I still enjoyed watching it unfold in the presence of these three talents (even if nostalgia was a big part of that). The films premise is essentially an Invasion of the Body Snatchers scenario transplanted into rural England, a setting which I've always loved about Wright's films of this sort. This element continues to be a great source of humor as no matter how outlandish the situations become, there's a small-town simplicity and bewilderment towards the events that grounds the film and gives way to some great regional-specific jokes.Although the film works as a whole it falls short is in comparison to the earlier two entries in the trilogy which felt more immediate and fresh. Where Shaun of the dead came from a genuine love of zombie films and wanting to satirize them or Hot Fuzz's clear reverence for the cop films it was taking off, World's End often feels like closing the trilogy was more of a duty than a necessary venting of creativity.That comparison aside I did enjoy the film's themes of growing up and how people change as it provided a nice emotional resonance to propel the comedy within it. So all in all I really enjoyed The World's End, but I'd hesitate to chuck it in on instead of the first two entries.",The World's End

It was flat, grisly, humorless, ridiculously stupid, and extremely boring! It was like a wet biscuit left in cold tea.Dreadful! Who writes such crap?? And the vulgar crudeness was far too much, why go to such foul-mouth filth??! That alone was enough to tarnish any positive thought that my family and I may have had about it. It just cheapened the whole movie and the actors. The only one I loved in it was Pierce Brosnan, now he WAS funny! but what a waste of talent!. His small part was better than all of the other actors. Otherwise, nothing funny about it at all. My family and I were waiting for the laughs but not even a smile from any of us. All we said to each other was ""What a load of rubbish!"". Many parts were quite horrific and sickening with the smashing and ripping off of heads yeah, very loving and charming! Don't care if they were alien robots or not.

Its written with the emotional immaturity of a 10yr old! I cannot comprehend people who love these kind of movies and can laugh all the way thru them its abnormal and creepy.

The friends, including Frost, Considine, Marsan & Freeman, find that life has them in very different places now. All except for King who is stuck in the past. As they crawl along they argue, they laugh and then battle all sorts of hooded robot aliens, as you do. The language is quite strong throughout, that was a bit surprising but not being easily offended it wasn't a problem, some might not be so tolerant. It is amusing for the most part, but I wouldn't say there are any real lingering jokes, bar one.

Definitely one for the fans but it stands alone well so seeing any thing previously is not a necessity.",The World's End
290,goc6283,"While no means a bad film, this is the weakest of the trilogy",7,11 November 2014,"Oh the lovable Cornetto trilogy. With it's crass British humor, and some hilarity by Pegg and the cast. In terms of this film specifically, it has some of the fun from both of his previous films, but it does not feel as creative or as well done, or least for the first half.The movie starts with the idea of a pub crawl. At this point, the characters are in general rather boring while Pegg is obnoxious, not just to the other characters, but also to the audience (and not in a way that is humorous.) You are happy when they down the first/second/third pint as the characters develop a bit more though you wonder why they followed the buffoon.The plot that develops from there is ludicrous but much more fascinating, with blue techno-color blood and some humor thrown in there. These fight scenes are similar to the ones in Shawn of the Dead, but not as diverse or well parodied, at least till the end.The final scene at the World's End is probably the single point in the film where it really feels like one of their films, not your generic science-fiction or apocalyptic film. The conversation between him and the network is both fascinating and absolutely hilarious. It offers an excellent conclusion to an otherwise lackluster film.The first 1/4 of the film gets a 5. the 2nd gets a 6, the 3rd gets a 7, and the final gets an 8. I'll round it down as it takes way too long to get to the good scenes.",The World's End
291,saggarwal82,A fun filled journey with friends turns unforgettable...,7,11 January 2014,"Pretty good movie with friends running around with a plan (well no plan) in mind and just trying to have fun time. Simon did a fantastic job leading the charge and driving the movie forward - with his laid back attitude, jokes with reflections of stupidity mixed with intelligence. Overall, movie would have fell short if it was not up to him. Just to be clear, everyone else did pretty good job too.I mostly liked the first half when it was real fun watching all the friends pulling each others legs while remembering their school days and what they did. Second half was less interesting but it was not bad. Overall, good comedy and worth watching.",The World's End

It isn't as brilliant as Hot Fuzz which I can watch time and time again and still need to watch through till the end. It isn't quite as touching or well executed as Shaun of the Dead, though it does have its warming moments.I'm not entirely sure the end is as good as it could have been.It is a good end to the trilogy, though. I like how they've switched around the friendship between Pegg and Frost this time, so Pegg is the idiot who's more likely to get himself killed and Frost is the sensible one who cares, too much, in spite of all the let downs. I almost expected it to stay the same and wondered how they'd almost kill Frost this time! I've always been a Pegg fan, since Big Train, he can't do much wrong by me. But I've tried to be as critical as possible considering I was so happy just to see the guys back in action.

294,abjerg01,The hate this movie gets is starting to get on my nerves real bad,7,29 December 2013,"First off, I'm not going to hold everybody against the wall with a gun at their genitals, asking them to please like this movie or I shoot their freaking balls off. I'm not that that kind of person (and who is anyways). But I want to clear something up here, because I'm getting pretty tired of watching this movie's rating keep on descending here on IMDb, currently holding a 7.1, and on top of that observe all the hilariously stupid hate-arguments people use to shoot this movie down. I honestly think people have forgotten how it was like to watch these movies for the first time, and why they found the first two in the series funny in the first place. Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were never as hyped as The World's End was, and I think people expected something else this time around, other than what they were used to from the series... Something bigger, something way beyond Shaun and Hot Fuzz. The fact is this IS different, and people tend to not look at the movie in a bigger perspective. All the hidden metaphors and references may be overlooked because all they can think of is: 'well this is basically Shaun of the Dead all over again isn't it"" NO it's not. NOT at all. I think people need to clear their minds and learn to appreciate good cinema when they see it. I think this got the 'bad-movie' sticker on it WAY too early, and it has become 'that movie to hate' even though it does not deserve that - yes that's my opinion but hear me out here...It is the 3rd movie in a brilliant series, of course it's hard to live up to. But I dare all of you to see it once more, and look at the unique signature directing style and editing from Mr. Wright, the perfectly timed jokes, and after that look up some analysis of the movie. I'm not saying you are going to like it after a second watch, I'm not saying that you did not get some of the references in the first viewing already either. I'm just saying that people rating this as low as 1 or 2/10 are completely insane. Maybe you don't like the concept, fine. Maybe you didn't like the ending, fine. But there has to be HELL OF A LOT wrong with this if you rate it as low as some of the worst movies ever made.",The World's End
295,FugitiveAmoeba,"Funny, but not memorable",7,10 January 2014,"The much loved Cornetto trilogy comes to an end with ""The World's End"" which is perhaps not the best of the three, but definitely a good film when viewed in isolation. The cast now includes Martin Freeman (who's suddenly popping up everywhere), Paddy Considine and Eddie Marsan which makes for a jolly group and the chemistry seems natural.Edgar Wright's films often mold the world to cater to the lead character's idiosyncrasies and not the other way around, and this involves bizzaro trips involving aliens, zombies and murderous cults. The world of ""The World's End"" gives a meaning and purpose to Simon Pegg's character ""Gary King"" who's still stuck in his adolescent phase and all the wanton exuberance that comes with it, unlike the rest of his mates who have grown up, but still look back to their days of youth fondly. Hackneyed premise, but not overly so.The film never gets the laughs ""Shaun of the Dead"" did, nor is it particularly memorable. But what you get is an evenly amusing affair, with some really well-choreographed fight sequences and clever dialogue. A decent finale to a great trilogy. 7/10",The World's End
296,ijozic,"Uninspired, slow, disappointing..",4,14 October 2013,"Shaun of the Dead was great fun, although somewhat uneven as the movie falls apart somewhat as it draws to the end (IMHO). Hot Fuzz fixed that and is a very well-rounded experience with a unique blend of humour, action and mystery and a great team chemistry by Pegg and Frost. Thus, i expected something in that vein with a touch of The Body Snatchers blended in. Unfortunately, this movie has got very little of that magic.(SPOILERS present)It starts much too slow, most of the main characters don't bring anything fun or interesting to the movie (the other three main actors) and a lot of time initially is wasted in some boring dialogs to give them some introduction and depth (or at least try to). Pegg's character's childish behaviour gets tiring soon as he is basically the only one out of five who is actually contributing to the movie. So, instead of them doing their fun stuff, they are dragged into some side- story about growing up (and refusing to in Pegg's case) and old romantic interests which actually takes most of the movie over. And the parts which were supposed to be serious/scary (the Body Snatchers taking over the town) were on the other hand represented in a simplistic and silly way (alien robots which leak blue stuff when disassembled). So, in a way, this movie reverses everything which worked with the previous movie. Thus, we are forced to go through long boring uninspiring non- funny dialogs between characters with little to no chemistry between them going through too many bars and (later) fighting the same robots over and over again until the anticlimactic showdown (although some of the Pegg exchange with the aliens is providing some relief) followed by clichéd and overly protracted epilogue.It feels like the authors had a few general ideas about the movie, but either they were not inspired at all in developing it into a full blown movie or those ideas were too few. Watchable for a few laughs here and there, but more as a melancholic reminder of past times (and music).",The World's End
297,magpie13,More Dark than Larf,9,10 February 2016,This is my favorite of the 'Cornetto' trilogy.It's not the funniest ('Shaun of the Dead' is the funniest).But it is the most (I hate too say) 'Mature'.It's the story of a man who has never 'grown up' and his efforts to recreate his youth. His friends have all moved on. His town has been incorporated and his life has become a Goth cliché.The comedy of this film often makes fun of this sad man which makes many viewers uncomfortable. If they had made this as a drama it would win an Oscar.It's a new kind of 'tragi-comedy' and not for everyone.,The World's End
298,KoreanPenguin,The Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy Strikes Again!,8,17 September 2013,"And with one final ""Hurrah!"" Edgar Wright's Blood and Ice Cream (or Three Flavours Cornetto) Trilogy finally and sadly comes to a close. Be assured however; fans of both 2004′s ""Shaun of the Dead"" and 2007′s ""Hot Fuzz"" can breathe a sigh of relief in knowing that ""The World's End"" not only lives up to expectations, but succeeds in setting a new standard for any potential follow-up for the combination of Wright and lead-duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.Early trailers for ""The World's End"" likely left most viewers a bit skeptical upon seeing Pegg's character, Gary King, for the first time. Please for a brief moment and only a brief moment, let us revisit our high school years. King was the high school burnout/dropout. He was the guy who would pat the back of a substitute teacher, only to leave behind a sign, reading, ""PLEASE KICK ME."" He is despicable and quite revolting. Fast forward fifteen to twenty years or so. King is still the exact same man, if I could even call him a man, because he is in fact still a juvenile boy at heart and mind. He is the kind of guy who probably still hangs out in the high school parking lot and sees nothing wrong with that.Enter our plot. ""The World's End"" opens with King narrating the ultimate 12 pub, pub crawl, nicknamed ""The Golden Mile."" This was a dangerous voyage that King and four other friends had attempted when they were but wee high school students. They had nearly completed the trek, when suddenly something went wrong, and the details are left a little fuzzy; after 11 pints, I could only imagine it so.Fast forward many years later and King is getting the old band back together. It seems that everyone has moved on with their lives, pursuing careers, marriage, whatever it may be, King doesn't have it. It is here where we meet the ol' gang, including Oliver (Martin Freeman), Steven (Paddy Considine), and Peter (Eddie Marsan). After a bit of convincing and their return to Newton Haven to attempt the pub crawl, we are introduced briefly to Oliver's sister, Sam (Rosamund Pike).Everything leading up to the eventual discovery that there is indeed something awry in old Newtown Haven is very fun. The cast takes the script to its limit and continues to push it. This is a fantastic group of actors together, and at many times we feel as if they all had actually truly grown up with one another. From the drive in King's ancient car, to conversations in The First Post (Bar #1 on the Golden Mile) ""The World's End"" is quite a bit of fun.I wish I could expound more on the events in the second half of the film, but it's so much more fun to experience it yourself. I've kept this review solely to the first half, and to the overall message of the movie.Director Edgar Wright uses snap zooms and close-ups like a veteran. Fast cuts have been a staple of the Cornetto Trilogy, and if you are at all familiar with the other two before mentioned films, then jumping over garden fences should be yet another throwback you will enjoy. Have no fear though. While Wright is not afraid to revisit his past work, ""The World's End"" is filled with new and original comedic ideas. Almost everything seems to work well here.Wright has developed a wonderful science fiction story for us here, reminiscent of a classic sci-fi like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" albeit, much more of a spoof than anything else. He takes time to poke fun at many of today's science fiction movies that perhaps take themselves a pint too seriously (if I may use such an expression). *SPOILER* Wright also takes the chance to have a little fun with the post-apocalyptic genre as well, which has become quite popular with science fiction these days. *SPOILER*There are many visual treats throughout ""The World's End"" including: wall or street signs behind our characters that are written to cleverly juxtapose whatever the character is saying, plenty of explosions, and positively fantastic fight choreography that would make Jackie Chan proud.The overall message here is friendship, and while you're trying to rekindle and hold fast to it, try to have yourself a little fun too. This is a movie where there is plenty of room for the ridiculous and absurd, but only because it works so well. The more impossible the situation, the better and more unrealistic and unlikely the solution will be to fix it. This is the close to the Cornetto, and this is ""The World's End.""Cheers.",The World's End
299,ivo-ivan,a kinda funny story that is told in an original way,6,5 January 2014,"This is not a great 9/10 or 10/10 movie in any way. But it pictures an original story that is put together in a funny and unorthodox way. It's different from most comedies. I suppose one is most likely to either think ""it was original and amusing in its own way"", or to find it boring.Five young men are having a crazy night out- a story to remember and to tell your friends about. Not to be too proud about but to tell with some sense of pride still.Say 20 years later, one of them is bringing them together to repeat it and to finish some ""unfinished business"" they were after back then. Most of them have families at that point and represent the settled down, middle class, having a steady job, being serious and responsible, the reasonable and the mature.At that point, the movie pictures the 'serious' fixation of this type of people in their habit of being serious. A stark contrast is made with a person who is their age but has preserved his youthful craziness and immaturity in the context of having fun and not thinking too much. At this point the movie could make one re-evaluate some of his or her values.Then the story makes a completely different turn. That is where it becomes funny (if you are fond of this kind of humor) and unorthodox.At the end there is this BIG philosophical argument: Freedom vs Perfection. I cannot take it seriously, so I take it from the funny side. How do YOU take it ?",The World's End
300,josephledbury,A fitting (World's) End to the Cornetto trilogy.,8,30 July 2013,"A short review of The World's End (2013)Firstly, i'm a big fan of Pegg-Frost-Wright and this was a perfect conclusion to the cornetto eating, jumping over fences, beer drinking trilogy. shaun of the Dead and Hot fuzz were brilliant and as I walked into the cinema I was wondering if The World's End could live up to it's expectations and be as good as shaun of the Dead and hot Fuzz.Go out on a bang is what they say and what a bang. Simon Pegg's characters in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were kinda mellow, cool guys who were reasonably calm, but in this movie he is the funniest in his role because he is so impulsive and rude. And it's the other way round with Frost's character as he is usually the rude or immature one, but in this movie he is the mature, responsible one who knows right from wrong unlike Pegg's character. The special effects were brilliant, a lot more fighting in this one than the other two in the cornetto trilogy but as i said; go out on a bang. The ending was unexpected and was so much more different the endings of Shaun and Fuzz. I think the funniest thing about this movie is that the five main characters had to go threw all the crap and intensity of the movie which in most situations you would deal with easier if you were sober ,while they were drunk off their ass. Good acting with a hlarious and at the same time serious situation and just a hilarious English comedy which proves that England can provide as good movies as Hollywood.",The World's End
301,andymike-75725,Neither funny or endearing,4,8 September 2019,"Like many people i have very good memories of Shaun of the dead and Hot fuzz however something kept me from going out of my way to see this movie. It just didn't seem to be very fun. It looked over the top, screamy and silly.Not after finally having seen the movie i can confirm that it was over the top, screamy and silly. It starts of well enough with a couple of old friends meeting up to go to a couple of pubs. It is not all that funny but it is nice and comfortable enough and you think it will grow on you.Then the robots happen. The drama and character relationship gets completely thrown out of the window. Some people might disagree and claim that these elements remain in the film but i reject that. When characters don't even react to hearing that their friends had been killed that is when i know that the people behind the film has stopped caring.Sure enough there is some pegg/frost bonding scenes because of course there is but i really don't care. The second half of the movie is pretty nonsencical and the ending is bad.Overall the idea of people getting wasted is by itself just not very fun and the movie does not have either the heart, action or jokes to make it interesting. It is just over the top lol so random silliness with shouting drunk people. I for one didn't enjoy it. It is watchable and have some good scenes but it is nothing i would recommend and the ending left a bad taste in my mouth.",The World's End

It has Simon Pegg reprising a similar role to that in Shau of the dead, as he fits perfectly into the role of lovable looser it is a very good fit here as well. He is joined by his happy gang of misfits like in his other masterpieces of comedy, being a group not unlike the frat pack of the us, only infinitely more comedic proace between them. This is a movie I would recommend to anyone that enjoyed hot fuzz, Shaun of the dead, how to lose friends and alienate people, or in fact those who like British comedy at all. I would also recommend it to those who like more American style comedies as well as it has enough humor that does not only resound with those people who do not understand or enjoy British comedy. Basically it is just a hilarious movie, watch it and than me later.",The World's End
304,mariogamer2000,"A little dissapionted (Quick Review, Please don't read if you like long reviews)",7,19 July 2013,"Im a huge fan of Simon Pegg and nick frost, I loved the first two cornetto films. Did I love this movie like the first two instalments, No. But I still really liked it. So The Worlds End stars of course, Simon Pegg and Nick frost. They play brand new characters once again and never the less do a good job of that. There always great(By the way Nick frost kicks some ass in this film). This film also stars Rosamund Pike,Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine. I have no complaints from the cast, I think they all did a good job. Surprisingly Rosamund pike was good and yet again plays a character named Sam.Now about the humour. I was little let down by the Humour in this film, it was a little weak for me. Although there were a few laughs in there, only about twice worked really well for me. If im to be honest, this was more of an action film than a comedy, and yes you can argue the first two were also.Which brings me to the action, the action scenes or the fight scenes if you like, were shot really really well, Edgar Wright done a superb job with those scenes and did a great job overall, he has definitely perfected his directing for the final instalment. But as I said before, the screenplay from Simon Pegg and Nick frost wasn't up to scratch for me, considering this was the final instalment of the cornetto trilogy. I felt it could of had a much better screenplay and been a lot more funnier.But the action was great, the CGI wasn't too bad, I mean you don't watch a comedy and expect amazing CGI. But it was good. Overall I still really enjoyed this film. It was definitely entertaining, but if your a huge fan like me, you will probably feel a little let down. But never the less, this was still a fun film. I do recommend this if your a fan of the other instalments. So Im going to give, The Worlds End a 3 and 1/2 Star rating. (7/10).Like most films could of been a lot better, specially when you have talents like Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Thank you for reading my review(Sorry for my bad punctuation), and I hope you have a great time watching this film.",The World's End

306,summeriris,The penalties of growing up and the penalties of staying a child,7,30 July 2013,"'The World's End' is such a British film. The bitterness is harsh and the sweetness very hard to find. The darkness of the comedy is simply so typical of the British. This is a film where anarchy is applauded to a certain extent and conformity something to run screaming from. At the same time it recognises the perils of anarchy and why some people like conformity. It is a film balanced on the edge of a sword and having great fun in the balancing act. Pegg and Wright have written both an extremely funny film and a very dark Scyfy horror.Pegg excels in the role of Gary, the Peter Pan of his generation. The boy all his mates thought was so cool before they grew up and became the adult he refuses to be. They both envy him and hate him. Nick Frost is strong, tough and the survivor. He is the rock to which Gary clings.I really liked the film. I laughed at all the jokes and all the geekiness of it. I loved the flavour of 'The Stepford Wives' and 'The Invasion of the BodySnatcher'. (The original book that is.) And I loved how Gary King stayed the same and how Nick Frost didn't.",The World's End

This film's unpredictable which is what I'd like in a movie. Simon Pegg's performance surprised me considering how he's characters are in the previous films but still I loved his performance.. However, having Nick Frost's performance was quite unexpected but great as well. Paddy Considine, Rosamund Pike, Eddie Marsan and Pierce Brosnan's performances in here were perfect.

308,andreolimarco,The circle is closed,8,28 June 2017,"The World's End is the last chapter of the Cornetto trilogy. I must admit I had totally lost this film and I had removed the idea I had missed the 3rd part of the Cornetto trilogy. Fortunately a friend of mine, who probably didn't know the first two films, advised me to watch this ""fantastic"" movie. So I bought the blu-ray. Director/author Edgar Wright and actor/author Simon Pegg come back to close the circle, that circle opened with the terrific Shaun Of The Dead (which wasn't a parody of the zombie films, but a film with zombies who made people laugh) and continued with Hot Fuzz.This time our heroes must face an alien menace. Five school friends, now in their 40s, go back to their youth town to try to complete the Golden Mile, that is to visit the 12 pubs of the town, drinking one beer pint in each pub, till the last one, The World's End. Everything seems strange since the very beginning, people behave in a strange way, they seem to not recognize the five lads. Soon they will discover something took control of the population.The style is unique, great writing as usual from Wright-Pegg couple with tons of funny situations and lines. The cast is made up of Pegg himself, omnipresent Nick Frost (great chemistry with Simon Pegg, as usual), Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, Paddy Considine and Rosamund Pike. There is also a small but significant role for former 007 Pierce Brosnan. Maybe the idea isn't so original, after all they are only aliens, even though here they are ""good"" and want to save the Earth population from self-destruction. The ending is the best they may have chosen.It's hard to choose which chapter is the best. Personally I love Shaun Of The Dead above all, because of the horror component, but it's undeniable that both Hot Fuzz and The World's End are amazing and funny.Wright and Pegg do have a huge talent about writing wacky stories. Hope they will continue on this path.",The World's End

310,john3-2,"Decent film, worth it if you're a fan of Shaun and Hot Fuzz",6,26 August 2013,"Based on the prior films in the Cornetto trilogy (Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz) I had high hopes the The World's End. When I left the theater after viewing World's End I felt a little let down, both because of the script as well as the execution. Since I've indicated the review contains spoilers then I will assume that you have seen the film or that you don't mind knowing about the film in advance.SPOILERS!The film starts pretty well, good voice-over from Simon Pegg to give us the history and then a nice montage to bring us up to present day and start us on the adventure. The film drags a little bit in the first third but gains momentum as they start the pub crawl and kicks into gear when they first battle the robots.From here it moved really well for a while, funny, action packed, entertaining, and with some humanity as well. The old gang started to gel, and it was quite entertaining. The last third of the film mostly fell apart for me. The best moment was when they met up in the old shack and verified their identities by checking old scars. Other than that the rest of the film had several problems for me.1: I thought the fight scenes were a bit long, and I was less than impressed with the robots and their abilities. 2: Two key members of the pub crawl are killed by the aliens, and very little is made of that. Added to the fact that the robots appear kind of incompetent initially it feels mean-spirited.3: The scene in the base below The World's End was too long, and too dumb. The alien arguing with two drunk humans just seemed silly, but without being funny. 4: And what exactly was up with the final scene where Simon Pegg shows up at a pub with ""empties"" and demands water for all of them. Is he now hanging with empties? So, for the first two thirds and bits of the final third I give the film a 6. It could have been better, and I was disappointed as I wanted it to be great.",The World's End
311,jorn-truyen,Endurable,7,31 August 2014,"Mostly, I don't really care for apocalyptic comedies, but Edgar Wright's third feature of the Cornetto Trilogy was not that bad a film. This film again features the dynamic duo, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. This time, Gary King and his five old friends reattempt 20 years later a legendary pub crawl with 12 pubs to make it to 'The World's End', but along the way they find out that their old stomping ground Newton Haven has mysteriously changed into a robotic nightmare. Wright's trademark comedy is always catchy, and his witty dialogue is perhaps even further developed in this movie. The four other guys have grown up and moved on with their lives, but Gary obviously has not ""come of age"". More than the other Edgar Wright films, 'The World's End' has some seriousness shining through. Gary's alienation and problems with alcoholism are ambiguously sad and funny at the same time. However, the film's ambition to deal with serious themes seems misplaced.There are a lot of funny bits in the film, but unfortunately less than in for example 'Hot Fuzz'. The best parts are when the comic persona of Gary or one of the others is driven to absurdity (e.g. Gary is always right). Situation humour and irony are present as well: Gary fights off numerous ""blanks"" trying to drink his pint. Although questions can be raised as regards story and character layers, all in all the film's certainly worth a watch.",The World's End

Gary King is just an idiot and he has 0 interesting quotes.I like Martin Freeman and the acting was nice actually but too much tempo without seriously 0 interesting material made me want to finish it as soon as I can.And the robots and people's decision making didnt make sense.

317,Emhilradim,"Smashing, absolutely smashing",9,18 September 2013,"Having watched the previous films in the ""Blood and Icecream Trilogy,"" as it is dubbed, I went into The World's End assuming it would be business as usual. Your typical dialogue-focused comedy movie, with one or two action sets, while the comedy stands alone. I was gravely mistaken, but for me, it worked out really well.Normally I don't care about this kind of thing, it's not a martial arts film to be certain, but honestly the choreography for the fighting scenes was masterfully done. This is in part, because the fights are not static in any sense of the word. Instead every fight was alive, and there were things going on in the foreground, in the background, and the fight scenes really flowed like water. These guys have been doing this for a while, and they have most definitely mastered their style with World's End. I'd love to see what Pegg, Wright, and Frost could pull together for their next film (and of course, I hope there will be a next film).This movie is the stuff of adventures, and definitely works to keep you both excited and laughing. A definite ""must have"" for any collection. I wasn't expecting to find a new favourite film, certainly not in a movie about five men trying to go between 12 bars in a town so small you'd be surprised there's more than one or two, but this movie really sells it.",The World's End

Having seen and enjoyed Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Paul I knew it was going to be fun. However, I did not see any trailers or read anything about the plot beforehand which really added to the overall experience. I recommend anyone considering to see this movie to do the same. At first, it seems to be a low-budget, British version of the Hangover. Do not worry, it is not. The movie is bizarre, awkward, but most importantly of all a lot of fun. The movie ranks amongst some of the most pleasant surprises of this year for me. The movie is highly original and full of surprises.",The World's End

Same old quick transition splices, same old pubs, stuff borrowed off ""Shaun of the Dead"" and done worse. A story borrowed this time off Halloween 3. Pegg looks ridiculous with that black hair. The film is actually boring in parts.I wanted to like this film, but I just can't give the crew a pass for this mess and being lazy.

320,KiltedGreen,This beer's flat with no lingering finish at the end,4,24 July 2013,"I absolutely loved Hot Fuzz. When I saw the cinema trailer I laughed myself silly and when I saw it a week later it had the same effect and when watching the film I almost had to be wiped off the floor at the end - everything about it was just right; drama, mystery, action, gags, horror, wit, humour, camera-work and suspense. I bought the DVD and have watched it at least 5 or 6 times and love it every single time.The World's End has but a few good moments and even now, one day after seeing it, I can't remember what most of them are. There are some good action moments, but the film just doesn't hang together. In Hot Fuzz there's the main protagonists' brilliant relationship along with their own character development that deepens and enriches the film along with the parade of fleshed-out and quirky characters living in the town, without ever detracting from the main story. Here the relationship between the annoying and idiotic 'King' and his friends never feels real enough to have sustained the essential premise of the entire film.The main story just doesn't go anywhere and like many others on here, by the end I was fairly indifferent to whatever fate befell any of them. The same (non)reaction seemed to envelop most of the audience too. The World's End will never become a treasured DVD for me.I was looking forward to this ever since I heard it was being made and now that I've seen it I'd be very reluctant to see a fourth if they should ever make one (""Never say never""). They should have left it at the blazing comedy star that is Hot Fuzz.",The World's End
321,ConnorMacleodoftheClanMacleod,A Fitting End,8,3 June 2019,"Firstly, I'd like to address the nay sayers who critique this film. It is evident from reading their comments that they have no idea that this film is part of the Cornetto Trilogy and their comments fall short.Secondly, don't look too deep into this film, it wasn't meant for that. The first film of the series was about an average joe surviving the zombie apocalypse, the second film was about a brilliant cop solving crime in a murderous town and now the third is about a group of school friends who, albeit reluctantly, come back to their hometown to finish a pub crawl, however they did not expect it to have been taken over by aliens that basically run our world.Simon Pegg stars as Gary King, a man unfulfilled and stuck in his past blaze of glory, who orchestrates an unwilling pub crawl with school friends he hasn't seen in decades. These friends consist of a pedigree of British actors, Nick Frost a straight laced office worker who has a particular hatred towards Gary, Martin Freeman a pretentious estate agent, Paddy Considine a normal run of the mill architect And Eddie Marsan, a mouse of a man working at his fathers dealership.Gary collects all men under the pretence of his mother dying and gets them back to their old village where they attempt to do a pub crawl that's finishes at The Worlds End. As they begin their journey through their old town it become apparent that things aren't quite right, they are almost exactly the same as they were twenty years previous. As the pub crawl continues events start to unravel, Rosamund Pike enters the fray as a love interest between Pegg and Considines characters. Pierce Brosnan appears a cool Headmaster and to finish the trilogy an appearance from Bill Nighy occurs.I shall not ruin the film anymore not give the plot away further. Out of the three Cornetto Films this is my least favourite, but that does not take anything away from this film as it is still brilliant! I would watch this again and again!",The World's End
322,AdamBowl23,The World's End May Be Wright's Best Yet,8,18 September 2013,"The World's End is the third film by director Edgar Wright and actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, with the previous films being Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. I was a big fan of both of those and going into The World's End, I didn't see how it could live up to either of them, but I still hoped it would be entertaining. Well, I ended up being surprised because this may be my favorite of the three. The story is about a washed up 40 something guy(Pegg) who gets his old school buddies together to do a pub crawl in their hometown. All of the buddies have moved on, with either wives, kids, and good jobs and view Pegg's character as a guy stuck in suspended adolescence. When the group arrives to the town, they soon discover that almost all of the city's residents have been replaced by robots and the action ensues from there. It doesn't sound like the most brilliant story in the world, but Wright is great at taking genres and giving them more than just what people expect. In a movie about crazy robots, I never would have expected to relate to a lot of the film's themes and the motivation behind Pegg's character to want to do the pub crawl. Comedian Paul F. Tompkins summed it up best with his brief review, ""The World's End is a fun, funny, smart, touching movie that you should see. YOU DESERVE GOOD ENTERTAINMENT!"" I also want to give praise to the soundtrack which included some of the more obscure (to us in the US at least) songs from the 90's. I can't remember the last time I heard Teenage Fanclub. And the action sequences were really good too, I'd stack them up with some of the big action movies of the last few years. So with this being the 4th film of Wright's I've seen(Scott Pilgrim vs The World being the other), I think I can safely say that Wright is the current master of the action/comedy and I can't wait to see what he does with Ant-Man.",The World's End

324,chas_newport,Wished it Would End,4,23 July 2013,"Here's the thing about expectations. I loved Hot Fuzz and have watched it five or six times with different people, enjoying it anew through their reactions. The dream team are back together with some stellar additions and the entire plot premise is based around that staple of adolescence, the pub crawl. The trailer is fabulous and even gives a nod to the collapsing fence gag but done by Pegg this time... What could go wrong?Quite a lot actually.Pegg plays a character who is so unremittingly obnoxious that by the time the moment of redemption heaves its rotting carcass over the hill you really don't give a damn. He spends the first thirty minutes with his mirthless grin, his back slapping enthusiasm and his voice turned up to eleven and I was overwhelmed by the feeling that, in real life, someone would have punched him by now.The other characters are a pretty dull and predictable bunch too and frankly by the time the perilous bits kicked in I really didn't care who lived or died.",The World's End

327,jesussaddle,Different Humor But Worth It - In The End,7,19 May 2014,"Really this is ambitious in a different way than the first two pictures in the trilogy. The humor isn't the main target apparently. The examination of the topics is, and this provide the greatest payoff in sarcastic humor as the film draws to a close. In fact, I'm still catching it and I watched it an hour ago. Like a long joke that no one character delivers.. A joke that you get, and continue to get, from right around the punch line to the next week, month, year...I liken it to Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life.Why I think the film is less appealing to some is that it is delivering social satire that seems ambivalent, and perhaps this is the intent. If a viewer were uncomfortable with the underlying questions it would be hard to get past the first 2/3 of the film. This commentary is about our quests as humans and whether they add value to us or detract from some ""higher"" purpose. Who gets to judge our missions, or how we act as accomplices to each others' dreams? It doesn't help those uncomfortable with self-examination that the main character is in need of it. And his early life friends and admirers are not so much more inspiring. The film could really use a second character, like the female love interest, Sam, but with a little more true levity or enthusiasm rather than sarcasm - IF appeal to the masses is the goal. The Meaning Of Life is similar in its lack of apparent fun and mirth - being dark in a different way than the other Python films. If you want either Shaun or Fuzz this film is not going to exactly answer the need. But especially if you enjoy delving into darker territory than slapstick (which plays here for a different reason than cheap laughs; rather it builds by way of blue peaceful light, and blue blood...) you may love this, long after you watch it. Its a great movie again from the very talented 'Network' of writer/actors, who may not exactly have a new franchise here. Oh, wait, that's the point!",The World's End
328,samfran94,Cornetto Loses Its Flavour,5,27 January 2014,"By picking 'The World's End', the climactic third act in director Edgar Wright's fabled 'Cornetto Trilogy', I would have put money on the trend continue and uncontrollable laughter filling our household. 'Shaun of the Dead' was fantastic, 'Hot Fuzz' was even better (in my opinion), surely with the third movie Wright along with series mainstays Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were going to up the ante. Sadly, no.Maybe I was disappointed simply because I had built up such high expectation. With the first two installments Wright had a winning formula - a great scripts, and a wonderful British cast to deliver its sharp wit creating non-stop hilarity. For me 'Hot Fuzz' was a non-stop riot of side-splitting laughter, and that's trying to avoid using hyperbole. Comedy zigged and zagged for the whole 2 hours between Pegg and Frost, and its success caused Wright's directorial star to continues its rise up the cinematic ladder.I thought where 'Hot Fuzz' left off, 'The World's End' would pick up the baton - Unfortunately I was wrong. Without sounding too harsh, it may just be me, the humour almost seemed to evaporate completely. I still can't quite put my finger on why, but often the movie even seemed dull to me. Admittedly it did make me laugh, but very sporadically, and never really in a 'laugh out loud' sense. At places I even found I was forcing myself to laugh, perhaps subconsciously trying to justify my purchase of the DVD for £14.99.Yes, the cast is still brilliant. Pegg and Frost are fantastic, and their strong friendship off the screen is easily transformed into powerful comedic chemistry. I also appreciated Martin Freeman and Paddy Considine being raised to more effectual roles, but the movie did not do their comedic potential justice. Rosamund Pike and Eddie Marsan were also introduced as 'newcomers' to the trilogy but made no real impact and almost seemed to become bit-part players in a needlessly complicated story.A good point about this movie is that is shows Wright's ability as a director, ability that will only grow in the coming years. What it lacks in laughs it somewhat makes up for in set-pieces, visual effects and fight-scene choreography. What's even more commendable is that Wright directed this picture on an estimated $28m budget, which is no mean feat! Something this movie has got me excited about is the Marvel studios' 'Ant-Man' due for release in 2015, with Wright in the director's chair. Obviously, Marvel are not an organisation known for doing things by halves and will undoubtedly give Wright a budget in excess of $100m, which is a truly mouth-watering prospect for comic-book fans across the globe!Reading this review back maybe I will give 'The World's End' another look over, perhaps I've been too hasty. It is humorous, there are an abundance of cleverly orchestrated action sequences that are easy on the eye; and I just can't help but love its delightful cast. Nonetheless, when 'The World's End' could have rounded off 'The Cornetto Trilogy' with a legacy cementing swansong, it concludes on a bit of a bum note.",The World's End

330,filmtrance,"Like a tamer, less humorous Hot Fuzz, but still with its own strengths.",7,29 July 2013,"The World's End is the third and final film in what has been tagged as the 'Cornetto Trilogy' by its creators Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright, which also features the hit films Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.The film follows a similar path to Hot Fuzz in that it is set in a small secluded village, with The World's End being set in Herefordshire's Newton Haven. The film follows Gary King (Simon Pegg) and his four childhood friends Oliver (Martin Freeman), Peter (Eddie Marsan), Steven (Paddy Considine) and Andrew Knightly (Nick Frost). The five-some embark upon the task of completing The World's End bar-crawl, which sets the challenge of drinking twelve pints in twelve pubs in one night, finishing at the The World's End pub. They tried and failed when they were teenagers and Gary, determined to put this failure right, sets upon re-uniting his team of misfits to complete the mission. What he finds however is a reluctant bunch of men who, unlike himself, have grown up and moved on, leaving King struggling to accept his new found mature, reality-stricken friends.As with Hot Fuzz, the innocent looking village they enter is not all that it seems. Something strange was afoot of which, in their own unique way, they stumble upon in a drunken fashion. Despite what happens to the gang of middle-aged men, King is determined to finish what he came to the village to complete despite the increasing obstacles of robot invaders and at whatever cost. The journey to The World's End is a literal one for King, who at first sees the trip as a way to forget his past, finds out it opens his eyes to the reality of his future.Drunken tales of sexual conquests, lost youths with a dashing of kick-ass Edgar-esq fight sequences makes The World's End an enjoyable sci-fi comedy that takes its rightful place as the final piece of the cornetto jigsaw. It does not quite live up to the high standards of Hot Fuzz in terms of its insane, outlandish comedy-action that saw an entire village turn into ravenous murders, but it keeps to a similar spirit, albeit in a more subdued fashion. The inclusion of another former Bond in Pierce Brosnan as Guy Shephard is another nod to the brilliant Hot Fuzz, but as with the rest of the film, it does not quite reach the same standards as Timothy Dalton's hilarious portrayal of supermarket owner Simon Skinner. The World's End is Hot Fuzz without the murder and sinister charm its predecessor had in abundance.Twitter: @FilmTrance Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Film-Trance/144519832376155?ref=hl",The World's End

It didn't top Shaun of the Dead for me but being that i am a fan of almost anything with a zombie in it doesn't really come as a surprise.What surprised me about this movies that in all movies with both Pegg and Frost in, Frost has always came across as Pegg's sidekick but in Worlds End Frost seemed more of a lead to me and Pegg almost playing out Frosts character in Shaun Of The Dead. I am saddened that this will be the last in the Cornetto Trilogy as i love the team up of Pegg and Wright.To summarise, The Worlds End brings about the end of a trilogy in a classy, witty and funny way.............

332,davetomkins,Oh My. How the Mighty Have Fallen...,3,16 February 2014,"I am a massive Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz fan, and had been eagerly awaiting the final part of the Wright/Pegg/Frost ""Cornetto Trilogy"" as soon as I heard about it.The idea itself is sound. A revisited pub crawl over 20 years after the original; the town is not quite what it used to be and aliens are involved. The cast is excellent; Pegg & Frost are back as you would expect, and there are welcome additions in the form of Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, Rosamund Pike, Piers Brosnan and David Bradley. So much promise.However, such promise can easily end. And it does. The scriptwriting is very poor. Sure, there are some funny one-liners, but this isn't anything like as good as Fuzz or Shaun. It's almost like the trio rushed this into production before it lost its appeal. World's End appears to be a first draft rather than a finished product. And we need to add the this what I consider to be the main problem with the film: Simon Pegg's character Gary King is a grade A arsehole. What made the other two Cornetto films so much fun is that the main character had something to champion: in Shaun you had the bumbling ex-boyfriend who tried to put things right. With Fuzz, Nick Angel was the top of the class cop with morals, someone to root for. Gary King is the person you'd cross the street to avoid, especially using the excuse that his Mum had died just to get his former mates out for a drink. You genuinely don't give a damn what happens to him because he's such a prick, and not in a funny way.The film just doesn't flow at all; it is disjointed and actually pretty boring for the first 45 minutes. Then the last hour is all a bit too weird and not very well thought out at all. The ending where the aliens leave smacks of ""we couldn't think what else to do"".I am so disappointed that after the triumph of the previous two, our beloved trio came up with this. It was ""that difficult third album"" for them and doesn't work at all. The sad thing is, it has no doubt become a popular film BECAUSE it's the third in the ""trilogy"".I really wished that they had taken more time with this. Sadly it can't hold a candle to Fuzz & Shaun. It will not be added to my movie collection, that's for sure.",The World's End

334,jaythejza,"An enjoyable movie & good end to the ""Cornetto"" trilogy",7,26 July 2013,"I enjoyed the last of the Cornetto trilogy from Director Edgar Wright & the usual pairing of Simon Pegg & Nick Frost. I would argue that it didn't reach the heights of the previous two movies in ""Shaun of the Dead"" & ""Hot Fuzz"", but don't get me wrong, this is still a very funny movie & defiantly worth a watch.The story centres around Gary King (Simon Pegg) trying to get his old school friends back together for some unfinished business, a pub crawl called the golden mile back in their home town. The story follows the group, who have all moved on with their lives, some successful, others stagnant, where as Gary is still clinging onto his teens, while in his mid 30's. As they progress along their pub crawl they realise all is not how it seems...As you would expect for a movie with the duo & director above, there are plenty familiar faces from the previous ""Cornetto"" films as well as the likes of Spaced. I was a little concerned as Pegg's character, as I'm not so keen on his roles where he isn't the most likable character, say similar to his role in ""How to Lose Friends & Alienate People"". I did sympathise with him, but didn't really connect as much as say the others. All the cast played their part well, I did enjoy the development of Frost's Character, going from the straight laced, a changed man type, eventually giving into his inner demons and peer's influences, with hilarious consequences.There were plenty of great fight scenes, with plenty pub based frantic action, with many references to the likes of ""the Warriors"", as well as what seemed like Nick Frost's enjoyment of wrestling moves. Add into these scenes plenty of comedy & it makes for an enjoyable watch. There were plenty of running jokes to keep people laughing too.I left the cinema laughing about this movie, it was a very entertaining Sci-Fi Comedy & does add to the ""Cornetto"" trilogy as a whole, I think if this movie stood alone, without the previous two great movies hanging a shadow over this, I think it would have got a higher rating. Maybe it's down to the fact it's kind of got a similar premise to the other movies, but with a Sci-Fi theme. While it doesn't add much to what has followed before, it still does it better than most similar movies & it's a funny an entertaining movie to watch.",The World's End
335,matsnowie,"Unique, but still in line with Shaun and Hot Fuss",8,5 September 2013,"Few cult classics of the last decade managed to be as popular as Shaun of the Dead, and I'd say no zombie film has been as entertaining. When Hot Fuzz came along from the same crazy team it managed to upend the action cop genre just as well as Shaun had upended zombie horror. Both films walk a very thin line between satirizing the genre and being a part of it, and both succeed brilliantly. Now comes sci-fi/alien/apocalypse comedy The World's End.The film's aliens are actually robots that have replaced most of the town in a mix of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Stepford Wives. Party guy Gary (Simon Pegg) convinces his four high school friends (Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, and Paddy Considine) to go back to their home town to finish the twelve-pub crawl that they never completed 23 years before. Soon the robot alien secret is revealed, and the guys have to fight for their lives and try to save the world.Unlike most recent comedies, The World's End manages to include real character development, conflict, and drama without sacrificing laughs. Anyone who has had a few close drinking buddies in their life, and perhaps have gone too far some nights, will relate to these five old friends. They have their ups and downs, and still carry some old scars, but they are there for each other when the blue alien robot blood hits the fan.Revered Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski made the famous ""Three Colours Trilogy"" with Blue, White, and Red. Film geeks Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have now completed their ""Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy"". Strawberry red was in the gory rom-zom-com Shaun of the Dead, original blue is in the police-centred Hot Fuzz, and alien mint green is in The World's End. Along with a recurring set of actors and a few recurring jokes, the trilogy is mostly held together by Pegg and Wright's quintessentially British humour and Wright's love of fast editing, which is on full display in The World's End.I hesitate to mention, but if I had one complaint with the film it would be, ironically, the end. Although the story wrapped up and climaxed in a wonderfully entertaining way, the last few minutes saw a sudden tone shift that I felt halted the momentum. In a way it was the perfect way to end the film, and it marked a clear difference from the other two Cornetto films, but it still didn't feel right.Despite the minor issues I had with the ending, or with the somewhat underused appearance of Pierce Brosnan (with Timothy Dalton in Hot Fuzz, I'm sad that Connery or Moore weren't in Shaun of the Dead for a James Bond hat trick), The World's End was a wonderfully entertaining film.Apparently Cornetto is releasing new flavours in the UK, so if the stars align and find themselves with some free time, perhaps the trilogy will expand. For now you can expect to see Simon Pegg expanding into drama with Hector and the Search for Happiness as well as more Star Trek, Nick Frost will be acting without Pegg for the first time in salsa dancing comedy Cuban Fury, and director Edgar Wright is finally working on Ant-Man for Marvel's Phase Two films leading to The Avengers 2.http://charlieposts.blogspot.ca/2013/08/the-worlds-end.html",The World's End
336,Jaguara333,Like a sub par episode of Doctor Who... Without the doctor.,3,4 September 2017,"As a fan of several of the cast members, I was quite looking forward to this film but ultimately found it disappointing.Make no mistake this film does not even come close to Shaun of the Dead, and should not even be mentioned in the same paragraph. Well that was a clever parody of the zombie genre and yet still a good zombie film in its own right. It was funny and endearing, you cared about the characters and it was a film you could watch over and over.This film, on the other hand, has no endearing characters and while it is funny at times, those times are too few and far between. It's contributes nothing to the Sci-Fi genre , and actually seems like a feature film parody of a single Doctor Who episode. However Doctor Who does a better job of parodying itself and the Sci-Fi genre at large. Actually, any single episode of Doctor Who is superior to this film on every level. This film also pretends to be an action film at times...but it is no Jackie Chan feature...if you want to watch mindless fight scenes you might as well go find some old episodes of Xena or Kevin Sorbo's Hercules.As a final note the plot is also nonsensical, but I barely mention that as it seems to revel in this fact. Saying that the lack of a plot is the point...I guess that's as good as an excuse as any, or you could just see it as a cop out. Some claim that there is a real backstory with some dramatic value, I would dispute this and found at best it reached the levels of false sentimentality.So to conclude, this film and the characters difficulties in their quest to slog through to the world's end are an excellent metaphor for the difficulties I had in sitting through the film itself. I had as much difficulty getting to the World's End as they did. My advice is to save your 2 hours Andrey watch Shaun of the Dead instead.",The World's End

Plus, it was really interesting to see Simon Pegg and Nick Frost switch characters. The action scenes were the best of the trilogy, I don't know why people didn't like this movie. I think it's the best in the trilogy! Also like each movie they include at least one scene with real acting, and with all of the madness going on before this one's scene, it made the moment even more epic! SO my advice to you is to forget about the bad reviews, and just go and see this unappreciated gem!Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy ranking1. The World's End 2. Hot Fuzz (alphabetical) 3.

338,goryverbinski,The best movie about recreational drinking since Beerfest!,10,11 September 2013,"The World's End is about a group of friends (Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, etc) who reunite after twenty years to embark on ""The Golden Mile."" An all night drinkathon where they have a pint from twelve different pubs spread out across there hometown, ultimately concluding at ""The World's End"" (pub #12). Simple enough, right? Oh, except for one little hitch. I forgot to mention that the town has since been taken over and overrun by killer robots. As if Edgar Wright was going to let us off that easy. Naturally chaos ensues and eventually the band of drinking chums find themselves in a struggle for survival and a literal fight to the finish. This film is bar-none, the most fun you will have at the theater all summer, if not your entire life. It is chalk full of sci-fi, comedy, horror, action, and of course, drinking. This is the third installment of the ""so wrong it's Wright"" trilogy and surprisingly one of the most successful. Personally, I thought it was way better than Hot Fuzz, and just as good as Shaun of the Dead. Not better. I mean, come on, how could it be? That would be like the time the Beatles said that they were bigger than Jesus.",The World's End
339,zao923,Come in without expectations and leave laughing,9,4 May 2021,"Anyone poorly reviewing this movie clearly had expectations set up from the prior two movies. This movie has all the quips and jokes the first two did- but with an awesome twist halfway through. Sign up for a drinking buddy comedy, and end up with an awesome sci-fi survival flick. It's my favorite out of the three movies, for that alone...but not by a wide margin.",The World's End
340,tamemlin,The Cornetto Trilogy has its Godfather part 3,1,22 July 2013,"The World's End is about all about trying desperately to re-live former glories and the film ends up mirroring that. You come away remembering how great Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were, and how sad it is to see the same talent serving up something so lackluster.The story has a promising concept, but it's a dud from the start. The pub crawl idea simply doesn't work when meshed with the sci-fi invasion. Because after the 'robots' are revealed there becomes no reason for them to continue drinking. You can throw up a flimsy explanation that they continue so as not to arouse suspicion, but it doesn't wash. Put simply: once there are robots around, you do not care if they get to The World's End.Furthermore, I didn't much care if they got killed/replaced. None of the five are very sympathetic and they are for the most part very nondescript. These are not the kind of drinking buddies you want to go on a ride like this with. Freeman, Marsan and Considine all play similarly bland characters. They're really nothing but place-holders. Pegg and Frost, having nailed the lovable doofus previously, obviously wanted to play against type for this one and it backfires massively. If Shaun and Ed were on this pub crawl, I'd be in. Gary and Andrew? I wish I'd bailed after the first round.Even the direction felt oddly off here. Of course there were the obligatory half-second shots of pints being poured, keys turned, etc. But it lacked the energy of Wright's previous work. In fact, it felt like no-one's heart was really in it. The whole film was came off like an idea they no longer believed in. Either that or they just haven't got it anymore. A bit depressing either way.It's sad when people you love serve up something you hate, but The World's End is a turkey. I only wish I'd drunk twelve pints before seeing it.",The World's End

I wouldn't want to put a spoiler in but I will say it is amazing what can happen when one goes for a wee! The end is boring and the beginning is definitely far fetched and tedious. It lacks star quality. I am not pining for Bruce Willis but Frost and Pegg have high jumped their quirky talent status and crash landed. Even their cohorts lack charisma - although one of them does look like he is on a day out from the office. CGI suddenly explodes into place, as if the director was saying, 'Hey guys, we really need to liven this one up and we've got loads of budget for technicals left.' As for Newton Boring their Mecca near the A41, it looks like the dullest cross between Welwyn Allotment City and Weston Super Horse. Doesn't work. One horse town. A great shame because the Americans will only be puzzled by this and wonder where all the super heroes were...could have been a fine export.Why was there nobody foreign in it? The closest to a super hero and foreigner was Peirs Brosnan who looked like Bond's Grandad. He was the only one with charisma.

342,yanqui,A silly film,5,27 July 2013,"Advance warning, I will be saying silly a lot in this review. I hope it at least mildly irritates you in the same way that this film did to me. This film is so silly it's annoying. Imagine shaun of the dead with sillier characters, sillier premise, sillier dialogue. It's like a 10 year old rotten urine smelling dead badger of a parody of shaun that has been lying in pegg's brain festering until eventually came out and disappeared up his own sphincter. So the story revolves around this village that gets invaded by very fragile robots and it's up to SIMON PEGG and some...other people to save the entire world from them. Surely Pegg and Wright are taking the pee-pee out of the audience. Surely they secretly hired A SIX YEAR OLD to write this. There is too [!!SIMON PEGG!!] much [!!SIMON PEGG!!] in this film. Too [!!SIMON PEGG!!] many close ups of [!!SIMON PEGG!!] his stupid face. His [!!SIMON PEGG!!] overacting is hilariously bad [!!SIMON PEGG!!] and riddled with predictable [!!SIMON PEGG!!] silly one liners. Martin freeman plays the same character in everything he's ever done. He only has one facial expression, the laurel one. To be fair though, I can imagine the discussion pegg and wright had about what to do about his silly laurel face and they did come up with a suitable remedy for the problem about half way in. SIMON PEGG SIMON PEGG SIMON PEGG SIMON PEGG! The rest of the characters I can't remember who they were what their names were, what they said or what they [!!SIMON PEGG!!] did.The ending is the biggest anticlimax in cinema history and so sadly the cornetto trilogy miserably deflates itself and disappears into a black hole of marketing hype never to be viewed again.",The World's End
343,Leemsn-co-uk,"Slow start, and BARELY any connection to the previous Cornetto films, but it is still very good.",8,21 July 2013,"Saw the Cornetto Trilogy at the Midnight screening on Thursday, lasted from 7:30pm until 2am, but loved every minute of it. It was my first movie marathon at the cinema and it didn't feel long at all. In the special introduction Edgar Wright asked the audience to applaud every ""F"" word in Shaun of the Dead, about 60% of the audience did it all, then before Hot Fuzz a member of staff came in telling everyone off because people complained, which was kind of a bummer on the night, but on topic...The World's End is truly the biggest of the three films, not in terms of length but in terms of plot, budget, and cast. Most of the cast in this has either been in the previous two films, or has just joined for this one. I will admit it did have a slowish start, and I was thinking ""Hmm I wonder if it will grab me any time soon."" By maybe fifteen minutes in I was hooked, it was funny at the start, HILARIOUS by the end.Plot was very weird but it worked, the cast gelled really well, even if Martin Freeman plays the character he always does ""Worrysome goody-two shoes who is always anxious etc"". There were some good plot twists and Simon Pegg and Nick Frost interacted beautifully as always.There were only maybe 2 or 3 references to the other two Cornetto movies that I noticed, the ""jumping over a hedge/fence"" thing and then the FLEETING Cornetto reference within the final 2 minutes (a Cornetto wrapper flying past...) but apart from that the humour was still as great as the other ones.Overall the movie is fantastic, the humour is still as sharp and witty as ever, the visual effects are great, acting is brilliant. Took a while for me to get into at the start and like I said I would have liked more reference to the other movies, but it never ruined the enjoyment for me once I was engrossed. Definitely getting the ""Cornetto Trilogy"" box set, which I'm presuming will be out around Christmas.",The World's End
344,rudith13,Best Comedy Of The Year!!!!,10,20 November 2013,"I had been eagerly waiting for this film for over a year since it was announced. I really liked Shaun of the Dead but loved Hot Fuzz. When i saw the first trailer, i was a bit excited but by the second trailer, my hopes were let down a little. However it did not douse the raging fire within me that wanted to watch this film. As i finally watched, i was so astounded that i had to watch it again. It is safe to say that it is not as good as the first two of the trilogy but it is a hell of a lot fun. The story is smart and funny and the supporting characters don't feel like supporting actors at all. Each character has its own great story, humor and touching moment. This film was weird in its own right yet its so funny and delivers some of the most funniest lines I've ever heard. The action is extremely engaging and fun whilst also giving off the essence of struggle between the fighters. I loved seeing Simon and Nicks personalities switch. Nicks first time very serious performance is both extravagant and heartbreaking. Simons' is more funny and over the top. I found Nicks performance more engaging. The very last scene is a bit unclear but other than that movie is terrific. There have been noticeable reviews about the vulgarity of the language. Its not even that much compared to other titles released this year and check the bloody MPAA rating before watching it. I enjoyed it very much and if others think that films such as This is the End (Which was quite good) is funnier than this slice of British comedy gold then all i can say is ""Open your eyes"".",The World's End

I could watch this movie every day.",The World's End
346,jusdiz2,Good-hearted comedy to spend some time with the smile on your face,8,8 December 2013,"Good comedy. I think that director of this movie Edgar Wright knows what he's doing, he has style, he has his actors, he has his sense of humor. I really enjoyed this movie, although my girlfriend said it was only an average film for her. So it depends on what you like. If you already saw Shawn of the Dead, you might know what to expect in this one too. Crazy, non logical actions, a lot of irony about mankind and life in general! But in the end, movie tells us that traditional values of life are irreplaceable - family, friends, life purpose, to know who you are. Because in the end, only these matters.Although I spent good time with these fellows in the pubs, I didn't like the super high tempo of this movie. It's impossible to understand the dialogs if you are not English or don't have subtitles! And the main character is quite a hyperactive guy! So I still think that this movie will not change the world, but it can change one of your evenings if you like stupid but good-hearted comedies!",The World's End

That's their point of view I'm not going to argue with. Yes, this movie isn't funny enough compared to the other Simon Pegg's works. But it's not about being funny anymore, and maybe that is why I respect him even more - because of growing, maturing. The general topic on the mature/immature take on life in total prevails, and the ending shows us how fragile the so-called-mature state is. Maybe this movie isn't that much about laughs, but about a little bit of thinking?I totally admit I'm with the 'Gary King's team, the idea of freedom, even though I'm working within the corporate standards - the skills, experience and knowledge make up for the anarchist position. I only wish for people in charge to notice our strengths, not our 'questionable' affiliations.",The World's End
348,hanz12891,"And so, the trilogy ends!",8,30 November 2013,"Close followers of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg knew this movie was coming, since Shaun and Fuzz were planned as a trilogy. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are back, and this time, they embark on the pub crawl of their lives, and they will finish it even if makes the world end (literally). If your a fan of the Edgar's previous movies, you will have a blast through this one. This time its Simon Pegg who is the dimwit of the the Simon-Frost duo and he leads a great cast through a movie thats funny, thrilling, loaded with action, and smartly written. There are cameos, hidden references and throwbacks everywhere, and it might take multiple viewings to spot them all (did you see the Winchester's pinball machine??). There's also a lot more action in the World's End, mixing the art of bar fighting with kung fu (you'll get it when you see the movie).There were times I felt like the dialogue is a little too fast, but overall, its very smartly written, as you would expect from Edgar Wright. The film also has wider array of characters, and each are given equal attention and nobody is really worth forgetting.Smart, fast, action packed, and hilarious. 8/10",The World's End

After an unsuccessful attempt at the 'Golden Mile' - 12 pubs, 12 pints - twenty years later, the school pals (Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine and Eddie Marsan) reluctantly reunite for another crack at the ultimate pub crawl in their home town of Newton Haven. But all is not what it seems in their cosy little town, which soon becomes apparent after a run in with some youths in the gents of one of the pubs!I think that the script by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have got the right blend of comedy and sci-fi with this film, with some really funny moments scattered in amongst the well crafted sci-fi bits. I really enjoyed the previous two films in Edgar Wright's 'Three Colours Cornetto' trilogy, and this one continues by keeping Pegg and Frost's characters at the centre of the film, albeit in the role reversal of Nick Frost's Andrew being the smarter more mature one compared with Simon Pegg's Gary King, and it works wonderfully. I'm also thinking that there is a big love for Primal Scream's 'Loaded', as they do quote the opening line to the song quite a bit. Can't complain too much as I do like it!With a cracking 90's soundtrack, and if you've enjoyed Edgar's previous work, including 'Scott Pilgrim vs The World' and the TV show 'Spaced' (of which 'The World's End' is as close to a cinematic version you'll probably get) then, like me, you'll get a kick out of watching this film. Go see it if you can!",The World's End
350,HarveyA2010,Alright but Disappointing,7,20 July 2013,"After ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" being so amazing and had you laughing at everything I was pretty disappointed and felt that there was so many things that could of been added in for instance they could of had Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"" playing in one of the pubs, maybe had an early reference to ""Do you want anything from the shop"" and one thing I felt was when Andrew (Nick Frost) has the two stalls and is destroying the Blanks, it would of been brilliant if Gary (Simon Pegg) could of said ""Your off the F-ing Chain"".I loved the Notion with the Cornetto wrapper floating past Andrew (Nick Frost). Raph Spalle and the girl from Shaun of the Dead (Mary I think) who they throw the Vinyl's at cameo's were good. I felt laughs were at sometimes forced and that it wasn't as funny or as clever as the other two films, but The bit when Peter(Eddie Marsden) beats up his childhood bully (who turns out to be a blank)with a branch I found very funny.I was annoyed at how many good jokes from the film you had already seen in the trailer's i.e. when Gary (Simon Pegg) says ""To the bitter end... or lager end"". I felt that the ending had been rushed and that not much thought had been put into it, as it seemed a pretty poor ending from two writers (Simon Pegg and Director Edgar Wright) of such quality with two amazing films (Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz) both of which were very good behind them. but I just felt this ending didn't give ""The Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy"" justice. but hey it was worth watching, and I would recommend it :)",The World's End
351,Calcium2000,"Please Edgar, I want more!",9,26 November 2013,"After seeing the Worlds End yesterday I can honestly say that I loved all three of its installments. This may have been the weakest of the three, but that doesn't say much. The other two were so good (the best being hot fuzz) and this film ended the trilogy in the same way that Shaun of the dead started it, brilliantly. The budget and CGI has come on a long way since Shaun and ever Hot Fuzz and they used it well to make the film seem like a sci-fi. This didn't take away from Wright and Pegg's genius script writing, they maintained the wit and charm of the first two with the classic references but managed to not be nostalgic and created a film that fitted today's audience. It was nice to see Pegg and Frost swap roles (Pegg becoming the stupid one and Frost becoming the sensible one) and it meant they could end on a high showing off all their acting skills. The story was, like the others (but sadly less so), almost a sci-fi action film but towards the end they were still throwing drunk jokes at us. This was disappointing but the ending is great. They thought of such a witty way to end the trilogy: with the biggest problem earth faced in the cornetto universe.This was a fantastic conclusion to the best comedy series out there. I'm really sad it's over. I don't usually say this at the end of sagas but please Edgar, I want more!",The World's End

I mean Wright crossed Comedy, Horror, Mystery and Action. How can do that? It was brilliant! I was very excited to see The World's End. There were some funny bits. Pegg is funny but the twist with Frost's character being the straight guy just didn't work. Great supporting cast but the Alien story just didn't work. Sorry - loved the Cornetto - Blood and Ice Cream trilogy but this was the weakest link.",The World's End
353,Lubezki,Disappointing is an understatement,5,8 December 2015,"Back in in 2004, the talents of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (the latter two collaborating for the umpteenth time) brought us the best homage of George Romero's notorious Zombie franchises -- the supremely clever, tongue-in-cheek and laugh out loud hilarious ""Shaun of Dead"". From there it spawned what we now know today as ""The Cornetto Trilogy"" and the trio returned three years later to somehow top their previous effort with ""Hot Fuzz"", which followed the same formula as ""Shaun"" but instead took jabs at cheesy buddy cop 80's movies whilst incorporating it's own incredibly witty script and identity to make it, for my money, one of the best comedies ever made. So when I learned they had one more film left in them, I was beyond excited. Even if they couldn't top the last two, being half as good would have been perfectly fine for me......except it wasn't.The main problem with ""The World's End"" is that it doesn't know what story it wants to tell -- it veers from one plot line to another which ultimately derails any sort of momentum the film may have been gaining. On paper, the concept of four old high school friends reuniting one last time in their hometown to embark on a wild pub crawl sounds like a blast, and to an extent you do get to go along with them on this adventure for about the first half of the movie. But it takes a nose dive when these silly looking prosthetic robots who have somehow invaded the town are introduced and by then all the fun is just sucked up into a vacuum leaving the film to trudge along towards it's even more tiresome and ridiculous climax. That's not to say it isn't without it's merits, however few there may be. The choreography in the fighting scenes are well done and Simon Pegg gives his best and most heartfelt performance to date as a struggling alcoholic. The accomplished supporting cast which includes Eddie Marsan, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman and Rosamund Pike also try inject some much needed zeal into proceedings. That they didn't keep the storyline tighter and more focused on these characters is what ultimately brings everything down though and they're left with next to nothing to work with.It seems that Wright, Pegg and Frost succumbed to the pressure of ending the trilogy on the same note it started on. And given the standards they reached with ""Shaun"" and ""Fuzz"", it's certainly understandable -- but it's nevertheless a huge disappointment.",The World's End
354,bobbo204,Horribly boring. By far the worst of the 3 Simon Pegg/Nick Frost movies,5,2 September 2013,"I'd start this off by saying that I absolutely love Hot Fuzz. It's one of my all-time favorite movies. Shaun of the Dead was funny, but not as good as Hot Fuzz, IMHO. This movie, which I had high expectations for, was absolutely terrible. My wife and I went to see this and thought with an IMDb rating of 7.8 that this was sure to be a good comedy. Instead, we laughed maybe three times throughout the movie. Simon Pegg's character was just plain annoying and none of the other characters were anything memorable. The jokes were lame and didn't have anything near the wittiness of the other two movies in this ""trilogy."" The first 1/3 of the movie is spent setting the scene and drags on. The 2nd & 3rd portions become more of an action/chase movie and while the action scenes were very well done there just wasn't enough of comedy in this film to make it worth seeing. It seemed to not know what it was supposed to be and while the action scenes in Hot Fuzz were both good actions scenes and absolutely hilarious, the ones here were more kung fu (which I love), but with very little comedic pizazz. Again, just my opinion but I thought this was dreadfully boring.",The World's End
355,TheCineSinge,A Film About Grown-Ups Looking Back... Made by Grown-Ups Looking Back,8,18 July 2013,"The World's End is about characters who have grown-up but are drawn back into their younger years. Immediately, it seems this is a comparison that can be made with Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in their making of this film.For me, Gary King (played by Pegg) represents the youthful side of both the film's characters and of Pegg, Frost and Wright; fun, playful, reckless but forgotten and moving away from. However, once coerced into reminiscing, it all comes back.This is reflected in the film itself which starts off rather slow and dry, and surprisingly, isn't as funny as what it ought to be. So although it does take a bit longer to get going than may be desired, once it does, the laughter flows freely pretty much right through until the end of the film. I have no hesitations in saying it is a funny film.However, while the laughter is mostly consistent - coming from another fine Pegg and Wright script - the final 10-15 minutes are, in fact, a bit clunky and long-winded despite containing some of the most heartfelt moments of the trilogy.Nevertheless, it is a joy to see Pegg and Frost on-screen together again. They crack jokes left, right and centre as we are used to but due to Gary and Andy's (Frost) rocky relationship, it's not often with each other. This lack of warmth in their relationship, though a bold change from the previous films, does strain at times and presents a rather unwanted opposite here and there to what we are used to - friends, fun, immature. There are, in effect, 5 leads which does sometimes hinder the Pegg-Frost double-team.However, since there are 5 leads, this patch is mostly covered up. Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan and Paddy Considine do an excellent job as King's high-school buddies, the latter in particular - Considine is a gem.The World's End is the strongest film, thematically, in the Cornetto Trilogy. It's about adulthood vs adolescence, regret, friendship and above all the state of modern society. It does not nod nearly as much towards or satirise genre like Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. No, instead the nods and satire are mostly out and the themes are in.This is half-welcome, half-disappointing for the final film of the trilogy. On one hand, since the other two satirise film genres it is odd the this doesn't and honestly, a bit disappointing. This is much more of it's own beast but, for a Pegg, Wright and Frost film, it does feel far too much of an unexplored area. On the other hand, the concerns of the central plot and the thematic content give the film the strength to round off the trilogy in a fitting and appropriate way.Furthermore, The World's End contains many of the little recurring elements from Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz which show such loving attention to detail and continuity: the Cornettos, the Wright short-shot montages, the fantastic soundtrack, the amazing use of the word 'C**t', the noise of the pub fruit machine, and many other little details that have made appearances in the previous two films are here.Not only are these recurring details present but so too are some of Wright, Pegg and Frost's collaborators with their own fantastic cameos. I won't give any away specifically but there are actors from previous films in the trilogy and beyond (stretching back to Spaced, here) making appearances and it's actually rather heart-warming. Evidently, roots have not been forgotten.However, the impressive camera-work of Shaun of the Dead (with it's long, Steadicam tracking shots) and Hot Fuzz (the well-studied and executed shots deriving from the action blockbuster genre) was not as present this time round. In The World's End, the CGI gets in the way too often for the camera-work to shine and this is most apparent in the film's several fight scenes. Fun though they are, they seem off-kilter and as if they have been tinkered with a little too much. Though I don't think it is as adventurous with the camera-work, it is still a fine looking film which I credit with Edgar Wright's choice to continue shooting on film instead of digital. Despite what may appear to be a lot of grumbling with The World's End it is still very accomplished and probably one of the better films I will see this year. Is it funny? Certainly, without a doubt. Is it as funny as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz? Not quite. And it is the memory and affection for these two films and the frankly unavoidable and inevitable comparisons between them which unintentionally hurt The World's End. The influence of these two films, on the other hand - how they got where they are to make this film - has undoubtedly not been forgotten. However, the plot itself and the more heavy thematic content in place of the fun, snappy genre references, give Pegg, Wright and Frost the air of saying that there will always be time to reflect, have fun and cherish the memories of younger, more immature days but that they are older and more mature now and it is time to move on (though I don't wish suggest that they wanted this film done and out the way - a lot of love clearly went into it, as with the whole trilogy). If this is the message we are to be left with, I will say that is a fitting way to end any a trilogy.A desire for just a little more immaturity and laughter lingers over The World's End nevertheless but it is still a very good film, one I would not hesitate to recommend, and I am forever grateful to Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and the rest of their crew for completing an unforgettable trilogy.",The World's End

Simon Pegg and Nick Frost kind of switch roles from their previous movies, Frost is the one that has it together and Pegg doesn't. It works well and they still maintain their great humor and wit. The supporting cast is equally funny with Eddie Marsan being a highlight. The movie if full of great one liners and some absolutely hilarious moment.

A blend of very funny realism and sci-fi led by the crazy lead character Gary King and 4 schoolmates who reune to hit 12 bars in one night which they failed to make in their younger days.The other four have settled into conventional safe lives but that doesn't mean their lives are that wonderful. The lead character Gary is half nuts and hasn't accomplished much since school days. But he is still full of juvenile life and leads the group on the marathon pub crawl.Along the way some strange things happen. Gary might be nuts but he still has a mind and a will to live life against the odds, and so do some of the others. Whatever the 'best' choices in life, they would rather live on as human beings with all the failures and all the problems, than settle into a perfect, predictable life without pain and without problems.If you're over 14 and looking for more then summer hyper schlock, go see the World's End.

When they work together, usually Simon would be the stronger character and Nick would be the much more laid back, careless character (as shown in the previous two , shawn of the dead and Hot Fuzz). But in this case they both switched characters. I thought for once this movie would sucked because both would be acting in they less favourable character but in this movie, Simon Pegg had done exceptionally well! Nick Frost was great in that movie, and also the chemistry between those 5 characters are so strong you might have thought they had worked together for a long time.The storyline was okay. It wasn't much to ponder upon but the quality was there. The script is good and most of them are quite humorous. All in all, a movie worth watching. Credits to the acting. I gave an 8. It would be a 6 if it wasn't for the excellent acting job by all actors and actresses.",The World's End
359,tom-ko,Just may be the best of the greatest movie trilogy!!!,10,21 January 2014,"Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do not fail to amaze with this original, incredible cornerstone of British comedy. The first film of the trilogy 'Shaun of the Dead' set the highest mark possible for British filmmaking and 'The World's End'- even though it can't beat 'Shaun of the Dead's ' originality- smashed it with a mixture of hilarious and thoughtful dialogue, a 'rather fitting' to the theme soundtrack, Hollywood style cinematography and groundbreaking effects. Not to mention the many hidden easter eggs.In this film Nick Frost portrays the polar opposite of previous characters of 'Ed' and 'Danny Butterman' with his depiction of straight man Andy Knightley. This pays off for the film and Nick Frost as we see a new side to him.This film is definitely recommended for fans of the Cornetto Trilogy as it does not disappoint and gives new vision and cinematic value to British filmmaking.",The World's End
360,ian-j-williams75,Disappointing,5,3 March 2014,"I am a big fan of both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and was hoping for something similar. Sadly this wasn't a patch on those comedy classics and despite a few moments was a real disappointment. While 'Shaun' and 'Hot' were parodies of genre classics, this didn't have anything to pivot off and, as a result, felt aimless. Sure, there were hints of Invasion of the body snatchers or even The Stepford Wives but not enough to impact the narrative. I guess this makes the film more original - and I didn't think this was a bad film - but it just wasn't as good as its brother films and, consequently, was a missed opportunity.",The World's End
361,LordMaxentius,A good fun movie with great humour,8,11 October 2016,"First, let me get one thing out of the way: the plot is dumb. In fact, it is probably one of the most ridiculous movie plots I have ever seen. However, it would be wrong to say that this makes it a bad film, because it in my opinion fully compensates for the lack of a good storyline.The story follows five childhood friends, who try to finally complete the famed pub crawl of their hometown, having failed to do so many years earlier. The acting is superb, with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman and many others all delivering very solid and convincing performances. Pegg adopts a role unusual for him in the Three Flavours of Cornetto Trilogy, this time playing a childish character with a lot of (mostly social) problems, as opposed to the more confident protagonists Shaun in Shaun of the Dead and Sergeant Nicolas Angel in Hot Fuzz. Despite this being a new kind of role for him, I thought he did a superb job, and I felt myself emphasising with his character quite a lot throughout the movie.As per usual with any Edgar Wright production, the cinematography is brilliant and eye-catching, with several very sneaky camera/cutting tricks and transitions that are very fun to watch. My favourite thing about the movie by far however, is the scripting/dialogue. The first five scenes in particular, during which the protagonist talks to the individual supporting characters (his four friends), are comedic brilliance. Every line has perfect timing and execution, and none of the jokes failed to make me laugh. The humour throughout the entire film is very good, and if you're British or enjoy the more British sense of humour, then you will no doubt laugh at a lot of these jokes. All in all, this movie mixes great humour and dialogue with awesome cinematography and a cast of good actors who all did a superb job. If you're looking for a fun movie to have a good laugh, then this should definitely be on the top of your list.7.7/10 (8)",The World's End
362,TheCinemister,Great movie!!!,8,9 March 2018,"Such as Gary said ""There's only one Gary King! In my opinion,they are few movies in this style but there's only one movie like this!!
A usual british comedy from the lovely from the audience Edgar Wright,gives you a plenty of funny quotes and of course the awesome role of Simon Pegg.
As the rest of three flavours Cornetto Trilogy last part is Great as well with Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the dead.Also,The World's End is exting sci-fi with a lot of horror spots and is good directed.
At the end I want to refer that is catchy story,with good fights and action and also, contains plenty of Easter eggs that who are connected with the other films of trilogy that will make us elated and consider about them",The World's End

However if that is true, the same can be said for the other 100+ people in the theatre! Didn't hear a single laugh throughout - indeed guy nest to me I thought went to the loo after 50 minutes and never returned! I'm sure the avid Pegg / Frost fans will make sure they watch this, but once those have, then it will have to stand on its own merits. Sadly, there are none.I can forgive the swearing, I can forgive the hammy acting, I can even forgive a woeful script, but what I cannot forgive is a comedy that isn't funny!

364,ianmat,This is the way the world ends - not with a bang but a whimper,5,31 July 2013,"Oh dear. The loose trilogy concludes with a narrative-laden, vaguely amusing but overly-long story. The plot is thin and a poor story is rescued only by some good acting from the lead players and the occasional one-liner that reminds us of the talent behind Shaun and Hot Fuzz.The film begins with what we later find out is a characteristically long piece of dialogue giving everyone's back-story and then moves onto the intriguing but thinly developed plot line about middle-aged men not having left childhood. Somewhere between the idea and the reality falls the shadow of a missed opportunity.I loved the other films, as did my wife. This time she fell asleep in the cinema - there was no noise and no mirth to wake her. To quote the great Keith Hunt on Alan Partridge - ""no manners, but what a critic"".",The World's End
365,K_A,Almost,7,9 October 2013,"The first 3/4 of The World's End is relentlessly laugh-out-loud funny, clever and overall brilliant. Perhaps a little too similar to Shaun of the Dead, but I don't mind. Shaun was such a good film; no problem if they want to make it twice. But then, just when the story reaches World's End, the film abruptly rolls over and dies. It tries to shift gears into... something. I'm not sure into what exactly, but the shift fails. The last half hour or so is like a completely different film - a quite disappointing one.Still, most of The World's End is a riot. The characters are silly but engaging, the buildup towards the climax is masterfully done, and the dialogue almost reaches Pulp Fiction levels of cleverness. It's such a shame they messed up the ending.",The World's End
366,nicholasmoulaison,Amazing,8,7 September 2013,"Wright sure finishes off the trilogy with a bang with The World's End starring the hilarious duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who, despite playing different parts then what you're accustomed to seeing them play still manage to work really well together as always. The World's End is insanely entertaining with great laughs and some pretty great action as well. The World's End feels the same but completely different at the same time, it just works really well together and with a great soundtrack and cast it sure shines as arguably the best in the trilogy. Maybe that's because I've watched the other 2 so many times they don't seem good but either way Wright still has it. The World's End is a great time and a great movie and if you liked Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead at all then you'll surely like this.",The World's End

Watch this movie closely, there are quotes and scenes to snicker at. Love it. And this requirement of 10 lines is crazy. So I will fulfill the rules. Watch this movie and enjoy and again, a combination of ""Stepford Wives"" and ""Village"". I think I met the 10 line rule. Let me try again. Good funny movie. This should be ten lines.

There are plenty of cameos from Reece Shearsmith, Michael Smiley and even Pierce Brosnon. I had never seen Eddie Marsan in anything else but he's a very good actor. You forget about the cornetto but when it appears you feel like cheering. The action is very well done with some Mortal Combat style robot kills. I spent the entire movie pointing out the references.

369,kpower98,A perfect end to the Cornetto Trilogy?!,8,19 July 2013,"As a huge fan of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz (as well as other Pegg- Frost films such as Paul), I had extremely high expectations for The World's End. Did it deliver? You bet it did. The film centres on five guys, four of whom have grown up a long way since their crazy heydays, one of whom hasn't changed at all (Pegg). First reluctantly, but later willingly, the four agree to a reunion that will see them take on a failed pub crawl from their youth. 12 pubs, 60 pints, 1 night. The gags are hilarious, the fights marvellous and the shocks... shocking. The somewhat unbelievable plot line means chaos and madness ensue which allow you to be sucked into the crawl with them. Obviously Pegg and Frost were fantastic, but Freeman, Marsan and Considine gave highly commendable performances. Wright and Pegg's writing style is just my cup of tea, and the classic short, sharp camera shots, prevalent throughout, were certainly welcomed back.A fitting end to one of the funniest film sets ever.",The World's End
370,ronindave,The Pub Crawl to end all Pub Crawl (literally!),10,19 December 2013,"Very enjoyable film which is almost two films in one - one is about old friends reuniting after many years on the coerced behest of ne-er-do-well friend of theirs to complete a pub crawl they never finished when they were young and the other is a sci-fi movie which involves saving the world from well-meaning but very misguided aliens.The film does a great job in telling a story about getting older, accepting responsibility, and dealing with an alien invasion which is for our own good. There are some genuine touching moments in the movie with the characters coming to terms with their past and their present as they destroy robot replicants of the aforementioned alien invasion.Particularly good is the role reversal with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Usually Frost plays the couldn't-care-less loser character whom Pegg's character has to help and defend. In this film Pegg is brilliant as the loose cannon figure of the group who never wanted to grow up while Frost is the responsible one and has to knock sense into Pegg's character. He takes the lead of the group several times when Pegg cannot be trusted but he doesn't become a boring straight man character. He has some very funny moments in the film.World's End is a very funny fun film that can also be bittersweet at times. Well worth a watch and definitely worth seeing with friends and beer.",The World's End
371,masatoshi,Simon Pegg does it again,7,30 May 2014,"This movie would have been different without Simon Pegg, but I'm not reviewing him now, I'm just saying that he drew as (almost) always lots of laughter. Overall the movie was quite entertaining, with only a bit of hiccups and goofs here and there, probably if this movie was not based on the popular English humor, it would have miserably failed. Just the British accent, their faces and those typical pub jokes are worth watching this comedy, and there aren't many good comedy movies lately on the screen.I gave it 7/10 because it could have been better from multiple points of view, but it turned out a good comedy to watch, mostly because of Pegg's performance. Other good movies I'd recommend you to watch in case you haven't: Shaun of the Dead % Hot Fuzz. (both with Simon Pegg in a lead role)",The World's End

Every character grows on you more and more as they are very relatable and very deep. The humor in it is incredibly well written as it is quick-witted, hilarious, and most importantly used at the right time. The action in this movie is very comedic, but it doesn't mean it can't have some awesome super violent fight scenes! To me this is the perfect balance a great comedy that has some depth and when things go down, THINGS WILL GO DOWN!

373,lee_impressionist,Disappointing,4,17 March 2018,"I enjoy Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, always have. That being said, The World's End left me wanting.
The relatable characters, which develop or prove themselves capable of change, throughout the previous 2 films in the trilogy are replaced with unlikeable and unfunny depictions of people who are stuck in their ways and have no intentions of changing.
The humour, which is prevalent in Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, is replaced with a rather upsetting storyline of alcoholism, a yearning for the past and very few intentions of providing the same laughs that made the other films so enjoyable.
There was a smattering of chuckle-worthy moments throughout the film and well choreographed fight scenes, but the main plot was not enjoyable to watch and the ending seemed forced and hinted at almost lazy writing.For lovers of the first 2 instalments of The Cornetto Trilogy, I think you will be disappointed by The World's End, I know I was.",The World's End

377,white431,So disappointed....,4,21 July 2013,"I view Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz as wonderful, brilliantly written and directed parodies. Even without Edgar Wright, Paul was still great. However somehow, The World's End just fell completely flat.It didn't help that the lead protagonist is completely unlikeable. If you don't like a protagonist, you won't connect with them or sympathise. Also, a protagonist should grow. Shaun and Nicolas Angel from the previous films grow and notably, always have the buddy buddy relationship with Nick Frost's character. This is what draws us in - yet here, Gary King is completely unlikeable. There's no buddy buddy relationship to fall back on. He doesn't grow as a character. There's no character that we can directly relate to.Characters are underdeveloped and nothing makes us care about any of them.The humour isn't there either. The wit is gone. OK, there's a few laughs here and there, but it's not enough to elevate this up to the greatness of the previous films.There is an attempt to sort of ham-fist a statement on technology in this film, but that doesn't really work for quite a letdown of an ending.The only really good thing this film has going for it is the soundtrack. I simply can't believe there are people out there lauding this as the 'best film ever'.I think Pegg/Wright/Frost got a little carried away here trying to make some statement on the state of society and technology, forgetting to make a comedy instead.",The World's End

All that having been said, I saw the zombie movie, then the fuzz movie, and now the last and equally unfunny end movie. I held out hope that one of these would bring a smile, a chuckle, anything, but alas that was not to be. I can say with complete confidence that it is a million times better than ""This Is The End"", which is so bad all of the actors should be banned from both the big screen and small screen for life. And I don't know if I'm misremembering, but I could've sworn that when they are down under the pub, that the real estate agent's head is once again whole and at the end it is broken and he is using something as part of his head to give the appearance of a whole head, which is suppose to be funny.

380,james-965,Decent but flawed action comedy,7,20 July 2013,"Having waiting a long time for the 3rd in the Blood and Ice Cream trilogy, I was hoping for great film to bow out on.However, I'd say I was disappointed overall due to a number of problems, but would still recommend overall. Multiple times if you're a Wright/Front/Pegg fan.Lets start with whats good: the actions sequences were awesome. A few real ""f**k yeah"" adrenaline soaked scenes were present along with decent effects.Spotting nods to previous films and TV programs, actors and actresses who popped up (Mark Heap and Micheal Smiley were awesome) and the catch phrases brought the most smiles.I live a stone's throw from where the movie was shot and have drank in some of the pubs so I can understand how residents of Wells felt when watching ""Hot Fuzz"" - it doesn't help the immersion but is fun spotting locations.On the negative side: the jokes are thinner on the ground, some were predictable. References to other non-Wright films also more sparse.Acting was fine but the character interplay is limited and they don't all gel and feel like a bunch old buddies. Eddie Marsan and Martin Freeman didn't seem like they would really be Pegg and Frost's mates. The script was just a bit too weak and hadn't been fleshed out fully. Pace wise the film was very up and down - and then ending felt rushed but had the potential to be very good.All in all - if you're a fan of the Cornetto Trilogy already it's a definite must see to watch your favourite actors back together again.For everyone else it's worth a watch and certainly better than most of the other dross advertised in the pre-movie trailers.",The World's End
381,samturver1200,Did Not Like It,3,3 June 2017,"what does the cornetto trilogy and the godfather trilogy have in common? They both have a black sheep film, that being the godfather part 3 and The worlds End. Here are a list of things i didn't like about the worlds end -forgettable characters -the premise was unoriginal (that being that the human race never had the capability yo make technology) -Character reversals (that being Simon pegg was the goofball and Nick Frost was the straight man) -Generic Steve Jobs style villain -Not funny -main protagonists didn't feel like friends or even school yard friends, more like people who once talked to each other and had a massive argument at the end of the visit. -Ending Spoiler warning After confronting the alien masters and finishing the Golden mile, The aliens leave. whilst leaving, the aliens create an electromagnetic pulse to wipe out all of mans technology. The aftermath of the explosion shows that a complete disaster followed and that the five protagonists went there separate ways. This ending was very bleak and disappointing. In the first two Cornetto Trilogy films, the ending was a well earned happy ending because the protagonists had been through so much, that it was only natural for them to have a nice ending. Here, the ending was unnecessarily bleak. Overall, much like the godfather trilogy, i would just stick to the first two. I would also like to say that Paul is the unofficial Sequel to the cornetto trilogy, despite not being written or directed by Edgar Wright or having a cornetto ice cream in the film, Paul was funnier, had memorable characters and had a happier ending.",The World's End

389,ramzyb,Riding the train of past glory,4,3 December 2013,"Having enjoyed Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, I rented The World's End without checking any reviews -- Probably a good thing as I would've felt even more annoyed considering the generally positive reviews that this movie has received.The plot is simple -- Gary King gathers his school chums to embark on an epic pub crawl consisting of 12 pubs that finds its conclusion at the aptly named ""World's End"" pub. The central plot device revolves around Gary's insistence on finally conquering the pub crawl he and his mates couldn't finish during their youth.Gary King (Simon Pegg) plays a man-child unable to let go of the past and move on with his adult life. Unemployed, lonely, unfulfilled, and depressed, he decides to confront his old friends and convince them to join him on the fabled pub crawl. His friends, however, (Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan, and Martin Freeman) have all grown up and moved on with their lives.The first half of the movie involves Gary convincing his friends to join him on the pub crawl. After several drawn out confrontations all parties eventually agree to accompany Gary.The first thing that got me about about this movie was the humour. It isn't the same as Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. There's a distinct lack of snappy puns, clever wording, and generally funny banter, and instead most scenes devolve into awkward cringe humour, revolving around Gary's lack of maturity. I didn't find myself laughing very much in this movie, if at all. After the first hour you begin to grow tired of the recurring themes and jokes. OK, we understand Gary is a loser, we understand his ""friends"" aren't comfortable with the pub crawl, why don't they all just leave?The rest of the movie plays out in the same fashion. They get to a pub, Gary does something stupid, they reminisce about past events (do you remember that time..?), something happens, they move to the next pub and repeat. The characters don't mesh together very well, the dialogue is flat and unintersting, and it's difficult to get into the story or enjoy the characters when they spend literally every on screen minute complaining about their ""friend"" Gary.The story is held together with weak plot devices to keep the scenes moving forward, but it gets to the point where nothing makes sense anymore. We make fun of cheesy B-horror movies for characters making moronic decisions, but The World's End really begins to to carve a place for itself when the characters find out that the town has been invaded by alien robots hell-bent on indoctrinating humans, yet they still decide to continue with the pub crawl so as not to arouse any suspicion.Things really begin to take a turn for the worse when the movie devolves into relentless action scenes depicting 5 middle aged, unhealthy men who handily fight off hordes of robot soldiers without any difficulty. We're to believe that they're up against a super-advanced race of alien robots who are in the process of indoctrinating the world, yet the very same robots are unable to run faster than Andy (Nick Frost), an overweight middle aged man?All characters and central plot themes seem to follow boring established tropes and clichés -- There's the moment when the quiet and reserved character finally lashes out, there's the secret love, there's the establishing character moment which viewers could see from a mile away... It's as though the movie is checking off boxes as it trudges along.There are dozens more situations that are downright confusing from any point of view, such as Gary doing everything in his power to sabotage the groups escape so that he may live out his fantasy and finish the epic pub crawl, despite two of his friends being abducted by the aliens. But, perhaps the most annoying part was the abrupt and meaningless ending -- As if the conclusion of the movie was re-written on the back of a napkin and filmed at the last minute.As mentioned earlier, this movie seems to be riding the train of past success. The World's End serves no purpose other than sullying the positive reception that Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead created, as well as ending the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy on a bad note.Not worth the time or money -- Possibly worth renting, if only as a means of rounding off the Cornetto trilogy... Although on second thought, you may be better off forgetting this one and calling it the Two Flavour Cornetto Duology instead.4/10.",The World's End
390,koniev,it's amazingly bad,1,5 December 2013,"The movie is the worst sh that I've seen in my thirty years old life. It is one of the most serious candidates for the golden raspberry award. Idk, if it suppose to be funny, scarry or what. Irrevocably snatched me of one hour and forty minutes from my life. I do not know how retarded one have to be, to see this movie cool. I guess only the naive and mentally limited children, too drunken farmers and randomly selected movies in the cinema, would ever want to see this stupid crap of their own free will. All the actors encountered with this pathetic production should be ashamed for such debasement. The dialogues in the movie were hopeless, the concept of robots - terrible, message - sucks, the characters - illegible, script - as if was written by a five year old, special effects - average. I do not know at all how it was possible that I wasted as much time watching this senseless misunderstanding. I have no idea how they managed to collect forty million to produce this thing... certainly not on Kickstarter. Extremely shallow movie.

391,pymdnl,Disappointing,6,10 November 2013,"I was pretty excited for this film thanks to the other Edgar Wright pictures, I loved each and every one of them(Yes, even the controversial Scott Pilgrim). So if you have seen my rating you already know I was disappointed, but let me make this clear 6/10 is an above average rating for me, bit better than average. So let's start with the problems: Too much exposition at the beginning without any relevant character information(except for the protagonist). The first 5 minutes of the movie with the flashback sequences was too fast paced and with nothing interesting to learn about. We barely learned about the characters throughout the movie, which should have been a key element, on the contrary: in Hot Fuzz, I can recall any minor character with unique personality and here, I didn't even know our main heroes. The actors were pretty good, but there was a change this time Simon Pegg's character was the slacker type and Nick Frost was the snob, which didn't suit him at all. Making Gary King the protagonist was not a good idea, although Simon Pegg's portrayal was really good, this character should be on the side and carry the story with a caring main guy. A character who has given up on life and just wants to slack and he is miserable, is not the best person audiences can connect with, or want to connect with. The editing was horrible, I would have laughed much more, If the editing were more fast paced at times, but most of them have fallen flat for me. The effects were pretty good, It kept me interested in how they did it, at least. I would recommend this movie to regular pub crawlers though It could be a funny experience with friends and beer and etc. But I am sadly not that type of person.",The World's End

The plot development didn't entertain me very much, and although I loved Simon Pegg's character (Gary King), as I found it fun and interesting, the four other friend's of his struck me as all the same: successful people who didn't want anything to do with their old pal anymore. I found them a bit arrogant, especially Nick Frost's character, Andrew Knightly. ""That is probably the worst and most boring role Nick Frost has ever portrayed"" I thought to myself, while comparing it to his other characters from Shaun of the dead, Paul and Hot Fuzz. But boy oh boy I was wrong. Dead wrong.Andrew Knightly is the most badass role Nick Frost has ever portrayed. He's cool, brutal, confident, sincere and... Well he just kicks ass! Hell, I'd marry him. My point view completely changed to this as soon as the five friends discover what's really going on in their old hometown. At this point, there's more action, funnier jokes, and all the characters get's less boring (in tact with their alcohol consumption). Steven, who seemed like a snob at first hand, became a real good guy who deserved more than he got. Pete became a really sympathetic character as you learn of his past and how bravely he has dealt with it. Oliver is kind of a different case, but I don't wanna spoil anything for you guys. You also learn why Andrew despises Gary so much, and you come to understand his behavior. You see it as not boring, but the only choice he has had as a result from certain events in his past... and his present days. Nevertheless, as soon as Andrew hurls down drinks like the beast he is, his behaviour gets ten times more brutal. Like a gorilla on steroids, just a lot more hairy. Ultimately you begin to respect him... and not just the hulk version of him but also his serious side. Gary is found out to be much more than just an anarchistic and lazy goof ball. His character is actually rather tragic and caught in his past to such a degree that you pity him. He's simply too caught up with his past self that he cannot change. Circumstances that has driven him far...Anyway, To me The World's End is an action packed, funny sci-fi movie and a true marvel in the cornetto trilogy. However for this movie to have scored a 10/10, it would have required a more engaging beginning. This movies also marks the sad goodbye to a trilogy which I've loved for many years and as i've re-watched Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz numerous of times, I'll do the same with The World's End. But there certainly still will be more movies with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Trust me. Because after all, it is not the world's end.",The World's End
393,sb-901-395404,Not very funny but right on the money.,5,10 January 2014,"Not sure if the creators of this movie are trying to say something but the analogy gives pause for thought. This spoof of invasion of the body snatchers turns the warnings of that movie on their head. In the original, the metaphor was that the protagonist was fleeing from the communist threat that was taking people over while they ""slept"". This was the warning from the capitalists, owners of Hollywood.However, in the ""The World's End"" we see it is the Capitalists who have taken over society, where individuals have become empty headed consumers controlled by the world wide web and ""connectivity"", sold as ""freedom"". The masters of humankind do not wish you to fight them but obey them ""willingly"", which entails becoming a robot slave, who thinks they are free, despite obviously being not.These ""free"" robots (slaves) represent the wage slaves in today's capitalist society who are constantly indoctrinated that they are ""free"" and live in a ""free"" society (somebody once said, ""There is nothing more pitiful and a slave who thinks he is free""). Moreover, they are told that they live in a ""democracy"", which in fact they do not. Instead people are given representative democracy, which is expressly designed to counter and control expressions of genuine democracy.And remember, the capitalists regard us as children in need of guidance not able to think for ourselves and if we continue to rebel against them, then society will crumble, the ""World will End"". However, the movie suggests life without might not be so bad after all, in fact, after a little adjustment, it might a little better without crap technology and crap food.",The World's End
394,marfcord,Original and hilarious,10,21 April 2014,"If you are looking for a comedy film with coherent story and plausible happenings, you probably will not like it. Here, not even the characters convince as possible human beings, once their line of reasoning and dialogues are absurd, to say the least.If you are open-minded and find humor and amusement in the nonsense, keep on reading, because this movie might be for you! Back in the 90s, 5 teenage friends failed to accomplish ""the golden mile"": going in 12 pubs in a row and drinking a pint of beer in each of them. 20 years later, in their adulthood, they are gathered again by the only one of them who really still cared about finishing the challenge.To this point, OK. A regular comedy film could have this premise. But in the most abrupt fashion, everything becomes a mess - but in a really good way. I won't write more to avoid spoiling the experience, but a very interesting feature of this film is that the script unfolds in a pretty peculiar pace, with many sudden and nonsensical overturns. This element by itself already made me laugh out loud many times - not to mention the many silly quick-witted dialogues. The acting and the directing are also brilliant, and the special effects are quite impressive. I also enjoyed the soundtrack, which sometimes brought me back to the 90s.That said, I guess the whole experience will depend on your sense of humor - and I particularly loved it! That is a truly remarkable comedy film to watch drinking beer with some good ol' pals.",The World's End
395,darkmarshall,The Weakest of the Three,7,12 February 2015,"...still manages to suck me in. *minor spoilers...* First off all, if you haven't seen any of the Man-Child Movies like The Hangover (or their equivalents), this film will be a slow-starter for you. However, even if you haven't seen them, you will know what they are making fun of. Plus a weird take on Invasion of the Body Snatchers...What doesn't work in the third installment of the Cornetto Trilogy?1)The re-hash of old jokes. While I don't mind them personally, I can see why others will think it is a lack of originality.2) A seemingly weak ending. Personally, I felt the ending of the film fit the overall tone of the movie. It was over the top, reasonably understandable, and made some good points about the human condition. However... ""f**k it"". Let's watch Mad Max, why not?3) The effects. Atfirst, I like the idea of Barbie aliens made of old-school doll design. However, by the end of the film it starts to take its toll. The fact that they are able to sneak around town with hundreds of flashlight faces running around and still can't seem to find them seems silly.Beyond that, the film works very well. I love word play and this film is filled with it. There are a great many subtle jokes that will only be noticed the 2nd and 3rd time around. Is it as good as Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz? No. But it's a wonderful film with a big heart. Oh, and Nick Frost actually plays a normal dude and does it very well. I love to see actors get out of their sphere of comfort.The pacing is all over the place and, at times, it feels as if the writers are juggling too many story arcs at once, only to drop them all end of the film.",The World's End
396,stefan-woo,Cornetto Trilogy goes out with a 'zzz',6,23 July 2013,"Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz are two fantastic comedy action films, Both films contain lines which will be repeated and remembered fondly forever. However The World's End does not, Me and two other friends left the cinema completely unaffected by this film, We couldn't remember a single line or engaging moment in the whole film and apparently neither could the rest of the theater as the film barely got a laugh throughout, 2 people to our right, Left about 20 minutes from the end.The pub crawl concept is actually decent but it was ruined by the lack of cohesion between the five main characters, You never really felt that these five were really lifetime friends, When some of them inevitably met their demise you honestly didn't care.I also found it a bit strange seeing Simon Pegg in the role of the idiot and Nick Frost in the role of the serious character, Gary King played by Simon was not a likable idiot the same way Ed and Danny were.The pacing of the film was very odd too, It starts off fairly smooth but suddenly goes all over the place, The last 30 minutes was directionless chaos with a forced in at the last minute message about Technology.To put it simply, The World's End suffers from sequelitis, It was always going to be compared to the first two but you hoped it was good enough to stand on it's own two feet. Unfortunately it never did.",The World's End

The only thing good about the movie was the epilogue because I knew the movie had almost ended. The movie is totally senseless, the plot is totally meaningless. Believe me, there are a lot better movies out there. Don't think that I only like those boring movies with good plot. I like entertaining movies in general. This movie was so bad that I felt responsible to veer other people from watching it, yes this is the first time I have reviewed a bad movie. If you want to watch something new and light try watching The hot tub time machine or We are the millers or Horrible Bosses or The interview or Zombieland or Shawn of the dead or Ted.

398,jonnemuistaa,An excellent film in its genre,7,13 October 2020,"This movie was an enjoyable viewing experience. Reliving the adventures of youth as a middle-aged was a topic that appealed to me. The film is aptly absurd, and many are sure to be entertained by the numerous martial arts scenes. In my opinion, there could have been about 75% fewer fights and the movie would still have worked. I liked the first two parts of the ""movie trilogy"" more, but this one was good too.The acting work was solid. Although Nick Frost's character was too serious for my taste - I want my Nick Frost to be a goofy!

If you're a big Simon and Nick fan like myself, you would very much enjoy this movie! :) The ending was brilliant, made me laugh the most. It's a proper man's movie but still enjoyable for anyone. It's really great to see Nick Frost play a more serious character for most of the film! It's film I can watch over and over again and not get bored.

400,fionaleongziyi,A twist of sci-fi action in a comedy,6,23 July 2017,"At first the movie started out about a guy, Gary King who wants to finish up what he never did "" The World's End"" when he was young. It started out with Gary finding all his 4 friends and he called them as a group of ""five musketeers"". He faced some hardships when gathering all of them for the reunion but he finally succeed in persuading all of them to do ""The World's End"" (five guys. twelve pubs. sixty pints). They went back to Newton Haven and started with the first pub. Suddenly, the movie turns to a sci-fi action comedy with Gary arguing with a teenager in the toilet and started fighting, only to notice that the teenager wasn't even a human! His head came off with ""blue blood""! Just in time, Gary's four friends came barge in the toilet to question him about Gary lying about his mother's death and they started a war with the 'Robots', only to found out that the plans of 'Robots' to replace the townies if the people don't surrender. Overall, it is a fun comedy to watch on Friday night.",The World's End
401,RockerJarvis,You might love it or hate it. The Marmite of the Cornetto Trilogy,7,15 June 2014,"The World's End was never going to have the same buzz or appeal like Shaun Of The Dead, which everyone was interested in being the whole horror/zombie boom at the time, and it was never going to have the intrigue of Hot Fuzz, being the second in the trilogy with people expecting what next, but what it has for it, is that its the final return of 'the team' (Edgar Write, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost) in a humble Sci-Fi affair, along with some massive names in British talent. Along with the obvious Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, we have the likes of Paddy Considine, who is an amazing talent. The Office favourite, Martin Freeman, who lets just say has been doing rather well in the film stakes lately. Eddie Marsan who i feel is one of the most talented British actors working at the moment, this man can act, and holding the lady flag high, we have Rosamund Pike, who over the last few years, has become a household name, and is only getting better.The World's End is about Gary (Simon Pegg) who wants to go back to his hometown of Newton Haven after leaving 20 years previously, and is hellbent on getting together with his 4 best mates and go on drinking marathon pub crawl. Gary, still acting like the kid from back in the days, sees that everyone has moved on with their lives and grown up. Andrew (Nick Frost) is now a solicitor. Steve (Paddy Considine) owns his own company in construction. Oliver (Martin Freeman) works in property, and Peter (Eddie Marsan) is a partner at his fathers car dealership. Gary has to try and convince everyone to meet up and try and complete the 'Golden Mile' which they were never able to complete for numerous reason as teenagers, all with the expectation to complete it this time, one way or another. The Golden Mile for Gary and his friends have many memories connected to it from their childhood, some good, some bad, and many a underlying reason why some of his mates have lost touch with Gary over the years.The World's End has a long but slightly drawn out opening sequence, an entertaining, if a bit mashed up middle, an odd and pointless conclusion, and an an least unconventional, if on a personal opinion, weirdly unnecessary epilogue.The start seems to drag a bit. We have the introduction of the characters, which is enjoyable, but its the same for 20 minutes. There are a couple great jokes here at the start though, with the likes of the tape player joke, or the owner of the car moment, plus it really shows you how our main character Gary is still in the past. The middle, made up with the 'Golden Mile' is quite interesting. The whole back and forth between the pubs, with 'down memory lane' stories told by each character is a smart way for us, the viewer, to understand who these friends really were back in the day, and how strong their relationships once was. Their are some funny characters introduced here too, mainly at the pubs that they go to, and with the whole alien invasion turn in the story, how is played out is done well, if a bit odd at times. The whole conclusion seems just a whole smack in the face, with a few WTF moments. I really didn't enjoy how it concluded. The path some of our characters take just seem a bit selfish in the grand scale of things, and the epilogue, even though rather fitting to the films name, has some silly revelations.There are a few laughs here and there. For me personally I feel it's not on par with Shaun Of The Dead or even Hot Fuzz, on laughs scale but it still has a few thrown in. The fight scenes at first are excellent, and even latter there is some great moments within the first scenes, but we start to get more and more of them that they seem just a bit messy and uneasy to follow.There is a back story here which is quite heartfelt come the end of things, especially considering what some of the characters have gone through, but when the main character, Gary, comes across as an annoying prat, it loses some of appeal. However with we have to remember, he hasn't really grown up. He is suppose to come across as a childish fool. He still still acts like he did back when he was a teenagers, he wants to continue to be in a time where he was king of his friends, a time where loved, where lost, and where he had friends, where he has family. The time where he has it all, and was happy, not now, not where he is unhappy, where things have moved on, and in his eye, for the worse.The World's End has a great cast, and some awesomely funny moments, and action scenes. The whole Sci-Fi element of the film is intriguing, but does get repetitive after the first 20 minutes. The meaning of trying to go back to when there were things you loved or lost, is something that we could all feel at certain times. The mix of British humour with Sci- Fi thrown in for good measure, works well. The ending was the weakest point for me, but many will enjoy the change of conclusion.This is the Marmite of the Cornetto Trilogy, you will either love or hate it, i thought it was the worst of the three, however if you enjoyed it, then good for you, here's an ice cream.",The World's End
402,firemagefm,"All in all, relatively mediocre. Goes out with a whimper.",5,7 September 2013,"To be completely honest, I did not have high hopes for this film from the previews. I absolutely loved Shaun of the Dead & Hot Fuzz in terms of Simon Pegg's written (or co-written) movies--not sure of others really. Haven't seen Paul, I believe it is.In any case, the previews for this movie made it seem ""too"" stupid, a form of stupid that I wouldn't enjoy. I'm not sure how to articulate what I mean here, but there's hilarity through stupidity and then there's stupidity that doesn't get anywhere. Some people can go ""You don't get it then,"" but they can buzz off!The movie starts off okay. I was fine with the premise, but I completely hated the way Simon Pegg's character was introduced in the first 15 minutes or so. Sure, he's meant to be portrayed as an ass who is stuck in the past, but I couldn't get past the character. I just wanted him to go away. So you can say ""That's good character"" or you can agree with me in that he could've been presented in a different way.As seems to happen, like in Shaun of the Dead, the movie tries to tackle certain serious points among the stupidity. Making points about free will, finding happiness in life, and so on. But collectively, the movie does that for less than 10 minutes or so, even when it comes to really crucial points, like the scene that appears to reveal Simon's character as being a ""cutter"" and having been admitted to the hospital for such suicidal tendencies. This reveal explains a prior reluctance to show his arms, but it's ultimately brushed aside in the movie.The movie is too repetitive on the fight scenes. We get it, there's robots/""blanks""/alien captors. We don't need to waste so much time on the fight scenes.And don't get me started about the ending. I can't really remember Hot Fuzz, but Shaun had a rather abrupt ending if I can remember. This movie... hits you with a ton of things in the span of 15 minutes and altogether left most of the people in the audience sitting in silence, somewhat stunned and annoyed. Sure, this isn't a drama for storytelling but that doesn't mean that you just completely screw the story when you don't know how to wrap-up. That's one of my biggest peeves.That last bit starts with the alien ""discussion""/argument scene where Simon's character talks the aliens into leaving. Sure, it was a little funny, and I guess I don't know what I expected, but it didn't feel right to me. And then the apocalyptic aftermath and brush-aside was just... I guess I'm at a loss of words for how to describe these things, because I don't want to just call them stupid. They simply left me (and many others) feeling frustrated.All in all, the movie didn't live up to previous expectations of Pegg and others. The previews had me put-off too, though. I was glad to see that Nick Frost adopted the serious persona in this movie, however, essentially being the ""head"" of everything though Pegg still ""lead"" the group about.I guess I just thought the movie could've done way better. These movies seem to explore some parts of human life while at the same time being stupid and hilarious. This movie, on the other hand, glossed over most of the human aspects and filled the humor with ""robot"" fights.",The World's End
403,krzl,"Boring rubbish, don't bother.",2,2 August 2013,"Saw it with a friend tonight. Disappointing. We both found it to be boring unfunny drivel.The basic plot remains just that throughout - too basic. There we were hoping something more would develop, but it never happened. Five guys aiming to drink in all 12 pubs in their childhood town - talked into it by Mr. Pegg's character - suddenly it turns out the town is over-run by ""robots"" who've replaced most of the townsfolk... then wastes more time explaining about how no they're not ""robots""... oh they need another name for them... more time wasted on pointless fiddle filler that adds nothing of value.Some pseudo sci-fi at the end with some alien species... and the very end was even more pathetic and stupid.Clearly a rushed and poorly thought out and executed movie.Don't believe the hype!

405,smallvillefan6290,Another enjoyable film to end the trilogy,8,1 September 2013,"I've been a fan of Simon Pegg's work since I first watched Shaun of the Dead on Christmas Day when I got the DVD as a gift. I also loved Hot Fuzz and watch the two movies on a regular basis. Needless to say, I really had to go see World's End on the first day of release. I wasn't fully sure what to expect because these movies tend to throw the viewer for a loop. While the first two were more about a turn on romance/life crisis and action/finding your center movie this one was more about reliving the glory days and going back to the old town. The jokes, just like the first two movies, were great and I was laughing all the way through. The cast worked well together, including Nick Frost who plays a fantastic straight man in Andy to Pegg's screw-up in life for Gary F$^%ing KING! I won't get into many spoilers because I think you could wind up ruining it for someone else but, for the third time, the movie threw me for a loop on my preconceived notions. The ending especially had me since it was absolutely nowhere close to how I thought it would end.I hate to see the Cornetto trilogy end but all great things must come to a close and this is a pretty good way to do that. There are a TON of references throughout the movie (game machine from the Winchester, etc) and honestly got heartbreaking at points but balanced it incredibly well. One moment was heart wrenching and the next I'm laughing yet again. Just go and see this movie. You shouldn't need me to tell you that if you're even looking at this page trying to decide.Finally, if all that didn't convince you, it has really well done fight scenes which was nothing near what I was expecting from this movie. None of that irritating shakycam stuff that's been in a lot of movies and they are still able to keep the references and laughs going in these scenes as well. FANTASTIC!",The World's End
406,oneyng,Extremely disappointing,4,25 August 2013,"I'm a huge fan of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Shaun of the Dead is almost flawless and though Hot Fuzz is kind of slow and suffers a little from some stupid moments, (not stupid funny, just stupid) it's extremely charming and interesting from start to finish.The World's End starts off pretty strong, halfway through hits a point that blows your mind to pieces, then pretty much dies.The biggest problem to me is that the movie suffers from tensionless fight scenes that show the main middle aged drunken characters killing everyone and everything that fights them effortlessly. There was a huge effort put into choreography for martial arts fight scenes, but it instantly sucked the charm out of the movie.Yes, I know it's a comedy. But Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz worked so well as movies because what was happening (though funny)was actually very tense and realistic. The zombies and townspeople actually posed a threat and they struggled to overcome them. The humor came from people behaving like people in those given situations. The fight scenes in this movie drag for so long and just aren't very interesting (except for the pint spilling joke.)Also there was a few moments when I just felt they could have written it a bit better. Peter falls behind in the woods and stands there talking to a threatening robot as all of his friends walk away, and this is a long time after they know they are being followed. He dies, and no one really cares. Then near the end the entire town is chasing them and the robots are literally in front and behind them, but yet still don't manage to stop them. And if they're robots wouldn't they have brain power to calculate, record and send what they are doing to one another. How did they manage to lose them? It all just seems like a bad idea for a film. I was really enjoying it until the robot story began.The final reveal of the movie is also pretty terrible. They literally have to explain it for 5 minutes and it's just stupid and adds more holes and stupidity to the plot.It definitely had some hilarious moments but for the most part I was just not interested, and the main characters didn't seem to care that their friends were dying and being replaced so why should I.Worth a watch, but I'll never watch it again.",The World's End
407,jamesringlis,Do not waste your time or money,3,30 August 2013,"Sorry, but this is a really disappointing movie. The third in the ""trilogy"", ""The World's End"" in no way lives up to ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Hot Fuzz"". Movie started out with promise and then fizzled to just a monotonous time sitting in a dark room after 20 minutes. There are some funny bits, but overall this movie is not even worthy of Netflix never mind paying money to see it. I was really looking forward to this movie but Simon Pegg and Nick Frost really let me down. It's almost like they had a good idea for half a movie and decided to make up the last half as they were filming it. Hell, I'd rather watch have to sit through ""Paul"" six more times than see this movie a second time. If you want to see Pegg and Frost in a good movie revisit ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Hot Fuzz"".",The World's End
408,AronDWillms,Amazingly original premise but it lacks the realism that allows you to care about the characters.,4,31 August 2013,"So last night I went to see this film with a large group of friends and initially had a pretty good time with it. Then I went home and let it sit with me for a little bit, and the more I thought about it, the more my opinion changed. I love the idea of a movie surrounding a pub crawl. It's original, brings out interesting characters, and has a lot of potential for laughs. Especially when it stars people like Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Bilbo Baggins himself, Martin Freeman. Unfortunately that premise is nearly impossible to enjoy because the only character who is really into it is barely likable, making the entire first third of the movie slow and painful. It had some laughs in it but when you're making the followup to Hot Fuzz, you need more than that. The second third of the movie is when the robots come into play and it's here that the movie changes pace for the best part of the movie. The robots, while a very present danger, didn't actually have a direct impact on events. Meanwhile, characters are getting more into it, allowing for a more enjoyable experience. The final third is where things really start to go south, and, I am warning you now, there will be spoilers in what you read next. So basically this is the point in the movie where characters start dying off. But it's not treated as though they are dead. It's treated as though they got fed up with the pub crawl and went home. So when the robots kill someone, they turn their bodies into fertilizer for the ground and create a doppelganger with the same appearance, voice, and memories. And yet people have no problem treating these things exactly like the people they murdered. The fact that the victims die is barely even mentioned throughout the whole film, making it very difficult to maintain any form of connection to any of the characters due to the lack of believability. On top of all this, in the final confrontation scene with the head of the robots, there is a moment where you could have had an epic speech made by Simon that would have actually made sense in the film's narrative. Instead, what follows is Simon's character essentially telling the main villain, who has been killing MILLIONS of people over the course of 10 years, that he is unwilling to submit to him. How does the mass murderer respond? ""There's just no reasoning with you, is there?"" And then it LEAVES. Millions of people rejecting it over 10 years and its answer is to kill them. But now suddenly it decides that it should leave. Oh, but it leaves the replacements behind. And then the replacements are treated as though they are part of the human race, and are actually openly replacing the people they killed with no complaints from anyone who isn't being portrayed as a prejudiced monster. I would have preferred it if they had stuck to their plan in the second act and gone through all 12 pubs while running from the robots, only to discover the following morning that the whole thing had been a drunken hallucination. You could even still have Simon's epic speech. Some of the characters' back-stories were very sub- par as well in that some characters' back-stories exist for no reason other than to cause their own deaths. Amazingly original premise but it lacks the realism that allows you to care about the characters, which is needed in any survival horror type movie, comedy or otherwise. So even though there was some clever humor in the dialogue, ultimately this film did not meet my expectations. If you are going to watch it, I'd recommend playing it in the background while something else is going on. Oh well, this may have been disappointing, but at least we still have Hot Fuzz!",The World's End
409,olivercalveley,"Good, but not on par with the other two6.5 / 10",7,23 July 2013,"It took a little while to get into this film, meaning that the beginning wasn't that great! Basically Pegg's character is rounding his old school mates up for another shot at the famous 12 bar pub crawl that they famously failed many years ago. It seemed to me that ALL the characters bar Simon Pegg's were the same character. Now grown up, with a family, career etc. They were stereo- typically boring and serious with a strong hatred of having fun. This was kind of annoying for me. This meant that Pegg's character had to single-handedly carry the film for the first half an hour. Don't get me wrong I do like Simon Pegg, but all that comedic talent had not one funny thing to say! A waste if you ask me. This carried on into the pub crawl. Getting a little tedious now. Who doesn't love pub crawl's/ale trails etc?Anyway moving on, the middle. After an epic scene in one of the pubs bathroom's the gang realise that something isn't quite right in their hometown. Hell bent on finishing the bar crawl Pegg's character persuades the others to carry on. FINALLY Nick Frosts character comes into his own. This is when the film starts getting good. Still not much from the others but we all know how Pegg and Frost can carry a film. Some extremely strong action scenes take place and it's just a lot of fun. Again Frost's character steals the show in these. You can't stop a Frost with momentumEverything is exciting, funny and tense all the way up to the last 10/15 minutes. It takes a strange twist and gets oddly serious and not very funny. At all. I don't want to explain more without spoiling it for you guys but you'll see what I mean.In conclusion - like the first two Frost and Pegg needed to work together, bounce off each-other and so on. It seemed that they were against each-other for large parts of this film. This was the recipe for the first two films success and I don't really understand why they didn't use this throughout again. Maybe it was because Pegg's character took the 'buffoon' lead this time. I'm not sure.There were also some unnecessary dark and depressing undertones to the film. Too serious for me, not in line with the first two. They should have lightened it up a little.But overall despite my negative points it was definitely an enjoyable film with hints of the first two cornetto films creeping in. Unfortunately though these were JUST hints.",The World's End
410,DrKnockers05,My rating out of 10; the amount of pubs in the film! (Very Mild Spoilers),10,28 July 2013,"Only 3 films have truly impressed me this year; Iron Man 3, This is the End, and this gem of a film known as...The World's End. I loved every minute of it. The action, the laughs, even the drama! This film had it all! While Shaun of the Dead saw Simon Pegg and Nick Frost killing zombies, and Hot Fuzz had them enforcing the law to a twisted community, this one has them, along with a few new friends, going on an epic pub crawl from their childhood whilst trying to survive a robot menace in the town. Granted, it may not appeal to some 'across the pond' due to it's, let's call it, 'British-y' sense of humour, but the 2 previous films in the so-called 'Blood and Ice Cream' trilogy' were positively reviewed by our American friends so I'm sure this one will be too. The ensemble cast made up of the epics that are Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Eddie Marsan are perfect together. The film also featured Rosamund Pike who I feel could have done with a little bit more screen time, but still had enough to feel like an important character, and a fair few other stars which I won't spoil for you but with some being recognizable from previous films in the trilogy, and others being new to it all completely, one of which was truly awesome. Each of the 5 main characters has their own little story to tell, some with plenty of humour, others with emotion that will surely tug at the hearts of some of the audience (especially with Pegg's story). However, the laughs are at an all-time high in this one, particularly with Pegg's character Gary King. In fact, one quote he says in it made me laugh so hard, I'm sure I laughed for a full 2 minutes in the screening room, then laughed when remembering it AFTER the film, and even going so far as to give it the title of 'Funniest Movie Quote I've ever heard'. Of course, the film isn't without it's action side. While not being as 'bloody' as the 2 previous films (save for a few cuts and bruises, human gore is at an all-time low in the trilogy), that doesn't mean it lacks other sorts of violence and blood...actually, it's more like ink (those who have seen the film, and even the trailer, will understand that reference). One action scene was a particular highlight for me, showing Nick Frost's character Andy Knightley as being incredibly skilled in pub fights and Pegg's Gary trying as hard as he can to fight...without spilling his pint. The CGI is impressive when needed, the acting was great, the action scenes were faultless, and the humour was so perfect, it almost flowed like a stream throughout the film, never once faulting. And if you keep your eye out in some scenes, die-hard fans of previous Edgar Wright-Simon Pegg-Nick Frost collaborations will notice a few nods to Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and even their TV Series, Spaced (to hint at a few; look out for a certain Mary from 'Shaun' in the beginning next to Pegg, an artistic friend from Spaced serving pints, and a familiar, icy, creamy snack...sort of). Overall, a truly incredible film once again from our 3 favourite friends in film. Here's to more films from Wright, Pegg, and Frost in the future! Let's just say after this one, fans will definitely be hoping for more from these geniuses.",The World's End
411,zuhairi1994,Disappointing but good,8,22 December 2013,"This film suffers the same problem as last year's (2012) Seven Psychopaths - huge expectations, poor satisfactions.Out of many films this year, this films is still good. The dialogues are still sharp, the editing and special effects are top notch, and the soundtrack is wonderful. One thing that I would like to really mention here is the main theme of the film. Compared to Shaun and Fuzz, The World's End complex theme on youth and regrets are something rare and special.However, compared to previous films of the Cornetto Trilogy, The World's End suffers from poor story and character development. The switching of Pegg's and Frost's character personality is a good attempt but unsatisfying. Not trying to contradict myself, the dialogues are sharp and fact pace but most of them are not funny. Smart, but humourless.In summary, The World's End is a good chapter to end the Cornetto Trilogy but don't expect it to be as funny or as smart as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.",The World's End
412,MrBenzene33,Didn't Want It To End,9,16 August 2013,"The Cornetto series continues with nothing short of what you'd expect from Wright, Pegg and Frost. Delivering top laughs with great action and a little bit of romance to suit all audiences. The film's visual style is quite appealing. The only downside to this film some may see is that the gore is not traditional (being robots). The style of violence in Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz shine through with just a bit of a blue tint. The characters are just plain lovable and hilarious in their own ways. Most of the laughs in this film came straight from dialogue of characters rather than visuals. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film, a fun comedy with nothing to pick on whatsoever A top film just like the others!",The World's End

414,ciara-b,Good on Reflection,6,26 July 2013,"This film was most certainly promising from the onset. The cast great, the genre great, the film... OK! This film seemed lacking to a degree in humour, original humour, unlike Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's prior collaboration.The real confusion and annoyance I had about this film was the hype about it prior to release. How is this film the last of a trilogy? The best collaborative film Pegg and Frost did together was Paul! Yes, agreed, they weren't the 'stars' of that film but it was in my opinion their greatest cinematic achievement together. So why dare I say it has Paul not been included in this mystical Trilogy?The film though lacking in areas made up for others with a wonderful cast and story. The theme of the film being based around 'robots, but not robots' was engaging to the end, and the end -for my taste at least- was where the film picked up. I very often get bored and annoyed by the typical... 'and they lived happily after' realisation or something to equivalent those words. However, as is true to their nature the boys didn't stuck to the ordinary and attempted a more original ending. A near apocalypse to be precise! This was much more fun to watch and made me think 'well I would have never guest that!'On reflection this film is worth a firm 6/7 could be more could be less, depends on my mood I guess you'd say!",The World's End
415,Jacob-charnick,One of my favourite comedies ever made,10,2 October 2014,"To start with, I am a huge fan of the whole trilogy. Shaun of the dead and hot fuzz are both great, great films. I was, needless to say, very excited to see this film. Upon my first viewing of the film in the cinema I was disappointed. The more I thought about it the more I warmed to it and wanted to watch it again. I purchased it when it came out on DVD to watch it again and I fell in love with it. And here's why:The film is very different from the first two films, I think the integral reason for this is the fact that 'The Worlds End' has a lot of heart and it has quite a sad, melancholy current running through it making it not only very funny but also very moving. Yes, the film is about a bunch of old guys who stumble into an alien invasion whilst on a nostalgia-driven pub crawl filled with resentment. The real and main theme is really a tale about a sad man who never quite moved on from the golden days of his adolescence whilst his old friends clearly have. His desperate attempt to reconnect with them whilst wearing a comedic mask is wrapped up in a surprisingly moving final act where Pegg and Frost come together in the last pub of the crawl. This is what I find so great about the film is that it works on so many levels, it's a comedy with a great amount of heart, truth and emotion. A lot of passion seemed to go into this film from Edgar Wright and the dynamic duo. I would urge anyone who didn't enjoy this film to view it again in a different light and re consider it.",The World's End
416,karly-is-here,Not quite what I expected,7,4 August 2013,"I walked into the cinema expecting pretty much Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz all over again. But this one seemed a little different somehow. I suspect it was mainly because Simon Pegg's character was quite different to in the other movies- still useless, but the time was aware of it. I found the movie a bit less light hearted than the others, however that's not to say it was serious by any accord. It was still the typical beer drinking, Cornetto eating group running through the town towards the pub. As a standalone movie though, I really did enjoy it. Although a newcomer to the trilogy might not really get the running gags, the movie itself is strong on its own. Definitely give it a go, but don't expect anything deep or well thought out.",The World's End
417,AJsMoviePix,Best of the trilogy,9,8 September 2013,"The final film in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy is the most mature and maybe even the best. Hot Fuzz is still the funniest, Shaun of the Dead is still the most original, but I think The World's End may be my favorite. This movie, which is about a simple pub crawl, has a very epic scale. By the end of this film, it has switched from being a wacky comedy into being a sci-fi action thriller, though it still provides plenty of laughs. The story's structure is very similar to Shaun of the Dead's, which starts slowly but gradually builds until the massive climax. This is by far the funniest film of this year and my personal favorite. It's a great wrap-up to what is now my favorite movie trilogy of all time. Go see it.",The World's End
418,barbequeyou,The Cornetto Trilogy Is Complete...,7,8 November 2013,"A film review by Greg CraddockAnd so the Cornetto trilogy is complete. This third and final film from Simon Pegg & Edgar Wright has definite similarities to the other two that came before it, especially SOTD. Having said that it is a rather clever story in its own right. The writing is very clever, especially in a timing manner aiming to quite a clever audience of us viewers. It starts off with very clever wit and humour, with a slightly nostalgic tug at anyone of the age. Then it starts to slightly slow down a little, and then just as you think this is a bit slow.... ... BOOM and so it begins. The performances are excellent, especially from Simon Pegg & in my opinion Eddie Marsan (Peter Page) who down plays his character brilliantly.For anyone who has seen Shaun Of The Dead & Hot Fuzz then this is a must watch for sure. Whether this film would perhaps be such a hit if it had been the first of the three I'm not so sure.We that have seen the first two are aware of why this is called ""The Cornetto trilogy"", but it's a bit harder to spot in this last hoorah. Can you spot it?",The World's End
419,HerbieVore,Hugely disappointing-AVOID!,1,23 November 2013,"Having really enjoyed the first two outings (Hot Fuzz is one of my all-time favourite movies of any genre) this was a massive disappointment. I missed the cinema showings, so I eagerly awaited an iTunes rental. I thought for a few seconds before deciding to buy it, as I thought that like with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, I would be watching and enjoying it a number of times. I didn't even bother to watch the trailer! Big mistake! Unfortunately the wit and cleverness of the first two films was sadly lacking in this one. I cannot find anything whatsoever in this movie to give some positive feedback about. I certainly still feel cheated, and I was motivated to join IMDb purely as a way of expressing my huge disappointment with this movie, and to hopefully flag-up to anyone who hasn't seen it to avoid it. It has certainly sullied my admiration for Messrs Pegg and Frost. As far as the majority of the user reviews are concerned, I can only imagine it's a case of the emperor's new clothes. This is one of the few movies that I switched off about half way through as I thought it was puerile (I'd had a few glasses of wine, but even that didn't dull the overwhelming feeling of disappointment!). I do hope Messrs Pegg and Frost can return to form in their next project, as this one didn't even deserve a straight-to-DVD release. When they do, I'll be sure to watch the trailer before making up my mind to watch next time!",The World's End

A cast riddled with stars and funnymen alike comes across as several actor friends producing a script during a night on the booze and just not re-reading it the following morning. Martin Freeman, shame on you for going through with it. The Hot Fuzz element of the film catches the imagination of the viewer until the film just does not improve. Surely actors of this fame can't just be cashing in on the public's allegiance to the cast? Bizarrely rubbish and not at all rubbish in a funny way.

Like most unconventional films, it has its ups and downs... and unlike more commercial releases, it's unpredictable: just when you think it's about this... suddenly, it's about something else entirely.Love Simon Pegg in Star Trek: The Reboot and thought he was great here. Manic yet desperate, funny and pathetic.The other actors - especially the friend owed 600 quid - were great. The special effects were believable. The script was funny.My only complaint was how much of the film's dialogue was bleeped on the broadcast I saw.

423,Timetravelling_Monkey,"Didn't love it, didn't hate it.Entertaining but forgetful...",6,23 July 2013,"...which is a real shame for an Edgar Wright\ Simon Pegg title, especially when it's being hailed as the last of the Cornetto Trilogy, therefore presumably their last cinematic collaboration together. I've been following their work since Spaced, I loved Shaun of the Dead and to a slightly lesser extent Hot Fuzz. Both were great comedies with fantastically written characters, amazing set pieces and laughs at every turn. Shaun of the Dead was a great homage to the Romero Zombie genre. In Hot Fuzz there were references to Westerns and cop buddy movies, so it seems a logical step to make the final part of the trilogy a Sci-fi extravaganza. Yet from the initial outset there is just a lack of humour. The film seems so intent on setting the scene and introducing the characters that it forgets to make the dialogue funny as well as relevant to the plot. The characters themselves aren't particularly developed and Pegg's part would have worked better as a supporting role rather than the lead, as I'm afraid to say that I found his character very unlikable. While Shaun was a bit of a waster, he had a lovable quality and his motivations were admirable. Hot Fuzz's Nicholas Angel was a by-the-books lawman yet an everyman's hero. But The World's End's Gary King has little to no redeeming features whatsoever. He is manipulative, loud, crass and at times extremely annoying.The story itself is pretty good, and I like the idea of the five main characters getting progressively more drunk as the film goes on, and I was hoping this would bring many comedic moments with it, but instead it left me feeling a little depressed. There were some serious moments that felt a little jarring and made the narrative falter. These mostly revealed some back story to the characters and explained to an extent why the characters were not as 'fun' as they should be. But it did not evoke any sympathy because the characters weren't particularly appealing to begin with. Also their motivation is slightly questionable too, and did leave me wondering why they kept going on with their 'quest.'Nick Frost and the rest of the supporting cast felt underused, and Gary King's attitude reflected that of the film itself; Trying desperately to make his friends think they are having a good time while in fact they weren't very enthusiastic about the whole affair. This is exactly what it felt like the movie was attempting with the audience in the cinema. I rarely heard anyone laugh. While I was entertained and wasn't bored as such, I couldn't shake the feeling that the film should be a lot funnier than it was. Fans will spot quite a few Easter Eggs from Edgar Wright's previous films, with regulars from Spaced again making an appearance. And while there are some funny moments, it is nowhere near up to par with the previous 2 films in the series. I did hope they could have saved the film with a good ending, but it slightly fizzled out and I'm not even sure it could be described as a 'happy' one. While this has been done in films in the past to great comedic effect, it finished on a bit of a downer, which isn't really excusable in a comedy, and stopped this from being ranked a 7.I would say this film is worth a watch. For maximum enjoyment, think of it as a dark sci-fi with occasional humour rather than what you have come to expect with Pegg and Co. and you might enjoy it more than I did.",The World's End

The problem for me is that Simon Pegg's character lacks any likable qualities: his character is so dislikeable that other characters within the story cut short any dialogue so as not to engage with him. This kills comedy! It just makes for very uncomfortable viewing. Rather than being the source of funny scenes the supporting cast simply provide a rather flat sounding board for Simon Pegg's self-indulgent performance. The one thing that I wish there had been less of was the liberal use of profanity, which served no useful purpose except to cheapen the script. I've no doubt the cast enjoyed making this movie, I just wish they'd shared the joke with the audience.Very disappointing.",The World's End

428,BrianNIL25,Standing outside of the Cornetto cult,4,24 August 2013,"Ah, that subtle British humor. The blokes behind ""The World's End"" have certainly unearthed a winning formula in combining the English disposition with outrageous action. The cult of fans who relish the work of director/writer Edgar Wright and lead actor/writer Simon Pegg will revel in this final entry into what has been dubbed the ""Cornetto Trilogy."" I am not one of these people. And as for the nuances of that British humor? Understated to the point it may not even exist.Don't get me wrong, throngs of people will enjoy this movie. I suspect most people who will pay to see ""The World's End"" have already cackled through its predecessors, ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz."" I tried ten minutes of ""Shaun of the Dead"" on TV before flipping the channel. It's just not my brand of humor. For this one, I noted that I didn't even laugh until 20 minutes in, and a snort through my nose at best.The movie begins with Gary King (Pegg) relating the story of exploits in his old stomping grounds with his four friends in the town of Newton Haven some twenty years ago. Gary's the kind of guy who never left the days of his youth behind, the very American trend of the man-child character. He recruits the four friends through possible duplicitous means to finally return and finish the pub crawl they never completed which culminates at a bar called The World's End. What would you know? The name of the bar comes to have a second meaning as the story progresses.Gary succeeds in ""getting the band back together"" and here we meet his reluctant friends, familiar faces to the trilogy including Nick Frost. They all have distinguishing characteristics, I'm sure, like the guy with a crush on the lovely Sam (Rosamund Pike). It's during the first few pubs of the bar crawl that I most appreciated. The estranged friends take verbal jabs at one another and apply more labels to people and things than an episode of ""Seinfeld."" It feels like sharing inside jokes with a group of friends, albeit friends dragged along for the ride. Still, the dialogue is wittier than it is funny.The group encounters a town that seems to have changed, full of youth with stone-cold faces and an utter lack of personality. Surely the bar veterans, 20 years past their prime, knew how to have a better time than these kids. Perhaps it's an allegory regarding contempt towards the new generation that they turn out to be some kind of robots.The idea of pitting somewhat charming men in their forties devoid of athleticism against zombies—er, I mean, robots—works better in theory than practice. I'm certain this movie was a lot of fun to make. The robots are fun and easy to kill, as even the weakest among the characters is more than equipped to screw off any of their heads, or disembody them in any number of creative ways, but for me, that's where the fascination with the undead dies. I mean robots. Their blood bleeds blue and not red, let's remember.The movie shifts into full zombie mode which is entertaining to a point if you like watching middle-aged men fight and run away from monsters with the occasional joke thrown in. For me it's just not interesting or funny enough.Movies and TV lately have trended towards competing for displaying the most extreme behaviors. It's refreshing to watch a party movie where the most shocking activity might be getting drunk and hooking up with a friend's sister in the bathroom during a pub crawl, and where the violence can't be taken seriously. After watching ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Spring Breakers"" this movie is something of a breath of fresh air.However, I give this movie 1 ½ stars, just below 2 stars, which I consider middle ground. If I could go back in time I'd tell myself to skip it. I'd rather kick back and drink a couple pints with the characters of this movie than watch the story.",The World's End
429,FantasticFearOfMisterBobo,Cheers to the cornetto trilogy for it's humour and heart,8,20 July 2013,"I love the movie, it was still very funny but it didn't have anything as memorable as the first two. Because of this it can't help but be the weakest (and it was always going to be) but the pure heart and story was better than the previous two. Shaun had heart (plenty) but the observation of life and being human in this was extraordinary. Two scenes were exceptional and I really felt for the characters. Which was another great thing, the chemistry between all the characters was great and you felt they were friends off-screen. Their dialogue was natural and very realistic, they bounced off each other exactly how they should have and I instantly grew to love them all. This was another thing that Shaun and hot fuzz excelled in but I felt this did it better. The story was great two, many plot elements I didn't see coming and had me laughing out loud due to pure absurdity, though the foreshadowing was a little overdone. The subtleness in the previous two made the movies more entertaining but it was still clever writing. I was also very Impressed by the the effects but the overabundance of it made it disconnect from the trilogy though the fights were hilarious and were stylised in such a way that makes me laugh just thinking about it. Nick frost is a great slapstick actor, you could tell he was having fun (along with everyone else). In the end this movie was truly the weakest of the three with less imaginative and laugh out loud humour plus an uneven tone but is truly exceptional in story telling and heart. This makes it just as fun to watch as the previous two even if not an instant classic. 8.6/10.",The World's End
430,ianlawrenceuk,Thoroughly Disappointing,4,21 July 2013,"I'll keep this review short and forgo describing the plot. I'm sure everyone knows the jist of the film already.After reading the majority of reviews, I couldn't help but think to myself ""Did we watch the same film?"". I'm a big fan of Wright/Pegg/Frost and found The World's End to be one of their poorest collaborations. When I read reviews proclaiming the film to be ""gut bustingly funny"" and ""non stop laughter"", I found THAT to be more laughable than the film itself. There was barely a giggle uttered in the entire cinema. Even thinking back (it's been a couple of days since I saw the film), I'm racking my brain to think of the funniest moment. By all means, it's not a terrible film. But I can't help but feel the creators are attempting to recreate past glories ie Shaun of the Dead. I felt the similarities were too great and Shaun of the Dead is a far better and funnier film.Finally, I think the group of protagonists was was a little too large. Martin Freeman's and Eddie Marsan's characters were essentially the same. A smaller group of friends may have allowed the individual comedic performances to shine a little brighter.A disappointing finale to the blood and ice cream trilogy.",The World's End
431,cmanrockon,The Trilogy's End,9,16 February 2015,"Edgar Wright's still doin' it right. The World's End is the third and final installment of what many fans call the ""Three Flavours Cornetto"" trilogy (i.e. Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World's End). Each film in the franchise features the British actor/comedian duo consisting of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, alongside a number of other cast members as they deal with everyday human problems regarding friendship, relationships, and the passage of time, all the while getting caught up in ridiculous, action- packed genre elements, including zombie horror, buddy-cop comedy, and apocalyptic science fiction. In this review, we'll focus on the latter of the three and how it works to tie in with Wright's latest film, At World's End - uhm, I mean - The World's End.Before watching The World's End, I had seen the previous two movies in the franchise, and although I was excited to see the new one, I had an unsettling feeling that the larger budget, change in character archetypes, and reuse of the killing-hordes-of-enemies- while-surviving-in-a-pub story idea might take away from some of the quality, enjoyment, and/or originality of the film. But believe me when I tell you that my doubts were nothing but worried speculation. This movie proves to be a great freaking time if you let it, and it does not sacrifice any of the series's original shine or wit in the process.Pegg plays drunken freeloader Gary King, who reminisces about the good old days and his high school friends. In an effort to rekindle his past excitement, joy, and sense of self-worth that he once had but seems to have disappeared, the King decides to get the old band back together to complete a legendary pub crawl throughout their hometown. There are only two small catches: firstly, none of the old friends are exactly thrilled by the idea of spending an elongated period of time with Gary King, and secondly, they face an arguably ""robotic"" alien race with identity issues that is hell-bent on corporately dominating the human race.Starting off as a for-old-times-sake friendship tale and transitioning into a sci-fi extravaganza may seem quite abrupt to many viewers, but it really works out due to the consistent comedy throughout the transition, the intensity of the fight scenes, and the continuance of themes in both acts of the movie. While there is a noticeable difference between the two styles of each half of the film, it's not nearly as drastic or sudden as the Tarantino- Rodriguez mash-up known as From Dusk Till Dawn. Even though the story becomes increasingly outrageous and extravagant as the action continues, it is still the subtle comedic lines, phrases, and mannerisms worked into the script and acted out by the talents that really hit home and put this film on another level as a cinematic work of comic genius.Another element that I was not entirely sure about at first was the unpleasant tension between King and the other characters, but this tension soon provides a great deal of hilarious humor and allows for some serious dramatic range as the story goes on – a surprisingly well-accomplished feat considering how drunk each of them gets. Each member of the group gets his (or her) time to shine, and I was downright amazed by the depth of some of the characters, especially during Pegg's struggle for self-worth and Marsan's fantastic portrayal of a troubled nerd. There was only one character that I wish I could have seen more of in this movie, but I understand that decision from a writing standpoint.The writers and director kept a strange part of me irrationally rooting for the gang to finish the Golden Mile and reclaim their pointless glory against all odds and all drunken stupidity, and let me tell you; that is a task that only a significantly quality film can accomplish. The pacing of the film actually worked for me as well, for each stage of the pub crawl felt like another step in an epic Odyssey for drunkards, and even the epilogue kept my eyes glued to the screen, begging to see more.The final turning point of the action in this movie, although quite amusing, seems almost too ridiculous and sudden to be true. Of course, one could argue that Wright and Pegg wrote the ending that way on purpose, in order to satirize many poor science fiction endings of the past, such as the horrible War of the Worlds disease ending. Therefore, I won't judge too harshly when taking that into consideration. I still think Shaun of the Dead has a better ending, since it is so funny and groundbreaking and is one of my favorite movie endings of all time, but I digress. Overall, the ending of This Is the End¬ – I mean, The World's End – is still a very satisfying and enjoyable conclusion, with a very redeeming, ""F*ck yeah!""-inspiring epilogue sequence. It really is quite interesting and amusing to see just how far they take the ""aliens controlling the world"" joke.This film has heart, but not the sappy kind, humor, but not the (entirely) idiotic kind, and a level of self-aware intelligence – the kind that is witty to the point of making some noteworthy statements about 21st century society, friendship, and even the degenerative powers of youthful recollection. On top of all of this, it wraps up many of the themes that are shown throughout the trilogy, including responsibility, relationships, and human nature. Bottom line: it's a great time, as any movie that is made by these guys should be. Whether you're watching it alone or with all your friends, The World's End is a great choice for anyone with a good sense of humor and a love for movies. Keep it real, people.

432,MaxKnowsFilms,Brilliant!,8,25 July 2013,"This film is directed by Edgar Wright and is the final part in his comedy 'Cornetto Trilogy'. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost star in the film with Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, David Bradley and many more famous British actors in supporting roles. The film centres on five old best mates coming back together to renew their friendship with an incredible pub crawl, finishing with the legendary pub known as 'The World's End'.I had hope for this film being a fan of everything Edgar Wright, Nick Frost and Simon Pegg had done in the past together. I suppose I love the real British humour mixed with Edgar Wright's extremely fast directing and editing. It adds a lot of excitement to the comedy violence and I wish Wright had directed Paul. With all that said I found this film to be very entertaining.The characters of the film are done so well with a great contrast between Simon Pegg who plays a complete immature man-child who totally living in the past, and Nick Frost and the rest of the group playing utter squares. For me Pegg totally steals the film and his character is definitely the most consistently entertaining. The fast paced dialogue is great and at times you really feel for these characters and their situation that quickly escalates to a whole world of weird that you can't just predict even after seeing the trailers. The film never takes itself seriously and it lends well to the material which is completely ridiculous. For the most part I felt the film had a good balance but towards the end it does spiral into some things that I felt were pushing it a bit far. Still funny of course but just a tad unnecessary. Thats really the only complaint I had.I enjoyed the film and for me it was better than Hot Fuzz but not as good as Shaun of the Dead. I give the film 8/10.Follow me on Twitter for more film stuff! - https://twitter.com/MaxKnowsFilms",The World's End
433,toonboy-129-5326,A Brilliant Ending To A Brilliant Trilogy..........,8,21 July 2013,"This film is truly a masterpiece, and it is everything you would expect from Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick frost film. It has action comedy and drama. It truly is a work of art.The story line about 5 childhood friends who attempted to do a 12 pub pub crawl when they were teenagers but they did not make it to the last pub The World's End. 20 years later Gary king the only one of the friends that never grew up. Attempts to bring all of the friends back together to this try and make it to The Worlds end but when they get there they find out that ever one they knew does not remember them and that the town has been over taken by alien robots.The great thing about this film is that although its a comedy it has enough action to entertain the viewer. With brilliantly directed fight scenes that don't just entertain you there will have you in hysterics.This film truly is brilliant and is a typical Simon Pegg and Nick Frost film and I promise that is you loved Shaun of the dead and Hot Fuzz you will love this film. This is the last one of the Cornetto Trilogy but it will not be the last film we see Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright team up for. I do looked forward to what ever they have got planned next. 9/10",The World's End
434,alex-tdwp93,Simon Pegg is very talented. Great movie!,10,4 September 2013,"I've been looking forward to this movie for a while. To be honest it looked like a very predictable film. I like that kind of stuff, I like to be familiar with movies. However this movie is anything but predictable.My favorite thing about The World's End is how incredibly written it is. I advise you to make sure you can sit through the whole thing before you watch it. If something doesn't make sense, it does later. If you need to know something only the characters know, it comes out in a way that is believable, rather than just informing the viewer. There are plenty of funny scenes in this film, but honestly the funniest parts aren't funny when you first here them, they're funny later. The entire story comes together in a way that I can only compare to the genius writing of someone like Larry David. Pay attention to every line, don't walk out of the theater or take a phone call. Please for your own enjoyment pay attention to each detail in this movie. Every character has his own story and it shows very well in their own ways throughout the film. I was expecting to see a comedy when I bought my ticket, but I got way more than just some comedy. The dialogue matches each character perfectly, and during the movie you kind of just laugh at something someone does and think ""They would that."". Meaning you get to know these characters completely in only a little less than 2 hours. Great movie, I got excited from reviews and I wasn't disappointed. In fact I loved it so much I had to write my very first review on this movie, The World's End. Hope you like it as much I did. Peace.",The World's End
435,Peterc103,Bloody Shocking Movie,1,6 August 2013,"This movie would have to be worst load of rubbish , that I have ever seen the only one good thing about the whole attempt at a movie is the sight of Rosemund Pike. she seemed cheap, it is not funny there is not one funny bit at all and the swearing is appalling, the f bomb gets dropped which is not needed but the C word there is no need for that , type of language which is disgusting . I feel that all the actors have been degraded by the appalling attempt at trying to be funny and it fell flat on their faces because it is a shocker.it is funny how the robots have blue ink and they repair themselves but when it come to the end of the movie one of the blokes on the pub crawl in the beginning his head did not repair. it is the biggest load of rubbish and I am ashamed that I had to pay $18 to see this rot .",The World's End
436,itsfoz,"The World's End, with no End.",8,20 July 2013,"A complete mix-up for Pegg and Frost occurs within this last-in-the- trilogy budget buster Wright film. No longer do we see Nick telling his landlord to calm down and farting about, quite literally - nor do we see him play the dumb cop. No, in fact I would go as far as to say this was heavily reminiscent of Pegg's character (Nicholas Angel) in Hot Fuzz with his work takes precedence attitude which as well as Nicholas, directly affects his home life. With Pegg, I would say less of anything you've seen previously in the last two films and more of what Pegg has always wanted to play, in a film he's always wanted to write (or at least help at). The World's End begins with what I would deem a very big boost in character development, highlighting everything we should know about all of the characters. For me it seemed odd this sequence, or rather set of sequences went on for so long, seeing them as children one by one and then the same as adults as Gary King (Pegg) convinces the crowd to join in on his antics. However, you soon realise about half an hour into the film that this was required as Edgar Wright doesn't hold up on the alien front for very long at all - I could even say we see alien blood, or ink as it's more fashionably named in the film a bit too early. Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were incredible in the way they stalled the twist of the film but The World's End doesn't seem to hold us out for long enough, letting us no immediately that the town of Newton Haven is not all that it seems. The main bulk of the film brings back the trilogy's hilarity and many of the casts from the previous two films including and definitely not forgetting Bill Nighy. Not sure about when you go to see it but for the second half of the film I could have sworn I could hear Bill and it wasn't until the credits I was told I was right, so, look forward to listening very well in order to grab his 'appearance'.Many reviews have said that the end has let it down but for me the end is twofold. 'The World's End' ending within the pub for me went on a bit too much and felt as if Pegg and Wright wrote what they wanted to hear, we know from 'Spaced' their massive fans of science fiction and I just feel this scene was a splurge of text they've wanted to say for years and decided to put it in rather than keeping it actually relevant and interesting to fit alongside the rest of the film. However, this is where I differ to most reviews - I actually like the additional scenes after and there was a copious amount of applause in the cinema when a certain wrapper was displayed. Many of us are aware that the end is obviously not the end; these guys are great friends and do wonders for the British Film Industry so although they won't be back in the same fashion, they will be back in a sci-fi form again.So, to conclude I would say this film was more for the 'Spaced', 'Scott Pilgrim' (A lot of Pilgrim can be found in this film) and 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' fans and less for a mass audience such as 'Shaun of the Dead' but a vast improvement for what seemed like a never-ending 'Hot Fuzz'. Although, similarly to 'Hot Fuzz', 'The World's End' could have done with some vast editing of the last few scenes. Edgar Wright has the cinematography professionalism to have a film fan hungry for more, but lacks in the sturdy and arguably abrupt endings that his films require.",The World's End
437,callum-low,Somewhat disappointing.,5,20 July 2013,"Having very much enjoyed Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, I have to admit I had fairly high hopes for The World's End. The trailer had me looking forward to seeing this film, and so I went to see it with some mates on release day.The plot is fairly straightforward, however very little happens which we were not shown in the trailers. The characters are likable, which keeps the film going. The occasional (somewhat rare) laughs make the film watchable, however other than that there was little to get excited about.I must say that compared to the other summer apocalyptic parody, This is the End, The World's End fails to deliver on the humour and seems to fall short on some aspects of the script.6/10 for the likable characters and great special effects, would've been higher had the film lived up to expectations.",The World's End
438,bigfacedboy,Very poor,3,22 September 2013,"A very poor show indeed. I expected some laughs... but only got a couple of small chuckles. I wonder how they failed to see that it wasn't funny when scripting and making it. I can only imagine that this had something to do with a bunch of sycophants wanting their share of the $40 million budget. For such a great cast and production team, I expected more and was disappointed. Can I get my two hours back, please?There really isn't much more to say about this but I need to fill ten lines. There isn't enough substance for me to critique anything. It's just poor.",The World's End
439,paulabear-727-947739,Crazy cool!,8,3 November 2018,I love time travel and I happen to hear this was one of the good ones and I like it! You like or you hate it kind of movie,The World's End
440,dandulieu,Worth it for the humour factor,8,20 July 2013,"Without giving away any spoilers, the movie's plot is well suited to it's predecessors, for the characters and the scenes involved. I felt as though it started off a little shaky in areas but certainly got more into what everything as it continued. Simon Pegg did a good job with his role, especially due him acting in a completely different manner to what we were used to with his films .In short, The World's End didn't take itself too seriously with some hilarious parts - acting was fine overall and the film definitely had it's own uniqueness, without being a total ripoff of the old ones. Shaun of the Dead probably remains my favourite out of the whole lot but this is definitely a worthy closure to the Cornetto Trilogy. Hopefully we'll see Simon Pegg (a bit off topic but he's looking real old nowadays?) and Nick Frost work together on some more films in future.",The World's End
441,robfan21,One of the funniest movies I've seen:),10,24 August 2013,"I am a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost movies. I have been excited about this movie for months and when I found out that one of my all time favorite actors Martin Freeman was in it too, I could barely contain my excitement! I give the movie 2 thumbs up, and I honestly think it was better than Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. I love those movies so much, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed with The World's End. I was happy to find out that it was better than I could ever imagine. I didn't go 5 minutes without laughing through the entire movie, from the very beginning to the very end. There is so much comedy, action, excitement and the pure randomness that is to be expected with this type of movie. I am going to see it again very soon.",The World's End
442,luvsails,RSVP for this apocalypse,10,7 September 2013,"Though the movie does start out a bit slowly, it is never boring. Simon Pegg plays his typical washed out loser, on a quest to reunite the ""old gang"" from high school and relive the best night of his life, ""The golden mile"", which is a pub crawl through twelve pubs in his sleepy town. When they get there, they discover their town has been taken over by robots filled with blue junk and their new quest is to survive the night in order to leave in the morning. The chemistry between the actors is pitch perfect and though the movie could run this risk of becoming brainless and the characters flat, their personal traumas and sometimes (very) deep flaws keep them grounded in reality. The ending, though perhaps not expected, was amazing. If you already like Nick Frost and Simon Pegg this is a definite must-see, but even if you aren't a huge fan or haven't even heard of them, this movie is worth a shot.",The World's End
443,jyles-790-704933,"A thrilling movie with great cinematography, sound track and acting but lacks plot and justice towards the end of the movie.",7,13 September 2013,"From the word go I was intrigued by the use of camera techniques. A heads up for this was through the duo's (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) previous film Hot Fuzz. Quick shots and lots of them definitely attracted my eyes to the film and encouraged the audience to try and connect with the characters that were being introduced. Backed up by great acting by Simon Pegg in particularly, as well as a very bold and exciting sound track, the first half of the movie was mildly watch-able and enjoyable. Edgar Wright allows you time to connect with the main characters, but in my own view, he might have taken too long to do this. With a prolonged introduction to the sci-fi side of the movie, I felt that I had gotten the concept of the movie wrong, that is until the twist of the movie was introduced.Without given away any spoilers I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in previous Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg/Nick Frost starred movies, as well as people who are patient enough to withstand a half hour of character development before touching on any real action or sci-fi themes.",The World's End
444,jschof77,"Big fan, but this.....",1,13 December 2013,"........is self indulgent dogsh*t!I would have left it at that, but apparently I have to put 10 lines of text down, so here's a list of what's wrong with this film -The characters - The fight scenes - The plodding direction - The criminal misuse of Pierce Brosnan and Paddy Considine - The complete lack of comedyShaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz are fantastic, even Paul was OK, but this has no charm, lacks any sense of fun and feels like they just wanted to get it finished and move on.How this is currently rated 7.1 is completely beyond me.",The World's End
445,Jess_A_Smith,"Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost: The British comedy dream-team brings us the conclusion to the Cornetto Trilogy....",8,28 December 2013,"...and do not disappoint. This film is on par with Shaun and Fuzz. Although certainly different in the characters, Pegg and Frost bring us two characters completely different from the comedic pairings of Shaun & Ed and Angel & Butterman. Seeing Frost play the straight man is a pleasant surprise. As for the Considine (Steven), Freeman (Oliver), and Marsan (Peter), they fit in very well. The writing, subtle in-jokes, and foreshadowing that is shown in multiple ways (Gary's opening monologue, the pub signs, things Gary says) provide laughs and make this movie even more worth multiple viewings than it already was. A perfect conclusion to the trilogy and worth every penny you spend on it to own the trilogy. The ending.....a beautiful homage to apocalyptic movies such as Escape From New York and Mad Max that leaves you cheering and celebrating. The only downside is that this movie is beyond bittersweet. Bitter because it's over, sweet because it ended perfectly.",The World's End
446,ladyfrost-129-58800,Worst Movie Ever,1,10 October 2014,"I don't know why this movie was made. It is now the worst movie I have ever seen. It wasn't funny like the other movies in the trilogy. The movie started off as a mediocre story about former friends who are forced to meet up to satisfy one man's meaningless superficial goal - to have a pint at 12 pubs in his home town in one night. Then it turned into an awkward situation as none of the men really like their former teenage leader and how annoying he is. I was still hoping for some funny jokes by this time but all of the attempts at humor were bland at best. Then the movie turned into a horror flick with glowing robots who at first seem to be a threat and have some skills at fighting the humans, but end up easily stopped in their tracks. By the way, the robots just want humans to have better lives. This doesn't really make any sense since the aliens are killing humans to replace them with robots. So in the end, the humans will all be robots. What was the point in adapting the humans to the alien ways if they were just going to replace them anyway. Then, the powerful aliens who are responsible for mankind's sudden technological advancement are easily talked out of their plans to take over Earth by a few drunk humans arguing with them.

It starts off as one of those old people get together and then turns into an robot action movie. Throughout the whole movie, I laughing like crazy. The plot was hilarious, the movie included many British actors (they even included the old bond) and the effects were realistic. I also really liked the robot ink people and how easy they were to kill! However, I gave it a six because the second half of the movie didn't make me laugh as much and also, the ending was disappointing but other than that, this movie is worth watching.

449,zero_omens,A fitting end to an awesome trilogy,8,21 November 2013,"In a way, this movie is quite different to the other two that comprise the Cornetto Trilogy... in another, it's the same ol' Edgar Wright we know and love. The World's End is not your average dumb comedy, although for the untrained eye it may look so. TWE is Wright at his best, combining his mastership of VFX and choreography, his thorough knowledge of the source material (which he doesn't shy to throw over your face over and over again) and the great writing partnership that he has achieved with Simon Pegg way for over a decade. This coming-of-age/sci-fi/social satire mash-up comedy may not appeal to everyone,it may even make some Wright fans raise an eyebrow, but if you allow yourself to digest all the things that this movie accomplishes you will not only acknowledge this film as a worthy member of the blood & ice cream trilogy but you'll witness the birth of a cult comedy for the years to come. (Having said that, Hot Fuzz is still my favorite)",The World's End
450,mark-swinton,Not the best tasting Cornetto but still an enjoyable one,8,13 November 2017,"Edgar Wright has managed to pull off a great enjoyable last movie to this Cornetto trilogy with a fitting mix up in the roles between the two actors.The comedy is landed very well, which is something that Edgar Wright manages to do in all the other Cornetto films but with this manages to add in a few serious moments and when he does it hits well and doesn't seem out of place or ruin the tone of the movie.One criticism I would give to this movie is that the main antagonist doesn't that much of a threat over the characters. They minions are just punching bags and when the main villain pops up it just takes a loud conversation to beat him.The movie is still very enjoyable though and this trilogy should be completed all the way through.",The World's End

There is no denying that it's an imaginative one, for example, ""blue ink as red blood"", ""reassemble legs to arms"", etc. but generally, the pot is quite cliche(brotherhood thing, fighting together, protecting human being/earth), just not creative enough, by using a poem quote from Louise Bogan, this movie is ""the town visited once"", no expectation for a second shot, cuz it's too simple, nothing deep to intrigue you thinking.

The movie is about one guy out of jail summoning his old high school friends for a pub-to-pub night out. Main character Gary has not aged mentally and is out with his grown out and established mates. There are fighting scenes, they are all short and silly. Actors were good, although I missed good female actors beyond Rosamund Pike.

I trusted his opinion and gave it a chance. I hadn't seen the trailer or read what the movie was about. I had no expectations and still I was disappointed. After giving it a chance the first half hour it's really not funny, very cliché and left me with the feeling that this is the type of movie teenage guys watch (but without really paying attention) when they get together, drink beer, smoke weed and wish they had girlfriends. After that the story develops into something even more ridiculous. All in all a waste of time, I couldn't bare watching the whole thing.

460,jamesltfc,Great trilogy but this is bar far the weakest link,4,21 July 2013,"Having loved Shaun of the dead and Hot Fuzz to the point that they are 2 of my favourite films, I had been looking forward to this film ever since it was first announced. The conclusion to the Cornetto trilogy couldn't fail to impress.I won't go in to the story as I'm sure most people already have the gist of it but five friends return to their old town to embark on a drunken pub crawl along the golden mile, a feat which they failed to finish as teenagers. In principle there's nothing not too like here, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost back with their on-screen chemistry to give us more laugh's a minute and another load of one liners we'll all be repeating for years to come like the first 2 films.In the previous films both lead characters we're lovable in their own way and you could attach yourself to them. Sadly it became apparent fairly quickly in to this film that Simon Pegg's character was just an idiot and the rest of the main cast had nothing about them which you could truly find yourself liking and sympathising with. At times it was painful to watch Simon Pegg's character as he just went too over the top.Don't get me wrong there we're some funny moments and the links to the previous 2 films with some of the jokes are there for all to see, in comparison though the humour in this film was a lot weaker than the previous films. It's not by any means an awful film but the previous 2 efforts set the bar so high that this falls well short of the standards they set.Unfortunately in summary I felt pretty disappointed with this latest effort and had hoped for so much more. I wanted to like this so much but it's not one I'll be watching over and over again like Shaun and Hot Fuzz.",The World's End
461,Offing,Well...,7,24 August 2013,"I am a huge fan of the previous films ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz,"" however, there seemed to be something missing from this movie. Like its predecessors, this movie circles around humor and camaraderie, but the story feels really lackluster for some reason. Maybe its the random gory stuff that you don't generally see in comedies that's missing (which was in the previous films) or Nick Frost and Simon Pegg swapping roles (Nick generally plays the jackass/ Simon plays serious guy). The role swap really changed the vibe of what i was expecting from this movie, but it still worked out. This is definitely my least favorite in the trilogy, but its still worth a watch if your a fan of the previous films.",The World's End

But the film turned out to be such a buzz kill. The film does not live up to its hype or its cast, with many of the characters feeling one-dimensional and underdeveloped, which is such a shame as the actors are some of my favourites and very talented. I could deal with the unlikely plot, but the ending was just stupid and rushed. The jokes were forced, and only one man laughed once through the entire film. All my friends and I left the cinema deflated. The one positive I would say is that the special effects were good. Apart from that I was bitterly let down.",The World's End

464,michael-bruno,Excellent end to the Cornetto Trilogy!,8,23 July 2013,"Having read a lot of the negative reviews for the film i thought i would submit my own, i think that the worlds end was an excellent film. There are a lot of people moaning and saying that it wasn't as good as Shaun of the dead or Hot Fuzz but i disagree. I would say that it is definitely a different sort of film to the first two, but just as good. The chemistry between all of the cast works really well and there are a lot of one liners that I'm sure are going to be just as big as ones from the other films. The soundtrack is also excellent but i think that is helped by the fact that i am the same age as Pegg and so it takes me straight back to the 90s!!

466,SanchezProductions17,My favorite film of the year,10,1 December 2013,"I'm a little late on this, but I love this movie. First off I will place this as my second favorite in the trilogy next to Hot Fuzz only because Hot Fuzz is my favorite comedy of all time. I first heard about this movie when Edgar and Simon talked about doing a sci-fi/invasion movie as the third installment of the Cornetto trilogy and I was pumped, flash forward 5 years I went to a Cornetto trilogy screening and saw it. I was laughing so much from start to finish. The jokes, gags, and callbacks hit the mark. One of the best things is the role reversal of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Frost kills the straight man performance, but I can see why people didn't like him and think he was a bit a of a dick. And I have to say this is my favorite Simon Pegg role ever. Gary King is his most layered charterer I have seen him play. He is a man who never grew up which is obvious with the fact he still wears his clothes from high school. Gary isn't a very nice person to be around with, cocky and almost egocentric, but he does have some charm to him, but it would be better suited if he still was a teenager, my favorite things of the movie comes from Gary. He walks around thinking he is a local legend but no one acknowledges him which brings in the themes of how time can change things and nostalgia. In a way Gary is a bad guy but he doesn't try to be. The action is amazing, it's fast paced clear and very exciting to watch, it has my favorite action sequence of the year. like the other movies some moments do hit home and hell I even teared up. I can relate with a lot of this movie. It's fun and touching. It was the best time I had in the theater in a while.",The World's End
467,jtslu,take this film to the loo.........,1,10 September 2013,"Three of us went and three of us had the same comment. ""One of the worse films we have ever seen."" We really wanted to laugh and found this pub crawl devoid of anything but low brow teenage content that would appeal to I wonder who. The premise and high ratings on IMDb caused us to pay real dollars for a fraud of a comedy. May the god of beer hide whenever this film is shown. Maybe , just maybe, the many known British actors in this picture might read the script first before they commit to this type of acting punishment. I am guessing that we will see at the end of 2013 a top ten ""worse"" films of the year and it is possible that this might garner #1. I would make a suggestion to any persons interested in seeing this film. Find some hallucinogens before you go but please do not use drugs and drive. Then and only then, could this film possibly get a HIGH review.",The World's End
468,d_wolf2011,"Funny,Exciting,and Filled with Humor!",10,25 August 2013,"I loved this film, i loved the action scenes (really well done) and I loved the humor and drama that was going into this movie that was perfected with the Actors and Actresses themselves.Starting off is my summary of this film. (spoilers)5 Friends from a town near London called Newton Haven had the night of their lives *the day they finish high school* and decide to do the Golden Mile, a crazy pub adventure through 12 different pubs and ending at the final pub The Worlds End.They failed to finish the Golden Mile and then years later they decide to try at it again. The town is strange from when they last were there and they are trying to see what is wrong while at the same time make it to The Worlds End.Oh, and by the way the ending will end up not what you probably expected it to end!Have fun experiencing this 2013 British comedy! 10 out of 10!",The World's End
469,grahambirks,A good fun movie to see with friends,8,25 August 2013,"The World's End, like most of the Cornetto trilogy, starts out slow. It introduces what the 5 main characters were like in their child hood and how they all attempted ""the Golden Mile"", a tour of the town's pubs. They were not able to finish the mile much to Gary King's, Simon Pegg, disappointment. After graduation they all went their separate ways and grew up, all except Gary that is. He was never able to forget that night and the fun they had and how he expected the rest of his life to only get better. But it didn't. In an attempt to relive the constantly replayed nostalgia, Gary tries to get the group back together again to attempt the Golden mile once more. The night starts out slow but eventually picks up into the most unforgettable night of their lives...The World's End is a quality, good fun, movie that is perfect for a night out with friends. Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright never fail to amuse the crowd with the sudden adventures of their ostensibly normal stories. Though none of them will be critically acclaimed for this film, that's not the point of the endeavor. The point is to entertain and they did just that!",The World's End
470,bigblueeyes2662,"Poor, should have made Paul the 3rd in the trilogy.",4,18 February 2014,"I was so excited to see this having loved Shaun and Hot Fuzz, but I found this film to be a massive let down. The cast was great, but the premise was rubbish and Simon Pegg's character was massively unlikeable, which ruined it for my husband and I. It just didn't work for me at all, the jokes were poor and the story was hard to follow. Pretty poor effort from a highly talented team, who I have loved in their other guises. The ending of the film was rubbish and I just wish they hadn't bothered.I felt really let down by the film, and felt that Paul would have been a much better ending for the Cornetto Trilogy, as it was bloody brilliant.",The World's End
471,dan-power3,A Satisfying Conclusion to the Cornetto Trilogy,9,12 May 2014,"The World's End is an enjoyable film, the type of film you would expect from Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, but doesn't quite live up to the hype laid down by it's predecessors Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.There are plenty of nods to the previous films, with actors and extras reappearing for roles both minor and major, and repetition of some of the scenes that made Shaun and Hot Fuzz so enjoyable. While this is satisfying the jokes can at times seem forced, and gives the impression that the writers set out to write a conclusion first and a standalone film second.That said, this film is still very good. Gary King is arguably the most interesting character in the Cornetto Trilogy, love him or hate him, and there are no corners cut on the action scenes, which are both thrilling and funny. This film also has more to offer than the others in the way of a moral message, which while simple is still thought-provoking and thoroughly entertaining.This film deserves an 8/10, which is one star more than the current user rating. The only way people could be disappointed is if they went to see the film thinking it was going to be another Shaun of the Dead. This film moves way beyond the spoofing and slapstick humour (although it is still present), and cannot be fairly compared to the other films in the Cornetto Trilogy.",The World's End
472,Mattez,Average Comedy,5,19 July 2013,"This isn't the first time that I've been disappointed in the Cornetto films, but thankfully it will be the last! I will start by saying that I loved Shaun of the Dead, due to it's comedic brilliance. However, when it came to Hot Fuzz I didn't feel this, and just felt sad, that one of my favorite comedy duo's had let me down. Sadly this is what I feel again with the latest and last film in the trilogy. Now don't get me wrong it's not all bad and there was several occasions that I chuckled and enjoyed the film... but that was it! There was no overwhelming laughs that need a pause in the movie so that you can get back to a concentrated state of mind. Which really just made me a little upset when I walked out of the movies, just like I was after Hot Fuzz.However, it's not all bad, you can clearly see brilliant performances from the cast along with a story that wasn't half bad. Not anything ground breaking, but far from poor. Which is what we tend to see in most comedies that are released at the moment. I would also like to applaud them for there fight scenes which have really come far from the bar fight with zombies in the Shaun of the dead film. if not horribly unrealistic.So to conclude, I certainly don't think that this film is horrible. I just felt let down and hoped for more. I would recommend that you give this movie a try, especially if you're a fan of the previous titles in the series. And hey, you might enjoy it more than I did, as I will say that the audience at the cinema certainly seemed too.",The World's End
473,Zashams,"Good, but not as good as the Corneto trilogy's's other entries.",8,2 February 2014,"I came into this film with battling thoughts. This being the third Corneto film(look up the Corneto trilogy if your unfamiliar with the term, I had high expectations. But when I saw the trailer, I thought it looked a bit off from the usual formula and style of comedy that present in the Shaun of the Dead and Hott fuzz(being two of my favorite movies).It in my opinion was only slightly below par of the previous two entries.I found that in this there were less grotesquely violent scenes(that usually provided a strong laugh)ie: the murder scenes from Hott Fuzz, or some zombie kills in Shaun of the Dead. I also found myself screaming in laughter slightly less than the previous entries. In both of the previous films there were touches of emotion that could actually move you, however in The Worlds End, there seemed to be some more serious topics about life and growing up.The story revolves around Garry, whom is a man in his late 30's, but wants to gather his matured friends and go back to their home town for one last 12 pub night. Throughout the film,the situation unfolds and we see what is really going on in this very bizarrely(but masterfully) written sci-fi themed comedy.The story just gets weirder and weirder, but worry not because the amazing trio of Pegg, Frost, and Wright handle the chaos perfectly. This film is truly worth watching if you want to laugh but also come out of the movie with a feeling that you just realized some really deep stuff about life.Was it as good as Shaun or Fuzz? no... but it was still a fantastic film that you will love almost as much. If it was not clear, Watch this Movie please. buy it,Support it,love it and wait for the corneto's next masterpiece of modern comedy.",The World's End
474,kathenshall,A very funny film,8,31 July 2013,"This film was funny all the way through, saw it at the cinema, the whole cinema had some great laugh out loud moments, it was stupid, an insane story line but that's what it was supposed to be. You have to watch this film with the way it was intended, just mental, crazy story lines that make no sense yet with hilarious outcomes. There were a few moments when you may think its going to loose it's funny momentum but then something else happened to keep you laughing. Overall it was hilarious. Simon Pegg is a truly talented actor as are the rest of the cast, u actually feel that team were meant to be together! Watching the film made me wonder why we all didn't choose acting as a profession, they must have had SO much fun making that film.",The World's End

Check. Tired subject matter? Check. Equally tired jokes? Check. Poorly-written villains? Check. Crude attempt at academic appeal at the climax? Uncommon, but check. Abrupt and confounding ending that leaves you empty? Check and mate.I have no idea what movie that the critics and fans saw, but judging by their gushy reviews, I'm guessing LSD was involved.",The World's End
476,mattsecombe,Longest 109 minutes of my life. Except perhaps for the first 109 minutes of Les Miserables.,1,29 July 2013,"I watched this film a couple of hours ago, but so much of it has been deleted from my brain that I can't remember much of it. However, I can say that this was not just not funny, this was UNfunny.Firstly, the characters. I cared so little about them that I cannot tell you a single one of their names other than Gary King, without looking at the character list. I could not have cared less if the whole lot of them had been killed by aliens in the first half hour. Indeed, it would have made for a much better movie. They were 2-dimensional and cartoonish, serving no purpose other than to back up Simon Pegg's extremely self-indulgent performance, as possibly the least believable character. Yes, it's a comedy, and no, I was not expecting Shakespeare, but do the writers really expect us to believe that, while being pursued by alien robots he will put his friends in mortal danger to have a pint in every pub?! Really? A pub crawl is more important to him than escaping an entire town or murderous robots?! Even in a low-budget B-movie I would not expect a character that poorly thought out.And then there was the rest of the storyline. Most of the film seems to consist of the main characters drinking, which, in my opinion at least, is not the sign of a comedy masterpiece. Oh, look at these people getting drunk! Aren't they funny?! Hahaha Simon Pegg just asked a girl to have sex! Hilarious! No. It's not. Subtlety is a word which can be used to describe many films, but this film's humour is about as subtle as a black eye. And somewhat less funny. After the drinking scenes, when the robots attacked, I can only assume that the writer lost half of the screenplay, because the amount of fighting is ridiculous. You can only smash robots' arms through their heads a few times before the novelty wears off. And boy, do they do it more than a few times. The fights are dull, painfully stretched out, and extremely excessive. Then there was the ending. The ending... Well... This has only one plausible explanation in my mind, and it's that the writer went on holiday before completing it, and everyone else was left thinking, ""Damn, what do we do now?"" As I have said, yes, I know this is a comedy, but if you decide to go and see this film, you must admit that it brings new meaning to the term ""Suspending disbelief."" I will not give away what happens to the people who still want to watch it, but the sheer amount of things wrong with it is unbelievable.If you still decide to see this film, I did warn you. I would love someone to enlighten me on what makes it a comedy. I can only conclude that the other reviewers on IMDb have been brainwashed.And I thought Shaun of the Dead was bad...",The World's End
477,joshgc98,The trailers gave people a feeling of false disappointment. I am here to give hope back.,8,26 July 2013,"This film surprised me greatly. I entered the cinema expecting a bit of fun, some violence and jokes. What I got was a great film and an amazing two and a bit hours. Darker than its predecessors it really ends a good thing on a high. While watching there are many moments that echo back to Shaun of the dead and hot fuzz. Step into a new, glorious world from the Lords of new British comedy. This film is a must see. As time ticks away for the great British double act the stakes get higher, the risks get larger and the worlds end is nigh. This film will go down in history as cornetto trilogy part three. My only problem is the feeling that you get when a great film has ended a decade too soon.",The World's End
478,stubbingso,Brilliant,9,19 July 2013,"Being a huge fan of Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz, I had high hopes for the finale of the 'Blood and Ice cream Trilogy'. In my opinion I thought it was an excellent final installment and had hilarious laughs and gags and some insane fight scenes which was a nice surprise. The story was original and easy to relate to and I didn't feel bored or disappointed at any stage. I loved the familiar cornetto gag at the end and the cameos were also a nice touch, it was good to see faces from the previous movies appearing again - and Pierce Brosnan was actually funny. I think fans of the previous movies won't be disappointed, I laughed the whole way through. 8/10",The World's End
479,theonlydanever,"Five guys, 12 pubs, 50 pints!",8,20 July 2013,"Edgar Wright brings us the final installment of the Cornetto trilogy with his most out-there comedy to date. The World's End is an action-packed, sci-fi comedy where a number of familiar faces return to help Gary King (Simon Pegg) achieve his lifelong dream and complete the 'golden mile' in their hometown of Newton Haven. Five guys, 12 pubs, 60 pints!I'd written a paragraph about the character's we see from previous films but that'd spoil it a little. You're welcome. I think part of the fun is spotting these for yourself and realising how close knit the cast are... so moving swiftly on!As you'd expect, the film was cleverly written and it was a lot of fun to watch. However, there's a reference a minute to Edgar Wrights previous work which, for fans, isn't a bad thing, but newcomers to the trilogy will struggle to keep up.Within the film, there are a number of stories and ideas going on here, but don't let us spoil it for you. The World's End is out now and, for veterans of the trilogy, well worth a watch! Nick Frost was a highlight for me, playing a different type of character this time round and for the better. Usually the happy-go-lucky friend, he plays a much more complex and leader type role. With so many other great names in the film, there was a risk that Nick Frost could fall in to the shadow of Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine or Eddie Marsan (who was awesome by the way)... but he doesn't. This is Frost's greatest film yet.If you haven't seen Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, it might be hit or miss so check them out before this... it is the end of a trilogy after all! Watching The World's End first would be like watching Return of the King and, even though they're unrelated, you'll feel left out when everyone starts laughing at a fruit machine playing in the background and you have no idea why.The film will do well, regardless how good it is - it was a great ending to the trilogy that started almost ten years ago. These have put British cinema on the map. And even though it's a mixed review, (ranging from a 6 to a 9 out of 10)... the golden mile sounds like a great idea - who's up for it? DW.",The World's End
480,richpeacock,They properly pulled it off.,8,20 July 2013,"Could've all gone wrong. It might've been a poor pastiche of what they have done before. Same key actors. Similar basic premise (small town, group of mates, something weird beneath the surface. But it didn't. It was a tremendous success.The script worked, the story arched, the characters developed, the direction had a firm but light touch. It was a really nice surprise to watch a British film located in the tradition of Ealing but aware of itself in 2013. It plays its hand subtly and it made some serious points about the corporate blandness of most of British town centres. Not in a hectoring sociology student way. But in a clever and serious manner, non the less.Perhaps the most surprisingly it was held together by Simon Pegg's and Nick Frost's acting ability. I say surprising not because I don't like what they have done before, but because they created quite different characters (especially Pegg) and inhabited them completely. It would have been a terrible error to play the characters they have been before, and I was sort of expecting them (and dreading it). Of course they are actors, but their previous personas appeared grown from them naturally so appeared fixed in place. Not so.The script demanded something else, and they pulled it off.It isn't Black Cat, White Cat or Four Colours whatasname. Of course it didn't try to be, but neither is it a half arsed stab (if arses could stab) at a complete narrative. It is most definitely whole. A nice film, and a pleasure to watch. See it.",The World's End
481,tom-story,More straight Sci - Fi than comedy,7,23 July 2013,"This is a good film, this has a great cast, and this has a cracking soundtrack.What this film doesn't have is much to laugh outright about.A couple of smiles in points, but the pacing of the first half of the film lulls you into a bit of a stupor that by the time there's a sense of action and drama you don't have much of a reason to care. Where Simon Pegg's Shaun was almost a regular everyman you could believe in, Hot Fuzz had such a strong supporting cast it was just fun being along for the ride, Worlds End lets itself down slightly by spending far too much time on knowing in-jokes and less time trying to draw the audience into the plot. It would have benefited from one more people who the other five friends didn't know to ask one important question – why. Ask the question the audience is asking.A core theme (and the driving force behind Simon Pegg's character) is the state of the world today, and how much things have changed in the past twenty years. There are some very, very astute observations here (and a Happy Monday's reference) – but the way they are presented just encourages you to blink a few times and move on.While this film doesn't hold up against Shaun of the Dead, or Hot Fuzz it paints a similar picture just uses darker colours. It's worth seeing in the cinema, but leaves your expectations at the door.If, however you've been living in a cave for the past few years, have missed both of the other films, (epically if you came out of education in the 1990's) this is well, well worth seeing. Maybe with a couple of pints first.",The World's End

Thinking about it a few hours after viewing I think the flaw was the execution of a great concept. The CGI alien sculpture thing was unnecessary and totally pointless. The wonderful mix of tension vs comedy present in Sean and Hot Fuzz was missing. The only fun for me came in spotting the ""in jokes"" and regular contributors (Hello, Mary from Sean! Hello,the other Andy from HF!) and recognising the familiar landscape of my local town!If you are a ""Cornetto"" fan this won't put you off but prepare yourself to be very disappointed bunnies.",The World's End
483,aidanevans7,The third and final installment to a great trilogy.,9,8 September 2013,"So last night i finally got to view 'The World's End', and i must say, i was blown away!!. Going into the movie i was a little worried about it not living up to the greatness of the previous two films in the trilogy, 'Shaun Of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'. But boy was i wrong to worry, 10 minutes into the movie and i did not want it to end. The acting all round from the cast is fantastic, especially from Eddie marsan. Usually who play's such evil characters and in this is such a sweet bloke that all you can do is root for him. The movie is a simple premise, 5 guys, 12 pubs and 60 pints, OH and robot aliens. The premise sounds so silly but is great to see it play out, you wont them to conquer the golden mile and also to find out where and who these alien robot things are and where they came from. The movie is also fantastic for the amount of eater eggs it has hidden in the movie. Eg each pub has the number in which order the guys drink at it. Edgar wright is just such a fantastic director and always delivers great stuff when working with Simon Pegg And Nick Frost.

484,adamcobbold,Entertaining but unfulfilling,4,29 July 2013,"Simon Pegg is obviously a talented writer/director and there are some excellent foundations, and many people around his age will empathize with many of the themes in this film. Buried underneath the Hollywood production style is a funny film. I am not quite sure whether Edgar Wright is to blame for the ridiculousness that the film descends into but unless you are a fan of constant and ludicrous fighting scenes and vacuous characterizations, you will quickly get increasingly bored by this film. The special affects offer a colorful lighting display and I guess the plot offers some intrigue. However with such great actors looking totally disgusted by their scripts you must conclude that the Simon Pegg Ego show just dominated everything from inception onward and the other actors just gritted their teeth and thought of the money to get them through it, before returning to their proper acting careers. Nobody will watch this film twice.",The World's End

That's a word that doesn't seem very large next to fantastic, awesome, spectacular but yet it's exactly how I would describe this film. It's a wonderful work of art and everyone involved in its making should be happy to have been a part of it. It's a culmination of the work Wright, Pegg and Frost have done together over the years and a fitting end for the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy started with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. I got to see this film early and that adventure can be read about here but this is strictly about the movie. Usually third acts seem dried up and depressing as they take what was good about previous works and either follow the exact same pattern or destroy it so completely that no one can recognize the film anymore.

488,Conradsigma,A Flawed Charm,10,25 August 2013,"The World's End was an enjoyable and an original film that explores a man's attempt to rekindle and redeem his sense of freedom with his four best friends on the most epic pub crawl the world has ever seen. Almost instantly they find something amiss with their estranged hometown. They slowly begin to discover the truth behind the strange occurrences as they become increasingly drunk. The characters within the film are for the most part believable and brilliant acted. They are all individually unique and discernible from their introductions. Simon Pegg plays with a selfish freedom throughout the film. While the previous film had a strong second lead Nick Frost, the World's End's character development, however, slightly thins with four other characters following Simon Pegg's lead.I found the plot was weaker than its previous films. Comparably, as the movie progresses it feels increasingly rushed and when it comes to its dramatic moments, they carry somewhat less of an emotional weight. The World's End is still a strong and masterfully written piece. It moves with stride and confidence. The jokes are wittier and the action sequence's camera angles are filmed uniquely (almost better than Hot Fuzz). My friend and I were fortunate to watch the entire Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy all in one theater the night of its release. While I have seen Shaun of the Dead numerous times and Hot Fuzz less so, I began to notice that each film foreshadows events with subtle details that it takes almost multiple viewings to better understand a joke. I feel this film may fair better with age as it lingers in the mind. I would say it probably the weakest of the Trilogy.",The World's End

But afterwards I would say it was a big disappointment. The beginning introducing you to the characters was OK. In the middle part the Story was told quite quick - and there the film could have ended for me. The rest was Kind of boring. The end was a bit surprising but in no way exciting. I even do not know as what I would describe the genre. I would say: a tiny bit of Action, some way trash, very low Level sci fi not to take serious in any way but also not to laugh about a lot, a bit funny but not enough to call it a comedy.

492,brightsim,Genre-Mix Falling Short on all Ends,3,16 September 2013,"So, I enjoyed Shaun of the Dead, loved Hot Fuzz and, in general, am a fan of subtle British humor. Having learned about this movie just days ago, I had not built that much of a hype the movie could not possibly withstand. Target audience and unbiased - what could possibly go wrong?The answer is simple: A lot.The first few minutes already give away what you can expect from the rest of the movie: While Hot Fuzz introduces Nicholas and Danny in brilliant fashion, outlining their traits with a great sense of humor, ""The World's End"" merely draws shallow characterly schemes.After being convinced to do so by former leader of the gang Gary, your typical ex-high-school-clique sets out to score 12 pints in their home town's infamous pub crawl. You get your regular guy, the guy who used to get bullied and the guy who used to be cool but ever since school failed to adapt to social conventions in his later life. ""Doesn't the movie feature five guys?"" - some of you might say. Well, yes, it actually does. Unfortunately just two hours after having watched the movie, I wouldn't know with what traits to come up to describe all of the characters - simply because they are dispenseble!Sometimes less can be more - certainly in case of ""The World's End"": If the clique would have been just a group of three, there would have been proper screen time for all of the protagonists.The contemplative home town leaves the same shallow feel: Hot Fuzz' setting had so much charm to it - it's a shame to see this potential wasted with The World's End.However, in the end characters and setting can only add to a foundation of a film. In case of The World's End this foundation is a blend of comedy and science fiction - at least that's what the trailer suggests. Does the movie deliver? Not really. The trailer literally spoils every single fun scene. And on the sci-fi front the only thing you get are some solid special effects. Fighting scenes are dragged out and boring.Remember when Shaun and Ed (Shaun of the Dead) encountered the zombie in the garden, throwing old vinyl records at it? Sharp tongues might consider this as dragged out as well - I for myself enjoyed it. Why? Because ""Shaun of the Dead"" made that particular encounter something that felt worth watching. The World's End, on the other hand, gives you one and the same jittery fighting scene over and over again....And then there is the story. If one wanted to come across especially witty, it certainly would be possible to pull the one or the other interpretation of the very few noteworthy events out of the hat. Personally, I won't do it, since this would require me to actually WANT to like the movie more (for reasons of how well it did in one other the other regard). Given this story hardly offers any more depth than your average ""Hangover"" flick, I don't see any reason why I should treat this film any different just because of the two good (indirect) predecessors.",The World's End
493,mebcaux,Worst movie I have seen in quite some time,2,24 September 2013,"I expected to enjoy this movie thoroughly, as I did the previous two in the ""trilogy"". I hoped for a British ""Hangover"". Pegg's performance was typically brilliant, but was wasted in one of the worst messes of a movie, and wastes of talent, I have seen in quite some time. I ceased laughing after 30 minutes, and began struggling to remain awake once the film went off the tracks in an incredibly moronic and astonishingly unentertaining diversion into a story about robotic body-snatchers. I concluded the writers must have completed the script while on a lengthy pub crawl supplemented with copious quantities of weed, else they could not possibly have imagined their script would be funny.",The World's End
494,a-buffam1342,"To err is human, so errr...",10,26 September 2013,"When it comes down to it, The World's End easily became my favourite movie out of the Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy. I've been super pumped for this movie since they started filming and I was not disappointed. The Pegg-Frost-Wright trio outdid themselves and it was just plain awesome. The music was fantastic, the actors were brilliant and the cinematography was brilliant. The only bad things I really had with it was Oliver (Martin Freeman) but you have to remember that he is a real estate agent who his only sibling is Sam and the setup because it took quite a while however! Great stories need to be set up.Otherwise, from the moment he came on screen, Pegg really grabbed my attention showing that while yes, he can play silly characters but towards the end, when he was fighting with Andy and when he was crying about it was supposed to be the start of his life, I was crying like a baby. Gary King is one of Pegg's best roles.Frost was not portrayed as the dummy in this movie and I rather enjoyed that. So otherwise speaking - yes, it wasn't the same as Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz but it was the best 109 minutes of my life and I never once left the theatre.All the awards for these boys.",The World's End
495,antonyowers,Pathetic gutter language,4,26 September 2013,"The plot (five old friends returning to their old home town for a pub crawl they hadn't completed years earlier only to find that the town had been taken over by aliens) was good, and there was some fine acting-- indeed I liked all five old mates and Sam-- but the film was ruined for me (I am over 60--probably not the target audience!) by the--for me--way overdone violence and action scenes--and, worse, the pathetic gutter language. Had those been in perspective we would have a had a pleasant one hour film which might have had some value. Instead I feel very insulted, and saddened, that such good actors stooped so low. Yours sincerely Antony Owers",The World's End
496,gards8,definitely not the funniest,5,8 November 2013,"i had great expectations of this film however it was mediocre at best and like several other reviews it did not live up to the hype. 7.4 usually means a good movie to be had. unfortunately not in this case, don't get me wrong i laughed on several occasions but nowhere near enough to warrant it up there with the best of the comedies. Basically storyline started off introducing the characters and the film looked promising and the chance to relive the youth for one night with a 12 pub pub crawl. after the initial meet up with the Blanks it just got daft and lost the plot a bit with fewer laughs as the film went on. Not the gangs finest hour but i suppose they cant make top films every time and lets be honest it wasn't in the same league as Hot Fuzz.",The World's End
497,stvnpntr,How Long Can They Get Away With This Rubbish,1,9 December 2013,"Pegg must be laughing all the way to the bank churning out consistent rubbish such as this. Lack of plot,lack of laughs and a waste of my life. If this is what represents British comedy in the US it's a travesty.Shaun of the dead was a great film, Hot Fuzz was average and this is scraping the very bottom of the barrel.Well done to Steve Coogan for finally breaking the Hollywood shackles and creating a great British comedy.I hope the cast and Directors go back to the drawing board before submitting the film going public to these atrocities.Get back back on the enterprise Simon and beam me up until you make something worth watching.Lets hope we see some improvements in British comedy in 2014.",The World's End
498,cristiteodorov,Do not watch this.,1,1 January 2014,"This was by far the worst movie ever created in the history of human kind. Seeing a 7.1 score on IMDb made me think that the movie would be enjoyable but oh my god i was so wrong. It cannot be unseen. After seeing this movie I think that I have lost my ability to rate a movie because everything will seem good when I compare it to this. Now I need 10 lines of text. I don't want to write 10 lines about this. I just want to forget. Please . Now something to fill the 10 lines. The idea of the movie is bad, the action is bad, there is 0 comedy in the movie. 40 million dollars to create this movie is just like setting it on fire. Why would you do that? Better donate to charity. 10 lines.. Cmon. There i did it. Thanks",The World's End
499,vincechente,Truly Awful,1,2 January 2014,"To call this movie the worst piece of sh*t of all time would be too generous and an insult to all the other crappy films out there. I did like how it began and good character development. We all know ""that one guy"" who refuses to get on with life and wants us to join the life long party. But then this film takes a major left turn to reveal a huge identity crises. The bros-night-out and the sci-fi angle don't come close to working together. The ending could not have been worse if they tried and apparently they did. This film would have been far more enjoyable had they stuck with the initial premise of the story and kept it going through a series of ""Hang Over"" style adventures and detours and left out the sci-fi stuff for Simon Pegg's role on Star Trek.",The World's End
500,steve-piro,"Promising, mediocre, acceptable, unwatchable, pretentious",4,22 November 2014,"The summary describes how I felt as the film progressed.First 35 minutes or so - promising, seems like it good be a great film, and builds up a charming rapport between characters.After this, I felt a sense of disappointment, that it was simply going to not be any good, but I gradually grew to accept the film...Until 1 hour and 22. Oh my. Now we're talking flat out embarrassing to watch.Then the last few minutes after 1 hour 38? Pretentious.Simply put, if you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, or both, as I did, you probably won't enjoy The World's End, because The World's End is an exceeding poor film.It's only had any glimmer of hope in the first half an hour, as mentioned.",The World's End
501,flynn-kait,Just... No,2,26 February 2014,"What was Edgar Wright thinking? I think they even forgot the story they were writing. They had to keep reminding themselves, ""We are not robots. Robots are slaves and we are very happy."" The story was bad and inconsistent. Simon Pegg's character has some serious emotional issues that don't even make sense. ""Our town has been overrun by not robots(?? I don't know what else to call them), but still I need to keep drinking and put everyone at risk."" I really hated that character. The other films were relatable; I have never known anyone to be that stupidly selfish.Also, no one told Simon Pegg that gingers can't dye their hair or they look super creepy. So bad. This fail is even more upsetting because Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were so good.",The World's End
502,amaladinesh0505,awesome movie,9,28 June 2014,"The world's end is one of the awesome movies i've seen in years.I would recommend this movie for everyone who love Adventure movie.The acting was top notch, especially from Simon pegg and Nick frost. The fight scenes and BGM are just mind blowing.Buy this movie on blue Ray and have a good time like I did.The best part about the movie is that the humor is so good and the characters are believable. The plot is that Simon pegg wants to reunite with his friends to finish his pub crawl that he missed in his childhood and when they were they find that the city has not changed a bit from the last time they saw it and suddenly they figure out that the city is occupied by robots and they call it the blanks now they have to figure out a way to escape from them.this movie reminded me of the THE THING and Shawn of the dead also from the same director. This movie is totally worth buying on blue ray.I am looking forward to the next edger Wright movie.And one thing before I finish my review I am New to this IMDb so I don't have much experience in writing reviews so the review is too short.Next time I will write an in depth review about the movie i'm going to review.",The World's End
503,tobyjamesmason,Good fun,7,19 November 2014,"If you liked Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, this will definitely be one for you. A good, fun comedy, mix in some action and a few twists and turns and it had me laughing throughout. I would definitely recommend this film to someone looking for an easy to watch comedy! Pegg is constantly delivering witty one liners, and the supporting cast play their roles excellently. Frost taking a slightly different role to his usual dufus sidekick in SotD and HF, but playing it expertly. I watched this film. As per, Pegg and co have managed to create another funny and exciting dramatic comedy that keeps you wanting more! Looking forward to another film from this cast.",The World's End
504,aggumm,A brilliant movie,9,12 October 2016,"Not the funniest of the cornetto trilogy, but possibly the best. This one is so brilliantly written that i am very, very impressed. Gary King (Simon Pegg) is a middle aged man who refuses to grow up, the only thing for him is the next drink; he wants to be free to do what he wants any old time.... He urges his friends for a one final pub crawl, a pub crawl of twelve pubs that ends at the one called the worlds end. The analogy between an alcoholic and mankind is a brilliant one. Gary King cannot stop drinking even though he knows it will lead him to his destruction. The robots are actually aliens from other worlds trying to save this one but Gary and the boys know better; they just want to keep the party going. Its nice to finally see a movie whith such strong message and such powerful imagery. It addresses some of the most fatal issues of the world today; we know we are going the wrong way, but somehow we just keep on going... not even aliens from outer space can stop us.",The World's End
505,mitchumb,Not good,4,21 February 2016,"I Was looking forward to a 4**** film. It was advertised as such in our TV guide. Generally that means it should be pretty good and others thought so too. Unfortunately not the case for this one, it was absolute rubbish. The initial idea was good enough (and I'm sure a great story could have been made from it) but was then ruined with the appearance of so called aliens trying to take over like so many have in the past. A complete waste of the talented cast in my opinion. I'm sure the good review came off the back of the film ""Paul"". I really enjoyed that film and it was a laugh out loud job. Not this though by a long shot, I kid you not. Give it a miss.",The World's End
506,jameswild-00197,Massive disappointment,4,20 March 2016,"As a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and of the other two films in the Cornetto trilogy I was really disappointed with this film. I know the other two films are hardly nonfictional, however this was unbelievable even for a fiction. The jokes weren't as funny and the whole thing just didn't work. Maybe I would have given this film a 5 had it been the first film I had seen in the trilogy... but sadly, that was not the case.Despite my love for Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, none of the characters in the film are likable. Without feeling some kind of attachment to any character it makes the outcome of the film (whatever it is) at best underwhelming and anticlimactic. Don't bother watching this film unless you really have nothing better to do. You'd be far better off going to the pub yourself.",The World's End
507,patrikmikolaj,Probably the worst movie EVER...,1,12 January 2017,"This was most likely the worst movie I have ever seen and spent my time on. The beginning and the overall idea of the movie seems fine at the beginning. Rather slow and long beginning promises a nice movie about the party of 5 guys who want to relive their high school ""pub crawl"". All good, with some very nice footage of English small town and scenic pubs, up until first scene in toilet where they are suddenly attacked by robots trying to take over the earth.... If I have not spent 35 minutes already on that movie, I would most likely turn it off. And boy, was I angry at the end that I did not do it? I would only waste 35 minutes of my life and not 110!!! Please do yourself a favor and do not watch this, spend that time either on some good TV show or reading a book. I just cant imagine how someone can spend money on a movie like this....",The World's End

509,the_bandersnatch,Funking Great,7,19 July 2013,"Saw it at a midnight premier last night (free Cornettos were given out!) and myself and the rest of the audience were laughing throughout, having a thoroughly enjoyable time. I thought it was great, definitely on a par with Hot Fuzz, though - to me - not quite as good as Shaun of the Dead, which is fair enough as it is one of my all-time favourites. It is definitely a worthy close to the ""trilogy"" though, and it stands up well against the other two.Amongst the highlights were seeing another former Bond actor, even if it was in a small role, along with various other regulars from the past films and Spaced - Tyres, Julia Deaking (Marsha), Bill Nighy's voice, Mark Heap, et al.With a plot as ludicrous as this one the film relies on the strength of it's leads to succeed, and they pull it off admirably. I liked that there was a role reversal of Pegg and Frost's usual character dynamic, with Frost especially noteworthy in his performance. The lads have clearly come a long way over the years. Pegg is clearly having a whale of a time, and carries us the audience along with him. Having such a talented group of back-up actors in Marsan, Considine and Freeman helps massively too.I feel they missed a trick by not using the line ""You've got blue on you"", though.",The World's End
