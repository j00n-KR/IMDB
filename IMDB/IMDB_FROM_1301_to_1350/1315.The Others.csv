0,MartinHafer,"Much like ""The Sixth Sense"", how much you know about the film ahead of time will strongly impact how much you enjoy it.",8,11 March 2012,"""The Others"" is a 'twist film'--one that relies heavily on a twist ending that gives the film a great 'AHAH!' moment. But, if you know about this twist ahead of time, it really negatively impacts your viewing of the film. Unfortunately for me, some idiot talked about the twist and so I avoided watching the film for many years. It's a shame--and folks who do this sort of thing deserve to be tied up and forced to watch every episode of ""Three's Company""! The same can be said for those who insist on telling everyone about the twist in ""The Sixth Sense""--a film which, fortunately, I was able to watch before some dummy told me the spoilers! Even with the ruined twist, the film is still very good and merits an 8. It's a bit overlong but solid throughout and quite original. I could say more, but I don't want to be one of those jerks that spills the beans!",The Others
1,TheLittleSongbird,Brilliantly written and chilling; wonderfully atmospheric with stunning period detail,9,13 February 2010,"The film may start off a little on the slow side, but essentially it is a truly chilling and effective period horror film, with just the right chills and thrills. Superbly directed and brilliantly written, ""The Others"" hits all the right boxes. Then there is an atmospheric music score and truly stunning cinematography and period detail(the house especially was fantastic). The story is an original one, very rarely gets confusing and goes along at a good pace. And the performances are wonderful, Nicole Kidman without a doubt gives one of the best performances I have seen her give in years, it was a performance of true intensity. Alakina Mann and James Bentley are outstanding as her children, and Christopher Ecceleston is effective in a small role. Asides from Kidman, Fionnula Flannagan is truly sinister and chilling as the housekeeper. Like Mrs Danvers in the Hitchcock film ""Rebecca"" while she is merely a secondary character, she does so much to enhance the story. All in all, this is a great film, and I recommend it highly. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",The Others
2,Leofwine_draca,A classic old-fashioned ghost story,7,22 September 2016,"Following in the footsteps of THE SIXTH SENSE (to which it is indebted with its many plot twists and revelations), THE OTHERS is a throwback to the older, more gentle (but no less terrifying) style of horror which is more about dark shadows, things moving in empty rooms, and atmosphere and style rather than graphic shocks or unwanted comedy relief. Which is why THE OTHERS is by far the best horror film that I have seen in 2001 so far, and with the year inexorably drawing to a close it's a fair bet that this film be the best horror film of the year full stop. Although the slow pacing means that some scenes of inaction inevitably drag, THE OTHERS holds your attention span with some well-portrayed shock sequences, lots of creepy bits, and strong acting from an above-average cast who breathe life into their roles.I was complaining recently about recent horrors like JEEPERS CREEPERS which assault the delicate senses of the audience by aurally battering them with loud bursts of music during the scare sequences; thankfully, THE OTHERS has only one or two such scenes and is much more frightening when concerning unexplained and diabolic events occurring on screen. For me, the scariest moment - which can almost cause one to look away in fright - is when Kidman sees that her daughter has somehow turned into a withered old crone, a truly disgusting and terrifying scene. This type of thing is often done well in horror stories but not so successfully in film, well that's not the case here.The setting of the large country mansion is a good one, and the plot contrivance of Kidman having to keep all the curtains shut due to the fact that her children are light-sensitive makes for an excellent visual contrast on screen between dark and light, with plenty of atmospheric shadows in which things might be lurking. There's also a fantastic sequence in which Kidman goes out into the woods and finds herself lost in the fog, which is conveyed so that you feel like you're there. The music of course complements what's going on up on the screen, and the best efforts of a fine cast also help things out considerably. In fact there's the same kind of chill atmosphere as in classics like THE WOMAN IN BLACK or the BBC Ghost Stories for Christmas of the '70s, when you knew something horrible would be revealed but never knew quite what and were frequently horrified and surprised.Nicole Kidman shows off her fine acting style and how she has matured as an actress since the days of DEAD CALM with a fine performance of a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and the child actors, both newcomers, are excellent as the quirky brother and sister. Also giving strong performances in the supporting cast are Fionnula Flanagan as the nanny, Christopher Eccleston (excellent in a tragic sub plot as Kidman's missing husband who mysteriously turns up), Eric Sykes as the gardener, Renee Asherson as a creepy old lady and Keith Allen.Initially I thought (with the characters and setting) the film to be a remake of the Henry James classic The Turn of the Screw, made most famously with Deborah Kerr in 1961 as THE INNOCENTS. As the plot progresses, however, the story moves in very unexpected directions, ending with not one but two fantastic twists which you won't see coming (at least I didn't, but then I don't go looking for them). THE OTHERS is a breath of originality in what now amounts to a stale genre, and is miles ahead of teen slasher rubbish like the recent JEEPERS CREEPERS. I know which one I'd pick out of the two; the film with characterisation, unexpected situations, thankfully no special effects, and with a real, genuine atmosphere of chill and suspense.",The Others
3,SnoopyStyle,Kidman terrific in great moody atmosphere,8,29 October 2014,"It's 1945 Jersey, the Channel Islands. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) is staying at a mansion with her two kids waiting for her husband. Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) come for work after the previous servants vanished. The children are photosensitive and can't be in direct sunlight. Grace is religious and over-protective with numerous strange rules. Then Grace hears strange noises and voices which her girl Anne says it's a boy named Victor and his family.This is a terrific moody ghost story. The twist is very nicely done. If there is any problem, it's that this movie is released two years after the best ghost movie with a twist. Nevertheless, Kidman is great and the creepy mood is worthy of the best of the old fashion ghost stories.",The Others
4,claudio_carvalho,One of The Best and the Most Original Ghost Stories of Haunted House Ever Made,10,8 January 2012,"In 1945, in Jersey, Channel Islands, the widow Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives in a lonely old house with her daughter Anne (Alakina Mann) and her son Nicholas (James Bentley). Grace lost her beloved husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) in the World War II and their children are photosensitive and Grace keeps the curtains and the doors closed to protect Anne and Nicholas against the sunlight. Grace raises her children with strict discipline and following religious principles. Grace hires the strange housekeeper Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), the mute maid Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) and the gardener Mr. Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) that have asked for a job. Out of the blue, mysterious things happen in the mansion and Anne claims that there is a boy named Viktor that visits them. Grace unsuccessfully seeks out the intruders until the day she has a revelation about the house and its intruders. ""The Others"" is one of the best and the most original ghost stories of haunted house ever made (the best is actually ""Haunted""). Nobody can guess the final plot point that has one of the best twists of the cinema history. I saw ""The Others"" for the first time on 28 June 2002 and today, almost ten years later, I have enjoyed almost the same way I did in 2002.This is the third film made by the excellent Alejandro Amenábar, who is the director, writer and composer. The plot is very well disclosed and the entire cast has magnificent performances. Nicole Kidman is very beautiful before her plastic surgery of the nose and has a top-notch performance. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Os Outros"" (""The Others"")",The Others
5,Sleepin_Dragon,A masterpiece.,10,8 August 2021,"Twenty years on, and The Others still rates as one of the best, most memorable horrors of the last two decades. It doesn't have the cheap gore or lazy scares that so many do, this has the element of menace, the scares are more measured, and suitably placed.It's very different to almost every other horror I can think of, it's like a story from a much earlier era, but given up to date production values and acting. It benefits of course from such a wonderful cast, Kidman is awesome, and does a terrific English accent.The ending came as a massive surprise, and was perhaps the most chilling element of the film. It is loaded with atmosphere, it's thoroughly engrossing, I would hugely recommend this film, 10/10.",The Others
6,classicsoncall,"""You'll soon find out there are times when this house is not exactly an ideal home.""",8,18 April 2018,"For me, the best horror films are the ones that don't come at you and hit you in the face with ghosts, monsters, or spurting blood the way a lot of modern pictures do. I think allowing the momentum to build with ambiguous characters while implying that something mysterious is going on is much better at providing tension and suspense. You had a lot of that going on here with the character of Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two young children, residing in a large, creepy house on the Jersey Channel Islands. The story takes place in 1945, roughly coinciding with the end of World War II, thereby adding another element of mystery to the story, that being the absence of Mrs. Stewart's husband (Christopher Eccleston), who's a potential casualty of the war.Nicole Kidman was well cast for her role here, demonstrating a wide range of emotions as she perseveres to keep her children safe in the face of a daunting medical condition. A better one might have been that of the young boy portraying her son Nicholas (James Bentley). I mean, the kid looked really creepy throughout the story, even more so than older sister Anne, played by Alakina Mann, who provided more of a conflicted sibling in light of her mother's doubts about her observations in the house. The three caretakers who arrive at the Stewart home bring even more ambiguity to the story, as they have a past with prior inhabitants of the house. I didn't realize I had seen this film when it first came out but as the story progressed I started to recall aspects of it without fully remembering how it turned out. So then the wheels started turning to try and figure out the twist ending, and it still managed to arrive at a satisfyingly surprise conclusion, along the lines of Bruce Willis's ""The Sixth Sense"". If I had been making the picture I wouldn't have had Nicole Kidman's character go into that long winded monologue after the reveal though. The twist by itself was enough to make the picture a memorable one.",The Others
7,gavin6942,"A Really Good Film, But I Think It Loses Something Along the Way",7,1 July 2007,"A woman and her two children live in a large house, waiting for the father to return. A maid, a gardener and a nanny arrive to help take care of the large house. But some others arrive, too -- a group that believe the house if rightfully theirs. This house is haunted! Nicole Kidman stars. Tom Cruise produces. It's tough to say how much of this film is due to their involvement and how much is due to just being a good movie. Certainly the success and nominations came from Kidman appearing (any other actress and this film would have faded into quick obscurity). But it's still artsy and I like that about the movie.I really can't talk about this film because there's twists and I want to mention them to really give a good overview. I knew about the twists when I sat down to watch this, which I think took something out of the film for me. Which leads me to think this film would not be half as good on a second or third viewing. My colleague in the movie review business, The Butcher, listed this as a must-see horror film. And it ranks at the bottom of the Internet Movie Database's Top 50 horror films, which is still respectable. I guess I don't think it's as good as they make it out to be.The ""horror"" elements are pretty much just thumps, bumps and people who might be ghosts that we don't really ever see (they always leave the room before the camera enters). So, it's not a scary film. The house and costumes are beautiful, for what that's worth... but not scary.Go ahead and watch this one. I think it's more a drama than horror, but that's not a reason not to watch it, I suppose. Strong acting everywhere, and the kids are fun if for no other reason than they have interesting accents. I suspect they'll never get another acting job again (especially the boy). Not one of my favorites, but good nonetheless.",The Others
8,lee_eisenberg,we all may be assuming the wrong thing about ourselves,10,16 February 2007,"At the beginning of ""The Others"" we get introduced to housewife Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) living with her photosensitive children on the island of Jersey during World War II. They can't leave the island as the Nazi submarines have it surrounded. Then, ghostly things begin to happen in the house, and the children say that some other people are living in the house. As time passes, Grace gets more and more desperate and angrily starts carrying a rifle around. And then...it turns out that we've been assuming the wrong thing the whole time.This movie probably makes a more interesting use of light and dark than any other movie (at least that I can think of). Every scene's contrast makes you think that something terrible is about to happen. Some people have compared this movie to ""The Sixth Sense"", and I would call that a legitimate analogy. Not only is there the horror factor, but also how the main character is forced to reassess everything that s/he has known...and then we find out the truth. Kidman, whose roles often seem a little too glamorous, here makes your blood freeze and displays a menacing face without even trying.Overall, I do recommend this one. Just see whether or not you totally trust yourself after watching this.",The Others
9,jboothmillard,The Others,6,14 September 2005,"This is quite an interesting idea for a story, some people move into a new house and the children suspected that the place is haunted. BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, she has two children who are apparently allergic to sunlight and will die if they get too much. Anyway, after a little while the children hear noises and see shadows, and they say the house is haunted. Only the maid believes them, but soon enough Grace starts to worry as well. Eventually they find out the terrifying secret, that the servants looking after the house are dead. But then the even spookier shock, they are dead too! Also starring Christopher Eccleston as Charles Stewart. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. It was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Good!",The Others
10,Tweekums,An atmospheric chiller,8,29 January 2009,"It is nice that there are still horror films like this around, ones that rely on atmosphere and good acting rather than shocks and gore, not that there is anything wrong with that, it is just nice to have alternatives. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, the devout mother of two children, living in a large house on the island of Jersey shortly after the end of the German occupation. The film opens with three strangers coming to the door to work as servants, as Grace shows them around the house she explains certain strange rules the must keep, all doors must be locked after use and all the curtains must be kept closed, this is because her two children are so photosensitive that any sunlight would make them very ill or possibly kill them. Not long after this Grace's daughter Anne claims she has seen a boy called Victor in the house along with his family, Grace doesn't believe her initially but after a while grows to believe that the house may in fact be haunted.There are few shocks in the film but an oppressive atmosphere is maintained by the darkened rooms in the house and the ever present fog outside, as the film progresses Grace seems to get more and more paranoid and irrational to the point where we are led to believe she might even harm the children. All the main actors perform well, especially Alakina Mann and James Bentley as the two young children. While I didn't find it as scary as some reviewers I'd still recommend it... just try to avoid spoilers before watching it.",The Others
11,ma-cortes,"Creepy movie builds taut by showing virtually eerie images , unsettling score and evocative cinematography",8,5 January 2014,"Thrilling and surprising story full of chills , plot twists , intrigue and excitement . The movie opens with Nicole Kidman, in voice-over, reading a story. She begins with the words, ""Now children, are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin."" As a woman named Grace Stewart who lives in a darkened old house with her two photosensitive (it is very strange with roughly a thousand people in the world that have it) children (the disease they have is an actual disease known as Xeroderma Pigmentosum). Grace , whose husband (Christopher Eccleston) has never returned from the war , becomes convinced that her family home (the house - supposedly on the island of Jersey - is actually located in the north of Spanish , in Las Fraguas , Cantabria , Palace of Hornillos) haunted while overprotecting her two young children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley were cast after an intensive search that encompassed 5,000 children). They will live alone there with oppressive, rare and almost religious rules , until she needs to hire a group of servants (Eric Sykes as Mr. Edmund Tuttle , Elaine Cassidy as Lydia and Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs. Bertha Mills) for them .The motion picture displays genuine chills , suspense, mystery and dark atmosphere with a twisted finale . Packs excellent creation of tension , thriller , emotions and terror . It's an exciting , bizarre film ; skillfully written and proceeded by Alejandro Amenabar and turns out to one of the most unusual Spaniard suspense movie ever made and certainly one of the most unsettling .The basis for this movie is an episode of the British series 'Armchair Theatre' called 'The Others' made in 1970 and remade as a movie called 'Voices' in 1972 , this version is more elaborate but the story is the same. ¨Los Otros¨ comes from a peculiar cross-section of production cultures ; it stars an Australian woman playing an Englishwoman ; it was written and directed by a Spaniard, backed by Americans, set in Jersey but filmed in Spain. Plenty of twists and turns , the strange images deliver the excitement united a thrilling musical score by the same Alejandro Amenabar . He along with screenwriter Mateo Gil appear in one of the photographs of dead people . Furthermore , Alejandro also wrote the interesting plot , embarking into the phantasmagorical, psychological or even quasi-surrealist story . Intelligent edition, special use of luxurious sets by Benjamin Fernandez and slick utilization of shock images make this one, a magnificent film . Colorful and glowing cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe which heightens the suspense . This was the first film ever to receive the Best Film Award at the Goyas (Spain's national film awards) with not a single word of Spanish spoken in it and his film went on after its release , to become Spain's biggest grossing domestic film of all time. The film opened in the US at number 4 in the box office charts and stayed around that figure for its initial run. Seven weeks into release it actually climbed up to the number 2 spot. The picture was very well directed by Amenabar in his third movie, after he achieved various hits . Since his perhaps best-known early short-film ""Himenóptero"" in 1992, in which he directed , produced, acted and wrote the script and the music, Amenábar progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with ""Thesis"", Amenabar was 23 when he directed this his feature debut , a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene . And ¨Abre Los Ojos¨ that was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky (2001), starring Tom Cruise who in ¨The others¨ was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . ¨Los Otros¨ (2001) was released a few months prior to Vanilla Sky (2001), the American remake of 'Alejandro Amenabár''s Abre Los Ojos (1997). Ironically, it starred Nicole Kidman's then estranged husband Tom Cruise . ""Los Otros"" confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world and is Amenábar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the all-time worldwide box office history . In all his films Alejandro also writes the script and the music, as well as composing the music for other films , most notably ""Butterflies tongue"" (1999). He subsequently directed ¨Mar Adentro¨ with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and finally the epic/historical ¨Agora¨ with Rachel Weisz . Rating : Better than average . Essential and indispensable watching .",The Others
12,moonspinner55,Effectively spooky and gloomy presentation...story itself is less satisfying,7,9 December 2016,"Atmospheric but somewhat unsatisfying tale of a woman and her two sick children in 1945, living in a gloomy mansion in the Channel Islands, doesn't offer many new tricks in the haunted house genre (even the colorless title warns you of that). Writer-director Alejandro Amenábar has visual imagination and panache to spare, yet his screenplay (which has an overlay of James' ""The Turn of the Screw"") is stuffed with red herrings that only serve to weigh down the ultimate explanation. Nicole Kidman is imposing and impenetrable as the proprietress of the manor who can't seem to explain the absence of her husband--and who keeps her precocious kids out of the sun because they're allergic to ultra-violet light. Kidman is one of the best actresses we have today; her film selections continue to be intriguing (she isn't afraid to take risks, which is clear with her work here), and she is also very lovely to watch. Fionnula Flanagan is flawless as the new housekeeper who has arrived mysteriously (with a mute assistant and a gardener in tow) after the previous staff has vanished into the night. Amenábar stages a grand scene near the end in a graveyard, but he's less successful at paring down the dross and giving viewers a really good fright (instead, piano music at night drives Kidman into hysterics, while her taunting daughter teases her endlessly with facetious comments). The picture does work on occasion, mostly due to the acting and the handsome production. *** from ****",The Others
13,dbdumonteil,to rank among the 5 best movies made in 2001,10,25 March 2005,"""And all the other voices said: change your mind, you're always wrong"" (the Cure, Other Voices, Faith, 1981).A few years ago, Alejandro Amenabar's third movie was prominent in the top 250 of IMDb. But today, it isn't there any more. That's really unfair. It largely deserved its place and to occupy it as long as possible.After, ""Tesis"" (1996) and ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997), Amenabar goes up a notch and signs with ""the Others"" (2001) a masterful masterpiece which refreshes fantastic cinema and breathes new life into the theme of the haunted house. He largely deserves his nickname of ""new young prodigy of Spanish cinema"". With Tom Cruise, partly responsible for the production, one could fear a strong Hollywood influence in Amenabar's opus. But fortunately, it's nothing of the sort. As a matter of fact, just like the great M Night Shyamalan, Alejandro Amenabar appears as a real author, on the fringe of the Hollywood industry and he's got enough character to let his style nurture. Let's hope he won't be crushed by the Hollywood machine. The movie was shot in Spain, with eventually a modest budget (17 millions of dollars) and it was a surprise to see it doing brilliantly a little everywhere in the world.Amenabar had already ventured in the dreadful world of the snuff-movies with his debut movie ""Tesis"" and had succeeded in mixing several films genres in one cohesive narrative line with ""Abre Los Ojos"". But with ""the Others"", one didn't suspect a real ease in the ""In Camera"". It's a quite dramatic change of style and in the end a successful translation in the fantastic.Amenabar's references are easy to guess. They're three cornerstones in fantastic cinema: ""the Innocents"" (1961), ""the Haunting"" (1963) and ""the Sixth Sense"" (1999). ""The Others"" can be considered as the meeting of these three opus. All the elements of the fantastic movie with Gothic nature are gathered and perfectly used. There's no shortage of examples: an austere mansion with a sinister architecture which hides a dark secret, big rooms half obscured, a mist which tends to thicken throughout the days, characters with sinister-looking faces. All these features blend themselves to create a nearly stifling universe. Moreover, Amenabar favors a calm and quite slow rhythm to play with the spectator's nerves as much as possible and we are entitled to real moments of fear. It is also interesting to write that a minimum of special effects is just enough for the director to maintain anxiety. He also weaves a more and more threatening atmosphere marked out by the progressive reversal of situation (in the beginning of the film, Nicole Kidman dominated Fionnula Flanagan but in the middle of the film, it's the contrary which happens). And, of course, like in a successful suspense movie, virtually all the obscure or ambiguous points are clarified making the story incredibly coherent and after the final conclusion (which of course, I won't reveal), the very last sequences have a strong emotional power and it would take a heart of stone to resist them. On another extent, let's also take down the omnipresence of religion, supposed to be a sort of protection for Nicole Kidman but which, in the end turns out to be useless. One can put forward that Amenabar had surely a strong catholic education and he must have lost his faith...But the qualities of ""the Others"" don't stop here. It is visually and technically an appealing movie with a gorgeous photography (certain images are breathtaking) and there's also a careful work on sound and the original soundtrack. On of the most important characteristics from Alejandro Amenabar is that he composes the music of his own films and her, very simply, he excels himself. The delicate and disturbing sounds we can hear contribute to reinforce the threatening atmosphere of the film and makes us feel a little more ill-at-ease again.""The Others"" was released when Nicole Kidman had just divorced Tom Cruise and I had thought that she gave the image of a more mature and ambitious actress. Amenabar's flick confirms it. One is really under the impression that she gives the best that she can. There's nothing to say about her role she takes with consummate skill. Her role of haughty middle-class housewife with a cold and penetrating look is sufficient to make one shudder. What is strange is that her name in the film is Grace and her hairstyle is reminiscent of Grace Kelly's. Is it a nod to the actress? Be that as it may, it would be unfair to forget the rest of the cast, especially Fionnula Flanagan who under a docile and frail appearance can easily become disturbing. At last, Amenabar made quite a creditable job of the directing of children who are, in general difficult actors to direct.A chilling and great movie from start to finish. To fully savor all lights turned off. Highly recommended. Hats off to Mr Amenabar: he is one of the main leaders of Spanish cinema and his career is starting well as the triumph of ""Mar Adentro"" (2004) testifies.",The Others
14,Quinoa1984,"Creepy, sometimes thrilling, and a good performance wedged in",7,15 August 2001,"The Others (originally titled The Darkness when I saw it 3 months ago in a private screening) tells the story of a widow, Nicole Kidman plays her with scritness and is actually fitted well for it, and her children.  Now these kids aren't like other ones, as they have to stay in the dark all the time, or else something bad will happen to them.  Things seem OK, and they're are new housekeepers hired, but then things of a supernatural nature begin to occur.The film is in the bloodline of such films as The Sixth Sense and on that level I can say this movie is fairly decent enough.  It gives fine scares here and there and it has a really crackerjack ending that will have some people talking, but in the end of the movie, do we care about the lot of the characters?  Director Amenabar gives good detail to the period and to the shocks, but the plot could've used some work.  B+",The Others
15,Coventry,"Subtle, genuinely creepy and ... SUBTLE",8,4 November 2004,"The Others is a very remarkable film from more than just one viewpoint. In an era where you can only impress young horror fanatics with bucket-loads of blood and gross-out effects, Amenábar actually re-teaches his audience that fear is especially caused by suggestion and the absence of explicit images. The Others is the first intelligent horror film in years, completely relying on atmosphere and eerie set pieces. It's such a relief to finally see a subtle film that is also effective! I'm normally not much of Nicole Kidman fan but she's very convincing as the prudish, over-concerned mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world (daylight in particular). She lives in a remote mansion and waits, along with her 2 children, for WWII to be over. With the arrival of 3 servants, strange events star to occur in the old house and the daughter spots 'intruders' everywhere. The screenplay - by Amenábar himself - is not totally unique (filmfreaks who're familiar with expressionism highlights from the 60's will quickly guess the hidden plot twist) but it's filled with ingenious findings and sublime dialogues. The Others reminds you of 'The Innocents' and there are far worse films to get compared with, if you ask me! What also is rather amazing about this production is that Amenábar seems so confident! This is his first giant Hollywood adventure with stars in the cast and American money and yet he has total control over everything. The acting is great, the plot actually scares you and the directing is solid. The Others is a total winner and easily one of the greatest genre-films of the last few decades.",The Others
16,michaelRokeefe,What old estate in England is not haunted?,7,2 September 2001,"Talk about a ghost story. This one has an interesting twist to it. Living in isolation in an old manor along the British shores is a prim young woman(Nicole Kidman) and her two children.

An odd trio arrives to help with the upkeep and day to day living. Mrs. Mills(Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle(Eric Sykes),the gardener and a young mute, Lydia(Elaine Cassidy)turn out to be no strangers to the homestead.This film is very slow and I am not certain that more viewers will not feel satisfied with the less than power packed climax. The movie is creepy and is sustained by the eerie mood and atmosphere. High suspense makes up for the small helping of horror. Some of the camera positioning made me think I was watching Grace Kelly instead of the equally beautiful Miss Kidman.This movie will keep your interest from the opening scream. Miss Kidman's talent is tested and she comes through with flying colors as usual. Suspense and a few chills. Nerve wrecking fun. Don't miss!",The Others
17,sunwarrior13,Unbelievable Twist,10,12 November 2011,"The Others is a psychological horror film that stars Nicole Kidman together with Fionnula Flanagan,Christopher Eccleston,Elaine Cassidy,Eric Sykes,Alakina Mann and James Bentley. It is inspired partly by the novella The Turn of the Screw.The music as well as the screenplay and direction was by Alejandro Amenábar.It tells the story of Grace, a devoutly religious mother of two ailing children who has moved with her family to a mansion on the English coast while awaiting her husband's return from World War II, though he has been declared missing. Their children, Anne and Nicholas, both suffer from a rare photosensitive disease that renders them extremely vulnerable to sunlight, prompting Grace's rule of having only one door open in the house at a time. When Anne begins claiming to see ghosts, Grace at first believes her newly arrived family of eccentric servants to be responsible, but chilling events and visions soon lead her to believe that something supernatural is indeed going on.The Others is another type of horror film with an unbelievable twist.It was engaging and absorbing from beginning to end.Also,it is definitely far from being clichéd and formulaic as the viewer may find oneself completely astounded and fascinated at the last scenes of the film.Aside from its unbelievable twist,one cannot help about the music,screenplay and direction by Amenábar as well as the brilliant performances of the cast especially by Kidman.Overall,it is one-of-a-kind horror film that clearly exhibits Amenábar's genius in film-making.",The Others

With her husband still missing in action during WWII, Grace and the children reside in a remote mansion on the isle of Jersey. When one day a trio of house servants turn up looking to fill the vacancies at the mansion, it coincides with strange supernatural occurrences around the home. Are the children being mischievous? Is Grace losing her mind? Or is there indeed something not of this world at work?The haunted house creeper has had a number of film version tellings over the years. A different kind of horror film, it's a sub-genre that relies on suggestion and atmospheric shocks instead of rampant blood letting. The Others is one of the finest of its type, a wonderfully crafted chiller that thrives on old fashioned values to deliver its scares. The set up is standard formula stuff, a big gloomy mansion that's nice and remote with rolling gardens and finds itself often cloaked by impenetrable fog. A couple of cherubic kids, classically inviting creepy activity, and servants that have foreboding written all over their respective foreheads. Throw into the pot the lonely female trying to hold her self together as things threaten to unhinge the family bond, and it's so far so formulaic. But Amenábar, for his English language debut, has a great sense of mood and pacing, slowly unwinding the coil to reveal a sense of impending doom, playing it out amongst eerie sounds and deft camera movements about the house. That the kiddies have a light sensitive problem gives Amenábar the perfect excuse to keep the whole thing dimly lit: to great eerie effect.With unease in place and the small band of characters firmly established, the other key element of the film starts to kick in, namely the mystery element. Just what exactly is going on here? The children, excellently played by débutantes Mann & Bentley, garner much sympathy, but at the same time we suspect they might be at fault for the ghostly activity. The servants are led by the officious looking, but gently spoken, Bertha Mills (Flanagan superb), you sense something isn't quite right but all cards are played close to the chest so as to not reveal anything. So much so that when the reveal does come, it's a doozy, firmly rounding out The Others as a classic of its type. The trump card here, tho, is Kidman. Pale faced and cold to the eye, she nails the plummy English accent whilst turning in a classic performance of a repressed woman battling against-it seems-everything and everyone. Following in the footsteps of Deborah Kerr and Julie Harris, Kidman's ability to make Grace's mental disintegration believable marks it out as one of the best horror sub-genre performances ever.Suspense, scares and some tricks up its sleeve, The Others is every inch a quality bit of psychological horror. 9/10",The Others
20,Theo Robertson,Rather Effective,7,13 January 2005,"I watched THE OTHERS simply because Christopher Eccleston in it , a future DOCTOR WHO in a scary movie , now this I've got to see , but to be honest Eccleston's role is little more than cameo while the always consistent Nicole Kidman isn't the real star of the movie - It's writer/director Alejandro Amenabar From the opening shots where the servants arrive at Grace Stewart's house I had the story pegged as to where it was going . Grace is an absolute nutter isn't she ? But then the story twists and turns a little and then I thought she might be a victim , I mean these servants ... But the story keeps twisting along nicely so that the script is one step ahead of the audience . There is a slight problem though if you're familiar to Amenabar's work , especially ABRE LOS OJOS and that is that he's a master of the shock twist ending and I thought with the appearance of Eccleston's Charles Stewart half way through the movie I had the story sussed . I actually did work out how he fitted into the story and was correct in guessing his fate but I never believed in what the twist ending was so well done Senor Amenabar There is a problem with this type of story and THE OTHERS is no different in that respect - You can only enjoy the movie once since you know the shock twist at the end when you see it a second , third , fourth time and there's another very successful film ( No clues but you'll know the one I'm talking about after you see this ) that has the same idea which means comparison's are inevitable , but it's difficult to compare to one another . Certainly THE OTHERS has a more creepy atmosphere and probably a better pace and cast with special mention going to Alakina Mann as Anna who plays her role as a totally convincing horrid brat , nice to know Amenabar has resisted the temptation to portray the children as sugery sweet little cherubs which is often the case in Hollywood movies , you might not believe this but THE OTHERS in fact is a Spanish film",The Others
21,preppy-3,Well-done but heavy-handed and very depressing,7,21 August 2001,"1945 Jersey. A woman (Nicole Kidman--who's excellent) keeps her two children barricaded in their big, gloomy, fog-shrouded house. It seems if the children are exposed to sunlight it will kill them. Then three mysterious servants show up to help...or are they? Strange noises are heard and the little girl starts seeing ghosts. What's going on?The movie is VERY dark, very creepy and very quiet...and that's the problem. It's too much. There's a constant air of dread and danger and it really wore me down. Also the film moves at a (purposefully) slow pace--too slow for me. It's all well-done and there are a few scenes guaranteed to make you jump (or scream) but it was too depressing. But there is a nice twist at the ending that I didn't see coming. So, it's somewhat worth seeing--just very slow-moving.",The Others
22,LeonLouisRicci,Solid Piece With An Antiquated Style,7,11 November 2012,"An old fashioned haunted house/ghost story done with a cast delivering perfection. It is the performances from all involved that captivate this story. The atmosphere is appropriately apprehensive and the pacing is solid. It is unfashionably stoic and is probably somewhat understated for some, but if you don't mind subtle surroundings and low key development this can be a mesmerizing movie with a probable ending.It is rather downbeat and somber with not much to cheer about but has enough surprises getting to the grounding of it all that can be spooky enough if simplistic in its tone.

23,poolandrews,Good but not quite as good as many make out.,7,13 August 2006,"The Others is set on 'Jersey, The Channel Islands 1945' where Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives in a large mansion with her two young children Anne (Alakina Mann) & Nicholas (James Bentley) who suffer from an incredibly rare disease in which exposure to bright light could kill them. Three friends, the elderly Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) & a young mute girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) turn up at Grace's home looking for work as servants & luckily for them the previous servants left a week ago. Grace gives them all jobs & tells them their duties. Grace warns them that her daughter Anne is prone to telling lies & making stories up & it's not long before she is telling Bertha about other people in the house although at first there is no evidence that there are, however as children's crying is heard, strange noises emanate from empty rooms & doors open & close by themselves it appears that Anne may be telling the truth...This Spanish, American & French co-production was written & directed by Chilean-born, Spanish based Alejandro Amenabar who also composed the music & I liked it, I didn't think it was amazing & I have one or two reservations about it but overall I thought it was an effective little ghost film. The script is pretty slow going even at the best of times & tries to return to the days where horror relied on good storytelling instead of relying on special effects, violence & bad language. It moves along at a sedate pace but the character's are decent & it's sort of involving, it manages to draw the viewer in quite well & all the careful build up helps the effective twist ending. A lot has been said about the twist & I for one think it works extremely well although there simply is no denying that it's more or less exactly the same as The Sixth Sense (1999) which was made at least two years prior to The Others. I'm in two minds over The Others, I liked it for what it was but it was slow going & sometimes I found it hard to maintain my interest in it & the effectiveness of the entire film depends upon it's ending which is great if you haven't seen The Sixth Sense but if you have I'd imagine you'd feel a little de ja vu & not be too impressed. There are a few holes in the plot & logic but nothing too detrimental.Director Amenabar does a fantastic job of giving the film a creepy look & atmosphere, the colours & the the use of light & shadow are excellent. There are some nice shots & some eerie scenes although on the negative side it's a bit lifeless & bland at times. The 40's period setting suits the film perfectly & it's superbly realised throughout. There's no gore or violence & I can't remember any rubbish CGI computer effects (yeah!).With a supposed budget of about $17,000,000 The Others is well made & has nice period production design, it shows that a lot of time went into the look of the film. While watching The Others I realised that because of the types of films that I like (horror, exploitation, low budget, sci-fi, etc.) I haven't actually seen a Nicole Kidman film before now. I was impressed & I thought she was great, she's very pretty & very good in this. Her ex Tom Cruise was an executive producer on The Others, presumably before they split. Everyone else does a fine job including ex Doctor Who (2005) Christopher Eccleston.The Others is a good solid ghost story that I found watchable & effective, unfortunately it's a bit on the slow side & the ending really isn't as original or groundbreaking as it could have been although it's still highly effective. Well worth a watch but I doubt many would want to see it more than once so perhaps wait for it to turn up on TV or cable.",The Others

26,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Brilliant, and almost sublime... a masterful work within the genre of psychological horror-thriller",8,6 July 2006,"As I write this moments after the second viewing of the film, I can say without a doubt that this is one of those rare films that benefit greatly from being watched more than once by any viewer. Having been very interested in the work of director/writer/composer Alejandro Amenábar basically since I first knew of Abre Los Ojos, after watching the Americanized remake with Cameron Crowe at the helm(and much, much more upon actually watching some of his work), I made sure to watch this as soon as I could. I remember being gripped and never really looking away... and astoundingly, I had much the same reaction this time, as well. This time, I noticed all the little hints along the way... all leading towards the shocking and intelligent twist. Anyone who hasn't seen this, I urge you to avoid hearing what it is, and make sure not to read neither the quotes nor the keywords for the film. And yes, it is somewhat similar to another popular movie(which I haven't and don't intend to see), but a movie doesn't have to be 100% original to be excellent. The plot is incredibly well-written, and it develops exactly as it should. The pacing is perfect. You're never bored and the film never hurries to get where it's going. The acting is flawless, quite simply. As far as Kidman and the other adults go, this is no major surprise, but the children... they are quite simply among a far too small group of extraordinarily talented young actors. The cinematography is breathtaking. The editing is masterful. Something that simply must be mentioned is the lighting... the way it almost becomes a character itself, the way it affects everything else, the way it is played with throughout the film. Explaining the lighting as well as the general isolation is the fact that the two children suffer from a tragic illness... they cannot survive sunlight. What is amazing that throughout the course of the film, you get used to this... the darkness, the thick atmosphere; it becomes every-day life. Near the end, you find yourself fearing the sun... the bright light. Featuring no real gore, blood or violence, the horror is all psychological. The atmosphere and the light(or lack thereof) creates a lot of tension and suspense... and all of it pays off so well. There are no false scares, nothing gratuitous and the whole film is very close to being sublime. Now, to the real problem with this film, at least my problem with it... it's simply not as open as the other works of Alejandro. It's more Hollywood, easier to take in. Instead of challenging you to think, of providing food for thought, questions as opposed to answers(as Amenábar himself has commented that his films are about)... it reveals everything at the end. It leaves little, if anything, up to the viewer to decide or debate. All is explained... the very thing that ruined what potential the remake of his film, Abre Los Ojos. I understand trying to open up to a wider audience, but it's a little sad that he has to make a compromise with his integrity and goals in doing so. With that said, however, this is still not the average Hollywood flick; there is still nothing in the film that is entirely superfluous, and almost every frame of it is perfection, pure and simple. I recommend this to any fan of Alejandro Amenábar, any of the actors and psychological horror/mystery-thrillers. 8/10",The Others

Your filmography consists of all foreign films save this one, so give us more.This movie was spectacular and I'll tell you why. After the mega successful movie ""The Sixth Sense"" was done, no way would you figure a movie regarding ghosts and a plot twist would be done. Or, if someone was as bold as to make a movie along the lines of ""The Sixth Sense"", then you would not figure it to be nearly as good. In steps ""The Others"" with a very similar story and plot twist, but oh so wonderfully different and uniquely brilliant. This movie didn't hardly get the accolades it deserves, but I am here to sing its praises. This movie was eerie, spooky, and suspenseful. Nicole Kidman, albeit not my favorite actress, did an excellent job. What made the movie even more amazing was the complete misdirection. I honestly thought the movie was headed towards a final showdown with a confrontation between humans and ghosts and the subsequent exorcism of those ghosts.

It boasts an impressive twist ending of its own, which I maybe should have seen coming but didn't. But it also knows that a twist ending is only as good as the movie around it, and it's used to enhance the film's story, not as a crutch.Nicole Kidman gives a terrific performance, one of two that got her attention in 2001 (the other being ""Moulin Rouge!"").Grade: A",The Others

Nicole Kidman plays a mother whose two children are allergic to sunlight to the point where drapes are drawn at all times. She brings them up on strict Biblical teachings and hires three servants to work in the house. Two of them are elderly while the other is mute. Suddenly strange things are happening that has Kidman questioning the behaviour of her children. Intriguing with numerous twists but a climax that leaves more questions than answers. Director Alejandro Amenabar sets up suspense with a fine technique that involves lighting and shadows. Kidman holds strong as a mother questioning everything around her and set on protecting her children. Unfortunately she carries the film by herself because supporting roles aren't so lucky. Fionnula Flanagan and Elaine Cassidy plays two of the house keepers. Cassidy in particular is the mute. Christopher Eccleston plays Kidman's deceased husband who decides that appearing as a spirit is the best way to reunite. Yeah, right. Perhaps he should have fired her a written message first.

One of the biggest issues is that nothing at all happens in here, with being just so slow and plodding that the scares hardly happen. Since nearly all the early scares or confrontations are off-camera with us coming upon their reactions or hearing about what happened, leaving this one to completely gloss over the potential main selling point by not showing anything to be afraid of and only telling us. This is compounded by all the times she keeps spouting off about their fates in Purgatory and such for failing to listen to her, her insistence on teaching and interpreting the Bible and all of the religious nonsense that permeates the film, as well as the rather ridiculous plot-point about the father coming home, which is dismissed quite suddenly and eats up several minutes of screen time going nowhere at all. Beyond the plot problems, the last act twist is just utterly confusing and makes no sense, rendering much of the film up until that point quite contradictory to what's been established and doesn't really serve a point at all. All of these issues aren't enough to save it from some rather nice points here, mainly a fine, suitably creepy Gothic mansion that serves as the perfect point for this effort, there's some generally freaky moments with the children's reactions to different events around the house and then there's the first revelation about the different workers' true past which prompts some fine action scenes for the first time and gets some chilling scenes involved.

Since these three have entered the home, strange events occur, and Grace begins to wonder if it's her sanity getting the better of her, or if there is something more sinister in the house with them.....Yes, we all know its so much more than just another haunted house movie, it's about segregation, coming to terms with losing someone so young, and coping with massive, life changing events, but at the end of the day, it's still blooming scary.Kidman is wonderful as Grace, and really holds the film, keeping the drama upfront, and the haunted house element as more of a subplot. Her relationship with her children is beautiful, yet also a little sinister.The children's illness adds a wonderful depth to the narrative, thus making the viewer at more unease than they should be.Halfway through the film, there is a bizarre appearance from Ecclestone, as some sort of lost soul, but it doesn't really make sense until you've seen the ending.And the ending is pretty cool, and like The Sixth Sense, it will change the way you see this film in the future, and make you feel smug when you are watching it with someone who hasn't seen it before.Good stuff, and Eric Sykes has never been scarier.",The Others
34,Aaron1375,Not really much horror or mystery in this one.,6,1 August 2009,"It entertained for the most part, granted it was rather easy to figure out the twist to this one. That may have more to do with the movie ""The Sixth Sense"", because thanks to that movie one tends to be looking for a possible twist especially when reviews talk about the shocking ending or what not. This movie has a lady and her two children living in a very big house where one day a group of three mysterious strangers comes and offers their services. Well the mother accepts and so starts the spooky going ons and such that accompany all such films as these. For the most part they are minor stuff here and there. Apparently the daughter suffers from some disease and must stay out of the sunlight, yet the shades set up keep coming down. There are other strange happenings and a strange visit by the father who for some reason comes and goes in very strange and mysterious fashion. Then there are scenes where the girl is seemingly possessed which are quite nice. Still the movie was somewhat disappointing, it is one of those horror/suspense films that is a bit to talky for my tastes and one of the films to start the current trend of PG-13 rated horror films. It also has Nicole Kidman in the lead and I have never been a big fan of hers, as she was one of the worst lead actresses in a Batman movie besides nearly everyone involved in part four. However, I will say this is one of the better roles I have seen her in.

After three people arrive seeking employment, they increasingly become convinced that the abode is haunted.While this is a fantasy movie in that it depicts supernatural happenings, like doors mysteriously opening and closing, these types of unexplainable things have been known to happen. The movie is a serious exploration of what may really be occurring. The mansion seems sterile and there's a one-dimensional pale 'look' to the bulk of the picture, which was intentional for obvious reasons.

36,zetes,A good way to spend an evening. 7/10,7,10 August 2001,"SPOILERSThis has potential to be as big a hit as The Sixth Sense on account of its nature - it is clearly trying to copy its success and its formula (not to mention its release date - I think they both opened in the exact same week, two years apart). It is nowhere as good as that film, but, if you did like that, you're going to probably like this. I doubt anyone will like this one better, though.Technically, the film is superb. In this aspect, it probably surpasses The Sixth Sense. The editing and especially the cinematography are often breathtaking. The acting is decent. I don't particularly care for Nicole Kidman - she harmed Eyes Wide Shut significantly, in my opinion, but her bizarre style of acting worked fabulously in the purposely campy Moulin Rouge. Here, as a constantly paranoid, possessive, and protective mother, she is more than adequate, though not deserving of any award or special hurrah. The three servants are well played by Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes, and Elaine Cassidy - they have a certain air about them. The best performances come from the two children (another echo of The Sixth Sense, although the adults in that one were also marvelous) - James Bentley as the perpetually frightened Nicholas and Alakina Mann as the intelligent Anne. Mann is in fact wonderful and I hope to see her in other films in the future. There are just a few actors after these principals, and I commend the filmmakers very much. This saves a ton of money, and makes the film more intimate and frightening, which is exactly what this film calls for.Like always, almost all of the film's problems exist in the script. The screenwriter (who is also the director) realizes that his savvy audience will guess that this is a descendent of the immensely popular The Sixth Sense, so he is always attempting to trick us. What are these strange servants up to? A few times, we experience the narrative from their point of view, and what they say drives us wild with guessing. And what is wrong with the father, who had disappeared in WWII (this is set in the 1940s) and then mysteriously reappears in a frightening fog? We know that there are surprises, and these tricks work to confuse us and lead us away - good old McGuffins. I guessed right away, correctly, the father's situation, which kept me from seeing the forest for the trees. What the script forgets to do, or at least forgets to do well, is develop the characters. The children are well developed, but Amenabar relies too much on the inherent creepiness of the three servants for their effect - they almost become silly by the end; anyway, there were several moments when I laughed at their actions, although it might have been intentional. Grace (Nicole Kidman) is Amenabar's biggest failure. Her main character trait is a severe neurosis - her husband has been lost in battle and she has been left alone in an enormous mansion with only her two children. Those children have a severe light sensitivity - they break out in hives when they come into contact with light (no, they aren't Gremlins or magwies). For most of the film, Kidman's character is built up, but the revelations at the end don't ring true. One of the reasons that the ending of The Sixth Sense worked so well was because the final revelations revealed a lot of hidden facets about the characters and their actions in the events which happened beforehand. The revelations here, while very unexpected and clever, don't exactly follow what Amenabar was building.Amenabar also has a problem with suspense. He gives himself all these little peculiarities to deal with - the kids are allergic to light, for instance. But he never really uses that to create suspense. One morning, the children wake up to find that all the curtains in the house have been stolen. It would have been better, perhaps, if we were allowed to watch the curtains being slowly removed at night. The suspense nearer the beginning, when we don't know very much, is quite good. The first set piece is excellent. A lot of the other scary scenes are also quite good, including the climactic one, where the secrets are finally revealed. Still, the film uses too many stingers (sharp rises in the music). That may make us jump, but for a dishonest reason.",The Others

41,JamesHitchcock,A Ghost Story of the Old School,7,2 February 2005,"Ever since the success of The Exorcist and similar films in the seventies, serious horror films (as opposed to the tongue-in-cheek variety) have normally been overstated. By this I mean that such films have been dominated by special effects, with plenty of blood and gore and everything shown explicitly. Before that, however,there was a tradition of making more subtle, understated horror films, where the horror is implied rather than shown directly. Examples that come to mind are The Spiral Staircase and the original versions of Cat People and The Haunting.Although it is a recent film, The Others falls within this earlier tradition. It is set on Jersey in 1945, shortly after the liberation of the island from Nazi occupation. Grace Stewart lives in an old manor house with her young son and daughter. The two children suffer from a rare allergy to sunlight, which means that they cannot go outside but must stay indoors in darkened rooms. Grace's husband, who was fighting with the British Army, is missing, presumed killed. The children begin to believe that the house is haunted by the ghosts of an old woman, a married couple and a boy named Victor. At first Grace does not believe them; she is a devout and strict Roman Catholic, who dismisses belief in ghosts as superstitious. The strain of living in such a lonely, gloomy house and her worries about her missing husband and her children's health, however, are beginning to tell on Grace's mind. The strange behaviour of the three servants she has engaged is another source of worry for her, and she starts to wonder whether there might be something behind the children's stories.The film ends with a sudden, shocking twist (which I will not reveal). I have read in other comments on this board, and elsewhere, that the twist is an obvious one which anyone can see coming. I suppose that it might be obvious to real horror film buffs; all I can say is that it certainly took me by surprise. Too often a surprise ending merely serves to show off the scriptwriter's cleverness, without any thought being give to the film's internal coherence, but in the case of The Others, although the twist was unexpected, I found the film had a satisfying ending that made sense in the context of what had gone before.Establishing a suitably eerie atmosphere is an important factor in the success of a horror film, and The Others is extremely atmospheric. The film was shot in a rambling old house (actually in Spain, although it looks very English). For most of the time we see the house shrouded in dense mist. The children's rare illness, as well as being relevant to the plot, also serves as a device which enables the director to ensure that most of the interior scenes, even daytime ones, are suitably gloomy. Light only enters the house at the end, when the mysterious housekeeper opens the blinds against Grace's strict instructions. This development leads straight into the surprise denouement; the physical light of day and the metaphorical light of truth enter the house at the same time.There are some effective performances, especially from Nicole Kidman as Grace. Grace, who starts off as a strict, authoritarian parent and gradually becomes more and more disturbed, is portrayed as that very dangerous type of individual, the control freak who is losing control. There are a number of holes in the plot; it is never, for example, explained how Grace's husband managed to escape from the German-ruled island to join the British forces. The sudden reappearance of the husband halfway through does not really add much to the film. Overall, however, I found this an impressive and genuinely frightening ghost story; proof that, even in the twenty-first century, one can still make an effective horror film without resorting to explicit violence or stomach-churning special effects. 7/10",The Others

46,OllieSuave-007,Not your typical ghost movie.,7,12 March 2014,"This is not your typical ghost movie, where Nicole Kidman stars as Grace Stewart, who retires with her two children to a mansion towards the end of the Second World War. Her children are photo and sunlight sensitive and she hires three servants to care for them and the house; however, strange things start to happen shortly afterward and Grace believes her house is haunted.Filmed in the Channel Islands, Spain, England and New York, this movie captures the brilliance and beauty of each place and the subtle aftermath of post-WWII. Alejandro Amenábar wrote and directed the movie, providing us with an eerie story full of mystery that will have you guessing where the plot turns and have you surprised at its unpredictability. Just the Mrs. Bertha Mills character, played by Fionnula Flanagan (who always look strange and mysterious to begin with), provides enough uncertainty and chills to the story, enhancing the overall suspense. However, there are some parts where the plot lines do not quite intertwine, which may confuse the audience, and is notorious in American ghost/horror movies.Kidman did a fabulous job in her role, nonetheless, providing enough drama to captivate the audience. It's a film full of surprises, which deviates it from many other ghost/horror movies with predictable plots.Grade B-",The Others

It was a pretty routine ghost story in many ways (except for the predictable plot twist that I won't describe because trying to figure it out might be the only thing that would make this worthwhile for some folks) which means that since the genre has been done to death (no pun intended) it wasn't particularly frightening, unless strange noises from upstairs, and piano playing when no one's at the piano and doors slamming into Nicole Kidman's face frighten you.Ho hum is the best way to describe this effort, which (I'm feeling generous) I'll give a 4/10.",The Others

49,lost-in-limbo,Accommodating the afterlife.,8,10 April 2006,"Set in England after WW2, Grace and her two children, Anne and Nicholas live in a rather isolated mansion waiting for their husband/father to return from the war, but I they haven't heard from him since leaving. To make matters even more worst their housekeepers have just got up and left without any notice and the kids suffer from an illness were sunlight could cause them to badly, blister up. But suddenly three mysterious servants show up to work there and that's when strange occurrences start happening with the kids claiming that they're not alone in the house, but the uneasy Grace doesn't want to hear about it, that's until she becomes aware of the strange forces at work.The sudden interest in subtle, supernatural horror flicks can be attributed a lot to M. Night Shyamalan's film; 'The Sixth Sense (1999)'. This is my second viewing of it and I might be going against the grain, but I say this film is more emotionally engaging with such penetrating atmosphere and flawless performances compared with M. Night's mixed bag. 'The Others' is an intelligently stylish, sophisticated slow burner that plays on the little things to work up the increasing intensity that slowly strangles you with its grinding atmospheric air. Director Alejandro Amenabar manages to create a rich atmosphere from the shadowy grand exterior of the house to the blanket of mist that smothers the lush surroundings of the estate. But what impressed me most was the confident and sensitively in depth performances he got out of the small cast. Nicole Kidman raises the bar with an extraordinary performance as the rigidly, fearful mother. The two kids Alakina Mann and James Bentley are convincingly good. Then you got remarkable supporting roles from Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy. Christopher Eccleston makes a small appearance too. The story sticks close to the traditional, Gothic haunted house tale with the usual set-up with dead silence making way for sudden noises, poorly lit rooms, things going bump, fake scares and so on. But what made these things such a breath of fresh air is how director Amenabar had total control of his vision with precise timing to milk out its bold, suggestive thrills, which will totally put you on the edge just like that of Kidman's brittle character. The atmosphere ventures into a dreamlike realm but still keeping a steady foot in reality. While, in the imposing Gothic mansion the darkness fills every space with it creaking with isolation and tightly knitted quarters. These striking visuals and set-pieces are gorgeously shot with such skill and a good eye for detail. A powerfully streamlined score is generally enchantingly and when it strives for creepy scares it does so in an exhaustingly tense tone. The elegant plot illustrates an very intriguing mystery tale that's psychologically demanding with secrets crossing your path and many cryptic hints to what may happen. The film's major revelation might not be a huge surprise for some, but I for one didn't think it was that easy to pick up on.A chillingly subtle, but astoundingly effective suspense drama that pushes you to the brink with assured direction and very first-rate performances.",The Others
50,ElMaruecan82,"""They're here"" ... and so are they ...",9,26 February 2012,"In a nutshell, Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others"" is a gripping and emotionally powerful horror film, respecting our intelligence enough not to overuse graphic elements and to make the perfect dosage between thrills and mystery. And the mystery surrounding the characters is so absorbing that it immediately plunges us into such an unnerving and harrowing atmosphere that at the end of the film, whether we found relief or our hearts were still pounding, we know we'd just have lived an extraordinary experience.""The Others"" is set in a large mansion inhabited by a young mother, Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart and her two children, Anne and Nicholas. The film opens when she receives three applicants for house jobs, an elderly tacit grounds-keeper named Mr Turkle, a deaf and dumb adolescent, and the lady who seems to lead the group, Bertha Mills, played, in a remarkable performance, by Fionula Fllanigan. Mrs Mills is the kind of character that immediately strikes the viewer as very competent in her job while the eventuality of her vileness is better conveyed by the peculiarity of her workmates. what's more, Mrs Mills' personality, very calm and professional, efficiently contrasts with Grace's more natural behavior as a loving and caring mother, trying to hide her excitability behind a mask of aristocratic-like composure.It's hard to figure the period of the film until Grace mentions that her husband is fighting in Europe: it's WWII, the film is set in a mysterious foggy island in Britain, and we ought to believe her. Now, why would the mother of two kids endure such a spooky location? the answer is immediately given, setting at the same time, the tone of the film. Her two kids suffer an extremely rare syndrome, they are photosensitive, which means they can't be exposed to sunlight without being victims of irremediable symptoms. Therefore the mansion's activity is driven by a special but indispensable routine implying to close all the doors with a key, whenever someone gets in or out. This information is vital, and plays as an interesting display of smart writing in the way it distracts us from many precocious interrogations, such as why are all the three servants dressed in a very old-fashion way.I mentioned in the early paragraph the atmosphere of the film and, no pun intended, it's indeed the key element that drives the film. The atmosphere is so intense that we don't need to be scared, because we constantly keep our guard up, it's the kind of situations so calm we know something will happen. Yet everything remains desperately quiet, and as the movie progresses, all we have are little doses of thrills, through apparitions, voices, screams, encounters with mysterious presences, and the macabre discovery of photographs showing dead people, but no death, no gore, no fights. The secret of ""The Others"" is to works as an efficient set-up whose sensational impact would ineivtably rely on the climax, so all we have to do is to be patient, and collect all the hints in order to know what to expect and this is what communicates the thrilling effect of the filmThe atmosphere is carried by a shadowy external photography and a powerful cinematography whose use of lights transforms the vastness of a mansion into a sum of little closed places, conveying the disturbing feeling of a suffocating paranoia. The house is so big yet feels so small while the mysterious and haunting presence of 'strangers' make the whole setting totally unsettling. And the force of the film is within the story as it features characters who are apparently forced to live in this mansion for vital reasons, and the satisfying resolution would either be a way to chase the others, or to be chased, but we all know the confrontation is inevitable. ""The Others""' suspense works on a Hitchcockian level, even more effective because we really don't know what to expect, and take it from someone who saw it each time with different persons, no one ever guesses the ending, and neither did I.But it would be unfair and untrue to imply that ""The Others"" only works thanks to the ending, the narrative evolves around an emotional core within the story of a mother who tries to protect her two children. And the conflict in ""The Others"" is not just between two different kinds of presences in a same house, but the psychological consequence through the torment invading the heart of a woman, torn between her maternal instinct and a terrible secret belonging to the past and profoundly affecting the present. Nicole Kidman magnificently embodies the vulnerability of a woman left alone and totally alienated by too much responsibility. And Mrs Mills represents the perfect counterpart to Grace's hellish condition and while she gets closer to Anne, and Grace's behavior becomes more suspicious, the notion of vileness goes back and forth and we wait until the moment it will finally determine who the real antagonist is  if there ever is one.All in all, it's hard to know who is the straight person of this series of incidents when emotions are so powerfully engaged. ""The Others"" is a remarkable chronicle of a dramatic family story involving a woman and two kids, one strong-minded and free-spirited little girl and her poignantly coward little brother. The two kids, beautifully portrayed, mirror the same contrasts between Mrs Mills and Grace Stewart and what's more, their condition plays like the metaphor of Grace's symbolic sensitivity to an even blinding and painful light. Needless to say that the ending doesn't disappoint and elevates the films to one of the greatest horror mystery thrillers of the last 20 years, working in every single level.So beware of the light, whether it's of a blinding sunshine or a terrible secret",The Others
51,paul2001sw-1,"Works hard, but worth it in the end",8,2 April 2006,"Alejandro Amenabar's film 'The Others' is in some senses a straightforward copy of 'The Sixth Sense' (with a nod to 'The Shining' added in for good measure). We are introduced to characters who bear witness to ghosts but whose own life is strangely disconnected from the world around them: the punchline is that they themselves are among the dead, only they have not yet acknowledged it. The formal structure of this revelation is more satisfying in 'The Others', it's still well signposted but there's a symmetry in the relationship between the ghosts and the living that is shocking and pleasing at the same time. The film also lacks the pompousness of M. Night Shyalaman's film, and works as a genuinely creepy horror movie despite almost the complete absence of special effects. What doesn't quite work is Nicole Kidman's central character, the woman who is dead but doesn't know it: her behaviour when she (and we) believe she is still living is apparently so batty that it's hard to relate to the story; while the eventual role reversal is handled with great skill, the earlier form of the tale (an apparently conventional ghost story) works far less well (for reasons that we eventually understand when the tables are turned). In consequence, I would say this is a genuinely spine-tingling movie with a great ending; but not a great movie overall, one that seems less silly in retrospect than it does when you're actually watching it. Both it and 'The Sixth Sense' demonstrate that this sort of trickery can work if handled with sufficient skill, but neither film completely succeeds in hiding the forcing of the plot needed to make it happen.",The Others
52,MOscarbradley,A ghost story guaranteed to scare the pants off you,9,8 March 2008,"A great ghost story; genuinely scary, particularly if you are seeing it for the first time. It's a haunted house movie and the less you know about it the better. It's also something of a chamber piece. It has a small, compact cast and only once does it leave the house or its grounds, (and then only for a chilly walk in the foggy woods). Nicole Kidman is the mother protective of her children to the point where we wonder about her sanity and she's magnificent. It's the best thing she's done so far, (leaving her Oscar-winning turn in ""The Hours"" in the shade). Fionnula Flanagan is the matronly Irish servant who arrives at her door looking for work with a mute Elaine Cassidy and gardener Eric Sykes in tow.The young Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar both wrote and directed the film with great skill as well as composing the haunting score. He also gets great performances from the children. Indeed, this is the kind of movie that will appeal to children while scaring the pants off them.

It's at times a slower piece and the horror generally comes from quiet bumps in the night, so if you're expecting jump-scares or overt gore you're likely to be disappointed, but thanks to a keen focus on character and narrative technique you're always invested right up until the breath-taking climax that I'd peg as perhaps one of the best endings in any horror picture ever made.

The Others is the definition of a slow burn and although it never technically pays off all that it sets up, it's certainly a well made horror-thriller. I typically look for an atmospheric or psychological take on horror stories, and The Others is one that relies more heavily on those two things than it does jump scare or creepy imagery. But there's still a fair share of those as well. Powered by a strong performance by Nicole Kidman, as a protective single mother who attempts to hide her family from the threatening outside world.

And not only is it Spanish, but it's also the only film that has ever won the award for the best Spanish film, without having a word in Spanish. Although the original script was written in Spanish, it was translated into English, it stars an Australian woman playing an English woman, it's backed by Americans and the story is placed in Jersey, but it is filmed in Spain and directed by Spaniard. IMDb classifies him as a horror/mystery/thriller, but even though the story itself is a mystery and perhaps somewhat a thriller, and the film has an atmosphere that balances on the verge of horror, in my opinion, essentially, this is primarily a strong psychological drama. Nicole Kidman once again proves her acting size and steals every scene in which she appears, but the rest of the team are not to be underestimated, especially eleven-year-old Alakina Mann. One of the strongest features of this film should be the surprise brought by the final plot twist, but since I saw it several times, I knew what would happen, and I really can not remember whether I predicted this twist or not when I first watched it, almost two decades ago, and if I did, in which part of the film it happened, and therefore I can not comment on its effectiveness.

58,ironhorse_iv,This supernatural gothic horror film is otherworldly indeed. It's one very creepy movie.,8,6 November 2019,"Set on the British Island of Jersey in the immediate aftermath of WWII, the film written & directed by Alejandro Amenábar follows the story of housewife/mother Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), being haunted by spirits wanting them to leave. Without spoiling the movie too much, for a film rated PG-13 and not a drop of blood or graphic gore in it. It's scary! It works because how well made the motion picture was. All the camera shots portray the dark picturesque decaying creepy astrosphere with melodramatic psychology fear to a tee. For example the opening title shots with the hand drawn drawing of a house fading into an actual home through an excellent use of transition made it seem like a ghost story was coming to light. While the overall atmosphere of clichés fog and haze does go overboard at times in the film; it does set a mysterious mood to the settlings. Adding to this, the voyeuristic wide shot taken from outside looking in the house through the pane of glass are very powerful. It shows the isolation of the trapped characters to the point that it's very effecting unsettling. I also like how most of the film takes place within dark rooms and dim hallways with flames of candles in lanterns as the only source of light due to the children's photosensitivity sickness. It create a more shadowy feel to the film, creating disoriented and uneasy psychological state within the viewers on what they're seeing and not seeing. A good example of this is the puppet scene. However some of the significant use of mirrors and reflections shots throughout the film don't really go anywhere. You would think it would play both more conscious and subconscious in the character's mind, but its themes are avert for the most part. As for sound. The disembodied voices, strange noises and intense musical music can lead the viewers to believe that something frightening is about to happen, yet, most of the big scares come at the moment where it's quite quiet with not much going on the screen. The film cleverly tricks your senses. Thus making scenes like the piano room jolts hardly predictable. I glad that the movie doesn't really indulge on too many in your face jump scares. The old school approach of not showing much is ambiguous. It's the fear of the unknown that really scare people. As for pacing. The film works best as a slow burn thriller with its runtime. While this might cause some parts of the movie to seem boring with certain amount of static shots, little action & heavy exposition dumps. In the end it does works to build up the tension to the climatic 1999 film 'Six Sense' gotcha type twist ending. Because of that, the movie has a lot of repeat value as there is plenty of clever hints and Easter eggs that lead to that the revelation of the terrible secret besides the gravesites and the oddly out of place post mortem photograph album with the servants like Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan). Some examples are the way Grace first picks up the rifle. She's seen looking at the item as it was déjà vu. Another is her frequently complaining about migraines. Even her children peculiarly heavy breathing foreshadows the end. To add onto that, Grace's religious fundamentalism makes a lot of sense when you consider that she interpreted her and her children allegedly continuing to survive after the war as a miracle of God. No wonder why she got super religionist and try to 'live' up to her given name to the point that she berates Anne for questioning what she's been taught by her, and uses biblical stories like limbo to frighten and manipulate her daughter. Kidman was very convincing as the prudish, over-bearing mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world. While her character can be a bit cold & unlikeable. There were some lovely heartfelt motherly love scenes between Grace's psychotic episodes for us not to turn off the movie. As for the children. The acting is a mixed bag. The girl that play Anne was pretty decent in the role, however, I felt that the kid playing Nicholas was below average in certain parts. It didn't help that the lines coming from them felt a little too posh and thick for my taste. They didn't sound like real kids from that era. More like children of pre-WW1. As for the supporting cast. It was alright for the most part, but if the film has any big fault. I really didn't find Christopher Eccleston's role as Charlie that appealing. I felt that his premise didn't really add much to the plot. Plus his character return didn't make much sense with the story that they were telling; much in the same way, a bunch of photographs of corpses posing for portraits can end up in a storing room in a house or a living person can possessed a dead person. Nevertheless, I do dig the some of the audience member's interpretation on the reasons about Grace's pariah state. It really does seem like she might had collaborated with the enemy during the war. Certain scenes points to that being the cause of her madness. No wonder why she didn't want her children to stray too far from Christ. Although, Grace has a strong connect with the lord. The film does takes direct ideological aim at Christian theology. Undermines faith and biblical doctrine calling them dangerous fabrications to the point that some people might find the movie blasphemous. Amenábar really didn't like Catholic school. Regardless of that, overall while this morbidly fascinating movie is probably not going to lift your spirits with its depressing ending & make your love life with your significant other better. It's still otherwise, a very good movie worth checking out. One far from being dead.",The Others

63,didi-5,Intriguing ghost story,8,12 January 2005,"This movie, starring Nicole Kidman as Grace, a deeply religious mother with two photosensitive children (Alakina Mann as Anne, James Bentley as Nicholas), starts with a mysterious trio of new servants (Eric Sykes, Elaine Cassidy and Fionnula Flanagan) being employed to look after the house, the garden, and to look after the children. The house is only lit by candles and the curtains must always be drawn in daylight, adding to the creepy feel of the piece.The music is minimal and help the effect when strange things happen. The twists - first we find that the servants died fifty years earlier of TB and are buried in the garden, then (twist on twist) we find that Grace killed her children and then herself and their spirits live on. The intruders are not the people we think they are! There are several hints to point to this when you reflect on the film - Grace's husband Charles, who was at war, appearing out of the fog in the garden and then disappearing; the curtains being taken down by persons unknown; the boy Victor squabbling with the ghost children over the light; and the photographic 'book of the dead' (the one photo missing being the one of the three servants).Does all this work? I'm not sure. There is certainly atmosphere throughout, and some shocks - but the ending felt like a cop-out in many ways. An interesting idea that just misses the mark.",The Others
64,zkonedog,One Of The Best Of Its Kind,10,11 March 2017,"""Sometimes, the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living"". That simple phrase, perhaps more than any, describes the sheer brilliance of ""The Others"", one of the greatest (and perhaps somewhat underrated) horror/thrillers in cinema history.For a very basic overview, ""The Others"" sees Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two photo- sensitive children (played by Alakina Mann & James Bentley) living in an old mansion in post-WW2 Europe. While waiting for the father of the house to return from war, the house is are suddenly intruded-upon by seemingly otherworldly inhabitants. Then, Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) and Co., the home's former tenants, come a-calling and only deepen the mystery of what might be transpiring.""The Others"" is certainly a film in the mold of say, ""The Sixth Sense"", in that it all leads to a spectacular twist ending you likely won't see coming (especially if it is your first viewing). I won't completely spoil the proceedings here, but suffice it to say that director/writer Alejandro Amenabar expertly weaves multiple mysteries together and has it all climax perfectly in the endgame.What makes ""The Others"" stand the test of time, however, is that even when you are very familiar with the big twist, it can still be enjoyed again and again. This is largely due to Kidman's inspired performance, as well as an exploration of themes (family, childhood innocence, insanity, ownership of one's surroundings, etc.) that probe much deeper than the usual genre fare here. In short, even when you know what is coming in the end, you'll still be sucked into the character journeys upon every viewing.Overall, ""The Others"" continues to remain on my ""short list"" of greatest psychological thrillers of all-time. Its spooky atmosphere, layered mysteries, and uncommon depth make it a well-rounded exercise in suspense.",The Others

In and of itself, this bodes well (so to speak- for the viewer, at any rate): likening THE OTHERS to classic fright films based on classic written works automatically elevates it to a height most fright films (unfortunately) never even ASPIRE to, let alone attain. Ambiance can be EVERYTHING in a fright film- hence, the term- but, all too often, the alleged ""auteurs"" prove themselves more ""hack"" than visionary. Fortunately for filmgoers, director Amenabar is one of the more gifted young filmmakers now plying their trade.

66,filipemanuelneto,"A powerful, intense thriller.",8,18 January 2017,"In this film, a mother tries to educate her two children by herself, protecting them from a mysterious illness that causes them great sensitivity to intense lights, such as sunlight. While her husband is fighting the Nazis, she lives isolated in a Channel Islands mansion, keeping the house in partial darkness along with three mysterious servants. The lead role is played by Nicole Kidman, who does a brilliant performance in a character who sometimes seems very loving, almost needy, and other times seems unusually hard. But she's just a woman trying to bear a burden that seems heavy: the burden of carrying everything back while her husband is away. The children are equally interesting: played by James Bentley and Alakina Mann, two very competent young actors, they are naive, sweet but also very mischievous, and their mischief contributes greatly to the suspense, especially the girl. She seems to know something that nobody else knows or to have a particularly sharp intelligence. The father, played by Christopher Eccleston, is almost a mere figure. He is purposely an absent character who is permanently present for the simple fact of all the others are constantly speaking of him, and this absence has great importance to the psyche of his wife. But the true life of this film is borrowed by Fionnula Flanagan and Eric Sykes who (along with Elaine Cassidy) give life to the house servants. The way they acted and how counter-acted with Kidman is brilliant, giving the film a deeply conspiratorial atmosphere. The constant darkness, the gas lights, the huge old house, the permanent haze surrounding the grounds are cliché elements that give the film a touch of elegance and help the audience to grab to the movie until the end, which is quite unexpected and disconcerting.",The Others

Big budget in Horror delivers expectations.,9,15 August 2006,"""The Others"" is an elegant Ghost flick that not necessarily deals with revenge; it shows that ghosts can still feel. With that brief brain storm explanation, I can say that this movie is deep and emotional on it's own way.It's true that the movie has a macabre plot twist in the likes of ""The Sixth Sense"" which should be recognized for creating a new way of ending Horror movies (which is not necessarily a good thing). But the ending of ""The Others"" will leave you satisfied and thinking how emotional the movie is. Sure, there are some scary and chilling scenes but that's not the point of the movie. After the movie's climax, the scary scenes are useless. Talking about the ending, it should send you shivers.The atmosphere in the movie is dark, unsettling and stylish. The movie looks Gothic at some points thanks to a great cinematography. The mansion is creepy enough even without ghosts. All the scenes of the movie have important information that should help in order to create a better experience. I remember that back in 2001 people were really terrified in the theater when the movie reaches it's climax. The same should happen if you watch it home alone.The acting is excellent. Nicole Kidman's performance proves that major Hollywood stars can do great in the Horror genre. The rest of the cast is also perfect.Please, watch ""The Others"" if you haven't seen it because it's an important Horror movie from the new millennium. Probably one of the best.",The Others

70,jzappa,Unusually Thoughtful and Affecting Ghost Film,8,6 February 2008,"The reason Amenabar's work on The Others is so above the fare of a given ghost film is because it turns out to be a beautifully philosophical musing on death, how death is something even the dead are not prepared for, because the psychological fear assumed on earth overpowers the physical seamlessness the real thing may have. There is also an honest undercurrent of perspective on how religion may effect the mental state of afterlife, complemented by another concept that may or may not be hopeful or comforting to people, which is the idea that spiritual and materialistic connections in this life may carry over into the next.The film flows gently like the English countryside it portrays, patiently executing a brilliant build-up of seemingly purposeless events and phantom motives that serve as exterior for the perfectly coinciding ones that later reveal themselves.The multi-talented Alejandro Amenabar, who wrote, directed, and also scored the film, has crafted an unusually thoughtful and affecting ghost film. Nicole Kidman's nerve-shattered, heart-ravaged performance as the strict Catholic war widow who spends her life protecting her two photosensitive children gives just the right conservative, classical yet realistically drawn upon approach. Christopher Eccleston, playing Kidman's husband, may be quite dull, but Alakin Mann and James Bentley, playing Kidman's children, are either not from the assembly line of cryptic horror movie children or they're from a fresh batch.",The Others
71,Vartiainen,A proper scary tale of mystery,7,19 January 2017,"World War II has just ended and a young woman with two children is waiting on an island in the British Channel for her husband to return home. Her housekeepers have mysteriously vanished without any hints and thus she's forced to hire new staff, three solemn locals who claim a past with the manor they're living in. And then the strange sounds start plaguing the family.The Others works as a horror film because it allows the atmosphere to build. There are very few jump scares, almost none at all, and most of the horror is build on the fact that the mother is slowly losing her mind and is forced to doubt her every decision. The situation itself is strange enough with a lone manor, two children being forced to live indoors for fear of the light and three closemouthed locals, but then the facts start revealing themselves and it ended up being quite different from what I'd imagined. But in the best way possible. It's a well-spun tale all around.Two special mentions for extra greatness. First to Nicole Kidman, whose acting abilities are still very much on top. Hers is the carrying performance of this entire film and she sells it flawlessly. From a stern although caring mother to a determined mistress of a manor to a scared soul trembling in the face of the unknown. The second mention goes to the soundtrack, which is a perfect blend of classical haunting and British pastoral music reminiscent of the good old days of the Empire. Definitely a soundtrack I would listen just because. And I in fact have.The Others is a very good horror film. One of the best I've seen in years and definitely a film worth checking out if you're looking for something a bit more psychological and mood-dependent.",The Others
72,Turfseer,Standard Haunted House Horror Film Tropes Abound Despite Clever Twist Ending,4,29 September 2021,"The unusual setting of The Others is the self-governing British island dependency of Jersey, off the northern coast of France. During World War II it was occupied by Nazi Germany. The story seemingly is set in 1945 in a remote country house populated by a young mother Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two young children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley).Three caretakers led by Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) show up at Grace's doorstep looking for work and Grace hires them practically on the spot. She has some odd rules they must follow including keeping the house in virtual darkness as she indicates her children have some kind of life-threatening allergy to light along with locking each door whenever leaving a room in order to ensure the children don't escape and are exposed to the sun.The bulk of the quite repetitious goings-on revolve around Grace's suspicions that the house is populated by ghosts or some kind of supernatural entities. At first Anne reports talking to a young boy named Victor and also observing a scary old woman along with Victor's parents. Gradually Grace comes to believe that the house is haunted which almost brings her to the verge of madness.Sandwiched in at the midpoint is the return of Grace's husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) who appears to be suffering from a severe case of Post traumatic stress disorder after fighting on the side of the British in World War II. After greeting the kids with some hugs, he inexplicably informs Grace that he's leaving despite her protestations and informing him that the war was now over.We finally arrive at the denouement in which Director/screenwriter Alejandro Amenabar proffers up a twist that saves the film from complete disaster. The twist is that the ""spirits"" or ghosts in the house are actually real people in the present time, which include the old woman Anne saw earlier whom in reality is a medium conducting a séance. Grace, her kids and husband, along with the caretakers, have been dead for years. The caretakers died back in 1891 from tuberculosis but show up there to deal with fellow spirit Grace who is in denial over the fact that she killed her children and herself back in 1945.You would think that Grace would get her just desserts in the afterlife after murdering her kids but Amenabar simply decides that an epiphany of being a child killer is sufficient. To me that's disappointing and certainly Amenabar could have found a much nicer place in hell for the mother murderer in contrast to having her simply continuing to populate the old house and drift around as a regular ghost.Since most of the machinations are strictly formulaic horror film tropes (ghosts trying to scare people in a haunted house), the twist here just isn't enough to carry the entire film. The acting here is particularly good, especially the child actors and the cinematography coupled with some neat scary music give the film a heady atmosphere. I cannot recommend this 20 year old picture but I hear there is a remake in the works. If it's going to be similar to this 2001 version however, then I'll ultimately have to pass.",The Others
73,bsmith5552,Marvelous Scare the Pants Off of You Ghost Story!,9,16 May 2002,"""The Others"" is a superior ghost story in the old fashioned vein without any glitzy special effects, no blood and guts, no graphic sex and no gruesome murders. What it is, is an atmospheric, eerie and claustrophobic scare the pants off of you haunted house ghost story. The story involves a young mother Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two light-sensitive children Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann, James Bentley) who live in an isolated manor in the middle of the countryside in 1945. The father has gone off to war and has not returned. Along come three mysterious house servants, Bertha Milk (Fionna Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and the mute Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), who show up unexplainably to apply for the vacant servant positions. Elaine and the children then begin to hear voices and things that go bump in the night. Are there ghosts or intruders in the house? Are the servants who they say they are? Can Grace protect her family against the evil forces? Director Alejandro Amenabar keeps us guessing throughout. He presents us with a creaky old mansion with all of the haunted house cliches (slamming doors, unexplained noises, creaking floors etc.) but does so in a style reminiscent of the classic ghost stories such as ""The Uninvited"" (1944), ""The Innocents"" (1961) and ""The Haunting"" (1963). He gives us a slam-bang ending, with a few surprises, that you won't want to miss. Nicole Kidman, after playing second fiddle to ex-hubby Tom Cruise is finally receiving the roles and recognition she deserves. Always a beautiful and talented actress, she proves in ""The Others"" what a fine dramatic actress she can be and does so without any of the trappings and glamour such as she had in her previous film ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001). Alakina Mann and James Bentley are excellent as the children. Veteran performers Flanagan and Sykes as well as, virtual newcomer Cassidy stand out as the servants.

74,dfranzen70,They're creepy and they're spooky....,8,28 May 2002,"Seems like when folks talk about the good old days of movies, they talk about movies that made you think, movies that scared you not by showing you something scary but by not showing you something at all. The fear of the unknown, conventional wisdom holds, is the ultimate fear. We do not fear the dark because it is dark; we fear it because of what it masks.The Others harkens back to those oldtime scary movies, a haunted house movie that answers some questions, invites many more, and always keeps you on the very cusp of collapsing into hysterics. It's not just a neat ghost story told well; it's practically dripping with atmosphere.Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives in a gigantic old mansion with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, waiting for her husband to return from World War II. The kids have developed a sort of photosensitivity disease, and cannot be exposed to any light more than that of a candlelight. This leads to the house being shrouded in darkness much of the time, and Grace even goes so far as to direct that no door may be opened without the previous door being closed, so as to prevent extra light from shining on the children.Grace hires a troika of housekeepers and handyman to help around the house and with the kids, but the three older people seem... well, a little off to her. And soon the Stewarts come to believe they are not at all alone in the expansive manse, as daughter Anne insists she has seen and spoken to a little boy named Victor.Who's behind the spectre appearances? Is it the hired help? Are the kids fibbing to their stern mother? Or is it all in the mind of Grace herself? Adding to the confusion is the return of Mr. Stewart to the house - like the help, he seems more than a little bit off-center. What is going on?The mood is positively eerie, and it's accomplished by a pronounced lack of musical accompaniment. In most horror movies, one hears a melodramatic chord or two, leading up to the victim being slaughtered. Not in The Others. Silence is deadly and heightens the tension and suspense immeasurably.
This is probably Kidman's finest work, and in my mind it mostly erases the painful memory of watching her attempt to act in Eyes Wide Shut. Stripped of the baggage known as Tom Cruise, Kidman is simply superb, mesmerizing the viewer to the point of feeling a deep empathy for her plight. The plot's no slouch, either, full of twists, including an incredible denouement. As ghost stories go, The Others is one of the best I've ever seen.",The Others

83,drownnnsoda,"Delightfully Spooky, Old-Fashioned Ghost Story.",9,30 May 2006,"""The Others"" is an excellent blend of suspense, horror, and mystery. It has a great story, some great acting, and I thought it was pretty scary. But you have to like ghost stories to enjoy this. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a mother who lives in a dark, old island mansion in the 1940's, with her two children, Anne and Nicholas, who are allergic to the sunlight. After some servants arrive to their darkened home, strange events begin to plague Grace and her children. As things get stranger and stranger, Grace becomes convinced that her home is haunted, and she begins to suspect something strange about the servants. Is the house really haunted? Or is there something even more disturbing going on? Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar brings this delightfully eerie ghost picture to the screen, in the vein of Jack Clayton's 1961 chiller, ""The Innocents"", and Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"". The story is nicely crafted here, and while the similarities between this and ""The Innocents"" are obvious, ""The Others"" is definitely it's own movie. Fans of slow-going, old-fashioned horror films will love this, because of the steady pacing that still manages to send chills up the spine. It's a bit of a slow film in the beginning, but things do pick up, and there is plenty going on in the meantime to keep the audience intrigued. The entire movie is done in the style of those classic haunted house stories we know. A very dark and Gothic atmosphere is prevalent as well, and director Amenabar captures some very eerie images and some excellently-constructed scare sequences. As for the twist-ending, I have to give some major credit for it. I never saw it coming, and it fit the story perfectly, completely reversing whatever ideas you had about the film. The acting is also great, Nicole Kidman plays her role as the eccentric mother perfectly, and Fionnula Flanagan plays one of the kindly new servants to the household nicely, as do the rest of them. And the children playing Kidman's son and daughter were also very remarkable in their roles.Overall, ""The Others"" is a classy and Gothic ghost story, reminiscent of those haunted-house classics we all remember. This film sets up an intense atmosphere - very dark, subtle, and old-fashioned. I enjoyed it. If you like this kind of movie, surely see it, you won't be disappointed. ""The Others"" is a great example of what a genuinely good ghost story should be like. 9/10.",The Others

85,davispittman,One of the most spine chilling flicks ever made,10,21 March 2017,"The Others (2001) truly is a blood curdling, bone chilling suspense movie that will surely scare anyone watching while watching. The chills in this film stem from the unknown, and subtle noises, whispers and voices coming from within the house. Nicole Kidman gives a fantastic performance here as the lead, a mother of two living in a secluded home while her husband is away fighting in WWII. Nicole has a great attitude/atmosphere about her throughout the entire film. Most of the movie she has a kind of tragic look on her face, and given her circumstances in life it's completely appropriate and called for. The way she handles scenes that are very intense and frightening is not only believable, but her acting lifts up the scare factor to a new level, which the actors in films like this must do. If the cast of a scary suspense film cannot do that then the movie as a whole will suffer. The child actors did a fine job as well, very impressive for their age. The daughter especially did very good job, her role requires more screen time than the son and the daughter has some pretty intense scenes with her mother (Kidman). The ending is brilliant in my opinion and I very much enjoyed the end result, it adds to the overall effect of the film. 10/10 for the others.

88,ferbs54,Haunting,9,14 May 2008,"With its sterling reputation as one of the best cinematic ghost stories since 1963's ""The Haunting,"" Alejandro Amenabar's 2001 film ""The Others"" was one that this latecomer plopped into his DVD player with great anticipation. And I am happy to report that all the positive word of mouth is right on the money, and that this really is some kind of great work. As most folks seem to have already discovered, ""The Others"" takes place on the isle of Jersey in 1945, where Grace (superbly played by Nicole Kidman) awaits the homecoming of her soldier husband, whilst caring for her ""photosensitive"" children and breaking in some new domestic help. Soon, though, Grace's worries are greatly added to by strange noises upstairs, the sound of a sobbing child, and the tinkling of a piano in an empty room. It would seem that her lavish mansion has been invaded by...spirits? Featuring an endlessly fascinating story line, interesting characters, fine production values, a creeping sense of dread and a good number of jolts, ""The Others"" really does make for a top-notch, classy horror movie. Amenabar not only wrote the screenplay for and directed this great picture, but also provided the film's lovely/creepy score. (The man must be some kind of a friggin' genius!) Fionnula Flanagan (who, incidentally, impresses me no end by dint of her having appeared on three ""Star Trek"" series!) is marvelous here as the housekeeper, Mrs. Mills; how wonderful to see her and Kidman giving two very Oscar-worthy performances in their many shared scenes. The picture features an absolutely brilliant ending that I was not prepared for (those who have read E.F. Benson's 1923 story ""Mr. Tilley's Seance"" will perhaps appreciate this ending even more), and that final shot of Kidman and her children in an upstairs window is just...haunting. I found this film even better and deeper on a repeat viewing. More than highly recommended.",The Others
89,aidanratesmovies,Overrated- but a decent watch nevertheless,7,7 June 2021,"It's a little messy at times, and slow at others, but The Others (for the most part), is a very clever and very well acted little horror film- incredible reminiscent of many classic films from the past. Largely a main factor of this film is the Victorian post-war setting that the film takes place in. Director Alejandro Amenabar largely focuses on the atmosphere and visuals of the world around them, which I feel can be a bit defeating in the scheme of things. It isn't that the look of the film isn't well put together, but that it takes priority over the characters and depth of them from time to time. We don't need to see and hear so much about the postwar world, we can understand how they feel from the characters, and I wish Amenabar decided to spend more time and effort on that fact to make a more dense picture. Besides that, and the film starting out at a rather slow pace- the film can be quite clever. It isn't always the scariest, but it can be rather interesting to watch the story unfold nevertheless, with twists and turns at every corner- and an incredibly devout performance from Nicole Kidman. The characters are well done, despite the films flaws, and although there are a few predictable moments, I did rather enjoy the twists that came along- particularly the ones we see towards the end. In the end, The Others is far from a perfect horror film, but it does have its moments of genuine curiosity and great performances nevertheless.My Rating: 7.1/10.",The Others
90,valleyjohn,"A rare subtle horror,",9,30 July 2011,"The Others is what you would call an old fashioned ghost story. This is a film which leaves more to the imagination and does not rely on any blood , violence or death ( well not really) but more on a clever script and an ingenious twist.Nocole Kidman plays a mother of two children who lives in an old country house and while she awaits her husband from the second world war she recruits three members of staff . All is not what it seems.I really likes this film. Kidman is good as is Fionnula Flanagan who plays the nanny.This is a slow burner that builds up the tension superbly until the viewer starts to put the pieces of the jigsaw together and in the end it becomes really quite scary.If you have not seen The Others before it is well worth a watch.",The Others

93,triple8,A very well acted movie with an intriguing plot but too slow moving.,6,11 November 2003,"This was a reasonably good movie that did not remind me of Sixth Sense as it did others but had it's own unique premise. I found the cinematography to be absolutely breathtaking, the atmosphere mysterious, and the Ghost Story intriguing. Also Nicole Kidman was every bit as good if not better in this then she was in Moulon Rouge so I don't know why she did not get an Oscar nomination. Anyway....In spite of all the positives-I didn't LIKE the movie all that much-oh it was all right, it was I suppose a 6, maybe a 6.5 but not much more. The movie had 2 major flaws in my mind and kept the film from being truly great.1)WAY TOO slow going-after awhile you stop being interested and become simply impatient-as interesting as the central plot is, how many times can children gasp and Nicole Kidman look scared until the audience loses their patience? Which brings me to:2)The type of scare tactics used. SPOILER ALERT: Oh me Oh my-WAY TOO MUCH-doors that open by themselves,scary music, cliché cliché Cliché-it's to bad-watching this all I could think at times was how Redundant they were making it-there should have been more Truly frightening scenes like The daughter changing shape and when Nicole and the kids realize their dead and the table starts shaking and the camera shows them yelling and....their is NOBODY there! Awesome! Scary too! Alas, too much time was wasted on creaky noises and people saying ""who's there?""So I'd have to say The Others is an OK movie but not a classic. I feel Sixth Sense was actually a much better movie. But this performance from Nicole was outstanding and up there as one of her best.",The Others
94,Spleen,A superb ghost story,9,12 March 2002,"SERIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD.  If you haven't seen the film don't read so much as a single word below. ...As with ""The Sixth Sense"", I believe you're MEANT to guess halfway through. When Grace meets her husband it's a ""Vertigo"" gesture: we now know the central truth that's eluding the main characters, they don't, and the tension comes from us waiting for them to find out.  Anyway, it's not as if the series of broad hints we are dropped during Grace's walk in the woods reveal ALL secrets, or clear up all mysteries.  We weren't told at that point that the caretakers are also dead, or that Grace murdered her own children, although the film plays fair with us and tells us all we need to know to work these things out.The list of clues I failed to see the significance of at once is an embarrassingly long one (although the chagrin was pleasant): the undelivered letter, the mysterious departure of the servants, the day that ""mummy went mad"", the fact that Lydia underwent some trauma that rendered her mute... But in addition to all these clues there's one EXTERNAL to the narrative, a matter of technique, which I failed to read correctly even though I saw it mentioned before I saw the film, and noted it while watching.It was in a review by New York critic Godfrey Cheshire.  It wasn't favourable.  An essential component of the haunted-house story, Cheshire argues, is ""daylight reality"", which means that in order for the spookiness to work we MUST see the people who are about to be haunted doing ordinary things in broad, unthreatening daylight.  And he's right: ""daylight reality"" IS an essential component of any story of this kind.So when the film opens with Grace emerging from a nightmare, breathless with terror, in a dark house surrounded by fog, it DOES appear to be a stylistic defect.  But it isn't.  Grace, it will eventually turn out, is a ghost, a haunter rather than a hauntee.  ""Very well,"" I thought to myself when I discovered this, ""but what about the caretakers?  Why don't we see THEIR daylight reality?""  The answer to this question is the same: because they, too, are ghosts (you think by this stage I'd have got it).  Not until the very end, when we meet the ""others"", does the sun come out.  This hard-won ""daylight reality"" is no less effective a part of the ghost story for coming last rather than first.",The Others
95,Seraphion,A cliché pioneer of horror plots,6,11 August 2014,"I personally am not a big fan of the horror genre. Yet it has come to my attention that at the time I write this review, one the popular horror plot is the twist where the main characters that the viewers assume as the ones being haunted, are truly the real haunters themselves. And Now, seeing this movie about fourteen years after its original release, I think now I have found the original movie that set the trend for such a plot. Of the small number of horror movies I've seen, I can appreciate the surprise that the plot brings, especially in the part where the twist comes in. In my opinion, the twist served n this movie has the surprise level comparable to the one I saw in The Skeleton Key, even in the original Shutter, that Thai movie. Nicole Kidman played an stable role, successfully portraying an insecure mother with the burden of a lost husband and photosensitive children. Yet I don't think this was the best performance from her.",The Others
96,nycritic,"They Are Here, Invisible, but Here.",10,10 May 2005,"The Stewart household is a strange one. An isolated house in the Isle of Jersey, it's constantly enveloped in thick, blue fog, all doors must remain closed, and drapes block the sunlight because the children suffer from an illness in which they are extremely sensitive to it. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman, finally coming to her own in a story worthy of her talents), wakes up one morning screaming from what may have been a nightmare. Three strangers arrive to the house and they tell Grace they are replying for her request for domestic help -- and almost immediately, though subtly, strange events begin happening and it slowly becomes clear that there are other unseen, unwanted people occupying their quarters. This only becomes more evident when Grace discovers, to her horror, that these servants are more than what they seem to and that her own reality is not what she believes it to be.Alejandro Amenabar had already caught the attention of Tom Cruise who produced and starred in his own remake of OPEN YOUR EYES, which gave Cameron Diaz a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and here he establishes himself for the American movie going public with his follow-up. Again going for clever storytelling -- even if it takes a while to take off -- and relying on atmosphere rather than on expensively produced special effects, it's a showcase for Nicole Kidman who carries the entire film on her shoulders and who conveys furious determination to protect her household and absolute terror at the unknown forces against her with intense verve. Fionulla Flannagan and Christopher Eccleston provide some interesting foils to her dominant presence, but the real star is the film itself, who never goes for a quick cheat to fabricate its denouement (diametrically opposed to what M. Night Shyamalan's style where the twist is everything). Already a contemporary classic, it will go down in cinema history as an updated take on THE HAUNTING, with more finely tuned performances, even darker atmosphere, and a rising sense of dread.",The Others
97,JuguAbraham,"Amenabar and Kidman concoct intelligent, scary entertainment",8,27 November 2002,"This is the most intelligent and scary film since Kubrick made ""The Shining"" and Hitchcock made his humorous murder thrillers. Like Hitchcock, Amenabar is able to make you laugh at yourself at the end of the scary film--while Kubrick could only made you sigh with relief at the end of his intelligent work.This is my first Amenabar film. The early scene of Kidman's screaming face switching from the vertical to the horizontal gives you a clue of what will follow--intelligent viewing, constantly requiring the viewer to re-evaluate earlier impressions. This is mature cinema. This is the stuff John Berger would love to include in his ""Ways of Seeing"" if he were to re-write the book. It is not without reason that in the DVD interview Amenabar says that he was most impressed by Kidman's eyes. It appears to be a frivolous comment. Yet Kidman's eyes are not only providing the impression of being terrorized or her character's steady descent from normality to lunacy, but they become the central sensory organ to a film in which light and darkness assume unusual importance. Amenabar is the Svengali. For a young director it is impressive to see the director working on his own story and composing his own music, to be able to get such topnotch performances from Kidman, Flanagan, Sykes, and the kids. Watching this film reminds you of Orson Welles' cinema, though Welles would have loved to be in front of the camera as well.The way Amenabar has crafted the story is so intelligent that you cannot help admiring how his story works backwards, with the end providing the pivotal point for the beginning of real entertainment and correct perspective. You begin to love the film after the movie ends--somewhat like the narrative structure of ""The Usual Suspects."" The prologue on the Creation, narrated by Kidman to the kids, would in retrospect be the appropriate epilogue. The film continues to entertain the viewer after the film has ended as the viewer is forced to pick up the clues thrown at the audience as the film progressed on the impending end.This is a European film in style and far removed from Hollywood's predictable approach to mystery, supernatural, aliens, etc. This style is what makes the film outstanding in the genre--it provides entertainment by teasing your senses and perception of what is real. Even when dealing with a supernatural subject it exudes a pristine charm of children and Bible readings. As the film progresses you note that often initial elements of charm hides a not-so-innocent mind (Flanagan's character Bertha Mills, Kidman's character Grace, etc.).Kidman is lovely to look at. Yet she is only truly impressive when a good director is in charge (first Kubrick in ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and now Amenabar).The strengths of this film also lie in the art direction, sound editing (superb), and cinematography.The film does leave holes in the story. What happens to the postman? What happens to the first batch of servants that preceded Bertha Mills et al.? Were the children really having a medical problem? What were the pills that Grace was having and what was Bertha giving her that Grace found suspicious? Probably these unanswered questions add to the richness of the film.This is a major film of the decade because of the narrative structure, which would put off conventional viewers of Hollywood products. The special features of the DVD are below average (e.g., interview with cinematographer is in Spanish, some of the English interview snippets are pedantic) while the sound recording is top notch.",The Others

Supernatural drama/horror done right.,9,18 July 2010,"""We must all learn to live together...the living and the dead.""I remember first seeing this back in high school, and I'm still almost as impressed with it today as I was back then. It came out at a time when there hadn't been many other movies quite like it, and it goes way beyond the average horror movie in both concept and polish. The Others doesn't rely on constant jump scares, buckets of gore, or violence. Its originality, understated performances, and focus on atmosphere are the reasons why I enjoy it so much. Every character is ominous and unsettling in their own way, and every event has a hidden meaning. Those are also the reasons why it still holds up so well, when many other supernatural movies lose their luster after the first viewing.  The plot is as novel as modern ghost stories come. There's several very creepy moments, and they're thankfully explained by the revelations of the movie, instead of eliminated by them. This is my favorite Nicole Kidman movie, and one of my favorite supernatural movies, period. It makes me wish that period ghost movies were made more often, they're a nice change of pace from those set in modern times.",The Others

Not because I'm easily scared, but because I can't stop laughing (which, for as far as I know, isn't the meaning of the creators of such movies). This time however it was a completely different story ... I don't think I've ever been so on the edge of my seat with a horror movie than with this one. The main reason why I love this one so much is because it reminds me of a story that runs in our family. It is told that my great grandfather once had contact with his dead wife during a séance. Apparently, details were told which only he and his wife knew about, which scared the hell out of him of course... I don't know how much of this story is true, but the movie certainly reminded me of it. The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't need brain eating zombies, gigantic spiders or other weird creatures that are supposed to scare me, while they only make me laugh. No, ""The Others"" relies on nothing more but a good story and excellent acting in combination with a great decor. I kept focused until the end, also thanks to the great twist at the end. I can't tell too much about it of course, you'll have to see it for yourself. I loved it and I give it a 9/10. It's by far the best horror movie I've seen in years!",The Others
100,moviewizguy,A Lovely Genuine Horror Movie,10,1 June 2007,"I'm afraid that telling a slightest hint of the plot will already give away what's coming when you watch the film, so I'll just give you the set up: A woman named Grace retires with her two children to a mansion on Jersey, towards the end of the Second World War, where she's waiting for her husband to come back from battle. The children have a disease which means they cannot be touched by direct sunlight without being hurt in some way. She then hires 3 servants to help around the house, or mansion.Okay, that really doesn't give the plot, but as soon as you watch it, you'll know it's a ghost story, but this time, it's not mainstream! Well, isn't that original? I'm so glad they don't have those usual horror movie clichés and those huge amounts of gore. In fact, this movie doesn't even need special effects to make us scared because this movie is really creepy.If this can't be one of the best movies in 2001, it should at least be the best or one of the best movies ever made in 2001, if not one of the best horror movies. If you're tied of those PG-13 horror movies, this won't disappoint. It's like The Ring (in as good PG-13 rated horror films).I love this movie because it's like Lost, in which subtle clues are given away little by little until it reaches the twist ending. Believe me, the pay off is great, if you think this movie's pacing is too slow. I'm sure it's slow, if someone figured the twist ending already. If not, don't try to think some up or you'll get mad at the graceful pace the film is moving.Nicole Kidman gives a really great performance in here, as well as many other characters. The cinematography, the score, and the production, they're all great! This film really doesn't follow many mainstream movie rules.

A ghost story of the highest caliber; but if you watch it too carefully, there are so many ""clues"" that you will guess the ending long before the final reel. For another version (a similar story) watch ""The Innocents"" (1961). The story seems familiar because it is a partial retelling of ""The Turn of the Screw."" I won't reveal the ending except to tell you that this is a ghost story told from the ghosts' point-of-view, which really reveals too much. (The young boy Victor, one of the ""intruders"", can see the ghosts.) A handsome production with excellent cinematography and sets. Well directed and very atmospheric but too intense for very young children. The movie mystery starts out with a few huge hints: The mannerisms and dress of the servants.

This is too slow narrated.If it was a parody on Hitchcock of the 40s it would be rather splendid, because it is played in a 40s manner, especially by Nicole Kidman, who is doing one of her best performances. This also goes for Fionnula Flanagan and the actors must have had lots of fun during the making of this film.The plot doesn't hold together however. Definitely not. Nothing should be said about the ending, more than it's cheating and disappointing. Besides it's too much fog outside the house, it's too much spooky victorianism all around, it's too much walking in corridors, which would be all right in an parody, but this isn't.

It has a few contact points with other movies involving ghosts and children like for instance ""The Innocents"" or ""Shining"" though maybe not so scary like the latter(nevertheless of course a bit scary anyway like any ghost story worth of its title). But it has the advantage of having a very surprising end that will leave you almost breathless though not exactly horrified since it's even somewhat poetical. The acting is great not only by Nicole Kidman as the main character but above all by the two children that do extraordinary performances. The interior scenery of the old mansion where the story takes place is quite convincing and very much fit to the general atmosphere of the plot. A good movie indeed though not exactly a masterpiece because the story doesn't give great occasion to that classification in all its details since in these stories that mix natural with supernatural it's always difficult to make things logical and illogical at same time.",The Others

107,sme_no_densetsu,An expertly constructed haunted house story,8,8 February 2020,"""The Others"" was the English-language debut of Alejandro Amenábar, who was at that time best known for ""Abre Los Ojos"", shortly thereafter the recipient of a Hollywood adaptation in the form of ""Vanilla Sky"". Here, Amenábar crafted an original screenplay that managed to breathe new life into the age-old haunted house sub-genre. Following on the heels of ""The Sixth Sense"", this movie is another classy supernatural thriller that keeps audiences guessing until the very end.The story's main character is a British woman (Nicole Kidman) who lives in a remote country house with her two children shortly after the end of World War II. Her husband went away to war and, having not returned, is presumed dead. With the previous household staff having recently vanished, a trio of former servants arrive to offer their services. They are accepted into the household and soon become acquainted with the children's unique medical condition. The ingenious premise put forth by Amenábar is that the children are highly photosensitive and cannot be exposed to light. Thus, the house is draped in shadow out of necessity. This sets the stage for mysterious occurrences that may or may not be supernatural in origin.The cast is small but well-assembled. Nicole Kidman is the focal point and she delivered an impressive performance in a demanding role. This type of movie doesn't often get recognized by prestigious awards bodies but Kidman nevertheless managed to land both a Golden Globe nomination & a BAFTA nomination. The actors that played her two children (Alakina Mann & James Bentley) were also up to the task. However, the best performance in a supporting role has to be that of Fionnula Flanagan as the enigmatic Mrs. Mills.Amenábar certainly knows how to establish the proper atmosphere for a good old-fashioned haunted house story. Not only did he bring his script to life with visual panache, he also scored the movie. ""The Others"" does such a nice job of sustaining its suspense that you don't realize until it's over just how simple the story actually is. It's a simplicity that harks back to the written ghost stories of centuries past but presented with a verve that has no trouble transferring the timeless appeal to modern viewers. It's also a presentation that's elegant enough to appeal to more than just watchers of horror movies.",The Others
108,frankde-jong,A very stylish movie,6,31 December 2020,"""The others"" is an entertaining horror movie that is greatly indebted to ""The sixth sense"" (1999, M. Night Shyamalan). The words that come to mind by ""The others"" are rather ""clever"" and ""stylish"" than ""original. Personally I find ""The sea inside "" (2004) a better film of director Alejandro AmenabarWhat do I mean by calling this film ""stylish""? In the first place the light. The two children in the film suffer from ""xeroderma pigmentosum"", which means that their skin is allergic to sunlight. Children with this disease are also called ""children of the night"" of ""children of the moon"". As a consequence it is always dark in the house, and this is very well done giving rise to very beautiful images, for example as the mother (Nicole Kidman) is waliking through the house with a kerosene lamp.In the second place the character of Nicole Kidman is designed as a real Hitchcock blonde. One would almost think that her name (Grace) is a reference to Grace Kelly.In the most frightning scene of the film Crace is looking for her daughter and is in for a shock when she finally finds her. For a chance this scene does not reminds me of ""The sixth sense"", but the shock effect is very much the same as in the end of ""Don't look now"" (1973, Nicolas Roeg).",The Others
109,oneguyrambling,A career highlight for Kidman - but still not a classic.,7,5 November 2010,"Before I yammer on about The Others, let's first discuss the career of one Nicole Kidman, who I consider the most over-rated actress on the planet. Sure she is attractive in a ""Womanly"" way, as opposed to the million ""girl"" actresses that burst on the scene and vanish seemingly weeks later, but her decision making when saying yes to a movie is obviously abysmal.Thanks to IMDb I can say that these are Kidman's career ""highlights"": - Dead Calm (My initial typo said ""Dead Clam"", which I hope to option and sell to Hollywood for a million bucks.) - The Others That's it. I've seen at least a dozen of her other flicks and have been underwhelmed every time. Kidman is good-looking without having that one ""thing"" that you remember, a good actress without ever being the most interesting character in any movie that she is in, yet she is critically lauded and extremely well paid.Another thing: I am Australian and realise this is almost slanderous that I am fully bagging a fellow Australian success story, but it needs to be said that NICOLE KIDMAN IS INCREDIBLY OVERRATED.Late addition: I subsequently checked out Rotten Tomatoes and found that Dead Calm and The Others are 2 of her higher ranked flicks, followed by Eyes Wide Shut, which I have seen but thought was nowhere near as good as it was made out to be.So back to The Others, which after my rant is actually pretty good, more thanks to the simplicity of the story than anything Kidman does though.Set in post-WW2 on a British island, Kidman plays a mother of 2 young kids named Grace living in a massive isolated manor that is seemingly eternally surrounded by fog. Her husband Charlie, was a soldier in the war and hasn't been heard from for some time - perhaps already dead. Her 2 kids are around 4 and 7, the younger a boy named Nicholas and the older a sister named Ann.Grace is understandably very protective of her two children, who apparently have an allergy to natural light (read sunshine), and must remain indoors during the day and behind thick drawn curtains. In fact Grace locks every room behind her to make sure they don't wander out, something that is a bit of a contrived plot device in retrospect.So one day three strangers roll up unannounced at the front door, Grace assumes that they have answered an ad offering work and employs them all instantly.They are: Mr Tuttle – Gardener/Handyman, perhaps 60. Mrs Mills – Nanny/Cook, also about 60. And Lydia – Maid, around 30 ish and a mute.Grace explains that her previous help vanished, and she takes great pains going through the rules regarding her children to Lydia and Mrs Mills.So one day Grace hears a crying child and immediately assumes it is one of hers. Nuh-huh, they are both OK. Ann blames some other kid named Victor who Grace has never heard of so she punishes Ann for the perceived lie. After mutterings, random noises and scuttling upstairs, it seems evident that someone else is in the house, and after questioning Ann matter of factly explains that there are in fact 4 others including the afore-mentioned Victor.Of course Grace being proper and rational initially doesn't embrace this idea, only as the usual evidence of self closing and opening doors, footsteps, unmanned pianos that play and random voices sorta changes her tune somewhat. She demands that the three servants search the home and grounds for evidence.A bit of an odd turn of events happens about half way through that I won't ruin (though it makes little if any sense), Grace decides to go for help through the fog, but eds up becoming disoriented and lost, until she finds..Again I can't say, but it does seem that the hired help know more than they are letting on, and that again someone else is in the house. Aside from Mrs Mills, the help seem to be around more to give the audience and Grace someone to be suspicious of, as elsewise she would be largely jumping at shadows.The Others finishes with a decent turn of events that makes sense given what precedes it, but unlike The Sixth Sense it does not reward repeat viewings for some reason. I had far fonder memories of this film from when I initially saw it in the early part of the decade than after watching it the other night. In essence I realised that it was a film with one scare, that wasn't really scary anyway, and two revelations that are both OK, but once you know 'em you know 'em. There is little joy in revisiting this flick.However It does contain one of the (inadvertently I think) funniest lines in film history. Grace is once again seriously discussing things with her kids and in an attempt to comfort Nicholas says: ""You'll never go to war."", to which Nicholas in typical 4 year old fashion replies ""We never go anywhere."" Dunno why, but it cracked me up enough to rewind it twice.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. This is worth seeing the first time, but if you've seen it before don't ruin any positive memories by watching it again.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",The Others

This is a film that accentuates psychological terror and atmosphere over blood and machetes.  It also takes its time getting to the point but along the way you are treated to a film that wants you to figure out what is going on, literally behind closed doors.  I had heard from people that there is a great twist at the end of the film and that made me keep my horror senses open.  I really tried to figure out what the catch was, but about a third of the way into the film, I ceased trying to figure it out and I was just enjoying the film for all of it's artistic merit and style.  And what this film lacks in the area of genuine scares and chills, it more than makes up for in the aesthetic of the film and the make-up.  I recommend this film to anyone that is tired of all the Scream rip-offs and films that have no idea what the difference is between gore and raw primal fear.  I can, in a way, compare this film to a film like The Blair Witch Project.  It's not what you can see that frightens you, it's what you can't. We are always afraid of those sounds that go bump in the night. But not necessarily what makes them.  The Others never forgets that concept.When you make a film about a haunted house, the first thing you have to do is have a great setting and an ominous looking house.  The Others accomplishes that by having it take place in the 40's, just after the war, in England.  For some reason, English haunted houses just seem ripe with history and they create an atmosphere conducive to the chills and fears that haunted houses produce.  This house is no exception.  Nicole Kidman plays Grace and she and her two children live alone in this ominous house.  Her two children are both photosensitive, which means that if sunlight, or any strong light touches their skin, they could break out in massive hives and die.  This is a clever plot device because it means that the entire film has to be filmed with the lights off and only dim candles burning for light.  Other film makers would kill for a premise like this because it actually gives the director a legitimate reason for the lighting to be the way it is.  And lighting is one of the key components in any horror film.  As the plot moves along, we find out that Grace's daughter, Anne, seems to be able to see and talk to ghosts in the house.  Grace, being a devout religious believer, doesn't believe in ghosts and tells Anne that she is lying.  She also tells her that when you lie, you don't go to Heaven, you remain stuck somewhere in purgatory.  Harsh words to be telling a 12 year old no less.Suddenly, three servants come knocking on the door and tell Grace that they are there in response to the ad that she put in the paper (but what are their real motives for being there?).  Grace hires them and they go about their business of making sure the shutters are closed and all the drapes are shut.  It is also a strict rule that before one door is entered, the other has to be locked.  This presents some problems for the caretakers as there is some 50 doors in the house.The Others plods along and drops hints every once in a while to assist us in trying to figure out what is happening and what the so called secret is. But not enough to make it obvious.  The imbroglio just keeps getting stranger as the film prods forward.  Director Alejandro Amenabar has a keen eye for detail and he does a good job of keeping us interested.  Some eerie looking pictures show up and then are brought back later in the film and before you realize it, the conclusion is upon us.  And when the twist comes, you are almost glad that it ends the way it does.  This is similar to The Sixth Sense where you may want to see it again to see if you missed anything the first time around.  I have only seen it once, and although it is a good film, I don't planning on seeing it again.  I am satisfied that I picked up everything the first time around. And as I said at the beginning of the review, if you are more interested in a film like Urban Legend and I Still Know What You Did.... then perhaps this is not the film for you.  The payoff is worth the wait, but you have to be patient.8 out 0f 10-- Much more in the style of Sixth Sense than Friday the 13th. And as much as I enjoy the Friday films, I will take a film like this any day over a film like Halloween 10 or Nightmare on Elm Street 9.",The Others
113,DunnDeeDaGreat,Stylish horror flick,7,30 January 2002,The Others is a very stylish horror flick. The diretor and writer Alejandro Amenábar  has made one of the best thinking horror flicks in recent memory. Nicole Kidman plays the lead role very well and I love the twist ending. The film is so much better than The Sixth Sense.,The Others
114,kevin c,DON'T GIVE AWAY THE ENDING,4,6 November 2001,"What spooks you in the horror genre, is very much a personal choice. Some would argue that this is a predictable scare. However for me, it was a good old-fashioned ghost story. In the tradition of Radio 4's Christmas ghost story.Kidman is believable as the mother and holds the film well (as usual). The daughter is very good, especially in the pair's intense scenes. You might guess the film's ending, but it's well worth going on the journey.",The Others
115,Stephen_A_Abell,The Story Of Things That Go Bump In The Night...,7,27 January 2021,"To appreciate this film to it's fullest, you need to watch it in the dark by the light of a roaring and flickering fire. Right from the outset, the writer and director, Alejandro Amenabar, sets a chill in your bones. He does this by setting the story in a mansion that is perpetually surrounded by dark grey fog. You can practically feel the frost and dampness in the air as the new servants walk up the path to the front door. Later, this frisson is enhanced by the strange, and possibly paranormal events affecting the family.The Others is a slow burn of a chiller. I like the way Amenabar uses the characters to bring the viewer into the story. You can relate to each in little ways. Though the main character of Grace, Nicole Kidman, is aloof, distant, and cold you know that she loves her children and will do anything to protect them... though there's something not quite right...Mrs Mills, Fionnula Flanagan, is the matriarch of the new servants. She's as strong-willed as Grace and won't take any nonsense from anyone... not even her mistress. At times, this creates conflict giving the audience more to meat to sink their teeth in to. With her chats to the other staff, you begin to realise that they know something, but what?There are more than enough unanswered questions to keep you watching and wondering what is going on in the house? Could it the children? Is it a stranger? Or maybe it's more paranormal?Amenabar takes everything at a slow pace and utilises this to build a creepy ambience and atmosphere. He also has a deft hand at using shadows and light. Too many times, directors go too far and drop a cloak of darkness over everything. Amenabar keeps everything lit. You can see facial expressions, which is great to show and build horror, doubt, fear, anxiety. While in the darkened background, you see a silhouetted humanlike figure pass a window. Eerie as hell.The movie is not a gross-out bloodfest of a horror. It is a haunting and chilling ghost story. So if you don't like this style of horror this flick is not for you. However, if you prefer a story and film to chill your nerves, and run its icy fingers over your soul, then give this well written and filmed movie a watch.Though I did guess the twist in the ending well before the climax when I originally watched this, back in 2002, it has taken me until now to watch it again. I still enjoyed it but not so much. The Others could be the kind of movie you pull off the shelf every twenty years or so. Not because it's awful, but because it's good and memorable. I hadn't forgotten enough to enjoy it more.With that in mind, If you've not watched The Others, I recommend you give it some of your time. It's both entertaining and thought-provoking, and well worth a look-see.Now, turn on those lights and come upstairs to the room at the top, and see where this ghostly tale landed in my rankings in my Absolute Horror and Dramatisation Of Life Lists.Take Care & Stay Well.",The Others
116,hall895,"Stylish, subtle scares",7,18 November 2013,"The Others is a ghost story but in this haunted house the scares are quite subtle. This is a movie which, to its great benefit, is more about the story than shocking, scary moments. To be sure there are some good frights sprinkled throughout. But nothing over-the-top. This movie is more interested in making you think than in frightening you. What exactly is going on in this house? It's a mystery the audience will be trying to solve right along with the characters. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, mother of two young children. The three of them live alone in an isolated house on the island of Jersey in the days immediately following the end of World War II. Grace's husband is presumed dead in the war. The family's servants just up and left in the middle of the night. Three new servants arrive at the house. And here things begin to get very interesting.From the moment we meet them there is something slightly off about these new servants. An aging nanny, an elderly gardener and a mute young woman...they're quite the odd trio. But they know the house, having worked there before and Grace welcomes them in. But first Grace must explain the rules for the house, rules designed to keep all sunlight out as the children are so sensitive to the light it would kill them. This makes for a dark atmosphere which adds so much to the film, especially once things start to go bump in the night. Grace's daughter Anne sees the ghosts but Grace herself refuses to believe it. The servants, especially the nanny Mrs. Mills, seem to know more than they are letting on. It's pretty clear these servants hold the movie's secrets. What are those secrets? The fun for us is in finding out. Grace needs to find the answers too but it seems unlikely she'll find much fun in it.Kidman is excellent in playing the loving, protective mother who is thoroughly harried by the unseen intruders in her home. Fionnula Flanagan is also terrific playing the mysterious Mrs. Mills who is somehow creepy even when she's not trying to be. Or maybe she is trying. Also notable are the performances of the young actors playing the children. James Bentley is quite good in playing the boy, Nicholas, but it is Alakina Mann, playing Anne, who is the true revelation. Mann turns in one of the best child acting performances you'll ever see, mature far beyond her years in playing a girl who sees ghosts and is not even freaked out by them, taking it all in her stride. Kudos to director Alejandro Amenábar for coaxing such fine performances from his cast and for creating such a creepy atmosphere. The movie's story is a smart one, building slowly but surely toward its big climax. There are enough hints sprinkled throughout that may let you figure things out before the characters do. So maybe when the ending comes it doesn't pack quite as much of a wallop as it would if you were totally stunned by it. But it is still all in all a very satisfying movie-watching experience. A good story with enough subtle little scares thrown in to keep happy those who are looking for chills and thrills.",The Others
117,Fernando-Rodrigues,A great rich white family psycho-biddy,7,9 January 2021,"Surprisingly good! Powerful actings and a smart script (the plot twist of the main characters being dead the whole time and the ""ghosts"" were people trying to make contact is simply incredible) that flirts with Christianism criticism.",The Others
118,gftbiloxi,We Will Never Leave This House,8,18 April 2005,"To a certain extent, one's enjoyment of THE OTHERS will depend on how quickly you recognize the major plot device on which the entire film turns. Once recognition sets in, how much you are able to further enjoy the film will then depend on how much you have become engaged by the characters--and it is here, really, that the film stumbles a bit, not so much through the way it is done but rather through the way the characters must be played in order for their behavior to make sense at the film's conclusion.The premise, which seems deeply influenced by both Henry James' THE TURN OF THE SCREW and the 1960s film version known as THE INNOCENTS, concerns a woman who resides with her two children in an isolated mansion following World War II. Her situation is dire: her husband is missing in action and presumed dead; her children suffer from a rare genetic disease that makes sunlight dangerous to them; her servants have departed in the night without a word of warning. The latter problem seems remedied by the arrival of new servants--but no sooner are they installed than odd happenings begin to occur. Is the woman going mad? Are the servants involved? Have intruders secretly entered the house? Or could it be--something unearthly? The cast is exceptionally good here, with Fionnula Flanagan as the newly arrived servant Mrs. Mills and children Alakina Mann and James Bentley giving remarkable performances. But the focus is on Nicole Kiddman as Grace, a role that Kiddman plays with a white-knuckled grip and considerable ferocity--so much so that it becomes extremely difficult to like, much less sympathize, with the character. In some respects, however, this is ultimately necessary for this extremely plot-driven film to have any significant impact, and in hindsight it is hard to imagine that the role could be played in any other way; still, hindsight does not allow you to engage fully with the character when you are in the midst of the film. It is a flaw, but it is an unavoidable one--and the film is so remarkably stylish that it largely overcomes both the anticipated plot-twist and Kiddman's necessarily ferocious performance.The production values are first rate all the way down the line. Everything looks right, sounds right, feels right. But two items deserve special mention: the exceptional soundtrack, which was composed by director Alejandro Amenabar himself, and the stunning cinematography, which has tremendous visual texture and which neatly blends a fluidity of movement with a remarkably claustrophobic feel. If your tastes run to special effects and blood-spatter horror films, you are likely to disappointed, for there are none in THE OTHERS; Amenabar craftily creates tension more via what is suggested rather than shown, and doors left ajar and half-heard sounds are his devices of choice; it is all very subtle and yet remarkably chilling.The DVD package is a double-disk set, with the film on one disk and bonuses on the other. Although the bonuses are often quite interesting--particularly a documentary on individuals who actually suffer from hyper-sensitively to sunlight--they actually contribute little to the film itself, and it is a bit surprising that such a small bonus package would require a second disk. The sound for the feature is also problematic re home viewing, and I recommend that viewers play it at top volume, for there is no middle ground--everything is very quiet or very loud, and the contrast adds tremendously to the film's effect.It is extremely difficult to know how to rate this film, for as I've noted the very nature of the story has two embedded flaws: the almost inevitable recognition of the major plot device and the necessity of Kiddman's over-the-top performance. But even though I recognized the nature of the plot device very early in the film, and even though I found ""Grace"" an unlikeable woman, this did not actually prevent me from feeling the icy breath with which director Amenabar endows THE OTHERS.

119,jhclues,Amenabar Achieves the Impossible,10,3 June 2002,"Films that deal with the supernatural, whether in direct or implied terms, are more often than not disappointing, in that they rarely manage to deliver on their promise.  Moreover, films of that same school touted as being `scary,' as well, are usually even more of a let down; so a film that can truly bring a supernatural theme to fruition and be frightening-- joltingly scary even-- in the balance, is one to be celebrated.  `The Others,' written and directed by Aleiandro Amenabar, is a film to be celebrated.  Unlike most films of the genre, this is a true sojourn into regions beyond the known that actually takes you to that final destination.  And when your mouth is so dry you can't swallow, and the palms of your hands have gone clammy cold with sweat, you'll know you've arrived; that Amenabar has succeeded in taking you to that place where few filmmakers dare to even attempt to go. By the end of the film, it's clear that when Amenabar makes a promise, he keeps it.The Channel Islands, 1945:  World War II has ended, and in a picturesque country mansion, the mistress of the manor, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), is at the end of her tether; she has not heard from, nor about, her husband, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) since he went off to war, and all of her servants-- including her children's nanny-- have inexplicably disappeared without notice and without a trace.  Caring for her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), without help, is beginning to overwhelm her, as they suffer from a rare disease that makes them vulnerable to light any brighter than the essential amount of candlepower, a condition that demands the utmost vigilance on the part of their caretaker.  And at the moment, that means Grace, alone, in a house by necessity shrouded in darkness.Help arrives, however, in the form of Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) and her companions, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a young girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), in response to an add placed by Grace in a local newspaper.  All experienced in service, they are the answer to Grace's immediate problems, and she puts them to work immediately.  But it soon becomes apparent to Ms. Mills and the others, that something is amiss in the household; something to do with Grace, who seems to be having trouble coping.  Still, there's more:  Anne insists that she has seen `others' in the house, including a young boy she calls `Victor.'  And, according to Anne, Victor claims that the house belongs to him and those with him.  The real problem, though, is the fact that no one else can see him.  Only Anne. And it's about to take Grace to the very edge of what's left of her sanity. If, indeed, there is any left at all by that time.More than a supernatural thriller, what Amenabar has created here is a gem that stands out from among the rest because of it's sheer purity and brilliance; a diamond with it's own unique cut that dazzles the mind and the eye with it's perfection.  From the opening frames, he sets a deliberate pace and begins to sow the seeds of doubt and question, opening that Pandora's Box of enticement that allows you to consider that otherworldly devices are actually at play here.  In the quietude of the atmosphere he's so deftly created, he winds the tension slowly and subtly until the wheel can turn no more, and just at the point at which others films would fail because they simply cannot deliver on the promise of what has preceded, he hits you with the reality of what is happening, and in a way that will jar your senses.  He does not manipulate and he does not play games; he quite simply and directly delivers one of the best endings ever filmed within this particular genre, especially, and moreover, one that will stand against any of the best from any category.  Because, regardless of genre, very few films have ever delivered so well on what has been promised as the story unfolds. 
Nicole Kidman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in `Moulin Rouge' this year (and deservedly so), but her portrayal of Grace Stewart is the one that should have put her at center stage and clutching the gold on the big night.  Her presentation of Grace is introspective, subtle and reserved; understated and convincing, she fills the screen with a dark charm that is reminiscent, and yet something of the antithesis, of Grace Kelly.  And her screen presence has never been more dynamic.  She enables you to feel her fear, anger, confusion and frustration as the drama moves toward the denouement, and it is Grace through whom you most experience the impact of that final, breathtaking scene, when all is at last revealed.  A truly memorable performance from the gifted and beautiful Kidman, and one that is destined to be more appreciated with the passing of time.Flanagan turns in a memorable performance, as well, creating a character in Ms. Mills that transcends the stereotype of one `in service,' and successfully adds to the aura of mystery surrounding the events as they transpire.  It's a portrayal that demonstrates how important a good character actor is, and how much it can add to a film. 
The supporting cast includes Renee Asherson (Old Lady), Gordon Reid (Assistant), Keith Allen (Mr. Marlish), Michelle Fairley (Mrs. Marlish) and Alexander Vince as Victor.  Riveting entertainment that will slow your breathing and increase your heart rate, `The Others' is an inspired film that offers one of, if not `the' most satisfying endings ever produced in the realm of supernatural cinema.  Amenabar is a magician who has performed the impossible:  He's made the `Super' in supernatural viable and real, succeeding where almost all others who have tried failed.  It's an awe-inspiring accomplishment from an accomplished filmmaker; and it's the magic of the movies.  10/10.",The Others

121,KnightsofNi11,Spooky,8,24 July 2012,"Ghost stories come in all shapes and sizes and The Others, for a while, seems to be a pretty ordinarily shaped ghost story, but there's a lot more to it than meets the eye. Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a devoutly Christian woman who lives in a large country house with her two children who have a disease that makes them react terribly to sunlight. At the beginning of the film Grace hires three new servants to help her around the house, as it is only her and the children because their father is off fighting in World War II. As soon as these new servants come into the house strange things start happening and suspicions arise that the house may be haunted. Clever spookiness ensues in a film that doesn't phone it in on cheap thrills, but rather builds a slow crawling suspense throughout the film.It's always a blessing to watch a film like this. It's one that manages to be spooky and suspenseful, but it's also high quality entertainment. It's a beautifully shot film that uses lighting wonderfully to amp up the chills. One of the major plot points is the children being basically allergic to sunlight. Because of this they can't travel alone through the house. Any room they go into or just pass through has to be darkened. This calls for the constant closing of shutters and drapes that gives the whole house a dreary and depressing ambiance which makes the whole bleak mood of the film all the greater. There is no room for joy or happiness in this story, and the way the ominous story and dim cinematography come together is excellent, and it's what makes this film so utterly creepy.For a long while The Others is fairly straightforward, but also intriguing and unique. It helps knowing that the film is a well rated film by fans and critics because throughout the slow building suspense you know that there will certainly be some sort of great pay off in the end. And there is. What seems like your run of the mill ghost story has a great catch to it that rounds the film off as an awesomely surprising story. This is a great film for any fan of suspense thrillers. It's not painfully terrifying, but just spooky enough to make you shudder the next time you walk through a dark room.",The Others

This film may be one of (quite) a lot, but it certainly is not 13 in a dozen. Although this film is not original at all times (borrowing a bit from the 6th Sense and being sort of predictive) it still is well made, well acted and well directed.

125,FilmOtaku,A throwback to the great spooky Gothic films,7,6 November 2004,"Rarely does a scary film come around that isn't schlocky and obvious. 'The Others', directed by the great Alejandro Amenabar (Abre los Ojos) is a stylish, spooky and fun film to watch that doesn't cheapen itself like so many in the genre. It is 1947 on the island of Jersey in England, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the mother of two small children, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) and Anne (Alakina Mann) who are allergic to the sunlight, so they are not allowed to go outside. Moreover, any room they are in has to be locked with the curtains shut, a cumbersome task in their mansion with its 50 doors. Mysteriously, the mansion's staff left the week before, which precipitates the arrival of three new servants; a gardener and two housekeepers who are promptly hired. Further complicating matters is the fact that Anne keeps talking to an unseen child, and unexplained footsteps, opened curtains and doors opening and shutting are starting to wear thin on the already uber-fragile Grace, until the occurrences threaten their lives.With 'The Others', Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion, the dark rooms lit by candles within the house, both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. Kidman is great as the incredibly brittle and mentally frayed Grace. While she puts on a cool, haughty façade, the circumstances she finds herself in are clearly eating away at her sanity. The actors who play her children are actually quite good themselves, particularly Alakina Mann, who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay, also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent, and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end, it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and well-written regardless, but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent. 'The Others' is not a phenomenal film by any means, but it is a refreshing change from the standard thriller/suspense fare, because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children, (obviously) this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone, as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic, jump-cut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. 'The Others' takes its time to get to its reveal, and it is worth every minute. 7/10Shelly",The Others

And his companion Mrs Mills the housekeeper allows Fionnula Flanagan to let in a tiny bit of warmth and genuine fellow-feeling. But much of the time this is just a confused lady of the house sinking steadily along with her ever-more traumatised (and xeroderma pigmentosum-suffering) children, with all becoming greyer and more misty with each passing moment.

Yes, the same guy who wrote the Spanish film that VANILLA SKY was based on. So, instead of just making a film that rips-off of THE SIXTH SENSE, he also makes it in Spanish, titling it ""Los Otros"". Touche!Nicole Kidman did an okay job of acting and we soon understand that her two children have the rarest of rare diseases. They are allergic to the light. So, when three mysterious servants arrive, strange things begin to happen. The cast is basically English, which is definitively odd since this film was written by a man of Spanish origins. The story moves along quickly and as everything is happening, it all seems to make sense. But then we wonder to ourselves, why is all this happening now? Why did it not happen years earlier? These questions are never explained and that is what helps make the film retched. Better examples of the genre would be the all-time classic, THE SIXTH SENSE, and many more consisting of WHAT LIES BENEATH, DRAGONFLY, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES and about a hundred others. In fact, most of the above films are somehow cliched in the film, so that might be where the title came from. THE OTHERS can mean that the film is consisted of stolen material from ""other"" movies. But, that is only my interpretation. See it for yourself and see what you think. It is okay on a level of spookiness and chills. But that is about it. There are some creepy twists and turns which help the story stay thrilling enough to keep the viewers awake, but after it is over, you will be wondering the same very questions that I was.

But a number of strange occurrences lead her to believe the house may be haunted...Co-produced by Tom Cruise (Kidman's husband at the time) and filmed in Spain with an international cast, THE OTHERS marked the English-language debut of Alejandro Amenábar, previously responsible for such high profile Spanish entries as THESIS (1996) and OPEN YOUR EYES (1997). Amenábar's film aspires to Jamesian sophistication, rejecting bombast for subtlety at every turn, as Kidman's troubled heroine struggles to identify the source of her supernatural experiences (are they real, or just a figment of her overheated imagination?). Kidman is too young for the role, and lacks the necessary gravitas, but she plays it with a fair degree of brittle dignity, particularly in her scenes with Mann, the most confrontational of her children, who is either a malicious prankster intent on frightening her younger brother with manufactured ghost stories, or is genuinely in contact with something sinister lurking within the house.Like THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) before it, THE OTHERS prides itself on a series of climactic 'revelations', some of which tip their hand too early, but Amenábar's screenplay has more than a few surprises in store, especially on second viewing, when the multilayered dialogue is revealed as a masterful patchwork of irony and misdirection. Stage actress Fionnula Flanagan is appropriately enigmatic as Kidman's stoical housekeeper, and there's strong support from Christopher Eccleston and veteran comedian Eric Sykes (here playing it very straight indeed).

He may speak English as a second language, but I couldn't tell from the use of language. Indeed he not only knows English, but also period English and slang!This uses light so sparingly that we get dragged in to this strange candle lit world of locked doors and drapes. What a smart and curious device that creates shadows and in intrigue in every corner - like a permanent night. There is no gore, but despite this it gives you the creeps and has many jumps and frights. I don't care how much you turn up the central heating you will feel cold watching this movie.Good performances all round here and Kidman just gets better and better. She should have been nominated for an Oscar for this. How strange to see Eric Sykes as the gardener with a secret. No English director would have cast him because he is a vet of English TV comedy and not serious cinema.This is not a big enough or original enough a piece to give the title classic, but it does what it sets out to do with style and then some. This is as good as Hitchcock and Kubrick when not hitting their absolute peaks. Think of The Birds and The Shinning and you get the general idea.When you think about it, it manages to do everything with a manor house, a small set of actors and a fog machine. No CGI, no stunt men and no blood. We will know a lot more when the director takes on his next piece, but let us hope he is as good as he appears to be here.",The Others
131,EijnarAmadeus,Creepy and very good Kidman - chills,8,30 June 2003,"THE OTHERS (2001) possible Spoilers((( Nicole Kidman, an actress who made a lot of excitement with her husband Tom Cruise, but then there was a divorce, but Kidman didn't stop making movies, or working with Cruise. Cause her Cruise has been co-working in production and Kidman plays the main character in this creepy movie. It isn't a pure horror movie, it is more like a twist between horror, drama and thriller. And it works well, no doubt about it. The movie is more like an old - fashioned horror movie made by, like, shell I say Alfred Hitchcock. The movie is packed with small creepy scenes that is mostly scary cause of the nasty blackness.The story is about Grace, a woman who is maybe a bit psychological harmed after her husband was killed in the war and that she always has to take care off her two children, Nicholas and Anne who has a sichness that they can't be in daylight. They're living in a big, cold house and soon they hire three persons to work for them; a gardner, a housekeeper and another young girl. Soon, creepy things starts happening in the house....Anne starts complaining about a boy named Victor...STARS: **** 4/5 (it's a coming classic horror movie)",The Others
132,deatman9,Not as good as everyone says.,6,11 December 2012,I actually had never seen this movie up until last night but I had nothing else to watch so I decided to give it a try because everyone seemed to love it on here. First thing the acting in it is good from everyone except the little girl. The plot is quite good with an interesting original twist however the movie is quite slow and dull for me.I thought it was going to be somewhat scary and it was not at all.This movie is about a young family in England circa 1940s. The father has gone off to war and the mother is forced to stay at home and take care of her children who have a rare disease which makes them ultra alergic to the sunlight. Strange things start to happen though as the kids start to see ghosts.This movie was OK it was just a little boring for me. Slow and dull just like most English things. Still more exciting then Paranormal Activity of course.,The Others
133,esteban1747,A different thriller,5,11 August 2002,"When you see this film you may consider it a thriller as any other one, but this is a mistake when you arrive at its end. This is an original thriller which could have better plot for its two first third parts, it is too boring to see Nicole Kidman always so hysterical and less smart than her daughter, crying any time for anything. Also the idea that a ghost will not recognize itself as such and that any other ghost will have to come to aid you in identifying yourself as a ghost is a bit illogic even for those who believe in a second life after death.",The Others
134,vostf,Too much work and not enough screenplay makes the Others a dull film,5,2 January 2002,"Is it sufficient to be a master director to make a very good film? The Others and the other movie-with-a-much-similar-story proves not. It's nice and halfway through the story we begin to wake up, and so? Nothing because the whole script derives from one idea which is to tell a peculiar story and explain only in the end why it is so peculiar. Thus nothing really happens except cheap thrills here and there to draw some kind of a tension. Some evoked Hitchcock: he played on his audience's nerves which is a lot harder than just stating our nerves are tensile. I have had enough of those movies that think they're clever because there is something to be said but ye shalt wait for it.",The Others
135,Christian_Dimartino,Bone chilling.,10,12 July 2010,"Nicole Kidman stars in the supernatural thriller, The Others. The others succeeds in everything it tires in: It's creepy, smart, incredibly entertaining, and at the end of the day it actually makes sense.Kidman is terrific as Grace, a mother living in the 30's. She lives in a mansion with her two children, who have a skin disorder, and is single do to her husband being in the war. Things start to get pretty wild when three servants arrive at their house. Things involving the paranormal. and they begin to make Grace look crazy. But as it turns out, nothing and nobody is what it seems.The Others is a extremely creepy and engaging thriller. It's a thriller that delivers what it's supposed to: the thrills, the scares. Nicole Kidman's performance is terrific. One of her best. I can't believe it took me this long to see this movie. The statement just about to be used is going to be used: It had the same effect on me that The Strangers had.This film is a breath of fresh air. It like lots of thrillers has a great twist. For once, a twist that you won't see coming. M Night Shamalyn used to have the thrilling touch. But not anymore. This seems like his kind of movie. But he hasn't done a good film in about eight years, so I don't think he's good enough for this movie.Recently i've been reviewing movies that i've missed out on. I don't know how I missed out on this one. The Others is a brilliant film.If you haven't seen it, you got to. It's almost better than M. Night Shamalyn's Unbreakable and Signs. Though most people won't agree with those. They'd choose The Sixth sense. I think that movie is overrated, but it's more similar to this one, Thumbs way up.The Others: A+",The Others
136,Movie-12,"Very suspenseful, great performances, effective atmosphere--but the timing is way off. *** (out of fur)",8,5 September 2001,"THE OTHERS / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	It must be difficult making a movie like ""The Others,"" when the entire plot is based on one final twist. The filmmakers know what that twist is, and it's probably tough keeping it a secret. Take ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Game,"" or  ""Fight Club,"" for instance.  The actors know they are playing character's with a special surprise in store for them, but their characters don't. The performances must stay true to the story after the final twist is revealed, but must not foreshadow what is in store for us in the final scenes. 	""The Others"" has another one of those endings that makes you want to see the movie again just to see if everything adds up correctly. Unfortunately, most people won't have the patience to sit through it for a second time. The film, directed, composed, and written by Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amendabar, contains a convincing atmosphere and knows how to build tension the audience can cut with a knife, but the timing is off. It makes us wait way too long for something to happen that will relieve the fog-thick suspense.   	 The film takes place on the secluded Isle of Jersey in the final days of World War II, where a young woman awaits the return of her husband who went to war when his country needed him. Nicole Kidman plays this quiet, subtle woman, named Grace, who spends her days and night taking care of her children (James Bentley and Alakina Mann) in her gorgeous Victorian mansion. She hires a new trio of house servants to replace the crew who mysteriously disappeared. Then strange things begin to happen. Grace's daughter explains that she has been communicating with an unseen boy. At first, Grace does not believe her child, but when Grace herself starts to hear strange noises, and witness unusual events, she also questions the possibility of an intruder inside her home. 	""The Others"" lingers for a long time. It does get under our skin and create a strong, spooky mood, similar to that of the old-fashioned haunted house movies. The film makes us believe we are in a dark, lonely house, and that someone, or something, may be inside with us. Nicole Kidman's performance is contagious. She infects the audience with Grace's fear and suspicion. Easily one of the year's best performances, Kidman stirs the terror with a gripping, uneasy edge. The supporting actors do not steal the scenes from Kidman, she deserves the focus, but they still give her enough material to react to. 	It's too bad that more doesn't happen in the movie. ""The Others"" eventually becomes redundant-it's scene after scene of Grace walking through dark rooms and closing the blinds to her house-her children are allergic to the light (a plot element that doesn't contribute much to the story). The film also stumbles when a specific character enters the picture-the event is highly anticipated, but the movie doesn't know what to do when it happens. It's worth seeing because of the final revelation, the spookiness of the atmosphere, and the performance by Kidman. Alejandro Amendabar must think that with a story like this, the less you reveal, the more suspenseful it is. ""The Others"" proves a different theory: less is not more-more is more.",The Others
137,FlickJunkie-2,A triumphant American debut for Alejandro Amenabar,9,25 July 2002,"Writer/director Alejandro Amenabar has burst onto the motion picture scene in a major way with this, his first American film.  The Spanish auteur had already made a mark in Spain with `Abre Los Ojos', a film he wrote, directed and scored, which was remade four years later by Cameron Crowe as `Vanilla Sky', starring Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman's ex-husband who co-produced both films.This film is outstanding in almost every respect.  With a microscopic budget of $17 million and one bankable star, Amenabar turned a great idea into a brilliant film.  As he has in past films, he also composed the music, which is exceptionally powerful and a perfect fit for the story.  There are few directors with the talent to write, direct and compose this effectively.  It is even more impressive when you consider that he is barely 30 years old.Amenabar's use of shadow and light is phenomenal and he is extremely adroit at utilizing the camera to maximize the suspense.  He is also very insightful in his direction of the actors.  While Nicole Kidman is a veteran, the children are both in their first film and Amenabar elicits terrific performances from each.The story is elegant in its simplicity and the ending is difficult to predict.  The use of the séance scene to flip the film on its ear is inspired, creating a defining moment by taking an indirect approach.  He brings us a supernatural thriller that is scary without the need for blood and gore, making the most of what is unseen.  Often compared with `Sixth Sense' because of the final plot twist, this film is better in most of its technical elements, despite being slightly less flashy in its presentation.As if Amenabar's genius weren't enough, Nicole Kidman kicks out the jams and delivers one of her best performances to date.  She is utterly believable as Grace, the neurotically overprotective matriarch and mistress of the house. Her interaction with the children is exceedingly genuine, replete with nurturing affection and backbiting irritation at her daughter's perceived recalcitrance.  Grace's daughter Anne is played by Alakina Mann who gives a phenomenal performance in her first film.  Mann is sassy and stubborn and shows a strong backbone in the face of her oppressive mother.  James Bentley, as her brother Nicholas, plays off Mann extremely well.  Bentley's timidity and reliance on his sister creates a strong symbiosis between them that is extremely realistic.This is a fantastic thriller by a director with a very promising future. While the pacing is sometimes overly deliberate, the story, music, camerawork, and the acting are first rate.  I rated it 9/10.  Don't miss it.",The Others
138,sashank_kini-1,What a twist in the tale!,7,3 April 2009,"I saw this movie yesterday on the television and was so surprised by it. The Sixth Sense is one hell of a movie but this movie to gives it good competition. Even though the twist end in Sixth sense is shocking, the one over her, which slightly resembles the former movie, still manages to leave one flabbergasted.The beginning of the movie looked a bit fairy-tale-ish because of the old and dilapidated building, weird characters. I thought that some creature would pop out all of a sudden, judging by the title of the movie. But, as the story progressed, I was so hooked to it that every time I had to go and attend to something, I sighed and paused the DVD angrily.The characters are one of a kind with Nicole playing an over protective, stringent mother beautifully. The children too play their parts well even though they are not so likable as Malcolm. Out of the three servants, the old lady covers more scenes and plays her role effectively. There are double twists in the end, the second one which no one would have thought of. The atmosphere is chilly, the scenes are intense and the movie is great. 7 out of 10.",The Others
139,khatcher-2,"Though scaries are not my favourite genre, there is no denying we have a new genius here",7,29 September 2001,"I do not usually go in for anything in the phantasmagoric line; even very few horror films have attracted my attention. This is primarily because I like theatre and cinema to be rather realist, I like it to say something about the world we live in, society, personalities, human values, and so on. I do not look for escapism as a source of entertainment, whether in books, on the stage or on the screen. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule - `Gormenghast' by Mervyn Peake, `The Lord of the Rings' by J.R.R.Tolkien (I am not referring to the film), and of course the universal `Cien Años de Soledad' by Gabriel García Márquez, among books, or Walt Disney's `Fantasia'. Such that the run-of-the-mill factory-produced science-fiction films generally do not attract me either - exceptions being Stanley Kubrick's `2001: A Space Odyssey' and Ridley Scott's `Bladerunner'.Alejandro Amenábar might change my preferences a little;  having seen `Abre los Ojos' (qv) only very recently, I was persuaded rather perfunctorily to go and see `Los Otros' the other night, and did not expect much from what seemed a priori to be merely a `ghost story'. Which is precisely what `Los Otros' turned out to be. But directed and written by a young fellow who also composed the music and seems bent on updating Hitchcockian traditions: Alejandro Amenábar is an extraordinary and highly talented young man. The curious mixture of British Actors with Nicole Kidman, recorded in English, but is a Spanish film, makes it evident that Amenábar had his sights aimed at America. However, the film was not shot on Jersey Island in the English Channel, but in a large `caserón' a few kilometres inland from the Cantabrian Coast in Santander, Northern Spain. The photography at all times, but especially through the fog, is spectacular, but Javier Aguirresarobe is already a past master, having already filmed `Secretos del Corazón' (qv), `La Niña de tus Ojos' (qv), `El Perro del Hortelano', `Beltenebros' and `La Fuente Amarilla' (qv), among other titles. Nicole Kidman is pretty good; she plays the part of a mother of two children who is somewhat nervous, even hysterical, as she goes through the house opening and closing the doors as she goes. `Her' two children are very good: Alakina Mann and James Bentley play their parts with a good balance between naturalness and interpretation without exceeding too much in the latter.And the music is extraordinarily good as it accompanies the different scenes, never overdoing any set leit-motif, with some fine orchestration - although in this I think Amenábar had a helping hand from others. There were moments in which subconsciously some influence could be felt from John Barry perhaps, and I also noted a brief passage that seemed to have roots in the Portuguese `fado'. As Rolling Stone Magazine says, this is a psychological thriller; a little in the Clive Barker style but without all that gore, or even certain concepts from some of Stephen King's works in which `the thing' itself is not so ominously present. But, certainly, if Hitchcock WAS the master, surely we have here a new one? Make space over there at Hollywood - a new little genius is about to cross the Atlantic. Unfortunately.",The Others
140,raybennetthays,"Wow how original, not.",7,16 October 2021,"I liked the others but the ending kind of ruined it.It was gorgeously shot and quite suspenseful, and the acting really worked but the ending ripped off the sixth sense in so many ways.Also it's kind of funny actually,I'm gonna give the others a B+.",The Others
141,LebowskiT1000,Much better than expected.,8,11 June 2002,"I don't know why, but I had rather low expectations of this film.  I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  I still wouldn't say this was a terribly great movie.  It was good, but nothing great.  I'm actually VERY shocked that this film made it into IMDB's top 250.Also, I must admit that the film was MUCH better on the second viewing, perhaps it gets even better on the third time around.  I'll have to test that theory one of these days.The acting is pretty good for all the cast members, Nicole Kidman being the only cast-member that I've previously heard of.  Although, I did recognize Christopher Eccleston (Charles Stewart) from ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"", but I certainly didn't know him by name when I first saw the film.The story is quite interesting and takes a very interesting route of telling the story.  There is a number of similarities between this film and ""The Sixth Sense"", but I think I must concede that this film is pretty good in it's own right.  The only complaint about the story in the film is, I didn't like that the children had this weird photosensitive disease.  Does this condition ACTUALLY exist?  I can't imagine it does.  But you know the saying, sometimes Fact is stranger than Fiction.  The children having this condition does work quite well with the story, so maybe I should just accept it.If you're into creepy/strange/odd/ghostly movies like ""The Sixth Sense"", then you'll probably like this film too.  I would have a tough time saying this film is for everyone, but like I said, if you're into creepy movies, then you may want to take a peak.  Anyhow, hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading.-Chris",The Others
142,Nightman85,A beautiful and atmospheric chiller.,10,20 May 2008,"Hit chiller from the summer of 2001 is a terrifically twisted and beautifully made ghost flick that recalls the old-fashion spookiness of The Haunting (1963).Woman living in isolation with her two young children begins to believe that they are not alone in their huge, dark house.Alejandro Amenaber delivers an intriguing and compelling story, full of mystery, suspense, jolts, and capped with one mind-blowing twist. It's a fully gripping thriller with some likable and well-fleshed out characters. The direction of Amenaber is wonderfully atmospheric and done with a nice touch of subtly that builds tension even higher. The musical score is nicely moody too.Nicole Kidman does an excellent performance, as does young Alakina Mann and James Bentley as her children.

A month later in 1999, more ghost movies followed where there was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon proving to be more of an effective and original thriller. Other ghost movies followed but none will ever come close than ""The Others."" Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a widow to a soldier during the events of World War II who shelters two of her children, Anna and Nichols, in a mansion all by herself. Not only is she a fanatical Christian where she gives lectures and wants the children to remember certain things, but she doesn't allow the children to leave the house due to a skin disease they have. She hires help from Fionnula Flanagan who plays Bertha Mills, along with Eric Sykes (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) and Elaine Cassidy to assist her. Grace soon discovers weird things going around in her mansion before asking the children if they been horse playing and the housekeepers if they've been touching things and moving objects around that weren't suppose to move.Suspicion turns to threats, threats lead to clues, and everything will be unravel sooner or later with a shocking ending.I'm not familiar with Alejandro Amenábar's work, but as soon as I say ""The Others,"" all I have to say is that it's one hell of a movie beating the hell out of ""The Sixth Sense"" with its amazing cast and its edge of your seat/heart pounding moments making it one of my favorite horror movies of all time.Like ""Alien,"" don't you dare see this film alone or in the dark.",The Others

But somehow my friend convinced me to go see it and I'm really glad I did.It was the perfect movie for a rainy Friday night in April.To begin with, this movie probably contains the best performance delivered by Nicole Kidman. She is very believable and was a perfect choice. The two young actors were even better. Is it these magical and brilliant thrillers(""Sixth sense"", ""Unbreakable"") that bring the best out of children actors, or is it just my imagination. Anyway, a brilliant movie that can easily be compared to Shyamalan's ""Sixth sense"", especially the ending part, but in my opinion a very different movie. I consider the comparison to be flattering, since ""Sixth sense"" is well, an amazing and unprecedented movie experience, and ""The others"" produces a similar atmosphere, but it ends there. This movie takes its own path, and it does so very successfully. To make a horror movie without any blood, simply by playing with sound and light is extraordinary, and I realized it only after I read a review by a great Slovene film critic. Great, great acting, a thrilling and exciting story and of course a brilliant ending make this one of the best movie of 2001 and Alejandro Amenábar passed his first Hollywood movie making experience with flying colors.

152,SkullScreamerReturns,Haunted house film done right (and with a unique angle),9,28 March 2021,"The Others is an old favorite of mine. I first saw it when it was quite new (unfortunately not in theater, that would have been amazing. I guess I was too busy putting my money in music cd's and concerts those days.) It's a movie that is best when you don't know much about the plot, so don't read more reviews, just watch it. But then again, it's an enjoyable film to watch again also if you've seen it before. It has such a lot of value in it.So, I'm not going to talk about the plot much. It's about an old house where something strange starts happening. That's all you need to know. It's a particularly slow movie but that's where the atmosphere lies. I watched it yesterday in a tired mood when I wasn't feeling like anything too action-packed or noisy, and this one was a perfect fit for that kind of evening.Usually when nowadays coming across a film that is about some kind of haunted house setting, it's usually some very bland Exorcist ripoff where some demonic spirit infests some person and starts raving around. I don't usually care about that kind of movies. I like more about traditional gothic ghost stories that are more subtle in style. The Others falls more into that category, even though it's also a bit different than usual ghost stories.Because its slow pace this is a film that could have ended boring but the director Alejandro Amenábar seems to know exactly what he's doing. Also the acting is pretty good. Nicole Kidman is excellent as the neurotic and sorrowful-eyed mother. Another highlight is Fionnula Flanagan as the charismatic and a bit mysterious nanny character. Set pieces also deserve compliment because the house and its surroundings pay perfectly tribute to old gothic horror novels and films.

154,Gafke,A Masterpiece of Gothic Horror,10,3 January 2006,"World War 2 has just ended, but Charles Stewart has yet to return home to the island estate where his family await him. His wife, Grace, is a highly stressed woman. All of the servants have recently quit without notice, leaving Grace alone to care for the two children, Nicholas and Anne. To Grace's relief, three new servants arrive and offer their services; Mr. Tuttle tends the grounds, the mute Lydia takes care of the housework and the wise old Mrs. Mills becomes the children's new nanny. Nicholas and Anne are both highly photosensitive children and can never be exposed to sunlight, or else they will die within minutes. Therefore, the curtains are kept tightly closed and the gloomy mansion is lit only by weak candlelight. But although Grace seems to be getting her life back under control at last, something sinister seems to have invaded the mansion. Anne swears she has seen ""others"" in the house: an old, blind woman and a little boy. Grace suspects Anne of making up stories but soon, she too is hearing odd noises. Footsteps can be heard upstairs in rooms locked and empty. A grand piano plays by itself. Voices and whispers echo throughout the house. As the emotionally fragile Grace begins to fall apart, the terrible truth becomes unavoidable: the house is haunted. But who, exactly, are the ghosts?This is such a great, classy ghost story, genuinely frightening without a drop of blood anywhere in sight. Nicole Kidman delivers a knockout performance as Grace, who is so tightly wound up that you keep waiting for her to explode at any given moment. The entire cast is awesome, if you want to know the truth. Fionnula Flanagan is kindly and sweet, but also scary as hell when she wants to be. Alakina Mann is seriously creepy as Anne, the somewhat sadistic older sister. The mansion and its surrounding grounds drip with Gothic horror, shrouded in mist, silence, neglected gravestones and fallen leaves. I suppose I ought to have seen the great twist ending coming, but I honestly never suspected a thing and was exhilarated by the revelation. Highlights include a scary voice in an empty storage room, a music room door that slams shut in Kidman's face, some eerie photographs of the dead and, of course, the great scene between Grace and an old, blind woman wearing her daughter's dress. Truly creepy stuff! Fans of films like The Changeling and The Eye will really love The Others.

The Others in my opinion is narrowly better. I think that the film is so wonderfully shot and Kidmans performance is so good it narrowly beats Bruce Willis's flick. The gorgeous Nicole (you idiot Tom!) Kidman steals the show here as the mother of two children, the kids are photo sensitive and will die if exposed to light, after excuciating pain and suffocation that is, and their conditon makes way to create the chilling atmosphere of the film by the fact that the house is in near constant darkness. The films lighting is very spooky and the direction was very good, I was very uneasy watching this and I must say that it takes a lot to scare me but I nearly had a heart attck on a number of occasions with some very well timed jump moments. The film is scary, it makes you feel so nervy because of the dark atmosphere built up through brilliant cinematography and an eerie score. The other actors are good, the three people who play the mysterious house keepers were good and the two kids were a very high standard although do not compare to Haley Joel Osment but then again he is so far better than most child actors he is almost un-naturally good for someone his age. As I said before Nicole Kidman is excellent, she really earned some desreved respect in this film and Moulan Rouge. The film is very good with some great twists one of which I did see coming although it is not blindingly obvious, I just followed the classic rules of the movie world that most films of this type usually go by. If you stop and think you'll probably guess the main twist because the film makers will always go for the jugular when it comes to a plot twist. Overall 9/10 make sure spare undies are readily available before watching.",The Others

I must say that without Nicholes and those kids (whoever they are) this film would have just been another 40 mil. grossing pic. Because of Nichole this film was so scary, the only other that has scared me like this was ""The Eye"" a terrifying film from over in Asia, directed by (I think the Pang brothers)- and the original ""Candyman"" (of course I was 12 then, and did the whole Candyman thing in the mirror more than once) I just know that even after I had seen it a couple times, I still got freaked out even though I knew the result.

As the sixth sense (99) or the island of fear (I0), ""The Others"" is worthy of its end, with a regular performance of bipolar Nicole Kidman the highlight is for the children's actors, and also for the director of photography that brings a Climate that contrasts with the strong bright light of the sun with complete darkness passing through all the color palettes. With an honest script, that does not try to pass the leg, but knew how to make the catch with the viewer, Alejandro Amenábar does a good job, because the complete work of the film makes him intelligent and intriguing, although he creates several subplots, and does not explain any And with several repetitions of ideas that do not compromise the experience of the film, Alejandro Amenábar uses the soundtrack the way one has to use in a horror film, high, sharp and uncomfortable.

160,fciocca,"Excellent mystery horror movie, with an outstanding plot twists and unexpected ending.",8,5 August 2021,"Despite being exactly 20 years old, ""The Others"" is still a solid mystery/horror thriller that keeps the audience on the verge until the very end. There are some predictable scenes, but for the most part, plot twists are really surprising and the ending is completely unexpected, at least for me. Nicole Kidman did a good job, but I think that her acting is sometimes a little bit exaggerated, especially when she gets scared. Grace is a woman that strongly believes in religion and I liked that she has many arguments with her daughter Anne about deep topics. Alakina Mann takes a lot of screen time, while Christopher Eccleston who played Charles, is left a little bit aside. I wish that the director had balanced these two roles, giving a similar relevance. However, characterization is really good, the cast is small, so the movie had the time to really introduce and develop everyone in a meaningful way.What I really appreciated is that there is no violence at all in this movie, and yet it is scarier than a lot of recent thrillers. Director builds tension up with a certain camera movement, or with a specific shot, but there is no sudden loud music or noises, therefore no jump scares. Locations are chilling, the whole film is set in this enormous old English manor located on an island. This brings a desolating mood. The set is captivating and the production design is great.""The Others"" is a movie with a straightforward and simple plot that explores a lot of inner human fears about life, death and the unknown. As a horror lover, this is for sure a small gem that I wish I discovered sooner. If you are into mystery, thriller and psychological horror, I urge you to watch this film. It is a mature production that really surprised me.",The Others
161,dr_clarke_2,Old school gothic horror at the start of the twenty-first century,8,3 October 2021,"Alejandro Amenábar's 2001 film The Others is notably for being the first English language film to win the Best Film award at the Goya Awards. It won other awards besides, but it's probably more relevant for its target audience to note that it often crops up on lists of the best horror films of the twenty-first century. And whilst two decades has perhaps blunted its impact, it remains memorably creepy, if slightly flawed.The Others tells the story of Grace Stewart a war widow living in a large mansion on Jersey with her two children Anne and Nicholas, both of whom suffer from an unspecified photosensitive condition that means that sunlight could kill them. The arrival of three new servants coincides with creepy goings on in the house, as Grace and her children start to realise that there are mysterious ""others"" in the house, sinister unseen presences that threaten their existence. Thus, the story unfolds like many gothic ghost stories, but on this occasion it turns out that there is something of a twist in the tale...
The Others is constructed like a traditional haunted house movie, with no gore but plenty of jump scares and lashings of atmosphere. It gets surprisingly creepy very suddenly when Anne starts talking about Victor. Unfortunately, the big twist becomes largely obvious about halfway through when servants Mrs Mills and Mr Tuttle hide some gravestones from Grace and remark that the fog won't let her get far from the house, after which Grace's supposedly dead husband Charles turns up. From this point onwards, it is clear to the audience that it is the Stewart family members who are ghosts, although this remains a satisfying variation on audience expectations and Amenábar includes a second, more shocking, twist that reveals just how Grace and her children actually died.Amenábar wrote and directed the film (as well as composing the elegant, haunting score) and he writes to his strength as a director, exploiting the scripted contrivance of the need for the house to be kept in darkness to striking effect, with cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe making good use of the enforced darkness and shadows of the sets. This is a film that (for the most part) achieves its scares without resorting to special effects, instead using camera and editing techniques to chill. Having said that, the film's hybrid nature might make it seem ever so slightly off-kilter to British audiences, since it is set in Jersey, but filmed in Kent and Spain and is an English-language Spanish film with an Australian actress playing the lead and an otherwise British and Irish cast.Nicole Kidman stars as the brittle Grace Stewart, and her performance is rather mannered at times, presumably due to the English accent she is required to adopt. Generally however she's very convincing as an increasingly terrified woman whose life seems to be falling apart. Child actors Alakina Mann and James Bentley give remarkably convincing performances as Anne and Nicholas, and strong support is provided by Christopher Eccleston as Charles Stewart, Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs Mills, Eric Sykes as Mr Tuttle, Keith Allen as Mr Marlish, and Renée Asherson, who manages to be spectacularly creepy as the Old Lady. Amenábar's characterisation helps: there is, for example, a certain snide satisfaction to be had in watching Grace's trite Biblical moralising punctured, especially when we eventually learn exactly how she and her children died.The Others was released in the first year of the twenty-first century, but in its approach and feel it recalls nineteenth century ghost stories such as The Turn of the Screw. Whilst the film isn't perfect, it proves that it is still possibly to deliver chilling supernatural thrillers without resorting to gore or significant special effects and that's no mean feat: it's success is a testament to Amenábar's talent not only as a director, but also as a story-teller.",The Others
162,jayjaycee,Twisted and uniquely scary,9,10 April 2020,"""The Others"" is a 2001 mystery horror thriller directed by Alejandro Amenábar starring Nicole Kidman and Christopher Ecclestone. From time to time, I like to revisit some films with an either complicated or twisted story to see if it's even more well constructed than before. One of those titles is definitely this one. Roughly one year ago, I already gave it a spin at a film party and was blown away by it afterwards. With the knowledge of what would happen, this rewatch revealed even more of its subtle brilliance. First of all, the overall style is absolutely well elaborated. An old English mansion, seemingly neverending fog and authentic costumes make this film so tremendously atmospheric, but all of this would be in vain, if it wasn't for the general cinematography. It's the reason the film is so moody in the first place. The contrast between night and day, light and darkness make it come to life so easily. Without it, the film would be much less entertaining. Another factor the film would not work without is the central performance by Australian beauty Nicole Kidman. Not only does she nail the British accent decently, the way she leads the viewer through the subtle horror makes it so genuinely breathtaking. That's where we come to another point: Amenábar's screenplay. It creates such a creepy atmosphere although ... nothing really happens? To be honest, yes. Aside from some one or two scenes, the film completely passes on using graphic effects. There's no monster in this film, no terrifying entity that will haunt you in your dreams afterwards. It instead relies on mild scares and one might think ""Isn't that film terribly boring then?"". Surprisingly, the total opposite. The film takes place in your head and doesn't resolve what it's dealing with until the very end of the film, but before it reaches the shocking final conclusion there's Kidman who's singlehandedly in charge of creeping out the audience. It's her reactions, her terrified facial expressions that put the viewer in the same position as her and it's this helplessness that also effects the audience that make it so genuinely bone chilling. It's anything but your average ghost story with an obvious threat to escape from, because this threat in here isn't obviously definable. I guess that was what many people back in the day expected to see and why it's fairly underrated by several. It never intended to live from its graphic effects, Amenábar always wanted to terrify the audience just by his phenomenal screenplay. Speaking of which, it's even more brilliant upon a rewatch. Knowing about the mind blowing double plot twist in the end, I realized how it points out countless small hints over the course of the film that actually blatantly give away the ending. It's obvious and subtle at the same time and when it comes to a scene where it should be absolutely clear what really happened, it adds a small detail that makes it ambiguous. It gives the viewer so much information, both true and misleading, but it always makes so much sense nevertheless. This doesn't only happen once, it happens in every single case. I knew that it worked, because my brother who's never seen it before and didn't know about it was genuinely devastated by the ending while I sat there and was like ""Oh, he probably has a clue now"" a number of times. But he didn't. Another stylistic device of it is the subliminal juxtaposition of religion and atheism, as it at the same time denies and confirms the existence of God. All in all, this intelligently written film is an underrated gem that knows to frighten you without being too graphic. The main reason this film disappointed the expectations of so many is probably how it was advertised, as it is a mystery thriller with horror elements rather than a horror film with thriller elements. But if you're able to put aside those false expectations you're in for a minimalistic but definitely frightening flick that builds up its tension with a spooky scenery and by playing mind games with you. It's psychological thriller in its best form that only uses the supernatural to lead you astray. An underappreciated and well crafted gem.",The Others

Well-acted, too, all around.  Here's hoping Nicole Kidman keeps getting the good jobs.  And those kids too, and let's not leave out Mrs. Mills.  Great characters, great acting.I have to wonder if I'll enjoy it as much on second viewing, or third or fourth, like ""The Sixth Sense.""

168,mnpollio,"Refreshingly old-fashioned, character-driven haunted house story",8,21 August 2009,"Set in the isolation of the Jersey isles in the days directly following the conclusion of World War 2, Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, an upright Catholic mother coping with the absence of her husband who has yet to return from the front and the burden of raising two precocious children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) whose deadly allergy to sunlight requires her to keep their immense home shrouded in darkness. Into their strange home arrive an eccentric trio of servants, headed by the seemingly benevolent housekeeper Mrs. Mills. Shortly thereafter, Grace finds their lives turned inside-out as it becomes increasingly apparent that they are not alone in the house and in fact may be the targets of a malevolent haunting. Alejandro Amenabar's lush haunted house story is moody, atmospheric and plays far more like a richly textured old-fashioned film from the 1940s than the garish gross-outs and rock-'em/sock-'em visuals that cater to the attention deficit audiences of today. He has been blessed with a stellar cast, spooky settings and a solid screenplay, which keep the audience guessing as to what is going on. Sharp-eyed viewers might guess some of the elements, but it is doubtful that they will guess all of them as Amenabar has a tendency to consistently provide new twists to muddy the waters. Bentley and, particularly, Mann are credible, sympathetic youngsters, who may be victims to their physical health, but are often more astute as to what may be happening than their mother. Fionnula Flanagan is an inspired choice as the motherly housekeeper, whose unflappable demeanor masks a bit of the sinister. Much of the film rests on Kidman and her interpretation of the not always likable Grace. At the start of the film, Kidman presents Grace as rigid and unwavering – a woman to whom no obstacle cannot be overcome by sheer will and a reading of scripture. She honestly seems to love her children, but seems torn between the resentment of constantly living in darkness and isolation on their behalf and embracing the inherent martyrdom of such an existence. There is a certain bit of viewer satisfaction in watching her world shaken up a bit and seeing her iron façade start to slip. Kidman does a marvelous job of walking the line between making Grace a force to be reckoned without turning her into a hateful tyrant and then slowly transitioning her into a far more complicated woman, whose emotions slowly start bubbling to the surface. I actually find this a far more difficult and intriguing performance than the one for which she would win the Oscar the following year in The Hours. A truly worthwhile and haunting film that actually grows on the viewer even moreso over time.",The Others
169,Eternality,The Others is assured of a spot in the upper echelons of contemporary horror cinema where films like The Sixth Sense and The Orphanage reside.,8,8 September 2010,"Alejandro Amenabar's first foray into English-language filmmaking is a largely successful one. One of the most striking filmmakers to emerge in the late 90s, Amenabar is a skillful craftsman whose talent extends beyond directing into screen writing and also into film score composition. Born in Chile but raised in Spain, the director of acclaimed dramas such as Open Your Eyes (1997) and the Oscar-winning The Sea Inside (2004) gives us a fine addition to the horror genre with The Others, a mainstream production made with authority.The Others is assured of a spot in the upper echelons of contemporary horror cinema where films like Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (1999) and Bayona's The Orphanage (2007) reside. In an uninformed reality, Amenabar's film comes across as a fusion between the two above-mentioned pictures. That being said, it would make more sense to chronologically observe the influences each has had on one another over the years. Similar to Shyamalan's film, The Others has a climatic twist at the end (don't worry, there are no spoilers ahead) which equals in ambitiousness but strangely unmatched in terms of shock value.The Others stars an excellent Nicole Kidman in the lead role as the mother of two children whom are photosensitive (read: allergic to sunlight) and must be kept perpetually in the dark (an intriguing plot device). The huge house they live in does have a sinister past of a ghostly nature. What seems like a straightforward ghost story turns into an exercise in atmospheric mood setting. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe creates lingering, almost elegant-like shots of the exterior of the house which is nearly always hidden in thick fog. For interior scenes it is mostly lit by candlelight (a requirement of the plot device), giving an eerie glow that is both warm yet chilling.Speaking of chills, The Others has one prolonged spine-tingling sequence in the final third: the two children 'escape' from the confines of their room in the middle of the night only to find themselves in a small graveyard with suspicious servants pursuing them. The mood setting here achieves its pinnacle. Amenabar does stick to the rigid expectations of the genre, but he explores them with a fresh approach mainly through its unconventional plot.The role of darkness versus light is reversed in this film. Here, the children seek solace in the dark but are traumatized by daylight. Their mother, on the other hand, feels uncomfortable in darkness but is at ease when it is bright. This allows Amenabar to tap on the fears of the characters and to create tension in two extreme settings. The Others is clever filmmaking, boasts artistry and is clear in its execution. At its heart, it is a film about challenging one's beliefs and the need to stand true and firm when these beliefs are challenged.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomeno.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",The Others
170,cosmic_quest,Horror at its best,9,19 October 2007,"At a time when horror films constitute silly teenagers blindly wandering into danger and unnecessary gore, 'The Others' is like a breath of fresh air. It goes back to the roots of the horror genre, employing an eerie atmosphere and mysterious characters to conjure the chilly backbone of the film.'The Others' is set in the Forties and revolves around staunchly Catholic Grace Stewart, who lives in an old mansion located on the island of Jersey with her highly photo-sensitive children ten-year-old Anne and six-year-old Nicholas. The house is almost permanently entrenched in darkness, in deference to the children's condition, and Grace's husband is lost in war, only enhancing the sense of gloom to the story. One morning, three servants mysteriously turn up at the door of the Stewart mansion, despite Grace having not yet advertised the posts, to replace the previous servants who had suddenly left their posts a week earlier. Anne then begins to maintain the house is haunted, her deduction supported by the fact locked doors left ajar, closed curtains suddenly being found opened and furniture moving when there's no-one in the room. Grace, deeply ingrained in her religious belief that ghosts don't exist, initially refuses to believe her daughter but soon she questions her faith as she can't deny there is something ominous about the house...Nicole Kidman gives an excellent performance as the almost cold and aloof Grace, who does love her children dearly even if she doesn't always show it openly. Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy, as the three servants, are suitably mysterious by showing they seem to know more than they let on, leaving viewers questioning their motives from the start. But it is the young child actors, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, who steal the show as Anne and Nicholas. Despite their age and inexperience, both children given first-class depictions of their characters, showing their isolation thanks to their medical conditions and their reliance on one another despite typical sibling discord at times. Mann, in particular, excels in portraying the stubborn nature of Anne and her precarious relationship with her mother. It is a shame this child never continued her acting career because she is a credit to young British acting.'The Others' is a subtle horror films for those sick of cheap Hollywood horror flicks and are seeking interesting characters and an intelligent plot. While there are no special effects or buckets of blood in this film, in the tradition of 'The Exorcist' and 'The Devil's Backbone', it instead relies upon more old-fashion methods of frightening the audience, which are far more effective. The story is well-paced, leaving the audience guessing what is happening and what the characters' motives are right to the end.This film has to be one of the best horror films I've ever seen and puts many films in the horror genre to shame.

That chill running down your spine, your heart pounding so loud the person next to you can hear it, eye lids closed, screams of terror, quickly followed by a shamefully amused giggle. That's the ride a good scary movie delivers for you. That's what ""The Others"" keeps you through.It doesn't have a brilliant plot, the twists aren't ""dementially"" cool as in The Sixth Sense, but it's got a feel of terror embroidered on its frames. Yes, it gets that horrific in the best of ways! A mother and her children live in a huge house, alone, until a some new servants pop up in front of their door and commit to their housekeeping tasks. But there's something wrong about the whole thing from the very beginning. The fog, the house, the children, the words...it's a feeling that takes hold of you and doesn't really let you go until near the end. It's authentic psychological horror, brilliant in all regards, not showing any truly obnoxious images. And I've never seen anything like it. Even ""The Sixth Sense"" relies more on imagery and as I well recall, it wasn't all imagery there either. But - if I did start comparing it to The Sixth Sense - there's one more thing I need to add. There is a reasonable difference between the movies, especially regarding the emphasis. Shayamalan's movie relies on the ending and the ending is more than just the Cherry on top. Some will make the mistake to criticize ""The Others"" for a sloppy conclusion, but this simply can not be regarded as the movie's strong point. It's the inner force that thrives through its intense tale. The movie itself forces you to admire it, not a simple gimmick.Nicole, I hate to admit it, is pretty damned good and the kids go just marvelous together. However, there will be those saying it's not ""that fresh"" and not ""all that original"".

I thought it was quite good, but am aware of what was wrong with it.But to call the ending a surprise is way over the top. There are only really 6 characters in it so the choice was either: none of them are dead, some of them are or they all are, so it was no surprise for me, so don't expect the ending to come as that much of a shock.The other criticism which I agreed somewhat with was that it took an awful long time to get to the point & not a lot happened along the way to get there. It was always watchable but at occasional point not exciting and could've done with being 10 minutes less.On the plus side though, the young girl stole the show with a brilliant performance & Eric Sykes chipped in with a good role.Unlike other films like this, I didn't find any major flaws or even minor ones. With the knowledge of the end, the early scenes all still work, as far as I know. The one grey area was the locking the doors. I failed to see the real relevance of it & don't know whether they were being locked really or not. I doubt it, but am not sure.Whilst I found the ending no great surprise I thought it was a good ending & well done. But I would still describe it as 'An Ending' rather than 'The Ending.'

177,basrutten,"Works in the theaters, not on TV",5,24 June 2002,"Like ""What lies beneath"", ""The Others"" is a movie that probably work very well on the big screen, but on the TV (I rented it on video), it falls completely flat. I can easily understand that this movie is scary when you see it in a dark room on a big screen with stereo sound, but when you rent it at home and watch it...what a disappointment.The acting is great, the cinematography is great etc..but it's all so very boring. Hardly anything ever happens, and when something happens it usually doesn't make a lot of sense. You have no empathy at all for the characters: two whining little kids and an overly harsh mother. Plus, it's not even remotely scary (on TV). Granted, the ending is adequate and does clear things up, but it didn't shock me nearly as much as ""the Sixth Sense"", a movie with a similar theme, did. I'd even go as far as to call this a rip-off of the Sixth Sense.Well made, but very boring and derivative.** out of **** stars",The Others
178,herbqedi,Run-of-the-mill Gothic Thriller,5,3 March 2004,"The performances are all marvelous -- most especially the young girl and Fionnula Flanagan.  Kidman was just a tad too flamboyant for me in spots, one scene in particular conjuring up images of Nancy Kelly in the Bad Seed -- but overall, she was more than up to the task at hand.  The suspense is real, and the visuals are quite well done.  The sound track, sound effects, make-up, and costumes are all first-rate.  But, for me, the flimsiness (these days called delicacy and cheered by critics -- all things run in cycles) of the storyline and transparency of the twists make this an unmemorable time-killer.  If you're into this kind of movie, it's probably worth an 8/10 -- for me 6/10 was the right number.",The Others

The Others is a very religious horror film and I see many hating it because of that. Same reason people didn't get into The Exorcist that much. I really liked the religious twist though, and for some odd reason religion makes a movie more creepy and daring. The twist is out of no where and I loved it, kept you in the story until the end and that's what movie making is. Nicole Kidman is a very good actor as we should all know and she does her part perfectly here too. At first in the story I thought she was crazy and then later on I realized she is just paranoid of the kid's sayings. The kids also play their part pretty well too, and thank god it wasn't like those modern movies. And then we have the PG-13 rating which some people hate. They all think R makes a movie scary and that's not the case. The Others is a very great horror movie and I really enjoyed it's slow, eerie pacing and descending into a well-done twist. 7/10.",The Others

I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It is suspenseful, creepy and has a relatively unique twist at the ending, which I refuse to give here.The slow moving plot builds up a little at a time, and reveals itself in little bits. It's as if someone has taken a jigsaw puzzle and scattered the pieces for us to find along the way.

Just watch ""Open your eyes"". ""The others"" is a really good horror movie.""The others"" is a terrifying but philosophical trip through the questions of the man. I want to compare it first with the character of the beautiful book ""Rayuela"". This character reminds me a lot this movie. Because he is in a difficult situation. He doesn't know if he exist. Of that it is ""The others"".

They have truly shown that for making a film you do not need to have sound effects and ghost with bad faces. What is worth noting in the film is that you will feel scared at least for one point of time. I give most of the credit to the actress – ""Nicole kidman"". And of course nothing is possible without a fine piece of direction. The director is new to me but I will remember his name forever. The idea of inducing photo sensitivity in the children so that there will be darkness in the house all the time. I think this reason gave the film an edge regarding the reasons, As many horror films employ everything in dark and without giving it a thought that why everything is to be done in the dark. The ending could not have better. The sound effects are kept to a minimum and fear is induced by the situations and the circumstances. The only thing that I found unnecessary in the film was the character of their father. Other than that this is the only horror film that has made me feel scared.""A must watch for everyone.""",The Others

She's just great. Such a pent up neurotic would steer one inch and she would become a caricature. Instead, every gesture is perfect, every fit of hysteria just has to be there. Like every note in a Bach sonata. Her icy, statuesque beauty, allure and hairdo (!) make it all ""come together"". The scene in an unexpected sexy white night gown asking for love from his estranged husband is a small, very small gem :).Cinematography is BEAUTIFUL, I want to live in this house! (Unocuppied if possible :)). To all of us who have read ""The castle of Otranto"" in loony early teens, this was what Walpole was talking about :)!Horror is the contrary to gore. It's atmosphere, not ketchup. This is more of a psychological study (and a lesson in acting, let us not forget ""Fionnula Flanagan"" and Grace's bratty daughter. By the way, I LOVE everybody's English usage, and how it reveals class differences between ""Master and servant"". Body language too!This is a MENTAL drama, the plot wisely gives us SOME keys to keep us engaged, but never enough to foresee what's coming. At least not me! ""kate_hartshorn"" (Irvine, CA) is right: this could well be a practical case of a ""psychology of perception"" course. And I agree with Mr. Kleinman from Portland (also on Amazon) that one should better NOT read much before the film. I was lucky enough this time to only watch the pictures and a general look at the cast. Had I read even Amazon's ""plot keywords"" would have basically spoilt all the fun (as it has, many times before).I didn't really FEEL much for the characters, although I confess I suffered with poor troubled Grace. I give it a ten although, for I suspect it follows the ""rules of the genre"" that preclude any glorious and hefty monologue alla ""Pacino"" or something heroic, political or socially relevant. I can't see how this film could be improved, but I am not so sure it would stand a ""second viewing"". At least, not in the near future. And certainly NOT a third one!!

184,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: The Others (2001),7,11 May 2008,The Others is a nicely told story. When i was watching this it didn't strike me as a scary movie until after the film is finished.A spooky ghost movie in the nature of Sixth Sense. Although it is just one step under Sixth Sense it still gives us a good movie.All the acting was good. Nicole Kidman was surprising and the kids were very creepy.Not one to watch with the kids might keep them up all night.I recommend it if you enjoy a good ghost story or liked The Sixth Sense. Good stuff.7/10,The Others

187,BigGuy,Not that big a surprise,6,12 August 2001,"Contrary to the advertising for this movie, the ending is not as big a surprise as they would have you believe.  I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say that with the plethora of ""misleading"" movies out there today it isn't hard to figure out what is going on.The whole of the movie is dimly lit and overly spooky.  The movie is set in a large manor house with curtains on all the windows to protect the children from the sunlight (they are photo-sensitive).  A constant supply of fog, austere costumes and actors who could sit for American Gothic complete the setting.  Frankly, by the time the real intense part of the movie started I was already inured to the setting.  And that was one of the great failures of the movie.  Trying to keep the audience on the edge of their seats the entire movie is a losing proposition.  Although there were a few jump scenes that broke through and caused a few yells in the audience.Overall the movie was fair, nothing too memorable, but probably worth seeing if you are into the suspense genre, or are a fan of Nicole Kidman.  Somehow she seems way too at home in these period pieces.  I gave it 7/10.",The Others

She plays the mother of two terribly sick children living on an island off of England during World War II who has just lost her husband. She hires three strangers who just happen to have worked in her home previously and begins to have strange occurrences happen soon afterward. The movie takes awhile to come full circle but it once it has you in it's grip it won't let you go. It is fiendishly scary and the buildup to the finale is filled with tension and suspense.

189,ryangilmer007,"Please see ""Haunted"" (1995) (spoiler at very end)",2,18 September 2001,"The Others is a slow, autmospheric movie that builds off of minute details, which may be missed, and ultimately Alejandro Amenábar explains everything with an ending that seems predestined for a huge payoff.Yet, instead of a payoff, you should feal ripped off.In the era where most trailers give the movie away, The Others has a great trailer that in truth does what a trailer is supposed to do. Basically, it gets you hooked, without giving away key elements of the story.However, in the era of media, The Others falls flat. It was hyped as ""The Sixth Sense of 2001"" or ""with a twist ending that will make you want more."", etc...In truth The Others is an interesting movie because instead of being a total horror movie, thriller, detective story, or period piece, it instead borrows elements from spine-tingling horror thrillers and constructs a fable about a lapse/period of time where familial strength and the elements that can pull them apart are in the shadows for us, the detectives, to dicipher.Yet, Alejandro Amenábar does not just borrow the ""surprise ending"" from elements of past thrillers and chillers, instead it is a blatent rip-off of the theme of the 1995 movie ""Haunted"".The Others is destined to get more press than ""Haunted"" ever did (except for Kate Beckensale fans)and ""Hauted"" is probably a movie that will sit dormant at rental stores for 90% of the year. ""Haunted"" really isn't a better movie, but it had the original shock of finding out that the people you thought were real, were really the ghosts and that the others were actually real people invading the ghost world in varying degrees.While The Others does not take the entire ending of ""Haunted"" (i.e. there is no fire and no living to dead marriage proposal), the thematic elements are there and for me at-least the media droped the hint of the ending.After hearing that there was a huge ""twist ending"", I thought, there is no way that then ending of ""Haunted"" would be used, that would be a cool idea, but a cop-out.

Obviously takes inspiration from the Sixth Sense, which was released 3 years before this movie came out and I can really tell what they were going for with the twist and it kind of worked, but I don't think it was as climactic as it was intended to be.Let's talk about performances: Nicole Kidman does a pretty good job in the movie, you can actually buy into her despair and going crazy. Like I said the performance is great, but the character really got on my nerves. I don't hear enough people talking about Alakina Mann's performance in this movie, especially for a kid actress, she is spectacular. I really wonder what happened to her, she hasn't really been in anything major since this.In the end The Others is entertaining and the twist is pretty good, although it is a film that is 100% style over substance, and it should have packed a meaner punch.",The Others

The acting all round is very good, the atmosphere and direction are fine.  It's just the story is really just 10 minutes at the end of the film.  All the rest of the film is rather pointless and boring.The film was made even more uninteresting by me predicting the twist in about the first 10 minutes of the film.  I'm actually surprised more people didn't.  After seeing Sixth Sense and any sci-fi film I always question everything.  Are they really there, have they gone back/forward in time, etc.  When they showed the first scene with Victor, immediately the thought that they actually might be the ghosts, popped into my head.  Of course when she meets the husband, the game is up.  He's dead, so she must be dead, plus the fog of course.

206,MUFCOK,The perfect example of how to create a ghost story.,9,3 February 2015,"The Others is one of my favourite horror films of all time. It has a good plot, it is subtle, it gives nothing away until the end and everything it does is relevant to the story. I would recommend viewing the movie twice to really appreciate everything that it does, you will miss many things upon first viewing and watching it twice will really enhance the experience.It is set in the early 1900's and the house, costumes and style are very well presented; they do a good job of transporting the viewer to that time. The story is all based within a mansion where a woman and her two young children live with their three housekeepers. Her two children suffer from a photosensitive disorder and are not allowed to be in direct contact with sunlight, this means that the house is constantly in darkness, offering a much more eerie experience. The daughter claims that she can see ghosts around the house, this is ignored by the mother at the start but before long she is questioning the matter herself. Is the house haunted?My main gripe with many horror films is that things are revealed too early on, in ghost stories you will see the ghost before any real suspense has been able to build. In my opinion the scariest things in horror films are the things that you don't see, the things that only your imagination sees. This is where The Others excels.The Others consists of around 6-7 characters with the majority of it being dedicated to Nicole Kidman, who does a fantastic job with a really convincing performance. She is a very mysterious character who seems extremely paranoid about her children's health and wellbeing; she appears as a woman who is on the edge of sanity. The whole supporting cast are fantastic and not one of them lets the casting down.The Others is a film in which you cannot say much about without the fear of giving anything away, but I will say one thing, the ending is spectacular. So many horror movies struggle to get the ending right, The Others shows its fellow horror flicks how it should be done. Its certificate is only an age 12 but in my opinion it is much creepier than many age 18 films I have watched. If horror movies are your scene then I would recommend this very highly.9/10",The Others
207,K-Slicer,Excellent Horror,10,21 March 2003,"The best psychological horror that lives up to ""The Sixth Sense"" is the ""The Others"".  ""The Others"" is a true suspense film in every sense of the phrase. Here are the reasons (spoilers contained within): (1) Nicole Kidman is one of the best screen actresses I have ever seen.  Her mentally exasperating and nail-biting performance is the best of her career. (2) Alejandro Amenabar is one of the most creative filmmakers out there right now.  He presides over this movie with a hand of a creative master. (3) Amenabar's writing skills are excellent as well.  Every scene that he wrote give a sense of the mental dread that the family feels as they progress toward the climax and conclusion. (4) The musical score also enhances the dread. Amenabar is also a musical jack. (5) I love the metaphor of light in a mansion as a water on a sinking ship. (6) The cinematography and lighting leaves no wanting. (7) The events of the story are spooky enough. (8) The last twenty minutes of the film are worth the ticket price alone. (9) The rest of the cast put in excellent performances as well. (10) Truly classic horror methods were used to convey mental dread.  Ten reasons give a score of ten.  Overall, this is a truly spooky film and it should have received an Oscar for either acting, directing, screen writing or even musical score.PS: Also see ""Abre los Ojos"" and ""Vanilla Sky"" to see Alejandro Amenabar's creative genius at work.  He along with Tom Tykwer are part of a new wave of filmmakers from Europe that have invaded the United States and brought some clarity and sanity to the supposed normalcy in American cinema.

In fact there is a peculiar condition for children in this film (Anne & Nicholas), that they are photosensitive. This is one of those movies which the viewers must never know the suspense/spoilers for thrills. So before you watch this, don't read any reviews with spoilers. The movie is a horror/thriller so its meant to be scary but didn't scare me. The sounds (sound effects) gave me jerk for I've watched it with surround sounds late at night. Just like a typical suspense movie, it can be watched once as the second time you wouldn't. Except for frightening scenes the movie has no sexuality nor profanity nor violence.

209,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,8,29 October 2013,"The Others is a psychological horror movie directed and written by Alejandro Amenábar, and it's his first English language movie. Amenábar is a director, actor and a composer. He wrote the screenplays for five of his movies, and composed the majority of the soundtracks. The Others was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, which is pretty rare for a horror movie. As a big fan of ghost movies, I consider this movie to be a masterpiece.On a huge estate, in an always darkened house – darkened because of the two of her photosensitive children – lives Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), the mother of a boy and a girl whose husband hasn't returned from war in the past year and a half. As a very religious person, Grace insists on her children's religious education, teaches them about God's morals and reads verses from the Bible. Because of her inability to conduct all of the house work, she employs three workers who should help her with the children and around the house. Since she has a heavy rheumatic disease, Grace keeps silence in the house, but it is one day disrupted by piano sounds, children's cries and sounds of footsteps. Her daughter Anne (Alakina Mann) tries to convince her and her brother that she frequently sees a little boy, Victor (Alexander Vince), and his family, but Grace blames the workers for everything that's happening.The Others has a very good atmosphere because of the creepy soundtrack (present in all tense situations), the old house in which many families have lived, the constant fog and the isolation from every form of civilization. Despite the fact that there are not many jump scares and blood, the tension is still present and it's created mainly by making the house dark (the curtains are always closed) and silent. Nicole Kidman, in spite of being reluctant to accept the role, since before this she was working on Moulin Rouge!, turned out to be excellent in the horror genre. She amazingly portrayed hysteria, as well as kindness to her folks, and her facial expression freezes one's blood (like in the scene where she starts finding out the truth). The movie is dominated by the opposition between the guessing what could be going on, the religious beginning and the overall thematic – and what's really going on, and the sudden annihilation of the aforementioned.The role of the children in the movie was very big and very successful. Their regular conflicts about their mother and father create drama and tension. The character who leads the audience, and the other characters, to the discovery of what's happening, is nurse Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), who tells Anne that she trusts her and that she also feels the presence of the boy Victor. She also tries to convince Grace of the existence of the supernatural. As a remark, I'd say the character of Charles Stewart (Christopher Eccleston) felt unnecessary – he has no impact on the rest of the characters or the overall plot. The movie's ending is exceptional and is worth every minute of the movie's duration. The movie doesn't want to leave the revelation to the very end – instead, the truth is progressively exposed throughout the movie, but still manages to lead to an unexpected finale. The Others, despite not being a movie that will haunt your dreams for weeks, manages to keep its quality and level of creepiness with every subsequent watch. A definite recommendation!

210,lingmeister,Chilling suspense,8,26 December 2002,"This movie totally puts the chills in you, with the atmosphere that the director instills, Nicole Kidman's characterization of a mother that thinks she is losing her mind because things are not making sense, and the newly arrived housekeepers in which we don't know if they are plotting something.There is none of those big scares like those horror movies.  Most of it are indirect or off-screen, resulting in something that is more of the bone chilling type of scare.I don't think every piece of the puzzle connects at the end, but nobody is trying to follow some rule here like the way they were trying to in The Sixth Sense, which by openly defining what one could and could not do, and following that rule on the screen does not mean the character could function as if they are normal and not detect their state.All in all, a very good movie if you want to get the chills. Don't know how it will be on second viewing since I haven't done that yet.",The Others
211,Sinnerman,Haunting yet sad.,10,16 March 2002,"Post WWII Horror Film starring Nicole Kidman, 1 missing husband, 2 kids, 3 new servants and 4 or 5 'others'. Grrrrrgh....This is a very creepy film. THAT old woman was very scary...  But ultimately, one can't help but be strangely moved by this understated piece of cinema. Nicole's subtle but no less piercing performance for this ghoulish yarn should have been rewarded with an Oscar nomination.
But in a world when a cheese burger can cost more it used to yesterday, and deserving films get chewed up by big budgeted crap, nothing is fair. Just think about it, isn't losing husbands (a real one, and a reel one) already a bad enough punishment for this woman? Imagine all those years of neck damage from having to look down all the time? Is it all worth it? Such injustice, the ways of the world, such utter injustice!(But I digress. Can't helpit. Sorry.)Anyhow, all is not lost as this eerie little movie earned so much money(close to US$100 million, and US$1 million more than Vanilla Sky at that! ITS TRUE!), it went on to become one of 2001's biggest surprise hits.
Miss Kidman is now hotter than ever before. And of course, she did garner a nomination for that other film(Moulin Rogue!). You know what they say: ""Unlucky in love....."" Nicole you are a free woman now. Take comfort in that thought. And guess what, you may now finally fire that chiropractor of yours and start enjoying the view! You go girl!",The Others

Combine SCARY with DRAMATIC and add some INTELLIGENCE to it and this is what you'll get! Simply amazing! 90% of the entire movie is happening in the house and i don't know how, but it's never boring. You're always expecting something that never happens. Brilliant! And i really liked how Alejandro Amenabar has tried and succeeded in adding a lot of drama to the movie. That really made the mood a lot better.I also really liked his directing. Almost the entire movie's been shot on dark places around the house with no light to it than the one of some candle or something. That candle or candles is what's, actually, giving you the chills when you hear voices or something in the movie. You always wonder what if the candle goes out.Nicole Kidman was brilliant. Ever since she started pumping her face with botox or whatever, even though she is a great actress, i just can't find any sort of emotion in her performances. But that's not the case with this one. This role demanded Nicole Kidman. She was just amazing. Sad, angry, calm, scary - all at once. This role really fits her. She freaked me out in this movie.I almost forgot to mention, the music is excellent! It really gives a lot to the movie! And the ending! The ending is perfect! More than perfect!!! It's what, in my eyes, made this movie one of the best horror's ever!!! Do not miss this movie! It's brilliant!!! This movie is the best that you can get out of a horror movie!!!!

Well it didn't seem so like that to me. It catches you easily, it generates fear with its suspenseful scenes accompanied by strong dramatic music that alerts something that never happens. The problem is that there are things that I did not understand why after that ending so good and unexpected, such as the scene that Nicole fights with the old woman speaking as her daughter or both the arrival and the departure of the husband. I think the best thing is the end because besides that it gives personality to the film, one does not expect it and it is the moment that the pieces of the puzzle come together.Nicole Kidman is doing very well but is nowhere near her best roles, a neat and fulfilling performance.",The Others

Unable to withstand sunlight, Grace's children must live in total darkness. In their isolation, they discover that they are not alone. There's a ghostly presence in their house......I know you will think it's just another haunted house flick, but trust me, do not trust the plot !

Actually the whole cast is great (yes, even the boy - i am not annoyed at his acting abilities - but at what role he has to play as a character) I also liked the conclusion of the story - i am not sure if this ""twist"" has been used before - but for me it was quite new, especially the ""tone"" of it.I have just recently re-watched it (2017) - and the movie has aged incredibly well (of course mostly because it relies on atmosphere and acting, and only on very low key effects (which seem to be mostly practical - or off screen anyway) i can fully recommend this movie.",The Others

Strange question to start a review with and yet and essential one when beginning to talk about this film.All I will say is  that the film is about Grace(Nicole Kidman) who lives with her 2 children, Anne(Alkina Mann) and Nicholas(James Bentley), in a remote house on Jeresy Island in the time after WWII. Her children are suffering from a rare disease that make exposure to light dangerous to them. One day Anne and later also Grace seem to hear strange voices and believe that the house is haunted and...You want to know what happened from now on, go and see the film. Telling you what happens now will deprive you from one of the film which will be remembered from 2001/2002. Because this a film to see and remember. It is good because at the end it make you think about a lot of things. Relations between parents and children. Trust and believe between those 2 parts of the family. Acceptance of things in your life. In a more philosophic level it says something about our perspective and the way we see things. How we take everything for granted while we shouldn't.Kidman is excellent(2nd time this year with a strong part) and seem to be improving every time I watch her. The children and the rest of the cast are also good and complete the strong ensemble which help the movie. The direction is good and is helped by the lighting of the set and the score.All in all go and see the film. The twist somewhere in the film will make you and everyone else in the cinema jump.

225,the-gossip-king,Chilling well directed movie,8,10 May 2008,"The movie had a story that could have made it be your terrible, silly and gory horror flick but it wasn't. It was very cleverly directed and very well acted. It is in fact a beautiful period piece. The costumes and dialogue are excellent. Also what makes this such a good movie is that you think you are being led in one direction and then suddenly you realize everything is the opposite to what you expected. There were some scary moments but it was more chilling because every moment you were holding your breath because it felt like a scary moment was sure to happen. Nicole Kidman plays her role very well and deceptively to the point where we don't know if she is going mad or if there really are ghosts in her house.

In fact, everything about the film has been done before. so why did I like it so much? Simple. The Others is still a very stylish and atmospheric film. It hearkens back to the days when a film had an actual story to tell and did so at its own pace. Not ruled by hyper fast cutscenes. In this way, the film slowly builds its tension as it gives the viewer piece by piece the clues to its puzzle. And all the while it keeps doling on the atmosphere until the film almost chokes from it. In short, The Others is a better film for how it goes about its business than for what its business actually is.",The Others

The Others was a film based in the 1940's during the war, the house is haunted by ""Intruders"", the mother (Nicole Kidman) resides with her son and daughter, the daughter often complains of seeing ""Ghosts"" in the house. The chill factor in this film is pretty low, yet one with patience must watch this film.The Others is a ghost film after all, so dont expect blood and gore, if thats what your looking for...Jason, Freddy & Michael are all waiting at your local video store, this movie was scary, not frightening but the eerie camerawork and environment was enough for me. In terms of the plot, it was very well thought of, the script was fabulously written and the acting was flawless, what more could i say? This film deserves to be in the top 5 movies of this year, infact...Number ONE is a good number!ACTING: The acting was fabulous in ""The Others"", infact it was Flawless, especially by Nicole Kidman, such beauty portrayed on film, also the kids did a good job, especially the young girl, delightful to watch!ACTORS: Good, a few new faces in this film, but definantley not to waste, Nicole Kidman doesen't chose the best movies, but this time around she made the RIGHT choice, good range of actors, and good new-comers.SCRIPT: Terrific, this movie couldn't live without its great script, everything flowed in very well with the movie, the film had a dramatic twist at the end, could be predictable, but worth the wait.CINEMA: Brilliant, the use of the fog effects was breathtaking, the mansion was fantastic, the use of lights was brilliant, the camera-work was top notch material! Awards must be won.SUSPENSE: Quiet low unfortunantley, yet it is a ghost movie, it did have a couple of jumps, yet most of the film could be said to be ""Slow Paced"", yet the thrills actually make you jump they are very effective the moment they approach.MUSIC/FX: Nice, especially during the scenes where Nicole Kidman gets tormented by the ghosts, the music was used well and the music did add to the suspence, very enjoying.OVERALL: ""The Others"" is definantley better than ""Sixth Sense"", infact the Sixth Sense was way over-rated, this film is much better. It developed a better plot and much better twist at the end, the only complaint some would have was the pacing of the film, a slow start, yet viewers are rewarded with the MANY upsides of this gret film.**** (4 STARS)",The Others

231,darkjosh,"Intelligent, Atmospheric Horror",8,7 October 2001,"It's almost impossible to discuss The Others without bringing up 1999's already classic ghost thriller The Sixth Sense.  Both are films that move deliberately slow, drawing in the audience with a fine eye for details and no special effects, creating a brooding atmosphere and getting frights from suggestion and small effects.  Still, Amenabar's The Others goes even further with his minimalist style, constructing a film that becomes increasingly creepy with the slightest sound effect or plot point.Nicole Kidman, in a bravura, chilling performance, stars as Grace, mother to two children with a rare disease that makes exposure to sunlight deadly. She lives in a mansion on an island, fog smothering their secluded existence, when one day three servants come looking for work. She hires them, and suddenly strange noises and occurences start descending on the house. Slowly, it becomes evident that they are not alone when her daughter begins to describe her experiences with a mysterious ghost boy named Victor.The Others is an elegantly mounted film, and Amenabar succeeds in building an uneasy tension with striking cinematography that makes the light and darkness seem to come alive, as if it were a character in itself.  At times, the look and feel of it seems more like a macabre Merchant-Ivory production than a haunted house movie. Amenabar's pacing is perfect; it's refreshing to see a summer movie that slowly and confidently ups the ante to the point where the audience doesn't know where the story is going to go. When the film finally reaches it's end, its quite a spine-tingling climax.8 out of 10",The Others

Anyway you slice it, this guy can make one creepy movie. I'll admit, I'm a sucker for ghost stories, but good ones are few and far between. The Other's, is a period piece set in world war one England, filmed in a very quiet, dark setting with more bumps in the night then you can shake a creepy kid at. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman)is a soldier's wife, taking care of their tranquil castle and even more tranquil kids, while hubby is off at war. Add a creepy group of servants and what you have is some spooky (Good Lord, don't go in there) kind of fun. One of the best features that I learned about the film after viewing it a few times is that almost all the dialog is spoken very soft, a whisper in some scenes, this forces you to turn up the volume, and in turn, when something scary happens (see where I'm going with this?), your t.v. is cranked and jump straight out of your chair (cool stuff).

When the older lady servant was answering questions about where she and the other two servants had come from, I knew right then and there that they were not of this earth, the fact that they seemingly appeared out of nowhere gave it away, and they all seemed so vacant and ""out there"". I also knew right away that Charles was dead, he also had that same ""vacany""a bout him. I have read a lot and seen many TV specials about the supernatural and ghosts over the years, so perhaps that is the reason why I wasn't as spooked as the rest of the audience was, which was disappointing!

Clean and simple (it could almost be rated ""G"" if it weren't so scary), we don't get ambushed by special effects and excessive makeup.  No, ""The Others"" plays with our heads, and it pays off beautifully.In a movie Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of, eerieness abounds, and we are left constantly wondering just what is up with this house. Photographs of dead men, women, and children tucked away in an album.  Loud noises in empty rooms.  A young girl strangely calm about all the supernatural events she claims to have witnessed.  Servants with something to hide.  And a heroine on the brink of madness.If you like scary movies, this is a must-see.

241,RolloTomasi,so they do make 'em like they used to,9,22 August 2001,"Using absolutely no CG imagery, nor even blood or gory make-up effects, director Alejandro Amenábar goes old school here, crafting something that is truly special in a year like 2001, filled with meaningless, thoughtless work from directors who have proved they know better. ""The Others"" is the kind of picture (what they used to call this form of entertainment) that won't really course through your veins until after the end credits roll. Along the way it provides such great imagery, the kind you only see if you're really paying attention. For instance, when Grace is going through the box full of old photo albums, there is briefly revealed a ghostly face in one of them, as if it's watching her. Likewise the opening shot of one scene showing another ghostly face lit in candlelight (you remember the shot), that at first cannot be distinguished as real or a painting. All of it contributes to a singular purpose: not a shot wasted, no line of dialogue that isn't giving you something meaningful.""The Others"" is beautiful, not just in the way it looks, but thematically as well. Like any ghost story, it explores the spiritual. It doesn't tell you what to believe, but forces you to question the nature of death and hell. I predict that this will be the most underrated film of the year. Audiences have been programmed for too long to expect certain things. Too many films don't trust the audience enough to let them collect information and draw conclusions themselves. Too many films have spoon-fed us. Many will get to the end of ""The Others"" and say, 'what, that's it?' It's such a subtle work, it'll leave many feeling like there should have been more. For these reasons, this film will probably be forgotten before too long. And yet, it's the kind of film that should be studied for years to come, particular for its writing, direction, and cinematography. ""The Others"" looks like it could have come from almost any decade. The 'aughts' should be proud to have this film as part of its cinema history.Grade: A",The Others
242,Manthorpe,Fairly decent and original concept.,8,23 January 2004,"I'll have to admit that I put off watching this movie despite being told by several friends that it was pretty good and worth checking out. That's mostly because ""scary"" movies usually turn out to be nothing but crap riddled, cheap thrill fests with terrible acting by actors just looking for their next handout...not to mention directors that care nothing about the progress of their careers. That and the slew of B- horror/thriller movies that seemed to come out very close together along with this movie made me a little apprehensive. However, I was pleasantly surprised.First off, I'd like to say that I have yet to see The Sixth Sense, so I cannot comment on any similarities between the two films that I have heard exist.Grace (Kidman) and her two young photosensitive (X.P.) children live in a sprawling old house together in England in the 1940's and await the return of their father and husband who went off to fight the Germans in WWII. As a result of the children's very rare and dangerous skin condition, all of the house's curtains must be shut during the day and all of the doors must be closed and locked to prevent any accidental solar exposure to the children. Despite the warnings from her children and new found servants, strange things begin to happen in the house which Grace chooses not to accept or investigate...partly because of her zealous religious beliefs which leave her closed minded and ignorant to things outside her psychological realm of thinking. Sooner or later, she will have to come to terms with what's going on...Kidman's acting is admirable in this movie, and although I usually have a hard time enjoying her films, I felt she did a very decent job here. I think she was born to play a stubborn, hard nosed, uptight tart, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I especially enjoyed the acting performances from both of the children. Both are talented child actors and were definitely helped by the script which captured what it's like to be a child. I was constantly reminded of my own childhood amongst the belittling and teasing between the two, and of course the naive and adorable fears. The film is shot beautifully and has a lot of atmosphere, partly due to the fact that since the children are photosensitive, the house must always be dark, and the director definitely likes to play with that. There's something else that helps the film's atmosphere as well, the fog, which obviously adds to the general spookiness. But I'll leave that one alone as it plays an important role herein. The score helps as well, and is well placed and executed.Overall, I found this to be a very respectable and enjoyable film in almost all respects, and I no longer consider Kidman a pretty face begging for nude scenes. I felt it was very well thought out, and if it weren't for a minor plothole involving Grace's husband, I would have ranked it higher.
Easily a solid 8/10.",The Others
243,Chrimle,Too stubborn to remain mysterious,7,26 August 2020,"Amazing performance for the most part, with a great story. The characters were disappointingly weak, but the great acting made up for it. The story's pacing was a bit off and understanding the story took longer than it should have because of the movie's stubbornness to remain mysterious. Thus, the story was unpredictable, but not having much to go on is in itself - unpredictable. The atmosphere and eeriness suited the story well.",The Others
244,starlit-sky,"So you thought ""The Sixth Sense"" was good! This movie will put you in a coma!",10,12 August 2001,"""The Others"" is an extraordinary psychological thriller, full of suspense, frightening scenes and surprises that are guaranteed to blow your mind. Honestly, I never thought that they could make a better ghost movie than the ""The Sixth Sense"". I was thinking, ""why bother making another ghost movie while there isn't much left you could possibly add? It has been done already!"" I couldn't possibly be more wrong. It begins like an ordinary ghost movie but it develops into something purely unimaginable to the point of making ""The Sixth Sense"" look like ""Sound Of Music""! I assure you that ""The others"" will become a classic in a short time and be a HUGE SUCCESS. This is an extraordinary movie, a magnificent cinematic achievement. Its suspense excels any other movie I have seen (except maybe ""Alien"" and ""Silence Of The Lambs""). This movie is EVEN better than ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""The Sixth Sense""Why is it better than ""The Sixth Sense""? 1) It has a better plot that keeps you at the edge of your seat -at times while it doesn't make you jump out of it. 2) There are more suspenseful scenes and they are MUCH scarier than the ones in ""The Sixth Sense"". In fact, the scenes are so scary that they make audience LITERALLY jump out of their seats! 3) It also has more surprises (In ""The Sixth Sense"", there was only one big surprise at the end). 4) It also has more characters that make the plot more sophisticated whereas ""The Sixth Sense"" had only two main characters (or maybe three, including the mother). 5) It keeps you guessing right to the end and the pay off is quite magnificent. 6) The camera and sound effects are used in much superior and advanced ways. The scenes are shot from a perfect angle in such a masterful way; they actually add more tension to the already suspenseful situation. You could almost hear the whispers of ghosts as if they were whispering in your ear. Even when those ghostly sounds overlap with the sounds made by the characters in the movie, there is a sensible distinction that creeps you out. 7) The location of the story is also much more perfect for such a story than in ""The Sixth Sense"". The whole house itself, its interior designs, and its massiveness gives you the creeps. What I didn't like about the movie: You may find some inconsistencies if you think how the elements of the material world can share the same platform with the otherworldly, but there is no infallible way to overcome this in a ghost theme anyway. I loved the movie in its entirety. The Best Scene Of The Movie: The scene where Nicole Kidman faces The Others at the end of the movie. Line of the movie: ""Sometimes the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living."" spoken by the nanny, Mrs Mills. Possible Academy Awards Nominations: 1) Best Screenplay, 2) Best Sound, 3) Best Sound Effects, 4) Best Performance by a leading Actress (Nicole Kidman) and in my opinion, 5) The Best Picture. You will like this movie if you like: The Sixth Sense, Jacob's Ladder, and other movies with ghost theme.
My Vote: 10",The Others
245,evilmatt-3,A fantastic ghost story,9,11 August 2001,"This is a return to an old tradition in the horror genre: the haunted house film.  Many would argue that this particular subgenre has already been revived by such films as _The Sixth Sense_ and _What Lies Beneath_, but I would reply that this movie, with its excellent writing, acting, and mise-en-scene, shows just how silly and amateur those other films really are.One of the main attraction of this film is Nicole Kidman, and that is rightfully so.  She is as brilliant in the film as she was in _Eyes Wide Shut_ (perhaps more so) as a mother who is at once religiously fanatic and deeply compassionate towards her children.  It is this sort of moral ambiguity that makes this film so delightful and fulfilling throughout.The visual effects in the movie, although subtle, are nothing short of amazing.  The foggy landscape around the house and the dark, moody tone of the entire film set a tone in which the scares seem perfectly in step with the rest of the movie, as well as the emotions of the central characters.Last but not least, the script is one of the best I've seen in a long time. It maintains a careful pace (neither too slow or fast- a pitfall that claims many haunted house films) while slowly building to an unforgettable and logically sound conclusion (which seems to be less and less valued in big studio films these days, although it is an element with importance that cannot be estimated.)All in all, this is terrific filmmaking.  Here's hoping we see more horror films of this caliber soon.",The Others
246,Blackace,"Slow, Boring, Not Scary, Slow Boring..You Get The Picture.",7,23 August 2001,"What's really a shame about this movie is that it could (and should) have been a sleeper hit. But because of it's slow pace and lack of any scary jump-out-of-your-seat moments, the film falls to mediocre. The atmosphere was perfect for this film. Located on an abandoned island sits an old manor house with a cemetery next to it. It doesn't get much better then that for a ghostly atmosphere. We learn that Grace and her husband Charles are the owners of the house and live there with their 2 children Anna and Nicholas. The husband had left to fight in the England / German war and has not returned. There are strange rules in the house, which Grace cryptically explains to her new servants are important. Each of the fifty doors in the house must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. The daylight can actually injured her children and cause swores and burning if they stay in the light to long. Three strangers appear at the door looking for work. Grace had put in an ad for servants to cook and clean the old manor, or did she? Now, with all of this going for it you would expect at least 3-4 scary moments with the first hour, right? WRONG!! Besides some creaking doors and floors, a piano that plays by itself and won't stay locked and a paranoid Grace and her son, there wasn't a single scary moment in the first hour. There are only 2 scenes that will have you jumping out of your seats, and that just isn't enough. I was literally dozing off during this movie and my girlfriend was ""sighing"" wondering when something interesting was going to happen. As for the acting, Nicole Kidman did an admirable job, but little Alakina Mann who played the daughter Anna (in her very first movie), literally stole the show. This girl was brilliant. Not only was her dialogue spoken cleaning with precise timing, but her facial emotions were dead on. At times she looked very erie and subdued. Even the little boy who played Nicholas (James Bentley) did a wonderful job. Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), who did an outstanding job in Waking Ned Devine was perfect for this role and showed her acting talent very well. Nope..it wasn't the acting that killed this movie, it was the script.Everyone is calling this a Sixth Sense clone and in some ways, it is. Most people will figure out the twisted ending long before it gets there. I did! If the writer had let the cat out of the bag half way through the movie and then provided a new interaction between the characters, things could have been a bit different. Instead, the solution was told and the movie ended, just like that. Definitely wait for this to hit the video store. If this movie came out back in the 50's or 60's it might have been worth a look, but with everyone expecting a modern day ghost story, the film just doesn't live up to anyones expectation. Take a pass on this and wait for the next haunting movie.",The Others
247,sampleman411-1,Relative Ghosts,10,14 May 2002,"Along the vein of previous ghost films such as ""Tales From the Crypt,"" ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""The Sixth Sense.""  ""The Others"" is simple, yet brilliant ghost story filmmaking and storytelling.The Plot concerns Lady Grace and her two children (both suffering from an extreme sensitivity to sunlight) and their secluded life on an English island.  The family waits for the return of missing Husband/Father from WW2. The film is based on an original script by the Spanish director himself, but shamelessly borrows from Henry James' epitomal ghost novelette, ""The Turn of the Screw"" and Thomas Tryon's psychological horror novel, ""The Other."" 
Whatever the case, you'll no doubt enjoy this chilling entry (filmed in mainland Spain, not the English island).  I found it very entertaining, and Kidman is extremely convincing as the bitchy and 'wound-too-tight' Lady of the Mansion.  The child actors and the supporting servant cast also do a winning job.",The Others
248,sampleman411-1,'Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll Begin...',10,21 May 2002,"`The Others' comes from a short line of well made, serious-horror films since the early years of cinema history.  It scared me!  It filled me with awe as to the power and effectiveness of film (today, many filmmakers are truly clueless)   Among these aforementioned serious films are `The Uninvited,' `The Innocents' (based on Henry James' novelette `The Turn of the Screw') and, most recently, `The Sixth Sense.'  `The Uninvited' (itself a film based on Dorothy Macardle's novel, `Uneasy Freehold') offered a plot twist (one good ghost, one bad) at the end of the story, answering the audience's possible question, why is the ghost trying to kill her beloved, living daughter?'  `The Innocents' were motherless children (one boy, one girl) who, suppressing their knowledge of the possibility of ghosts ended in the death of one of them, somewhat indirectly, at the hands of their governess, a sexually frustrated, yet well-meaning heroine.Along came `The Others.'  This is a clever reworking of  Turn of the Screw' (the governess' here is now the children's religious, overprotective mother) and continues the cleverness in plotting, as seen in `The Sixth Sense.""Watching `The Others' I quickly realized that the director relishes good, old-fashioned ghost stories, and doesn't make a habit of insulting the general intelligence of his audience.  Throughout the production, we are given hints as to the very super-nature of the narrative (the fact that the curtains must always remain closed, hints at the metaphor of the mother's unwillingness to see the light' of the truth).The Others' cast rises to the transcendental occasion.  Flanagan is a seasoned stage veteran, and years ago appeared in the excellent television horror film `The Legend of Lizzie Borden,' here again playing a house servant.  Doesn't the young actress (playing the mute girl ghost) look something like Anna Paquin (although I know she's not her)?

249,comquest,Very few 'scares',5,21 May 2002,"'The Others' fails to live up to the studio hype.  Despite an interesting premise, the film is slow-moving and often boring. The few 'scary' scenes are somewhat creepy but never genuinely frightening. Overall, it's extremely tame for this genre.The actors, including Nicole Kidman, offer satisfactory performances but none really stand out as being memorable. Even the 'unexpected' ending didn't work for me.  I figured it out about 30 minutes before it was disclosed on the screen.  I cannot recommend this film, as there are hundreds of horror flicks out there that deliver far bigger scares for the buck.  This one simply creeped me out.",The Others

If you go to a multiplex theatre, go see the others, not the film ""THE OTHERS,"" but any of the other films. I don't understand the high rating it has now on IMdB. It is a total failure as a horror film. It didn't horrify me nor anyone else. They laughed. When it ended, I heard groans from the audience, which was an even mix of adults and children. I don't know what is happening with the ratings! Are people that hungry for a good film that they will pretend to like it, or do they scare too easily, especially at nothing but loud noises.

Even the kids worked well together and showed a true sibling relationship. I'm not much for ghost movies as they all tend to be the same in some way, but this one was completely different from the rest and it played out very well. Even with scary ghost movies like paranormal activity that have came out since, this one still rules as the top ghost movie for me.

""The Haunting""(1963) and ""The Innocents""(1961) are my favorite ghost story/psychological horror movies, and this film was said to be in the same vein. But it was disappointing, after a good set-up. Simply put, the film was TOO restrained, and I like subtlety in movies. Not enough stuff happened to put the audience on edge, or justify the mounting panic Nicole Kidman was displaying. ""The Others"" seems to be holding back, trying to build to a final payoff that, frankly, was not that shocking. Beautifully photographed, good acting, and Nicole Kidman is gorgeous. But scary? No. Eerie? Yes.",The Others
253,MadReviewer,"Slow, Deliberate, Stylish . . . and Slow, Slow, Slow.",6,20 August 2001,"It seems overly simple to classify ""The Others"" as a cross between classic Hitchcock and ""The Sixth Sense"" . . . mostly, because that implies ""The Others"" is a film of that highest caliber.  It's certainly not.  However, it's not awful, either; instead ""The Others"" unfortunately falls into the film limbo of being just plain mediocre.  ""The Others"" is a suspense/horror film owing a lot to its predecessors from the 1940s -- it relies on mood, atmosphere, and the casts to create the eerie mood that permeates the film, and never falls back on gratuitous gore to create its horrors.  The look and feel of ""The Others"" is very much that of a vintage Universal film; in fact, if this film had been made in black & white, and if a digital CGI version of Lana Turner could be inserted in Nicole Kidman's place, you would probably swear that this was a forgotten suspense/horror film from that era.   It's definitely not a classic -- there's a number of significant issues that add up together to keep ""The Others"" far, far short of greatness -- but it's an interesting film nonetheless.""The Others"" is, at its heart, a vintage ghost story -- on a small island off the shores of England, there is a forlorn manor house located far away from the trappings of civilization.  Living in this isolated house are the elegant Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley).  There are strange rules in the house, which Grace cryptically explains to her new servants are important. Each of the fifty doors in the house must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. While odd, these rules are vital, Grace explains, because Anne and Nicholas are so allergic to the sunlight that they might die if exposed to it.  The servants, led by the wise Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), accede to these rules . . . but they begin to hears voices. And things going bump in the night.  So do Anne and Nicholas.  Grace doesn't hear these things, or at least she claims not to, which slowly but surely leads to the questions: Are these new servants creating the disturbances for some sinister purpose?  Is troubled Anne creating them?  Is Grace?  Or does something really lurk within the walls of the manor house, something long-dead, something evil . . .""The Others"" relies on its pacing and direction to create its ominous mood. This reliance is both the film's strength and ultimate downfall.  Director Alejandro Amenabar lets the viewer savor each moment of the film, building suspense from scene to scene at a slow and steady pace, dropping subtle hints about what has happened and what's going to happen with a very deft touch . . . he really lets things build slowly.  In fact, too slowly. ""The Sixth Sense"" also moved along at an unhurried pace, but at least that film had the good sense to know that in order to maintain the slow pace, some sort of payoff -- or at least a good scare -- has to be tossed out the audience once in awhile, if only to keep some interest and to prevent the film from spiraling into mind-numbing boredom.  ""The Others"" has no sense of this.  An hour into the film, the luxurious pace of ""The Others"" has become little more than self-indulgent tedium.  The process of building tension degenerates into pure impatience.  There's only two moments in ""The Others"" that can genuinely be considered ""jump-out-of-your-seat"" moments; if there had been three or four more of these moments, the film might've averted its slow, steady crash into monotony.  Yes, some of the scenes are extremely impressive, and I was particularly impressed with a lot of the cinematography, as well as the richness of the dialogue . . . but these things only can carry a film so far.  They have to lead to some kind of ultimate payoff in order to truly mean anything, and in the case of ""The Others"", that payoff never comes.  It's a nice film with some wicked little touches, a few of which border on pure genius . . . and then the film ends. No build-up to a dramatic resolution -- or, for that matter, a satisfying resolution.  For that reason, ""The Others"" can be appreciated for what it is trying to accomplish, and for the techniques it uses . . . but in no way, shape, or form can the end result be called a success.  It's a shame, because it seems as though it wouldn't have taken much to turn ""The Others"" from a bland film into one that was grippingly tense.
Though billed as the star of this film, Nicole Kidman falls just short of providing the strength that ""The Others"" needed from its central character -- the film revolves mostly around her character's beliefs and perceptions, and she's simply not up to the task of making those beliefs and perceptions one thousand percent convincing.  Personally, I've always found Ms. Kidman to be somewhat of an acting enigma -- she's undeniably talented, but apart from her tour de force performance in ""To Die For"", she always appears to be struggling to find the right outlet for her talent.  There's flashes of brilliance from Ms Kidman in ""The Others"", but that's it, only flashes -- overall, the performance is uneven.  I found myself wondering what the film would've been like had it featured either Julianne Moore or Helena Bonham Carter as its star.  Fortunately, there's a ""sleeper"" star in this film, one I would hope to see in many films in the years to come: Alakina Mann, who plays Grace's young daughter Anne.  As Anne, this young actress shows both strength and vulnerability with a powerful range, one rarely seen in young actors and actresses today.  She's asked to go head-to-head with Ms. Kidman on a number of occasions in the film, and not only does Ms. Mann hold her own, she shines through like a champion.  If nothing else, ""The Others"" might be worth watching simply to see Alakina Mann's superb performance.""The Others"" probably could never have been made without the success of the equally low-key ""Sixth Sense"".  ""The Others"", though, while possessing an undeniable sense of style and grace, is a film ultimately without a lot to say . . . or a lot to give to its audience.  As such, ""The Others"" is a film with some interesting qualities, some more enjoyable than others -- but it's ultimately little more than an okay film that goes on way longer than it should.  ""Interesting"" doesn't always mean ""good"" -- and with ""The Others"", this is certainly the case.  Grade: B-",The Others
254,jpozenel,"Excellent acting, very good story",8,22 June 2003,"Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan were both excellent in this movie. The story was quite good, but the interaction between their characters made the movie for me.  I never paid much attention to Nichole Kidman until just recently.  I guess it was because she was married to Tom Cruise who, for the most part, I consider to be just an awful actor.  I was wrong to discount her acting ability because of their association. Still, I can't see what she ever saw in him and I'm not surprised that it's over between them.
As far as other people's comments about the story being a rip-off of the Sixth Sense, I feel that kind of thinking is ridiculous.  Both movies where very good and I enjoyed them equally (maybe the Sixth Sense a bit more.)  It never even crossed my mind until I read some of the other IMDB comments. Why can't people just allow themselves to be entertained without being so negative and looking for fault with everything?

Nicole Kidman plays a mother who lives in an old house with her two children, who are very sensitive to sunlight, so the house is always dark, except for the occasional candlelight lamp, which gives the film a very creepy feel that stays throughout the entire movie.  Not much more should be said, but I will wrap up by saying again that this is one of the best films this year and (even though I normally don't like her in movies) Kidman definitely deserves Oscar consideration for her great performance.

I'LL GIVE *** TO LET YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S SAFE TO READ.First of all, let me say - I worked out the first twist. The servants being ghosts and all, but the second one sent my brain reeling in all directions!!! WOW!***This film is a great film. It uses the simplest of techniques to achieve the highest desired effect - to scare us witless! Doors opening and closing on their own. The piano being played in a room with no-one there. This might all sound familiar to the avid horror/thriller/chiller fan, but it is dealt with very careful means. And anyone expecting a slasher film, go somewhere else.***In hindsight, if you actually sit down and think about what you have just witnessed, the twist makes sooooooooooo much sense, AND it holds water, unlike the Sixth Sense.Take the two worlds - the living and the dead. As Grace (Kidman), in the world of the dead, keeps closing the curtains during the day to keep her children safe from the sun, and closing every door behind her so none are open, to the living, it seems that they have ghosts. If the 'intruders' keep opening the curtains during the day and leaving doors open, then to Grace, SHE has ghosts. This is so clever and really plays on a person's perceptions of events. God, I can't even put into words what I'm trying to say. But you who have seen this will definitely understand!!!!***No beating about the bush, Kidman SHOULD get the Oscar for this film. I havn't seen Spaceck's performance yet, but so far, Kidman deserves it. She nails the British accent, she gives a powerful performance, and she is believable.The two children are also outstanding, the girl was genuinely creepy at some points - when she was doing the 'red-rum' style two voiced exclamations in the room with her brother.I'm still in shock I think after seeing this film, it does make you think. Which is always welcome when I watch a film.Great direction. Very controlled. He knows when to keep us on our toes, or scare us half to death with tension.

259,SwingBatta,"Sluggish ""Others"" saves its best for last",5,11 November 2001,"An ambitious disappointment, ""The Others"" is one reason why I hardly take word-of-mouth from critics and viewers, positive and negative alike, into account when I go to the movies. Directed by Alejandro Amenabar (and featuring an executive producer credit for Tom Cruise), this film's strong points include solid but unspectacular acting that is enhanced by the cinematography and production design that nicely enhance a foreboding, isolated English mansion and spacious surrounding grounds (which were all filmed on location in Spain), but it is overshadowed by its incredibly slow pace and thin, recycled plot (which unfortunately has led to inevitable conclusions to ""The Sixth Sense""). It is backed up by a flimsy score that descends into silliness during tense moments, thus killing their effectiveness.As she should, Nicole Kidman provides the film's best performance as Grace, who, despite the insistence of her young daughter (Alakina Mann), refuses to believe that there may be ghosts inhabiting her house, where she pines away every day while waiting for her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) to return home from the war.She takes in three new servants - a codger (Eric Sykes), a mute (Elaine Cassidy), and a crone (Fionnula Flanagan, who, for some reason, reminded me of the maid portrayed by Hermione Baddeley in ""Mary Poppins""), after her previous help mysteriously disappears, but there is a lot more to this strange trio than she could possibly imagine.Mann and James Bentley, respectively, make their first big screen appearances as Anne and Nicholas, two youngsters who have a potentially fatal allergy to light - or who are ""photosensitive,"" as Grace verbalizes it - which results in an exhausting routine to make sure every door and shutter in the house is always shut and every curtain always drawn. It's a subplot that doesn't have much of an impact on the film as a whole.Despite ""The Others"" being hailed for its suspense factor, all the suspense is couched into the last thirty minutes. The early scenes in which Anne insists that there are indeed supernatural visitors lurking about (in particular a little boy named Victor), which lead to Grace's eventual inspection of her surroundings, have no punch at all - save for one sequence in which Grace discovers an old photo album - because it's too predictable and...well, boring. It's something we've all seen a million times before. The music repeatedly hams up the ""scare that's not really there"" schtick, which quickly became tiresome.But there's no denying the impact of the ending, which saves ""The Others"" from becoming a total disaster and what makes the needle spin on the adrenalin meter. I can't speak for everyone, of course, nor will I reveal any details, but the unexpected swerve completely dispelled anything I had theorized.One thing that this film should be commended for, despite its failure in the scare department, is the fact that it succeeds for the most part in presenting a ghost story that doesn't rely on intense special effects or blood and gore (in fact, there's not one drop of the red stuff to be seen anywhere), instead relying on good old fashioned storytelling.While ""The Others"" didn't work for me - and don't knock me for not understanding the plot; I grasped it plenty, thank you - it definitely will do the trick for horror/suspense fans who are sick of the ineptitude of dreck like the ""Scream"" series and who yearn for the days of good ghost stories once shared around the campfire. 6/10",The Others
260,tripwires,The chills haven't stopped,9,27 December 2001,"I'll admit straight out that I get scared easily. I couldn't sleep for months after watching ""The Sixth Sense"", and I really want to watch ""The Exorcist"", but I fear my heart wouldn't be able to take it. ""The Others"" is one of those movies that I know would scare me senseless, that I should avoid if I want to sleep in peace, but the more I realise that, the more I want to see it. It's a funny thing, human nature, it's almost masochistic. I can never understand why I enjoy scaring myself so much.(spoilers) ""The Others"" concludes on basically the same note as ""The Sixth Sense"". Like I said, the latter film scared me, but I found ""The Others"" somewhat more chilling and thrilling. In ""The Sixth Sense"" (a very good film too), I was scared by the images of the ghosts, like the woman in the kitchen. But in ""The Others"", I was scared by the POSSIBILITY of what haunts the house. We don't get to see who's behind the mysterious closing and opening of doors and things like that until the very end, and it's a good thing, because it allows the viewer to exercise his/her imagination. The film doesn't show the audience its scares; it suggests them, and it's a lot more effective than creating a CG ghoul that floats about and have it boo at the audience every few minutes.I have another confession to make: I screamed out loud at possibly the scariest scene in the movie, during the climax. The last time I did that was during ""Scream 3"", which wasn't scary, but everyone in the theatre was screaming, so I thought it would be fun to join in (it was). But here, I didn't scream for fun; tension was building up, and you're dying to see what's behind the closed doors (I wouldn't say what doors), and when you finally do, you see a sight that is so...grotesque that you can't help but scream. Needless to say, I got laughed at by my dad, but even he admitted that that scene sent chills down his spine.Throughout the whole movie I kept feeling goosebumps all over my body, and in fact, still do now, when I think back to the film. Its geographical and period setting, its small cast, its music, its cinematography, everything contributed to its creepiness. I was surprised to see that Kidman was actually good in this, after her unintentionally comical performance in Moulin Rouge!. She displayed a range of emotions and daringness that I did not expect. Very much like ""The Sixth Sense"", the truth that was revealed was more tragic than scary (though it did scare me), and Kidman, along with the two kids, evoked a pity in me that almost made me forget how scared I was. That, I think, is a real accomplishment.The movie boosts some of the greatest props I've seen in a while. I absolutely hated the photographs of the dead. They're old and yellowed and the most important photograph made me want to hide behind my cushion. The film also doesn't have any special effects or elaborate CG images. It's all atmosphere and mood, and it works very, very well. This is a brilliant and subtle horror movie that is well worth watching.",The Others
261,eytand94,The Others: A Return to Classical Supernatural Horror,10,6 August 2011,"Nowadays in horror, it isn't enough to simply hint at a ghost. The audience is going to want to see the specter in the flesh. But that takes away the true fright of supernatural terror. The feeling of an otherworldly presence is much scarier than seeing it. After such classics as 1961's ""The Innocents"" and 1963's ""The Haunting,"" a film like Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others"" is a warm love letter to horror.The film is set in 1940's New England. While her husband is away at war, Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, watches over her dark, foreboding mansion, as well as her children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a disturbing allergy to sunlight. Once Grace calls upon new housekeepers to tend to the mansion and the kids, things begin to go wrong. There is something the new guests aren't telling her, Anne is ""lying"" about seeing a little boy named Victor, and strange noises occur. But Victor isn't the only problem. There are others, uninvited guests that can't be seen. Is the house haunted or is Grace's sanity string beginning to loosen? ""The Others"" is, without a doubt, an extremely frightening horror film in a repetitious world of serial killers and nude blonds. It got attention when it was released, but today, I feel like its popularity has unfairly faded.The film has an ominous feel right from the start. There is nothing happy about this setting. You can already tell that Grace is unhappy, and since her husband is gone and her children's lives are at stake, she is always on edge. The mansion is completely darkened, and leaving a single door open can bring in sunlight and trigger an effect on the kids. But in such a case when a door is left open and nobody has touched it, we, as an audience member, develop paranoia and fear of the characters' surroundings.Back in the day, not seeing a ghost was, and still is, more terrifying. Masters like Jack Clayton and Robert Wise knew that, and so does Alejandro Amenabar. We don't see a single apparition. Amenabar favors implication over shock, something Hitchcock would be proud of. It is an old formula brought back to fantastic life.Although atmosphere is a highlight of ""The Others,"" the casting of Nicole Kidman is equally powerful. She is beautiful as well as talented. Her performance sponsors a realistic fear, which is a mother's loss of a child's love or even the loss of a child. Bring ghosts into the mix, and you have a perfect recipe for psychological horror, thanks to her performance.The ending is definitely a more common cliché currently than it was in 2001, but it still brings chills. And so does the rest of the movie. Paying homage to the classical horror films of the 1940's, ""The Others"" knows what truly scares you, and I hope one day, that it won't be a film just for older audiences, but for newcomers who have been raised on slasher movies, also.",The Others
262,Dark Eye,It's not often that a movie gets it right,10,10 June 2002,"This is an elegant haunted house movie in its purest, most classic form. It relies solely on atmosphere, creepy music and sense of foreboding, without ever resorting to those cheap and overused ""jolts"" that pops up from the side of the frame to scare us. The script is well-written and in certain cases it makes you think. I recommend watching this movie without any preconceptions of any kind, otherwise it might ruin the experience and surprises.I must point out that after reading several of the critics' reviews, I cannot understand those who claim that the movie is too slow. Why? Have they been so desensitized by movies with big explosions and CGI graphics that they cannot envelope themselves in a movie's atmosphere without a guiding hand? The comparison of this movie with The Sixth Sense is well deserved, and this I believe says a lot about its quality. Every frame and moment are filled with a thick atmosphere that never lets up, and the answer always seems out of reach until the very end. Interesting and hard questions are also being raised about our perceptions of the supernatural as well as religion, and the movie handled these issues very well with overlaying subtleness. I have to say that the movie is also nicely cast, the two kids are great and convincing without any hint of cliched sentimentalism about them. Nicole Kidman did a good job, she got better throughout the movie and in one scene looked positively ravishing.After seeing several of those special effects-laden haunted house flicks such as the remakes of the Haunting and House on the Haunted Hill, I was so sure that nobody understands how to do this particular genre justice anymore, and that we'll just have to resort to its teen-lite version such as Scream. Well thankfully The Others proved that with the right approach and thought, substance and style always go well hand-in-hand. If you enjoyed rewarding and intelligent thrillers like The Sixth Sense, then this movie is for you.",The Others

265,ayric,Sixth Sense Light is not so Light,8,21 December 2001,"The Sixth Sense was bound to inspire other film-makers, as this film is a good example of. Nicole Kidman and two surprisingly brilliant and creepy kids star in this slow, but very effective horror film. Just like the above-mentioned, The Others concentrates on story and terrific actors. Nicole Kidman has probably gained from her traumatic events with Tom Cruise. She acts with a nerve she hasn't shown before. It's a chilling experience, which unfortunately loses touch somewhat in the end. It still leaves you with the feeling of having seen a modern horror classic.   Rating: 8/10",The Others

I noticed at one point I was bent forward on the couch..The film has few if any flaws and is certainly one of the best I've seen this year. It's a delight to watch, with its attention to detail and the absence of any blatant anachronisms or plot holes.When I watched The Sixth Sense, I was disappointed. A spectacular plot twist was packaged in a very average film with average performances. The Others is so much more. It explores the human questions raised in a far better way and succeeds in creating a believable, living environment for the plot.It's predecessor remains a pale shadow, almost obliterated.",The Others

268,larcher-2,Solid but predictable,7,20 August 2001,"Solid but predictable, especially if one has seen other recent ghost movies. The resolution left a number of loose ends which could have been more imaginatively brought together.  The core of the film--the relationship between the living and the dead--could and should have produced something more than a not-very surprise ending.  The historical background--the German occupation of the Channel Islands during WWII--was merely used as a prop, not at a part of the narrative.  Similarly, the use of Catholic imagery and theology (which was often oddly misstated) seem to have little or no bearing on the story or its resolution.  The Others has the ingredients of a classic, but fails to blend them into a satisfying whole.",The Others
269,SamRag,"Very interesting, but only once you finished watching it",5,23 August 2002,"I don't have much to say about this film.  It had a very claustrophobic feel to it, lacking overview at times, and very few characters.  Not that it made it a bad film or anything.  The actors all did pretty good job, though I had a dislike of Nicole Kidman's character.  What I suspect was the downfall of the film, from my point of view anyway, was that you never really get what the story is about.  That is, until at the end, and let me tell you, if you know how it ends, the film is ruined for you (I think).  Overall, has the feeling of someone having a great idea (i.e. the ending), and then not managing well enough to write an interesting story!  5/10",The Others
270,nxgn_not_not,"No special effects, just creepy.",4,22 September 2003,"PLOT SPOILERS: I guess I should have seen it coming, what with the sixth sense it's almost like a new trend in plot twists.  But I never even guessed that they were all dead.  And I'm usually pretty good with that kind of thing.  And the equally amazing thing is I liked the child actors.  I usually hate child actors.  Especially those of the home alone and ET variety.  Maybe it's the fear thing, but the last three underage performances I could stomach were Osment, Ricci, and now Alakina Mann. Maybe it is the hope that she could blossom into another Jodi Foster that colors my perceptions.  Maybe it was the overall creepiness that brings a warm glow to all the performances.  Maybe it's the Fred Astaire factor, he could dance with a hat rack and make the hat rack look good.  Acting opposite Kidman makes it all seem easy.  Kidman did it all for me on this one.  Loved the book of the dead.  Had some minor difficulty with the time code though - what year was this what year was that - I suppose ghosts have no way of keeping track of time - but I seem to remember her wearing a watch.",The Others
271,HBeachBabe,"Boring, dull & pointless",6,6 August 2002,"I had high hopes for this film after hearing so much about it - how it relied on creepy atmosphere and sound to supply chills rather than jump out at you gore.  Well, it certainly doesn't have any jump-out-of-your-seat frights.  That's for sure.  It barely has any thrills at all.  Creepy atmosphere will only take you so far.  Like Blair Witch Project, The Others is like sex without climaxing, all build up and no pay off.The ending is rather pointless and really doesn't add anything to the story. It's an easy twist to figure out and from the moment I did, I realized everything happening had no point as the ending renders it all moot.  The only good moment is the way the twist is revealed but it can't redeemed the 100 minutes of tediousness leading up to it.  How this managed to get on the Top 250 list here is beyond me.  I think I'll go watch 'Signs' again, to see how slow build and creepy atmosphere can be done well *and* pays off with genuine scares.",The Others
272,Clive-Silas,Did there have to be a séance?,7,21 May 2003,"Without spoiling too much I will say that I was slightly disappointed that a séance was performed at one point in this movie, with the implication that a genuine connection with the, shall we say ""spirit world"" was made. Even the movie Ghost knew better than that! All ""professional"" mediums, without exception, are charlatans and con artists, and promotion of a rational viewpoint in life is not helped by otherwise intelligent movies falling into this particular trap.And it is an intelligent movie. For the most part the film manages very well to tell its story in little revelatory bits and pieces, whilst keeping the tension high. It even manages well the part where the returned father actually being dead is so obvious to the audience, although Grace and the children (of course) don't recognise it. It is handled in a way that it doesn't matter. He's there for character and plot development, not shock value.The problem arises in the final act of the film. It's at this point that, not simply because of the plot, but something in the way it was written, lit, shot, acted, edited together: somehow one is suddenly no longer watching a movie, but an episode of television melodrama. Maybe it is because the movie doesn't finish with a cathartic climax with, say, the house burning down or something, but rather one of those ambiguous twists which reminds you of ""Tales of the Unexpected"" or ""The Twilight Zone"". But also (again without going into too much detail) there is a marked increase in phoney looking period detail, and the look, acting and writing suddenly puts one in mind of a rather sub-par episode of ""Poirot"".Despite all the praise received from professional critics, my view was that Kidman's performance was the weakest of an otherwise excellent little ensemble (particularly Alakina Mann as the daughter who is just fantastic). I was especially keen to see the magnificent Eric Sykes, who seems to be getting more work as he gets older. For non-British readers (and indeed anybody under 30), I would like to point out that Eric Sykes is not just a consummate character actor, he is also one of the funniest writers and performers this country has produced, beginning over 50 years ago with his collaborations with Spike Milligan on the legendary Goon Show, and right up to the 1980s with his own sitcom, ""Sykes"". He's still acting on stage and screen, despite having been profoundly deaf for many years.",The Others
273,poetellect,absolutely exquisite,10,5 October 2001,"Rarely have I been so impressed with a movie's wry, knowing, and uncanny ability to produce a story of such wry, intellectual, spiritual, and haunting power.  There is much and many things going on in this flick- and it will surely tapped for a few Oscars, especially Cinematography, Set Design (check out those props and chairs and house lights- they're the real 40s stuff!), and even perhaps Best Original Screenplay.  On an even more impressive note is the emotional scope and raw energy with which Nicole imbues her portayal of Grace, as well as the uncannily adult and responsive acting ability shown by the supporting characters. (Check out those child actors!  what are they, adults in kid suits?  I've never seen anything like it!  Haley Joel doesn't hold a candle to these kids' ability)*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Let me first start off by addressing some of this film's many themes.  The whole idea of Nicole having to ""lock"" each individual room's door when entering and exiting creates the whole idea of barrier and isolation, as well as emotional barrenness.The whole idea of ""lighting"" takes on a surreal effect in this film, not only in its importance to Nicole's children and the exquisite, special cinematography to be found here, but also in the creation myth that begins the film and the idea of ""light"" and ""darkness"", of ""other"" and ""us"".Exquisite is a hard word not to use when writing about this one.  It's the real thing- ""The Others"" is a movie at once brilliant without drifting into the land of the quasi-pretentious, as Memento has a tendency to do, (being so ""smart"" that it's oftentimes impossible to follow and understand).  ""The Others"" is at last an emotional look of the bonds of a three-membered family, of human interaction, of spiritual explanation of death and the paranormal, and a wry inquest into what ""ghosts"" in of themselves have to say about us the living, us the dead, or, as this film may have us believe, the very thin lines that separates the two.All in all, will definitely garner some Oscar recognition, as I stated before, and even (who knows?) get Nicole that Best Actress nod she's deserved for some time now.",The Others
274,kalibeans,"story, story, story makes this such a don't miss film!!!",9,17 July 2012,"The mark (for me at least) of a truly great movie is a well written story. Developing characters slowly, letting the story flow from their personalities. But the very best is that Amenabar does not rely on CG or gore or violence to create a chill down to your bones scary movie. They kicked it old school with this one and it is a real gem. Another rarity is the truly original story line. Full of twists and turns that despite your best efforts you absolutely do not see coming. I've also found I enjoy this movie better and better with each subsequent viewing. It simply begs to be watched again to pick up on all the nuances you miss the first time around because you are just simply too scared to pick up on them. Kidman is at the top of her game in The Others. Fionnula Flanigan is terrifying as the - well you don't exactly know what she is up until the end. It leaves you guessing as to the true nature of the supporting characters who play the new staff. Amenabar does a superb job with lighting and location. Isolated and utterly creepy the old house itself is almost a character unto itself in The Others. Mann and Bentley also deserve nods for their performances at such a tender age. If you can manage to hold off for a wonderfully blustery, stormy evening alone, it will only add to the thrill of The Others.

275,tripper0,"good, not great......",7,13 August 2001,"'The Others' is a movie that is extremely rich in atmosphere.  Kidman's character, Grace, and her two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a mansion that is constantly surrounded by a thick fog.  Plus, most of the movie is candle lit.  The light, and lack there of, plays a huge role in much of the movie, and creates a thick sense of tension and sometimes dread.      However, no matter how good the atmosphere was, the pacing was a little awkward.  It was generally slow, sometimes bordering on being to slow, all building towards a supposedly startling conclusion.  I will admit that I thought it was decent, at least somewhat original and smart.  In a lot of ways however, it just wasn't worth it.      You could probably talk to your friends afterwards about what made you jump, what didn't, and what you thought of the ending.

It just wasn't scary. Or interesting. Within 15 minutes of the start of the movie, I was wondering how soon it would end. I had no reason to care about what would happen to the characters, and nothing interesting did happen.I should declare my bias. Other than Dead calm, and Eye Wide Shut, I have never found much to like about Nicole Kidman's acting. She leaves me cold. In this movie, she seems to sleepwalk through the part, with an expressionless frostiness that left me uninvolved. I found myself viewing the movie as a critical exercise rather than being drawn into its alternate reality. Like all ""haunted house' stories, this movie depends on suspension of disbelief. Neither the script nor the acting delivered that for me.",The Others

But I am a fan of the more psychological horror films; The Others ticks all the right boxes for me. It has no special effects or gore for that matter, so it relies on moody lighting, a tense score, great acting and storytelling - at some points in the film, a combination of these things actually make broad daylight seem creepy. My only snagging point is the disease that the children have - they're photosensitive - so any exposure to sunlight will kill them. This is the basic set-up that the whole movie is based on, at first it may seem like a poor excuse to keep the house in perpetual darkness, but gradually it becomes a revelatory plot point. Now, if you're sharp, this light-sensitive ploy will be a dead giveaway right from the start.",The Others
278,Tommy-5,A masterpiece,10,22 May 2002,"The Others is a great film, excellent in every way. Every now and then something truly outstanding comes along and so it was with The Others. Nicole Kidman, quite possibly the most beautiful woman of our time, checked her ego at the door and dressed down to portray a depressed war widow with two young children. The mood and atmosphere are perfect and one waits with eager anticipation the next offering of the film's young director, Alejandro Amenabar. 	The time is just after World War II and the place is a gloomy house sitting in the mist of the Jersey Isle. One is reminded of Wuthering Heights with the constant sense of Gothic dread and unease which Amenabar so capably created. Grace's (Kidman) children are ultra sensitive to light and the house must be kept dark at all times, a point which Grace hammers home to the new house servants who unexpectedly show up at her doorstep to offer their services. It seems they have worked in this house before and know it well -- too well as we soon see. Grace's daughter claims to see visions of others in the house and Grace worries about her emotional health. The daughter is precocious, her son unhealthily timid and it is obvious Grace is a very burdened woman. 	Grace becomes convinced that the house is indeed haunted and the suggestions of hauntings are what make this film a masterpiece. Unexplained sounds, sightings, shadows and timely creaking doors come along at just the right time. By the film's last few minutes, we have learned about the mysterious house servants and Grace's husband. We are now on the threshold of learning a dark secret and experiencing an interesting plot twist. 	The use of shadows, lighting, sound, music and the body movement of the players (I have not mentioned what a fine supporting cast appears with Ms. Kidman, another important reason this is such a fine film) bring back memories of the conventional haunted house stories of days gone by. 21st century technology is an asset, not a burden here, and that is, sadly, not always the case. It is interesting to note also that The Others is every bit as atmospheric viewed in your living room as it was on the theatre big screen and  that is a credit to Amenabar's skill. You may even say his genius, because this is one fine piece of work. It may very well be that this becomes his signature offering, for it will be very difficult for him to top The Others.",The Others

The screenplay by Alejandro Amenábar is a masterpiece of structure, gradually revealing its mysteries, and playing on the audience's assumptions to create an atmosphere of dread.
The choice to make the children allergic to light is another master-stroke that gives director Amenábar the opportunity to play with darkness and light, and create a pervasive sense of danger.Nicole Kidman is great. Hard to believe this film came out twenty years ago, and she is still going strong. We take her for granted, and forget how brilliant she has been in so many movies across the years. Love her.Fionnuala Flanagan is effective as the old housekeeper who suspiciously shows up at just the right moment, and seems to have all the answers.A wonderfully made, chilling piece of old school dread.

In the latter are films like The Amityville Horror, and in the former I would add this movie along side classics such as The Haunting (the original).This is not a film for those with a nervous disposition. Hailed as the next Sixth Sense, a comparison that that is perhaps a little unfair, this movie will have you trembling in your seats and spilling your popcorn.Nicole Kidman stars as a mother trying to cope with bringing up two children in a large house on Jersey in 1945, still waiting for news of her long absent husband. Soon after the arrival of three new staff, strange things start to occur... If I told you any more of the plot it would spoil it. This is definitely one film where the least you know before hand the better. All I will say that it represents everything that is good about film; there is no swearing, gratuitous violence or nudity. Instead there is suspense and a great deal left to the imagination.

285,randreww,Soul Destroying,8,17 October 2018,"Seldom does a film this esoteric happen. And I think that this shall not appeal to everyone. But that is the point of making a difference. The horror genre has become very frivolous in later years. And I doubt enough people can appreciate the sophisticated subtlety & introspective nature of a film which aims to create a mood, a spyglass into the past, & with devastatingly convincing performances from the 4 main characters. So it is no surprise to me that this gets underappreciated. The film has me in tears every time I watch it about every 7 years. And as I get older, & regret my life choices, I can't help but let it scar me a little deeper each time. I suppose it feels very real to my own situation; lonely, heart broken, unable to move on, & destitute. It carefully switches from the suspense of being haunted, to the heart rending return of a lost loved war veteran; a father & husband. The music is exasperating in its' effectiveness. And you feel very trapped in this River Styx with them. This is not an easy watch. Not in terms of gore, horror, or violence. But because you can't help but pity each & every character. Especially the children, who spend much of the time on screen distressed. And are ultimately subjected to the worst scenario you can think of, through no fault of their own. There's a part where the husband breaks down in to tears as he realizes that he may have triggered the series of events by failing to profess all love for his family by going to fight in the war. It's a harsh scene that is doubly felt the second time round. If I ever watch this film again, I shall be 44 years old. I doubt I'll reach that age! But if I do, this film might be the end of me ha ha! Thankfully I don't believe in ghosts, gods, & gravestones. But I do believe in the imagination.

289,Axiom-2,"Check Out ""The Other"" Classics!",4,12 August 2001,"Before I saw this movie today,I read the reviews & they were very positive & given high ratings,so I decided to see it. I was very disappointed in it. I was expecting alot more & kept waiting for something good & scary to happen for the first while.I found alot of it to be confusing. For example: What's the deal with the husband showing up from nowhere in the fog,and what was the purpose of him in the plot? Am I missing something? Also, how come ""Ann"" was the only one to see the intruders? I left the theater trying to figure it all out. On the other hand alot of it was copied from other movies & predictable. I did not feel scared during this film overall. It had only a few creepy moments worth mentioning. One of them can be seen on the 30 second tv spot.(Ann as the old woman with the white vail) The other is the photo album that Grace(Kidman) finds. That was creepy!Everyone seems to be comparing this film to ""The Sixth Sense"" I liked that better than this but,I was disappointed in it as well. If you want to see a true classic ghost story then rent or buy the DVD of ""The Changeling""(1980) starring: George C. Scott. That blows this movie away! Lots of scares & a much better story. Also ""Dark Places""(1973) starring: Joan Collins & Christopher Lee, is another well done scary ghost story with plenty of twists & suspense. There was also an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" they did about ""Ghosts"" & one of the segments was about the ""Queen Mary"" being haunted. That scared me more than this movie! It was very well done & gave you chills up your spine & left you with a really creepy feeling.And I didn't have to pay $9:50 to see it!   I wouldn't say ""The Others"" stunk, but I wouldn't say it was great & worth seeing either. I give it a 4/10.",The Others
290,c_p_c,A Movie Worth Seeing,7,25 February 2002,"Creepy, spine-tingling, twisting, etc...these words plus many more could describe the nature of this film.  Set in an erie, remote house, this film uses psychology to thrill as opposed to blood and gore.  It uses the thoughts on what happens when you die and plays around with them, ultimately delivering a very pleasing film.  While in my opinion it took a little to long to get started, the scary enviroment, jump-scenes (not to many but when they occur, watch out), and the overall ending was worth the time spent.Overall, if you are looking for a suspenseful and respectable (not to often do you see those two words together when talking about a horror film) thriller, this is a good bet.  Creepy and crazy, when this movie is over you will be thinking about it for hours.7/10 - Points were subtracted for the while it took to get started (in my opinion the makers took to long to set the background), plus they needed a few more jump scenes.",The Others

Kidman's character makes no sense from beginning to end, and her involvement in the ""twist"" ending comes as little surprise.  Fionnulla Flanigan scores points as the omniscient maid.

Grace (Kidman in a superb performance) and her creepy children, who are sensitive to sunlight, have to stay inside. When her daughter Anne (Alakina Mann, who holds her own strongly, playing off Kidman well) starts telling her she can see ""intruders"" in the house, Grace disregards it until she begins having terrifying experiences of her own. After the arrival of mysterious ""servants"", who aid Grace in her paranoia, it becomes clear that something is very wrong within the walls of her home, and she must take matters into her own hands or something far worse could come of it.

293,silviopellerani,Gothic and weird. Worths to see it,6,28 November 2001,"To be honest when I decided to go and see this film I thought that acting Nicole Kidman would be a nice and ""handsome"" film without having read almost anything about it.I was misjudging the director and the ""beautiful"" actress, because this important film from the Chilean/Spanish Amenabar is much more than a normal thriller or a ""scary movie"". The photography is rather gothic, and since the beginning there is a sense mistery around this ""haunted"" house. The lack of light which is a ""leit-motiv"" of the action helps you to enter into Amenabar's world. As soon as the action goes on some elements are disclosed to the spectator but you have to wait up to the end to understand the whole plot.Nicole Kidman is the right actress in the right role, a bit ""northernish"" and of course beautiful.Rating: 6/10",The Others

At first it might look like just another good-mystery horror movie. However, as you watch it twice or three times, you will realize it has a complex thought-provoking subject which many of us would avoid because there are no right answers for the implied subject. Sometimes we will avoid because it can take us to a place we don't want to be very often, which is the boundaries between this world and the ""next"" one, whatever your faith is. Unless you're a totally science person like Stephen Hawking, you know we still struggle to understand the mysteries of this life. Why we are here, how and when we die, and how these events are related. That's the foundation of many of ours issues as humans, fears, uncertainties. To me, the idea of being trapped in a ""limited world"", whether it is a house, a neighborhood or even a city is really scary. It is like, depending how you leave this world, you should stay in limbo, whatever your limbo is, and for what reason? Reflection? I guess, the only remedy what we know will come someday is trying to live your life the best way you can. Follow your dreams, treat the others well and keep your faith, Those who choose to live in the desert might end up going to one.

295,ShinKyo81,Amenábar and Shyamalan: two brilliant directors,8,12 September 2001,"Alejandro Amenábar has created another masterpiece of film. ""The Others"" is an incredible production with everything that a film needs: brilliant story, incredible creepy atmosphere, brilliant recreation of the '40s and outstanding performances of Nicole Kidman and the rest of the crew.I didn't find the film slow at all. I went to the theater thinking of what I heard from lots of people: ""The film is good, but it's incredibly slooooooow"". But in my opinion, ""The Others"" needs a deep atmosphere, with dark scenarios and only with candle lights. That's how Alejandro Amenábar has included the tension that keeps you frightened from the start till the end of the film.Nicole Kidman is incredible (in all the meanings ^_^). She performs her character (Grace) with a lot of credibility. Also the two children, specially Alakina Mann, do incredible performances.A thing that surprised me is that there's no blood on the film. At any time. We don't find terror movies without blood&guts these days. Also, there're no CGI or modern special effects in ""The Others"", a thing that must remind us that the special effects are an addition to a film, not the main event of the production.SPOILER AHEAD:""The Others"" is pretty close to ""The Sixth Sense"" in different points. The plot is quite similar and the end too. Also the kind of atmosphere is really similar to Shyamalan's film. Even though, I'm not saying ""The Others"" is not original. It's a brilliant production from one of my favorite directors. Keep on Alejandro!!! We're waiting for your next masterpiece!!!Worth look! 10/10",The Others
296,morkulv_athferion,Very intense and moody thriller,9,26 May 2009,"This movie looks and feels as if it could have been directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and thats really saying something. I saw this movie for the first time in theater when it first came out and I must say I'm really glad I did, because its one of the finest thrillers I've seen. The movie has a thick atmosphere, especially because of the foggy surroundings and the mysterious mansion. The cast is small, but they sure give their full 100% because the acting never fails to deliver the great script that gets more intelligent as the movie progresses.Some people have been comparing this movie to The Sixth Sense, but they are not exactly the same. Yes they are both suspenseful thrillers and have a similar story-twist but I think The Others is better in terms of atmosphere. But overall if you love movies that get you on the edge of your seat the whole time, then this movie is definitely for you.I just saw this movie recently again and I am just as impressed as I was 8 years ago when I first saw this film in theater. The Others is a rare type of movie and very refreshing in a age where movies are filled with CGI acid-trip effects most of the time. This movie shows that big special effects do not win over a well-written story, a clever script and great acting.",The Others
297,LT-10,High Quality Film *Spoilers* Keep away if you haven't seen the movie!,8,24 August 2001,"This film gets points right away for being able to scare me. I don't mean something that will keep you awake and thinking like ""Rosemary's Baby"" The Others scares as you watch. This is rarely done now adays with success, it has just become too predictible after all the Halloween and Friday the 13th sequels. However, The Others pulls it off.Now to the idea that it is slow...I disagree. The entire film felt intense for me. If you think THIS is slow then you really need to work on your attention span. I am only 14 years old, but I read reviews from people I assume are grown men and women complaining of boredom. That surprises me, shouldn't it be the other way around?The moment in this film that will stay with me is the book of the dead. As Grace (Nicole Kidman) flips through the pages I automatically felt uncomfortable, unsettled. The images will stay with you. Another great moment is when the house is being searched for an ""intruder"". Grace is looking around a room when we notice something behind her, eyes, staring out from the darkness. She does not notice at all and just when it comes apparent to us they are there, a light moves and we discover the eyes are part of a painting. That was perfectly timed, genuine.Now to the ending, I'm talking about the ending-ending when we discover who Grace and the children really are. Well, I guess there was some element of surprise there. Unfortunatly, it didn't seem all the shocking since it isn't a new concept. The line ""This house is ours"" seems to come from no where. It wasn't like they loved the house, they were being put through hell. So the ending-ending wasn't the films strongest point. However, when Grace discovers a page that was missing from the book of the dead, that sends chills up your spine. That was frightening.The Others proves that special effects are not needed to scare. It also proves that no matter how many horror movies you have seen (And believe me I have seen LOTS) it is still possible to have a few scares. The Others will take you on a journey that you won't soon forget.",The Others

As so many have said before, the film's story and script themselves are solid and compelling. The direction, acting, cinematography and editing are excellent. The suspense is genuine and the audience really feels for the characters and their emotions.If Freddy and Jason and the other slashers are your thing, then by all means stay away from this film as you will be disappointed that no one is cut or tortured or hunted down in a screaming mayhem to die a gruesome death.

I found that I appreciated this more by reflecting upon it afterwards. It was not simply a movie but an experience. Our experience of the events remains with the characters and develops with them to the ultimate revelation.

303,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 5 out of 5,9,23 November 2003,"The Others is a riveting and darkly menacing thriller, yet, during the course of the film, not a drop of blood is shed and no one dies.  It is a reflection on the talent of director Alejandro Amenabar that small things, like a door slamming shut in one's face or a ghostly hand upon one's cheek are far more frightening than any amount of special effects that films in this genre are increasingly becoming reliant upon.  A sense of claustrophobia is introduced from the outset by the thick fog surrounding the house in which most of the action takes place, and also by the permanently closed curtains and doors that prevent sunlight from brightening the rooms.In this house the light must always be contained, because the two young children (who live there with their mother) are photosensitive, and exposure to daylight will make them very ill.  But it would seem that the family and their three somewhat mysterious servants are not the only inhabitants of the darkened house.  Footsteps are heard, doors are opened, curtains are removed, but search as they may, nobody can find the perpetrators of these actions.  And it would seem that whatever these beings are, they bear an ever-increasing amount of malevolent ill will towards the family.The film's conclusion is unexpected, even for those viewers who have managed to second-guess an earlier plot twist prior to its revelation.  The surprise factor is at least partly due to the outstanding performances by the cast; special mention must be made of Alakina Mann, who is a young actress with a very bright future.  This film is an example of outstanding cinematic production, and to maximise its impact, it is best watched in a darkened room.",The Others

Not that it matters, because The Others is just like any horror movie: it feeds off the movies that came before it and attempts to make them better. It succeeds.The Others not only succeeds in weaving the classic Hollywood ghost story (music, atmosphere, sudden shocking scenes, scenes of dawning horror), but it also succeeds in creating a very good movie. Nicole Kidman is absolutely fantastic, as are the two children, and the direction of the movie is absolutely stunning.Classic atmospheric horror seemed to be a lost art, relegated to be remembered through replays of Vincent Price movies. But then came The Sixth Sense, bringing back the classic ghost story with a wrenching twist.Then came What Lies Beneath, adding more terror to a more realistic plot, with another stunning finish.And now we have The Others, a truly beautifully haunting ghost story. A truly terrifying horror movie, one of the scariest in years. And it is much, much better than its modern-day ancestors.10/10",The Others

It is a slow moving picture, in a lot of scenes it is very obvious to me that Nicole Kidman is acting, i.e., she was not convincing, and the film didn't frighten me at all! One good thing is the fact that the film maker didn't use gory scenes throughout the picture which is a plus, even though a weak one! The stars that stand out the most in this film are Fionnula Flanagan, playing the housekeeper/nanny, in a very good performance, and the daughter played by Alakina Mann.

Nicole Kidman (with this movie and Moulin Rouge I really like her), the children and the woman who plays Mrs. Mills were all excellent. At the end of the movie one is likely to compare this movie to The Sixth Sense but thinking about it you realize that it varies the topic in a very interesting way. The script is wonderful giving you some hints but not giving away the plot. So overall, the direction, acting, setting, lighting, script and story are truly outstanding.

311,mar9,Atmospheric disturbances,8,6 March 2002,"The best thrills and chills are those inside our own heads. Everyone knows it but Hollywood keeps trying to outdo itself with more gristle, more gore and ever bigger vats of blood. Not the case with this film, which is almost a throwback to the ghost stories of the 19th century and the B&W mystery films of the mid 20th century. Revisiting that territory, in a film as tidily put together as this one, is refreshing.Nicole Kidman is radiant as Grace, the isolated, migraine-prone mother of two perturbed children (Alakina Mann is wonderful as the older child Anne, James Bentley is good too). Both children suffer from photosensitivity and Grace is meticulous in protecting them from the daylight. But all is not well. They are marooned in a mansion house (Grace appropriately compares the house to a ship at one point), the place is eerily fog-bound, the postman hasn't come, three new servants have arrived unexpectedly and the children are noticing that they don't appear to be the only ones on the house. Then Grace starts noticing things too...The most trivial things become objects of fear and suspense in this film. A face in a picture, shadows, a moving curtain, a door that moves suddenly, a bump upstairs, half-heard whispers, a piano playing behind a closed door, dense fog. The atmosphere is developed superbly and Kidman plays her part - when required, she looks utterly s*** scared. But don't expect gory shocks for there are none.",The Others
312,thechosen1,"Very, very creepy.",10,19 April 2003,"First thing's first... Nicole Kidman was absolutely brilliant. This movie raises creepiness to a whole new level.  The direction and suspense level are just excellent.  Very few horror movies are made this way.  The less you see and the more you feel and hear... the scarier it gets.  The main character, Grace, is determined to keep herself and her children protected from strange ""intruders"" in the house which she has been living in for five years.  The sudden appearance of three mysterious servants hasn't made it all that easier for her either.  So, you can imagine the extremely tense feeling that Grace is overcome by throughout most of the movie.  And Nicole does the perfect job of keeping that tense expression on her face for the entire duration.  Both of the kids did a great job and though Christopher Eccleston's role was a bit short, he was great too.  Very interesting, full of suspense and some fantastic twists and turns.  Highly recommended. 10/10.",The Others
313,DiamondGirl427,Glad I Never Bothered....,4,15 August 2010,"When this film came out...I thought it might be good..worth seeing at some point..in the theater. I am glad I never wasted my time and money to do so then. It starts off boring..stays boring..and does little to make you want to watch it until the end. It did not take long to realize the main characters were dead..and did not understand what had happened to them. The kids...the boy..is wimpy..and the girl is rather mean and hateful. No wonder..with a mother who seems to have major mood swings at the drop of a hat. The husband...a war hero of sorts..comes home..suddenly..out of the fog...unsure of how he got there...and with the idea the war is still being fought...so he must go back and leave his family again. To live in that gloomy house..surrounded by fog..no wonder he wants to leave. The caretakers of the place...they all seem to know SOMETHING...but none say a word...why? The housekeeper simply does the bidding of the woman..with a grim look on her face..as if she doesn't approve. Why doesn't she speak up? The kids are supposedly sensitive to light...so everything is kept dark..windows covered...she thinks the sunlight will kill them...how does she know that? Who told her? A doctor..? Or is it part of her delusions? She seems very uptight and almost manic at times..ranting and raving...which would have been the perfect time for someone to tell her the truth. Apparently..her husband was killed in the war...and she lost her mind because of it...killed her children and the people who worked for her...and then herself....or she was loony all along and that sent her over the edge? The mansion sits far from anything...it seems...no one comes...no one we see anyway...but when the curtains disappear...we know someone or something has taken them down...ghosts we are thinking..? Someone trying to kill her children...the woman is thinking. I never did get the idea of why the woman kept all the keys to everything. Every room had to be kept locked...another of her delusions? If she was so fearful of the place...why didn't she gather her children and leave? Fog or no fog? Any good mother would have gone for help or something of the sort. She gets a gun and attempts to shoot...another hint at what she might have done at one time to the living? I wanted to like this film...and I am not a big Nicole Kidman fan at all..but after I figured out the plot..it was no longer interesting. They called the unseen people ""The intruders""...and it scares the children. Who would scare children like that? If they have to spend eternity being afraid because of things their mother did..it seems wrong. The séance scene finally lets you in on what is going on...duh...we knew that already. What people would hold a séance to find out of the place was truly haunted before they decided to buy it? Weird. The place will continue to stay empty..because as Nicole Kidman says in the end ""no one can make us leave this house"". It reminded me of another haunted house type story..""Rose Red"" by Stephen King...which made a much better movie. Watch that instead...I think you will enjoy it a lot more.",The Others

It dosen't use special effects to scare (using visuals to scare dosen't work usually anyway) this uses atmosphere. For instance creaking doors etc, maybe your saying to yourself thats not scary thats a clice. But if you do think that way I would still think you would like this- no electricity, no phones, no radios. This is a deep and haunting tale. Nicole Kidman gives a tour-de-force performence. While the childern Alakina Mann as Anne and James Bentley as Nicholas give truly excellent performences- but theey're still not as good as Haley Joel Osment. All the cast are good really. Now the flaw many will have is its resemblence to another film I won't tell you what film- but really I over-looked that because I don't think the writer Alejandro Amenabar set out to steal from the other film.

If it doesn't then I suspect no movie can give you a breathless moment. Actually the build up is very slow and feels dull but curiosity kept me watching, was she an abusive mother etc. MAny things will come to mind on what is going on as it can seem confusing in its understatement oxymoronic as that sounds...Then BAM! Chills like no other film have ever given me. Nothing to do with the excellent ambiance or script to give this a 10 just the plain simple fact that it gave me a shock like no other film has ever done. Not since I was a child watching horrors on the sly has a movie made me feel such dread. Best watched in absolute silence if you are in company but even better when watched alone at home as I did. The only problem is that a second watch does clear up what exactly was happening but it cannot give you the creeps like a first viewing did.",The Others
320,JobsBronson,Classy frightfull film,9,19 October 2020,An awesomely terrifying movie. An absolute favorite. It doesn't underestimate our intelligence and it manages to surprise us so much. Nicole Kidman is great. I remember watching this movie for the first time and having goose bumps all over my body every five seconds. That's the feeling I want to have in thrillers.,The Others
321,SammyK,Is Alejandro becoming the Spanish M. Night? I hope not.,6,16 May 2002,"After seeing Amenabar's stunning ""Open Your Eyes,"" I greatlyanticipated his follow-up, ""The Others.""  Unfortunately, hisEnglish-language sophomore effort is a terrible let-down.  It had alot of potential, and it was actually a film that I wanted to like - if itweren't for some unfortunate plot contrivances.Instead of weaving an intricate web of subjective psychology,horror and supernatural ambiance, in an homage to ""TheInnocents"" (and ""The Turn of the Screw"" on which it was based),the director gives us a shallow, contrived ""twist-ending"" thriller,which doesn't have a whole lot to say or offer.  In this sense, itwould seem that Amenabar shares a lot in common with hisAmerican counterpart, M. Night Shymalan - the denouement-meister.To the film's credit, the cinematography is georgeously gothic.  Thefirst half of the film generates a good deal of creepiness throughthe atmosphere alone.  As well, the performances are stellar -from Nicole Kidman's hysterical mother, to her pale-faced children.But again, it's amazing how much one lazy stroke in a script - inthis case, the ""things are not as they seem, but you saw it from amile away"" plot twist - can sink a promising venture.Where's a script editor when you need one?",The Others
322,DP-4,"Good film, but too slow!",7,18 August 2001,"I must admit that I had not even heard of this film until my wife mentioned it. We only went to see it because of the high IMDB rating. I have mixed emotions about this film. It was most obviously inspired by the Sixth Sense, although it does offer a different spin on that theme. The acting was fantastic. I did not know Kidman was that good. The supporting cast was also equally as excellent, as was the directing of the film.But, this movie is sooooooooooo slow! You are left constantly, constantly waiting for something to happen, but get nothing until the last 20 minutes of the film. I found myself frustrated, and just wanted the end to come so that the movie would make sense. Fortunately, the movie does explain itself, but the explanation did not totally make up for the time it took to get to the punch line. That said, I would still recommend this film. The acting is so good that it merits viewership. Besides, the Sixth Sense was so phenomenal that we have to expect people to copy from it. Imitation is, after all, the highest form of flattery.-- DP.",The Others

Plus, an impressive bit of acting by Nicole Kidman.",The Others
324,saeedahmedsasoli,This is more of a drama than a thriller.,10,18 November 2020,"The cinematography is innovative and brilliant, camera angles and the lighting set everything up so well. The lighting is very important as well, in fact, the subject of ""light"" is so well mixed into the story, the dark feels safer and more secure than the light does. There are times when you long for the darkness, just as the characters long for the darkness (due to a part of the plot including a health condition of the children, which serves a basis for the mental thrill fest to come). To finish off this concoction, try to listen to the score, because it's very fitting.This is more of a drama than a thriller, though it deserves to be a thriller (it's scary), but the power of it's dramatic side comes bursting through. This is a beautiful movie, it has overtones of a more serious side, and it's a movie that hardly belongs in the horror section because of it's beauty, but it's too darned eerie, weird, and chilling to fit anywhere else.Finally, I cannot but mention the crew of the film. It is even a more fantastic job when you consider that the film (many people don't realize this) is chiefly a Spanish production. The production design by Benjamín Fernández and specially the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe are extraordinary. Just as in the best painting of figures like Goya or Rembrandt, light and shadow reveal the objects and the people.I do not hesitate to say that this is really one of the best films of the year 2001. I am still waiting to watch Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, La stanza del figlio, The shipping news, The hours and Italiensk for begyndere, but I know it will remain amongst those at the top. A 10/10 is really fair for a film that has it all, a perfect machinery that arrives at a time when we seriously need intelligent films and not blockbuster deceptions. I can only say I hope its director won't jump to Hollywood in search of big-time projects that waste his potential.",The Others
325,jjh6519,Completely surprised! Much better than expected!,10,15 May 2002,"I purposely waited to see this on video because I had read enough negative reviews about this movie, that I did not want to waste my money on seeing it at the theatre.   Well, now I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner.   The negative reviews completely misled me.This is the best ghost story and haunted house story I've ever seen on film. It has completely believable characters, a lot of hints dropped throughout (which I didn't catch until the ending), a growing tension and fear, excellent acting, and perfect cinematography to capture the story.  
If you have ever been turned off by the House On Haunted Hill type movies, believe me, you will like this so much more!  It showed that this type of film does not need gore and special effects -- just a good story, the right atmosphere (music, setting and cinematography), and exceptional acting by all in the film. One question:  Why did Nicole Kidman get nominated for that flimsy role in Moulin Rouge, but not for The Others?   This is possibly her best role ever, next to To Die For.   Her portrayal of the rigidly protective mother was masterful, and she convincingly brought out the full range of emotions.I was completely surprised by the artistry of the movie, how well it gripped me as a drama as opposed to a horror flick, and how the ending just plain floored me!  This was not the B-movie I was expecting.",The Others
326,jjh6519,The Ultimate Haunted House-Ghost Story!,10,2 November 2002,"I have for a long time had a lot of problems with the haunted house or ghost-in-the-house type movie.  There is generally way too much screaming, gore, special effects, and worst of all, these movies tend to take their ridiculous premises way too seriously. The exception has always been ""Poltergeist"", because so much warmth and humor was part of the story of a middle-class American family under siege in their nice suburban home, and because it definitely had some really scary moments. Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, one more time!So, when I first saw ""The Others"", I was not expecting much.  Was I ever blown away!  First: Nicole Kidman gives one of the best performances of her career in this movie -- better even than ""To Die For"" -- so why was she nominated for an Oscar for that pathetic role in ""Moulin Rouge""?   Second: This movie throws out all the other haunted house and ghost story cliches. The premise of the story is actually quite simple and believable if you believe in ghosts, and it cannot be repeated here.  See it and enjoy it. There is no blood or gore.  There are, quite frankly, no special effects. It is just a great story, within the confines of a ghost story and a haunted house setting, with a dynamite twist ending, with fantastic acting from the entire cast (especially Kidman as the strictly religious, super-control-freak mother of two very different children, and kudos to the little girl who portrays the daughter who knows too much and to the elderly lady who plays the wise nanny-housekeeper who also knows more than the mother).  Fantastic direction, moody cinematography and spooky music.This was chilling, shocking and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout, and I was watching it in my own home!   I saw it again tonight, and it still is every bit as fascinating and chilling.",The Others

It has everything and is genuinely one of the most atmospheric and chilling horror films ever made.  It doesn't have all the Hollywood gloss and special effects, instead it has first rate acting, from all the characters, first rate direction. Most importantly of all it lets you use your own imagination to fill out what you can't see. The plot also is important to this film and is much cleverer than you expect it to be.  You have to watch it carefully and to the very end to fully find out what has been going on.This is a truly gripping and scary film and unless you are Mr Spock you will have goose bumps at times and will jump out of your skin at other times. What you must do to really appreciate it is to watch it from start to finish without being distracted.  During the film you will get totally absorbed into the story and to have to finish the ironing for the last half hour of the movie simply won't do.If you like horror films you must see this movie. 10/10",The Others
328,Brandon Hall,A Rarity,10,15 May 2002,"I don't believe in watching horror movies after 1990, but this one proved me wrong. First of all, I wouldn't really call it a splatter horror movie, it's just an old ghost story. But, if you've seen this movie and don't understand (like I did the first two times) I'm going to explain it to you. And if you don't want me to spoil it for you please do not read ahead. Ok, I'm going to attempt to explain: Nicole Kidman lives with her two kids who seem to be haunted by a family of ghosts... but, Nicole Kidman and her two kids ARE the ghosts to the other family. In the final scene the family sits with a psychic trying to contact Nicole Kidman and her two kids when the psychic DOES reveal that Nicole Kidman had killed her kids and shot herself, which did happen... Nicole Kidman's family was haunting the other family. I found myself saying ""Ohhhhhh!"" at the end when the family (NOT Nicole Kidman's) decided to move out they put a ""For Sale"" sign up. So what I'm trying to say is that Nicole Kidman's family are the ghosts actually haunting another family, though we are lead to believe that the Nicole Kidman family is the ""good living"" family, they are actually dead because Nicole Kidman went crazy and killed them all. Okay! You probably can't understand that but if you can it will help you. I had to buy this movie after seeing it and I give it a 10/10. The only weak point in the film is the accents that the characters have, but, I guess it does kind of give it an eerie feeling. Check this out. Nicole Kidman and her two kids do great acting and great direction by Alejandro Amenabar! I promise I won't say Nicole Kidman again...",The Others
329,David_Niemann,Good or Great? Hmmm...,8,31 May 2003,"War World II has finished, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a huge foreboding mansion. Grace sadly, and perhaps naively, awaits the return of her husband, who went off to fight. Currently Grace has no home help, but she doesn't have to worry for too long. One day three people knock on the door and offer to be her servants. Grace not only needs help for the garden and cleaning but also for her children, who are photosensitive, which essentially means they are allergic to light. Keeping the children away from all light, except for dim candle-light, is a hard job, and this has taken it's toll on poor Grace. But soon Grace will have something else to worry about.A weird noise here, a bizarre occurrence there. Strange things are happening in the house. Is it ghosts? Is it Grace's imagination? Or is she going mad? And do the three servants have anything to do with this, or are they innocent bystanders?When the credits started rolling, I didn't know what to make of this film. I had enjoyed it for the most part, but near the end I started to wonder whether the film really was as smart as it thought it was. I had heard the film contained a nice twist, and when I watched what I thought was supposed to be the twist I was greatly disappointed. But I was wrong, and the film had a little bit more to go. I enjoyed the twist, but I don't think it's of jaw-dropping quality. Which is quite like the whole movie, very understated. If you only like big action movies, this isn't for you. I enjoyed the slow pace of the film, and the score is very nice, along with the cinematography. I enjoyed all the performances, with the children being stand-outs, and Nicole Kidman as good as ever. One complaint is that I would have liked more scenes with Lydia.In the first half of the film there were several scenes, that while not boring, I thought weren't as amazing as the movie seemed to make of them. However, upon finding out of the twist I feel these scenes would have a bigger impact on me. So I certainly will be going back for a second viewing.
I have seen the other film by writer/director Alejandro Amenabar, Abre los ojos, and enjoyed it greatly, and I look forward to seeing more films from him.Whether this is a good or great film doesn't really matter, have no doubt, this is a very fine film. I just didn't know how good it was. I couldn't decide whether to give it an 8 or 9. If I could, I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10. But I can't, so...8/10",The Others
330,cathcacr,"Supernatural Thriller, worth a watch",6,28 August 2001,"(Spoilers . . . ?)To liken this movie to _The Sixth Sense_ is almost to give too much of this away, but the similarities are all too obvious once you've seen it.  In other words, if you liked _The Sixth Sense_, you may like this one even better.The only question is: what are you overlooking the entire time that would give away the secret?  I was thinking that myself about halfway through, as I really KNEW something like that was coming, but what exactly that was, was pretty hard to tell.  For the most part it's a mystery with a seemingly incongruous plot line, and if you haven't guessed already (and you'd already guess about 20 minutes in), there is something about likely interactions between living and dead -- only this does _The Sixth Sense_ one better, in that it really doesn't give you much in the way of clues (until the end) about just what is the nature of the interaction.As the movie develops, though, there is quite a chilling sense about it, given the way that the mother and her two children living in the mansion (the characters and location around which the movie centers) live their lives.  A couple scenes are downright macabre, a term Nicole Kidman's character uses in just one of those very macabre scenes, without the need for the oft-used tactic of the instant scare to make you jump in your seat (though it's employed a couple times here).  The movie builds up the suspense quite well as it progresses.All in all, I came out of the theater pretty satisfied, though -- like _The Sixth Sense_ -- once you've seen it, you've seen it as many times as you need to in order to get the suspense.  One thing that counts against it for me is my aversion to heavy reliance on the supernatural in a film to make sense of the plot.  (I don't believe in anything supernatural myself, but even if I did, I doubt I'd appreciate its use as a significant plot device.) Unlike Kubrick's _The Shining_ (my favorite horror film, and perhaps not incidentally, one that places little to no explicit reliance on any supernatural elements), it leaves little room for mystery/ambiguity/wonderment at the end, and becomes all too similar to the standard ""ghost story.""In any event, being that this is quite good overall (it might even get Oscar consideration, just as _The Sixth Sense_ did), but not profoundly great, I give this one a 7 out of 10.",The Others
331,mejaflora,Fantastic after shock,10,25 November 2001,I loved this movie! Nicole Kidman's acting here has an almost equal calibre to Michelle Pfeifer's portrayal in What Lies Beneath.

332,DaveZ,deadly pace,6,18 September 2002,"The key to a good ghost story is in the telling.  The pace has to be just right  not so leisurely that the audience loses interest, but not so fast that the intriguing details are lost.  There is a good, spooky story in this film, but the film takes too long to get to the resolution.   The performances are very good (Kidman is plausibly mad), and there are some legitimate shocks; there is zero reliance on bloody special effects. Unfortunately, by the time all is revealed, I was just bored.   This would have made an engrossing 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.",The Others

There are SOME similarities to ""Sixth Sense,"" but to compare the two films or judge this against the other is not fair.  ""Sixth Sense"" was a classic, but ""The Others"" stands by itself as a great work.  Alejandro Amenábar is an enviously talented guy.  Besides the brilliant script and direction, he wrote a score that darn well should be at least nominated come oscar time.Also, you may hear about how ""slow"" this movie is.  I completely disagree. First of all, it's not an action movie.  But, if it developed any faster than it does, it would be silly.  I can also say that I felt tense at least 90% of the time, all the way up to the finale.  In fact at 114 minutes, I almost wanted a bit more, ALMOST.  The great direction, close-ups, acting, low-lighting, and creepy cinematography allow you to feel the fear as the characters do.

And not only! We're talking about a movie which twists to such an unbelievable extend the idea of what this kind of stories in art and literature represent, that makes you wonder if it could ever be possible in the future to have another example in this field that would add anything to what seems to have reached its absolute perfection. In ""the others"" we don't just have a story with threatening ghosts. We have an amazingly inspired twist, which through a breathless series of doubts and huge wonders, questions, and events which do not at all deviate from the scheduled flow of a very solid script, lead you finally to such a bitter, dark and – consequently yet surprisingly- extremely unexpected ending, that leaves you – and every other spectator- speechless on your sit. Yes, unexpected, because, though in a very artistic way indeed, the movie makes believe that it doesn't want to hide the truth, it gradually leads to it's perfect doubt, till it finally comes to its shocking, twisting revelation. There's no question that we're talking about one of the very best movies of all times! It's certainly the best for the ones who have a strong preference for thrillers. The double ""version"" of the scenes near the ""revelation"" and the ending, are really shocking and are exactly the ones which literally make any ghost story you have seen (or read) in the past, look and sound banal and trivial",The Others

The film is lifted onto another level, largely due to a superb performance by Nicole Kidman, ably supported by an excellent cast.Like 'The Sixth Sense', the film is deliberately slow, ponderous and very atmospheric with finely judged 'scary' moments. The twist at the end is totally unforseen and very effective, though as with the Sixth sense, it doesnt really stand up to close scrutiny.

In fact, I fell in love with it. This movie is chilling, very spooky, with a few moments that will make you jump, but it's a movie that works itself up, and by the end of the movie you feel scared, and like someone has zapped you a few times, chilly from inside out, but fulfilled.People have been comparing this to ""Sixth Sense"". Though the movie may share similarities, this stands on it's own. It's content is not trying to send a message, except for a universal theme that you want to grasp onto. There is historical and religious content, purely in context for the twists and turns and nuances to make this film so complete in every aspect. Everything works so well. This movie takes pride in each scene, and each is set up so that you get the most of it. Everything relates to everything, you are given clues the entire movie, but it's set up so masterfully the ending is the suprise you've been waiting for.The performance by Kidman and the two children are one of a kind. It's a realistic interaction between siblings and a controlling, dysfunctional, but loving mother. The acting and writing (the script) is so well done, it adds for scattered scenes that will, hopefully, stick around with you for a long time. There's this one beautiful scene in the movie, it's where Grace (Nicole Kidman) is hugging her son, and her daughter (who is slightly estranged from her mom) runs up and hugs her, and there this look of absolute release on the face of Grace. Another great scene is when Grace carries her rifle around the house (shoot the ghost!), and she's desperately trying to protect her house and children.  There are more like that, so keep your eyes open.The cinematography is innovative and brilliant, camera angles and the lighting set everything up so well.

It was so good because it kept you guessing on what was going to happen next and at the end everything you thought was true turned out not to be.  This is one of the best movies I think Nicole Kidman has done too.  I think that she should have won the Golden Globe for this instead of Moulin Rouge.  I hope that hollywood takes a hint from movies like The Others and The Sixth Sense and starts making more psychological thillers.,The Others
342,alishahmohd,A very good horror film with a spectacular conclusion,9,23 August 2014,"When I first heard of The Others, I honestly was that not interested in watching it, it's premise seemed like a generic horror flick and the plot about a mother living with her photosensitive children alone in a large house or mansion sounded as generic as it gets. How many horror movies we have seen with families living in an abandoned Haunted mansion? The Others didn't seem that different even if the children were suffering from a rare illness or disease, it became hard for me to distinguish the Others from your average generic horror flick. All that was until I actually watched this great film was absolutely mesmerized with it.The film starts out slow, as you are introduced to the characters and the new servants are hired to work in the house and you are introduced to the children and find out about the rare disease they suffer from. As the plot unfolds and the film moves on, events start to unfold, some weird incidents and noises start to occur in the house making the mother, the children and the servants realize that they are not alone in the house, making them believe it is haunted. The plot keeps on unfolding when the unforeseen twist occurs in the end, which I honestly did not see coming at all. It was shocking and was so well handled and executed that it is in my opinion one of the best scenes in horror films even though the scene in retrospect is not that scary but it is the shock factor that makes that scene so great to watch.Performance wise, Nicole plays Grace, the mother of the two children perfectly, she is strict towards her children and tries to discipline them, but is also well protective of them and loves them deeply, she is also depressed about being cut off from the rest of the world due to her children's condition. Bertha Mills who plays the nanny does a fantastic job in her role as a kind old lady but there is something that always remains mysterious about her especially in the later part of the film where she behaves oddly and it seems like that she is up to something with the other servants.The boy who plays Nicolas was actually good in his role, a kid who is scared, and is a sort of a momma's boy who is deeply attached to his mother, and he is scared about the recent haunting in the house. That brings me to Alakina Mann the girl who play's Ann. She received nominations for her performance in this film and it is very well deserved. It is a one of best performances a child artist has done in a horror film, she can be funny, she can be mysterious and creepy, and can also play a serious role. All of which she does in this film. Ann's character was extremely deep and the actress who played her did her job as perfectly as she can. The rest of the cast also performs well and serve well in their roles.Overall, before the watched the Others, I was thinking about watching just another horror film but I was so wrong, this is a fantastic film, with several scary parts and creepy scenes, a slow but well developed plot and a spectacular twist which will leave you in awe and leave you talking about it for days, and make you watch the entire film entirely from a different perspective.Overall Rating: 9/10.",The Others
343,erose001,A Haunting Allegory,8,23 July 2002,"We are fascinated by haunted houses on so many levels:  For their paranormal factor, for their ""scary"" factor, and for the psychological symbolism with which they are filled, considering the house as the symbol of the individual persona, with its inhabitants representing the various parts of the psyche. (In Freudian terms, that would include the Id, the Ego, the Superego, etc. In Jungian terms, it would include the various ""masks"" we wear to accomplish our various conscious tasks, as well as our unconscious.  In more generic terms, it would include the parts of our personas that are controlling, childlike, stewards, truthtellers, etc.)  All of these levels are explored well in this film, which makes the film a very satisfying psychological thriller until the twist at the end.  At that point, the allegory is stretched for the sake of a dramatic surprise, which for many veteran filmgoers was probably not all that surprising.  I grant that it did provide a tidier, ""Hollywood"" ending to the film, but in allegorical terms, actually made the story sadder and creepier than it already was.For those comparing the story to *The Turn of the Screw* (or the film, ""The Innocents""), the comparison to the psychological allegory is apt, although updated well from Henry James' Victorian sensibilities, which makes this a worthwhile film in and of itself.  Actually any comparison to a well-done haunted-house story is bound to bear fruit, as all have the same basic psychological elements.  (For example, Kubrick's version of *The Shining* can be compared also, although the gore factor was much higher in *The Shining*.)As for the comparison to *The Sixth Sense*, I see none, beyond the ability of children to see apparitions, and a twist at the end.  And there are many movies that include these features, few done in such a particularly interesting and surprising way as done in *The Sixth Sense*.  It stands on its own, it's an orange; this is an apple.  I think some make the comparison because the films came out within a couple of years of each other, and had similar marketing campaigns.  Had they come out 25 years apart, no one would think to compare them, beyond the fact that both are excellent paranormal/suspense films.As for filmmaking, other commenters have made the salient points well, I needn't repeat what has already been said about the excellent acting, lighting, cinematography, editing, and, of course, directing.  For pure suspense, I recommend the fog scene.  I'll say no more as I don't want to include spoilers.For those who want a mindless horror-suspense movie, look elsewhere, this ain't it.  But if you enjoy a little brain candy with your entertainment, overall, this is an excellent suspense film.  Just be prepared for the Hollywood ending.",The Others
344,Dr. Nick*#3,Very good movie,9,20 June 2002,"I'd dubbed this a quiet classic when I saw it last summer but the second viewing definitely pales next to the first, if only slightly.Nicole Kidman's performance is Oscar-worthy, the atmosphere and intrigue is established perfectly, the supporting cast is wonderful, but the story doesn't quite stand up to too much scrutiny. The emotional development of the story is deliberate and thoughtful while the supernatural logistics of the story seem kind of arbitrary, and that kind of undercuts the final punch of the plot - the suspense is strong but the explanations are invariably weak. Themes of penance and spiritual absolutism introduced at the start don't quite make it to the finish line, at least not explicitly enough. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend but the weaknesses made themselves known the second time around.",The Others
345,Twillhead,Intelligently Gothic,8,19 August 2001,"Those who see ""The Others"" with the intent to be scared witless by figures leaping suddenly out of dark corners or by axe-wielding maniacs are in for a big disappointment. This film is much smarter than that. It is quietly moody--the anxiety level is almost subliminal, and for that reason all the more compelling. Nicole Kidman, looking eeriely like a reincarnated Grace Kelly, carries the film as the increasingly distraught mother of two precocious but mysteriously odd children, flanked by three kindly but equally unusual servants. The film opens with Kidman awakening early one morning with a blood-curdling scream--a primal scream that seems just barely sustained at the base of her throat for the rest of the film. She is at once icy and nurturing, in a bravura yet understated performance that I can only compare to (and I am honestly sorry to do this) Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense"". Kidman proves, if nothing else, that she is an accomplished actor who is in complete control of her craft. The children are also excellent--the film wouldn't work if they were not. Nevermind if you guess the outcome of the film in advance, as did I--the ending is still fully satisfying and chillingly thought-provoking. Beautifully photographed.",The Others

347,Jon Kolenchak,Deja Boo,5,17 September 2001,"As the lights dimmed in the theatre, I was prepared for Gothic mystery, the supernatural, and some good story telling.  To my surprise, I discovered that I was not seeing one film, but a combination of three that came to mind almost immediately.  Take ""The Innocents"" (1961) mix with ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) and add a drop of ""The Night Has Eyes"" (1942), and you have ""The Others"". Much of this film is derivative -- the religion-obsessed maternal figure, the sheltered young brother and sister, and the oh-so-accommodating hired help all set in a nice spooky old house perpetually surrounded by an eternal fog. There are a few plot threads left dangling, to say the least.  Discussing those would involve getting into some spoilers, which I never do in films of this type.  But then again, you'll probably figure the story out long before the characters on the screen do.",The Others
348,zerodegreesk,Scary...,10,18 May 2002,"I've read many of the comments on this movie and while they don't ""spoil"" the story completely, they do make too many references to other movies, one in particular, which could make the impact of this story less effective.  I think The Others is unique.  When you consider how predictable storylines are today, after seeing this one you'd have to give it some credit.  I give it a lot of credit.  And, this is on the story alone.  The movie is beautiful.  The use of lighting is fantastic.  Pay attention to the scenes in the dark, especially when Kidman is carrying a candle while searching for the others.  The candle could not possibly create the lighting you see.  To me it's like a painter on a canvas with the light, but it's transparent and skillful, so you hardly notice it.  It's difficult for me to explain.  It's unapologetic and true to life, the story and the occurrences, which I find rare in film today, especially in the States.  There are no judgements on what happens or what happened in the storyline.  The ideas of morality and good and bad seem to be dead and buried once the movie ends.  This makes the story even more chilling.  There are no clear-cut endings or explanations. This is why I find it so good.  It seems the majority of the viewing public want popular justice and easily understandable and predictable endings and plots.  The references to this movie being like another movie, I think, are true because the stories are of a similar topic, but more importantly because they're both powerfully independent and true to themselves.  You know when you see these films because they affect you profoundly and are difficult to shake off.  You find yourself thinking about them for days and watching multiple times.  Horror/Suspense is my favorite genre and I'd easily say I've seen every popular horror movie and many, many of the rarer sort in the genre.  This one is great.  10 out of 10.",The Others
349,stevenleadbetter,Where did I put my keys?,6,7 November 2001,"Kidman has been busy. The second film from this versatile actor in as many nights. While I fawned over last nights offering 'Moulin Rouge', I have to say that this left me feeling a little cheated. 'The Sixth Sense' had reminded us to think about a film while it's showing rather than after it has finished, or you may miss something important. This comes too soon after that wonderful film. The outcome too obvious and one too many ends not tied up evenly enough for my liking. Excellent performances from most though the children (bless them) were not up to anything like scratch, especially after seeing the likes of Haley Joel Osment at work. Jersey - 1945. Two sickly children and their mother are holed up in a mansion,  never seeing the light of day due to a rare light sensitive condition. The husband had failed to return home from the war, though he does make a cursory appearance later on. It seems that they (and the servants) are not alone in the house. The eponymous 'Others' are visiting them. Much roaming about in the dark ensues and there is much made of locking doors and things that go bump in the night. Needless to say, in an effort to match the previously mentioned Shalaman picture, there is a surprise at the end. It may have stood in greater standing if it didn't if the truth be known. The audience is expecting a twist these days and these people should know this and not make the surprise so darned obvious. I worked it out early on and spent the rest of the picture waiting for it to be announced to everyone else. Nice locale, nice score, nice acting but shabby writing and the plot was thin to breaking in parts. A valiant effort, but an effort unrewarded.",The Others
350,res0owwh,The Others (2001) accurately depicts the existence of alternate existences.,9,21 November 2001,"WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Not unlike the Sixth Sense starring Bruce Willis, this movie illustrates the existence of alternate existences or parallel universes/worlds/dimensions colliding and infringing upon each other.Nicole Kidman's part is one in which she remained in denial of her own death (change in dimension), until proven otherwise by those in that dimension.To fully understand the concepts illustrated therein, it is usually necessary to understand quantum physicists who believe in alternate realities/universes/worlds/dimensions, etc., or to have actually experienced same.The movie is much appreciated for going out on a limb in that respect and is also considered ""fiction with a purpose"" since it teaches truths to those who are ready and/or willing to accept truths.  Otherwise, it's just another scary movie containing a lot of darkness and fear.Aside from quantum physicists' theories in re parallel universes, etc., there are some spiritual references to alternate realities, as well.  One being from the teacher Jesus, his statement, ""In my Father's house there are many mansions"".",The Others

She was left behind to live in a rather huge chateau while her husband went off to war. However, after the war is over, Grace doubts that her husband will ever return. In the meanwhile, she takes care of her two light-sensitive children with the help of a few servants. But, strange events begin to occur in Grace's home. In a matter of time, Grace begins to fear that there are other spirits or ghosts haunting her home.To reveal too many details of the plot would ruin the magic that 'The Others' works on you at the end. It's a twist ending that grabs you and makes you see the entire film in a different way. The same way that 'The Sixth Sense' did. But comparing to 'The Others' to Shyamalan's 'Sixth Sense' could translate into disappointment. The trouble spot is in the pacing of the film. Like in Shyamalan's film, 'The Others' creates its suspension through the tension felt by its characters. However, Shyamalan was a mastermind when it came to keeping its audience riveted. In 'The Others', there are numerous scenes that go on way too long for their own good. Thus, at times the film feels unwatchable. No matter, despite its flaws, 'The Others' works a spell on you.Rating: 7/10 or (3 stars)",The Others

353,seandchoi,A classic ghost story,9,15 August 2001,"""The Others"" is a surprisingly effective supernatural thriller / ghost story from the Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar (""Open Your Eyes""). It is a type of film where the less you know (about its plot), the more you will enjoy it--so, I will refrain from commenting on the actual plot of ""The Others."" However, I must remark that it is refreshing to see a horror film that taps into, and makes effective use of, the fears that are naturally ""hardwired"" into all of us (e.g. the dark, creeking doors, unidentified noises), instead of trying to induce artificialshock and terror into us (the usual method is: something suddenly jumps into frame, accompanied by a loud ""boom!"" on the soundtrack). ""The Others"" manages to generate an enormousamount of claustrophobic eeriness and suspense (most of the story takes place inside a house which has its windows covered with curtains) which are occasionally punctured by real moments of surprise. Nicole Kidman is present virtually in every scene and her natural and believable performance is a large part of what makes ""The Others"" so absorbing. This film should appeal to thoughtful horror fans who prefer suspense and mood over gore and blood. It is the best example of its genre since 1999's hit, ""The Sixth Sense.""",The Others

356,Theothervip,"Effectively bone-chilling, but there's more to it than that.",9,12 March 2011,"Rating: **** out of 4.Sadly, there are fewer and fewer movies horror stories like THE OTHERS being made nowadays. Ask even some horror movie fans and they might pick SAW or Friday THE 13TH over THE INNOCENTS or DON'T LOOK NOW any day, and to an even lesser extent, some of the horror fans of my generation prefer the PG-13 junk to any of those classic 70's horror thrillers. Well, it's a good think that once in a while, great horror movies like THE OTHERS come out and bring us back to horror movie heaven where we truly belong.THE OTHERS is one of the better horror movies to have come out in years. I can't believe I have only seen it recently! Consider this one of the movies in my ""Should have seen it earlier"" list. Director Alejandro Amenabar takes us on a psychological horror mind trip rather than the latest disposable PG-13-level release. It's scary but not in ways you expect. There are an occasional number of ""boo"" moments, but Amenabar handles them better than most; taking full advantage of our expectations and than catching us when we least expect. The whole theme of the story too is far more mature than most films of the genre. Perhaps it ain't as thought-provoking as, say, THE INNOCENTS (a film THE OTHERS takes a few notes from), but it's brilliant in its own clever, mind-blowing way.Having only recently landing a role in MOULIN ROUGE as a playful, sumptuous Can-Can dancer, Nicole Kidman takes an opposite turn playing a dark, fragile character as Grace, a woman who lives alone with her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), in an old dark mansion while her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) is away at war. Grace hires a trio of helpers - housekeeper Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a mute named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and gardener Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) - to attend to the house. Then strange occurrences start happening, prompting Grace to believe that the house is haunted by ""intruders"". Anne starts seeing a boy she calls ""Victor"", as well as an old woman she believes is a witch. Plus something may or may not be all right with the new help.THE OTHERS returns to the classic horrific atmosphere of those old-school horror movies - the candelabra-lit walks through dark hallways, doors being slammed shut by other things than the wind, and specters that look even creepier without the use of gruesome make-up effects. Even without the use of a lot of ""jump-out-and-scare-you"" moments (though there are a couple here), Amenabar keeps us interested because, unlike recent throwaway fare, he has an excellent story and an interesting array of tragic, unstable characters, and an atmosphere than effectively (literally) keep us in the dark throughout the movie.Amenabar has not made an outright horror outing since (he did make TESIS prior to THE OTHERS, but nothing else after), which is sad. The genre needs more like him these days, one that can perfect the balance of good writing, performances, atmosphere, and scares and delivering a ideal entry in the much under-utilized genre.",The Others
357,KMR,the ghost story is back,7,8 January 2002,"Warning, spoilers ahead--please don't read unless you've seen the film!Predictably, a lot of know-nothings are complaining about the twist at the end of The Others, claiming that it ""rips off"" The Sixth Sense. Well, guess what, the-protagonist-who-is-already-dead surprise was *hardly* introduced by The Sixth Sense; this plot device has been around since at least the old days of The Twilight Zone television series of the 50's, and as recently as in an 80's movie called Siesta, which was directed by Mary Lambert and starred Ellen Barkin (oops, looks like I just gave away the ending to that--sorry!). Besides, I have to admit that the twist here (actually the DOUBLE twist) completely threw me, and I was one of those who managed to figure out The Sixth Sense's big surprise midway through the film. Anyway, surprise endings aside, there is much else to admire in this fine ghost story. Nicole Kidman gives a very good, sensitive performance, and she has an excellent supporting cast behind her, particularly the two children, who are entirely believable. The film is rich in atmosphere and uses all the trappings of the classic ghost story (the isolated house, mysterious strangers, darkened rooms, etc.) beautifully. If you like ghost stories (and like me, are happy to see them back at the box office thanks to the success of The Sixth Sense) then hie thee to this fine film.",The Others
358,baseballfanjm,A Brilliant Movie,10,13 September 2001,"""The Others"" is all around a superb film that I loved. I've seen many complaints that the movie's plot is too slow. However, the way the movie is made you simply can't rush it along or it just wouldn't work. It isn't a slashing gorefest without much plot that needs to have nonstop action and violence but rather a subtle film that focuses on the fear of silence and what you can't see. The film never jumps out at you but rather maintains a frightening atmosphere throughout the entire movie. The acting in ""The Others"" is excellent all around. Nicole Kidman truly shines in her role as a mother of two sick children who hasn't seen her husband since he went to war. She grabs your attention as soon as she appears on screen and never loosens her grasp. She deserves an Oscar nomination. Heck, I'd even say she deserves the Oscar. The supporting cast is also wonderful, especially the children who are very realistic as a brother and sister.  Everything else about ""The Others"" is excellent as well. The cinematography, score, screenplay, and direction all range from very good to Oscar worthy. So all in all, don't listen to the film's detractors and see ""The Others"" for yourself. And if you are among those who say it is to slow, watch it again try to see why it can't be rushed. I give it 10/10",The Others

360,deputydoofus,A Shockingly Good Time...A Movie Lover's Tribute to Ghost Stories.,10,16 September 2001,"I have seen this film three times with a total of 9 different friends.  Out of the 10 of us, only one person didn't get completely frightened out of his wits, but every other person I saw it with couldn't stop talking about the film after we saw it.  We couldn't stop thinking about the film after it was over.""The Others"" is a difficult film to describe but not give away.  For this reason, READ AS LITTLE OF ANY REVIEW AS POSSIBLE.  I will attempt to keep this review concise and spoiler free.Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a mother who has been left alone with her two children after a mysterious event that forced her house maintenance workers and daycare helpers away from the house.  Alakina Mann and James Bentley play Nicole Kidman's children Anne and Nicholas.  The brother and sister are apparently unable to leave the house due to a mysterious skin condition. This is all of the plot that is fair to give away before seeing the film.The film is obviously a labor of love for director/writer/composer Alejandro Amenabar, and never have I remembered seeing a film that the screenwriter had such malicious fun writing.  There is a great amount of mischievous glee in seeing Grace reveal the rules of the house, the other characters revealing what they know about the house's secret, and in Amenabar slowly turning the screws of terror with his masterful compositions of visual cues and sound effects.  The first time seeing the film is one of the most terrifying film experiences I've had in my life.  There is just so much here to get worked up over.  Even as Amenabar turns up his orchestral hits, its evident he's not doing it just to get a scare out of the audience.  Each scene has one character in the middle of the scares who is in absolute terror, and the music represents his/her fright at that moment.So, the film has about a dozen little scares, about 2 or 3 real big ones, and a general undying creepiness that lasts throughout the entire film. Happily, there are also a few laughs and loving moments thrown in so it isn't a completely dark experience.  There is also a strong intelligence and development of themes in the entire film, giving it a true importance, allowing for endless thought and discussion about the film.  The film asks difficult and meaningful questions about conditional/unconditional love, religion, and the nature of existence.  Of course, during the first viewing, none of this will go through your mind as you will be scared out of your wits.  Any question you are likely to have the first time will relate to ""What the @#%& is in that house?"", so the other themes will likely enter your mind after the film and during subsequent viewings.Also, the film's three lead performances rank as the best performances I've seen this year from any film.  Nicole Kidman is outstanding as Grace and I would rank this as the best performance so far this year, perhaps tied with Haley Joel Osment's performance in ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"".  Alakina Mann and James Bentley also give exquisite performances, and, after Osment's last performance, I would say they give the best English-speaking child performances I've ever seen.In summary, I would say that ""The Others"" ranks as one of the few films this year that could be deemed ""unmissable"".  It is a eerily beautiful film that releases its nuances slowly, during the course of its plot and also over subsequent viewings.  I've also never been as scared during a film as I was in ""The Others"", and every audience I have seen it with couldn't help but randomly scream and jump during every part of the film.  The more I analyze the film, the more I am in awe of its technical wizardry.  The film is so dense and complex that it is worth more thought and discussion than the typical horror film, or even the typical Hollywood drama.While I haven't mentioned it yet, I believe that Amenabar's motive for making this film was the same reason Baz Luhrmann made ""Moulin Rouge!"". This film was meant to be an ode to the ghost-story film, taking every piece possible from every well known ghost film and fashioning a very thoughtful puzzle of artwork out of the pieces.  The film is a movie lover's tribute to ghost stories.This is a truly wonderful film experience.  I give it **** (out of 4).",The Others
361,maxwellsham,Really cool Movie,9,13 November 2001,"This really surprised me. When I saw ads for it I thought what a load of tripe. Another Horror movie which makes you laugh like crazy. Seen enough of those thanks. This isn't really a horror movie though either its more of a suspense thriller. And it really did keep me in suspense the whole movie through. I do think however the experience would be greatly diminished if not seen on a big screen with great sound. As far as strong points go this had lots really I thought the story was good it really was interesting and held you just in the right place to knock you over at the ending also kept you guessing the whole way through. The Atmosphere was also very good with only simple directing and not many amazing camera shots. The acting surprised me the most because I have not liked Kidman at all up to this point. She just seems so weak and pathetic normally but in this she really holds up very well and plays a very convincing paranoid mother. Finally I think this movie deserves Brownie points just for this, I hate movies where the director and the writers all conspire against you to completely obscure a truth and send you're mind of in a million different wild goose chases to find out whodunnit or whats going on only to turn around at the end and 'surprise' you and contradict all the feeling of the rest of the film just so the director can be right you can be wrong and you can't say oh well I knew that was going to happen. However in this movie there is a big twist in the end and it does sort of bend from the feeling of the rest of the movie but with a subtle twist which is very clever and innovative if not inventive. You'll have to see the movie to see what I mean though. By the way the movie is not fast but I really like slow paced movies.

First of all, The Sixth Sense was NOT the first movie to use surprise endings (see Se7en, Carnival of Souls, any Hitchcock movie). Yes, there are some similarities but overall, this a far superior movie. Nicole Kidman plays her greatest role yet as a single mother guarding her two children. Should you feel sorry for her at the ending? No, but this is a movie- should you feel sorry for Norman Bates in Psycho- no, but it still doesn't make it any less of a great movie. Having said all that, I must say that the subtle use of sounds and noises are frightening. Even having watched the film numerous times, there are still parts in this where I am startled.

It is incredible that someone would even try to make this and open themselves up to such criticism.  ""The Sixth Sense"" also explained the ""doctrine"" behind the parallel spirit world while ""The Others"" fails to explain the ""why"" at all.  For instance, we know why the main character in ""The Sixth Sense"" could not tell he was the dead person, because ""dead people only see what they want to see.""  There is no such explanations for anything in ""The Others"" -- and then to top it all off the movie attempts to create sympathy for a paranoid schizophrenic child murderer.  Huh?!

And unlike ""Moulin Rouge"" Kidman's other triumph of the season, it will translate well to the small screen.There is one moment toward the end of the movie where a frightful person appears.  Several people in the audience screamed when it happened--they were quite shocked and had been drawn into its emotionally claustrophobic atmosphereThe absence of violence, gore and murder is welcome in this genre.

It wasn't great, and falls far short of the Sixth Sense, to which it is often compared, but it was still a good movie.  The scene is England, 1945, and revolves around a woman (Kidman) who has lost her husband to the war and is isolated in this mansion with her two children afflicted with a condition which makes them vulnerable to light.  The children must spend their lives in candlelight.The movie has a few surprises, and there will be no spoilers here. I will just comment that the movie moves rather slowly for the first two-thirds or so, but does pick up at the end and did provide me with some jumps.  You are rewarded in the end for allowing the movie some character and plot development.The acting is excellent, and I was impressed by the two children's performances.  Kidman was fine, as was whoever played the old lady servant (OK, I'm too lazy to look it up now).  The movie was more spooky than scary for the most part.  The scary parts are due more to timing and development than gratuitous violence (there is none of that here).  My warning is that the movie is not for those with short attention spans, or for those who need a shock every two minutes to keep their attention.  This movie unfolds like a good book, introducing the characters and slowly giving you the stories behind the people and withholding most of the action until the end when you better understand who the events are happening to.

It is a drama-thriller, that's classy and well acted, with a great plot. And while it is along the same vein as other movies like The Sixth Sense at parts, it's original, not the same idea with both movies. Nicole Kidman never does cease to amaze me, and wow did she give a great one in this movie as Grace, the mother of two children living in a mansion in 1940's England. And the children happen to be allergic to light. The plot is also such a good one, one that I can't give too many details about, if you haven't seen it already see it when it comes to video. The movie as a whole as gave me the great feeling of an almost throw-back to older, classic, almost Hitchcock-ian thrillers.

369,sinomatictool,No Repeat Value,6,17 December 2002,After the first time the film is boring with it's futile telling solely leading up to some inadequate finale.

I decided to tape it, after all the great reviews it got from IMDb users. I'm very glad that I did...This little gem starts off with a Christian family living on an isolated island at the end of World War 2. The family have recently got some new servants, after the last set of servants 'disappeared' (the reason for this is explained at the end with an unforgettable twist). It is very clear that the mother isn't entirely stable, and when her daughter says she has seen a boy, and then an entire family who want to take over the whole house, she begins to get extremely paranoid, leading up to a great climax! This has everything: drama, suspense, horror, and it just oozes atmosphere, especially in the few final scenes, on a dark, misty night, when the truth behind the terrifying mystery is finally revealed!

371,jetan,Magnificent,10,27 October 2001,"Near-perfect ghost story. Comparisons to Turn Of The Screw and The Haunting, as well as to The Sixth Sense, are apt. In my opinion The Others is actually superior to the latter.     The performances by the various actors have been widely acclaimed, and justly so. Kidman, who seems literally luminous here, is actually upstaged at times by the performances of the children.     It would be hard to praise the direction and editing too highly. The climactic scene contains a POV cut that feels and acts like a dissolve (you'll know it when you see it), but that is to pick only one example from an overall virtuoso effort.     Though this is not a film that will appeal to all fans of Sam Raimi or Wes Craven,it will move quite fast enough for those who enjoy subtler, less effects-laden spookers.",The Others

She did it at Batman Forever, To Die For, The Portrait of a Lady and, of course, Eyes Wide Shut, between others solids works.I didn't watch Arthur Schnitzler' play The Blue Room (La ronde) but people who did, said she deserved to win the Golden Globe to Best Actress. She made representations to Londoners and New Yorkers till exhaustion -she got a laryngitis- of five different roles.Being making Los otros in a wet location at Palacio de los Hornillos, Spain, she felt the effects of a injury in a knee after the efforts in a Can-Can dancing-girl part at Moulin Rouge previously interpreted.

The movie, up until the end, was good.  However, there's something about a rip off ending that really wrecks a movie for me.  True, this is a re-make from an older movie, but come on - wait ten years before releasing something identical to one of the biggest movies in history.  The only redeeming factor is that Nicole Kidman plays one screwed up mofo, once you realize what she did.

Kidman and the cast demonstrate that it doesn't take gore and chainsaws to create a true horror movie.  This film is intelligent and skillfully filmed.  Every nuance; every scene is perfectly crafted to recreate a mystery.  There is no red herring, yet the complex story keeps you guessing.  I'll have to see the movie again to appreciate how much the storyteller does give away and how obvious the mystery's solution seems in retrospect.

380,mmintz,"Another movie completely reliant on ""twist"" for validation",7,2 September 2001,"SPOILER ALERT!Okay,  I kinda liked it.  True, it was slow but it was interesting.  Note, however, while interesting, it was not even remotely scary...at all.  And believe me, I did what I could to talk myself into being scared but to no avail.  I did, however, jump once when a door slammed.  GEE!  Had to admire the restraint that characterized the movie (in comparison with many of the other contemporary horror/thrillers) but might've hoped for a little more of ""the good stuff.""Kinda liked the theme that life is a little more complex than we think and will continue to defy our little systems of thought with which we try to pin it down.  I also liked the fact that the message was given gently.  Grace's religion and parental stringency were shown sympathetically.  Nevertheless, while useful and helpful we saw that they were inadequate to explain EVERYTHING.  Once again, this movie (like many others) was completely reliant on its ""twist ending"" to validate it.  I really don't like that.  A good twist should deepen things and give you that little ""more than you bargained for"" bonus.  When it becomes the only point of the film, it ceases to function as it was intended.  This is especially so with ""The Others"".  The two twists: a) Omigosh, the cleaning crew are really ghosts! and b) Omigosh, the family is really ghosts! were pretty lame.  Perhaps had they beaten ""Sixth Sense"" to the screen they might've worked but THEY DIDN'T.  The only reason I hadn't already figured it all out as I watched was because I thought, ""No, they wouldn't be that dumb.""  They were though.Okay, finally, in order to end positively, I'll say this:  The post-mortem photos were great.  Having already read about these in Clive Barker's A-Zs of Horror I thought their film treatment was appropriately eerie.  As Grace said, ""How macabre.""So, in summation, I'm glad I saw it but I will probably never watch it again.",The Others
381,TigerlilyBramble_of_WillowBottom,"""The others said they wouldn't. But they did.""",9,15 June 2002,"Imagine: Someone makes a scary thriller...and it actually has a BRAIN! Well, maybe I'm exaggerating, because some other thrillers do. Take ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Vanilla Sky"" for instance. They had plots, and made you think. But take, say, ""House on Haunted Hill"" (the remake)? Blood. Sex. Gore. Bad special effects. Scares? A real plot? Any reason for making the movie whatsoever besides cheap thrills and money? I think not. ""The Others"" isn't gross at all. The character development is good, and the musical score and sound is outstanding. And Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances to date.Kidman is Grace, a prim, religious 1940's mother with two photosensitive children, Anne and Nicholas. Every day, instead of school, the children study the Bible by candlelight. (By the way, the setting for the story is great, too. Almost the entire film is shot inside the beautiful but very dark house.) At the beginning, three mysterious servants come to work at the house--even though the advertisement Grace meant to send out never got mailed. This is because, they say, the servants worked in the house before.Soon, Anne begins mentioning Victor, a boy that assumingly keeps talking to her. While at first it looks like a good plan to scare Nicholas, eventually Grace hears noises in the abandoned room upstairs. The old forbidden piano starts playing after the children and servants are asleep, and even though a door isn't supposed to be opened without the previous one being closed first, Grace keeps seeing the door behind her in the corner of her eye open.
This might not sound interesting or scary, but you have to see it. The setup for each sudden, frightening moment is about three-quarters of what really scares you, and that's true for most other movies, too. I probably shouldn't go on with the plot, because this is one of the only movies where just one little spoiler ruins the entire movie.""The Others"" is also probably the only movie that scares you out of your wits every time, not just the first time, and at the same time doesn't give you nightmares for weeks. Probably because none of the scary images are really enough to stick in your head.The children, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, are excellent young actors, especially James Bentley. He deserves the Young Artist Award he received for this picture, no question about it, and Alakina Mann deserves her nomination.I hate to break it to you fans of gory thrillers, but blood and guts just aren't scary. Sure, they're gross, but they're more hokey than frightening, and it looks as if the filmmakers haven't got anything better to lengthen the movie with, like actual content. Movies like ""The Others"" really deserve praise for using things important to the plot, or at least explaining them at the end. I recommend this to anyone who's in the mood for a good scare without the gore.",The Others
382,austex23,"Finally a good film in a summer of stale, stupid movies.",8,18 August 2001,"After most of this summer's films, I left the theater feeling like I had contributed money toward the intellectual decline of America.  The Others was a refreshing change in this sad trend.  Comparisons to the Sixth Sense will inevitably be made by folks who have had their sensibilities atrophied by too many lame thrillers, but -- except for the most obvious and shallow of plot points -- there really is no basis for comparison between The Others and The Sixth Sense.  Both are fine films with entirely different agendas. The Others joins a very small list of authentic film ghost stories, descendants of the rarefied and poetic fiction of the late Victorian era. Wiser comparisons would be to the original version of the Haunting, The Changeling, or the obscure 1989 TV film The Woman in Black -- films about the places, dramatic and metaphoric, our world touches the world beyond death, but also about the philosophical implications of such contact.  The Others will be too slow for viewers more accustomed to recent fare like the remakes of the Haunting and House on Haunted Hill, but for people who like their chills a bit more subtle, it is a rare and very fine treat.  With superior performances, atmospheric sets, and an allegorical content that will be lost on many viewers, The Others may be the best film I have seen this year.",The Others
383,AP-Project,Kidman's Best Work,9,18 October 2002,"I was very pleased by this movie.  The cinematography is wonderful and helps to make the house seem more claustrophobic.  The director captures an ethereal quality in the actors. The mysterious sounds and voices that disturb this family, led by Kidman, ultimately come from more than one source.  Their deepening confusion, and struggle to maintain sanity, is what propels the plot. Obviously, this is the type of movie that demands to be seen and not spoiled by too many revelations here. I think Kidman is cast perfectly in this role.  This is her best performance. In some respects, this is a story about seeking redemption. Can eternal love achieve forgiveness for a heinous sin?  There are some interesting questions posed herein by the director. This movie has a wonderful cast, excellent acting and terrific cinematography. It is not a superficial or facile movie, although it might appear to be at first.  The Others rewards a perceptive, attentive moviegoer with a great experience. Highly Recommended.",The Others

There is no special effects, cutting throats or huge monsters but it's very thrilling with camera works, set, music and sound effects.

385,princesss_buttercup3,Exceeded expectations.,8,19 June 2008,"First off, let me say that this film is not at all reminiscent of Hitchcock, contrary to the opinion of several previous reviewers. While Hitch did do psychodramas, this is really more of a ghost story. Like other reviewers have said, the movie is very stylized and suspenseful, and above all, entertaining. I don't disagree that it is slow, but in this film, that is a virtue. It allows the viewer to get a real feel for the individual characters and the family/household dynamic- all of which are critical to the climax. It is difficult to give a thorough critique without giving too much away, but I must say that I did NOT see ""it"" coming- and I always appreciate it when a film can turn my perspective upside down. This is mostly a visual movie and I have a feeling it won't come across as brilliantly on a small screen, so if you're reading this and considering seeing the film, I strongly recommend seeing it in the theater. The use of light and space and camera angles is excellent, and I also appreciated the minimal use of background music- sometimes in a thriller/horror film, the score can become distracting or overpower the dialogue- NOT a problem here. I wouldn't be surprised if this film is nominated for several of the more obscure Oscar categories (the ones I normally wouldn't even notice) like Sound Editing and Cinematography. There are a few minor inconsistencies and anacronisms, but as a whole package, this film delivers. I've seen a lot of comparisons to ""The Sixth Sense"", but please don't let those shape your expectations of this movie. This is a very different, and in many ways, superior movie, because it relies even less on gore and shock and more on suspense and psychological drama.",The Others

She has to manage the household stuff, take care of her kids and bear the unusual happenings taking place in the house.

It does come when we expect it to but only prove our predictions to be wrong. The husband pays a visit in the middle of the film but simply throws us into more confusions....

Her servants have inexplicably run off in the middle of the night, although the children think they were frightened away. Enter three new servants who ""just happen"" to be looking for work and the fun and the spooks begin. Alakina Mann is completely plausible as Kidman's daughter, who tries to convince her possibly psychotic mother that the house is haunted. Kidman's performance is absorbing and chilling, as Grace tries to figure out if the house is really haunted and if so, by whom. Are the children playing jokes? Are the new servants trying to scare Grace and the children away? Or, is she simply going mad (again)?

Never mind that Cruise and Kidman were going through a divorce at the time, Tom still helped with the funding, probably feeling like he owed Amenabar one for letting him recreate Abra Los Ojas into the lackluster Vanilla Sky. The stirrings are creepy without being over-the-top, and the twist ending is plausible which makes re-watch palatable... though there's not quite enough character in the characters to see anything more than plot polishings when it's all said and done, Kidman does a fine job of providing an aura to the mother that's all but mostly absent from the script. We're never sure what makes her as she is and the history behind the family is as foggy as the island they can't seem to get away from.

Grace (Nicole Kidman), a widow and single-mother, lives in a secluded home with her two children, Anne (Alakia Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). She is forced to live in darkness, for her children have a severe allergy that causes them to break out and blister when exposed to mass amounts of light. All is going well, but soon, Grace begins to learn the she, her children, and her servants are not alone in her house. Grace becomes determined to find out who the intruders are...and drive them out to regain her home.This movie was just beautiful. The story was sharp and original. It wasn't just some cliche`d haunted house movie with spooky sounds and bumps and creaks in dark rooms, with boring ghosts that you seen any old day. The story used the idea of the haunted house, and twisted the story to make ""The Others"" into an original, creative, and new telling of the famous tale. This practice of taking and creating is what made ""The Sixth Sense"" so remarkable, and therefore makes this movie great as well.The acting was just as great. Not only is this Nicole Kidman's year for her movies, but for her acting as well. She has managed to give Oscar-caliber performance in two movies for this year alone. She convincingly plays the strict but caring mother, who is torn between the logic of the beliefs she grew up on and the apparent happenings in her house. You almost forget that she is acting. Alakia Mann and James Bently also deliver key performances as well. In fact, there wasn't one cast member that let me down.""The Others"" was also cinematically beautiful. The dark tones on the movie set the perfect mood for this movie's theme, giving regular scenes the right amount of light and sinister scenes the deserved amount of darkness and horror. The camera angling and positions also wonderfully gave the ""oomph"" needed to make the scenes be seen in the proper mood.A well-crafted dramatic thriller, ""The Others"" is a must-see for thriller-lovers and movie-lovers alike.

403,AKRob3,Such a waste of time!,2,23 July 2020,"This movie was horrid. I kept waiting and waiting for it to get good. I thought that, maybe, it was like Shawshank, just kind of slow. But it was slow and had no cool ending. Don't waste your precious time.",The Others
404,axvngey,Masterpiece,10,8 November 2020,"Watched this movie in cinema when it was originally released. It's difficult to review it without giving any spoilers, but here I will try:A widowed mother with photo-sensitive kids live in a large mansion, which seems to be haunted.That concludes my spoiler-free summary.Nicole Kidman's acting is top class. But the real credit goes to the director, who also directed the original movie of this remake. The atmosphere of the movie is unsettling, with quite a few scares. But the movie builds up and rises to a new apex toward the finale.Probably among my top ten movies of all times. Definitely a masterpiece.",The Others
405,rossaw,An inflated Twilight Zone episode,7,1 March 2002,"From the start I was irritated by Nicole Kidman's performance as the lead character in this. When she doesn't have some definite emotion to convey, like anger or terror, e.g. in a plot set-up scene, she can't carry it off. Moreover, she has to shoulder a great deal of the movie by herself, and I felt her pain a bit -- it looks like hard work. It's not all bad however. The gimmick of the light sensitive children provides some embellishment and amusing filler. And it does have some creepy, spine tingling moments. The two children and the rest of the supporting cast give impressive performances. This as a haunted house/ghost story with only one arrow in its quiver. It's set in the 40's, and reminds one of the pulp magazines filled with such stuff around that time. It has that lurid, somewhat tasteless feel of a story scribbled out at 2 cents a word.",The Others
406,Cinemafou,Disappointing,4,12 January 2013,"I had hopes that this film would offer some creative thrills. Unfortunately, it started off badly. Nicole Kidman, although playing the role well, played the role of an annoying neurotic. Sorry, hard to have much sympathy with her character. And as it went on, things often did not make sense. Some plot elements contributed nothing to the story and seemed to be no more than distractions. I just did not like the way it played out, waiting for the tension to build but it never really did. And worst of all, when the surprise ending arrived, I felt cheated. Of course, I can't explain why without revealing the whole plot. Pity.",The Others
407,Mr-JAFO,Amenábar at his best.,9,18 November 2005,"This is really a great masterpiece where a Spanish director shows there can be quality out of the Dream Factory that Hollywood actually is (I don't only say that because we share nationality). This movie shows how really great movies should be, and it has a hard to confuse classic taste. The way things are treated, the lack of explicits, and especially the lack of blood and/or gore makes this movie become a real classic since the first theatrical release. It's obvious that Mr. Amenábar just drank from the best sources (especially Hitchcock). Since ""Poltergeist"" I didn't see less killings in a whole movie, and, however, it's still chilling. Take example of these, you new filmmakers.",The Others
408,SimianLogic,Well Crafted Ghost Story,9,10 August 2001,"There's not much that can be said about this film that won't give away the ""surprise"" ending.  I figured it out about fifteen minutes in, but this didn't detract in any way from the enjoyability of the rest.  If you figure things out, you gain a different perspective on how to watch the movie that makes it all the more enjoyable.  I enjoyed the music (and often the silence), which added to the creepy mood of the film.  The lighting was very strictly controlled, which also gave a feel of something otherworldly.  This isn't as fast-paced as most of what Hollywood considers horror films (things jumping out of closets and chasing you with knives), but this is no great loss.  True horror can only come when it's built up slowly and believably. The Others achieves this in several places.  If you liked the Sixth Sense, you will probably enjoy this film a lot.",The Others
409,mikerichards,The best horror movie in a generation,10,25 November 2001,"A big claim? Well yes and no. Firstly I should define what I DON'T mean by horror - men in rubber suits or teenagers with outsized cutlery. If these movies were ever scary it was in the early 1980s when 'Alien' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' defined those particular genres to such an extent that no one has ever matched their standard. What I consider horror is something much more subtle and far older - the fears that we all carry inside of us whether we admit it or not.The terror of death; the ache of loneliness; the fear of a believer that there might not be a God, the worry of the most convinced atheist that there may well be one; the committed rationalist who outwardly denies the unknowable; the constant temptation of evil - those have been the staples of horror from the dawn of time and they still have the power to influence us.
	Who hasn't lain awake in the small hours with their heart pounding?
	Has anyone not glanced behind them when walking down a lonely country road?
	Is there anyone who can honestly say that they haven't thought of doing something that they know to be wrong - just for the sake of it?Unfortunately these ideas have been out of fashion for a long time. No one has come close to the superb horror of Robert Wise's 'The Haunting' which made a terrifying movie out of banging on the walls and a shaky staircase. Perhaps it is only 'The Blair Witch Project' that has recently attempted a minimalist approach to horror, but that film could not hope to live up to its advance hype and consequently was something of a disappointment. Fortunately 'The Others' arrived in the UK with mercifully little hype and is something of an unknown quantity.'The Others' takes the staples of a traditional ghost story from the pen of M.R. James and most particularly from Henry James' 'The Turn of the Screw' and produces something that manages to be very familiar and at the same time wholly original. The opening is a wholly discordant voice from childhood radio 'Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin.' It is the end of 1945, the war in Europe has ground to a halt and a world where the living and the dead are intertwined is trying to recover from the devastation. A young family is trying to settle into a large old house, unsure if the soldier father is alive or dead. The opening shot follows Grace (Nichole Kidman) as she walks to answer the front door. There she finds three servants looking for positions in the rambling house. Apparently the previous household staff had got up and left the house without rhyme or reason, Grace escorts the three through the house, insisting with fragile urgency that they always remember to lock doors after them.She offers to introduce her children Anne and Nicholas to the new housekeeper, Mrs. Mills. This is the first of many deeply unsettling moments. The curtains *MUST* be draw and lamps lit. Grace disappears into the children's bedroom and wakes them; what monstrous things are going to emerge? The suspense is drawn out until breaking point and then Grace reappears with two angelic looking children. not for the last time the movie throws you off your balance. The children suffer from a form of acute photosensitivity preventing them ever experiencing daylight, hence the locked doors and shuttered windows. These are the simple props used to support everything that follows.
People and a place on the edge of reality begin to slip into another world entirely. Doors open and close of their own accord, the protective curtains are thrown open, furniture moves, a piano plays in the middle of the night and Anne claims to have seen other people in the house. Throughout, Grace tries to reconcile events with her own deeply-held Catholicism, a terrifying construct where Hell and Purgatory are very close at hand. It is this belief that comes under attack, gradually at first, but as the movie progresses, her world begins to crumble. With control always shifting towards the increasingly sinister Mrs. Mills.A slight tale to be sure, but then the best horror stories only provide a skeleton (real or metaphorical) for our own fears.The house is just as much a character as the human beings that live in within; it appears to be adrift from the rest of the World. There might well be a world beyond the massive wall but equally there might be nothing at all. With the curtains constantly drawn the house is filled with a perpetual twilight, but even those times when we are able to glimpse through the windows there is precious little to see with an unchanging grey fog shrouding the autumn countryside. The movie reeks of death; there is persistent question of whether father is alive or dead; the belongings of departed former occupants are covered by shroud-like dust sheets, antique photographs of unknown people (including a particularly macabre photograph album) look out from shelves, whilst the garden is covered with autumnal leaves. Mortality is a presence in the house, even the hope of an afterlife is coloured by Grace's firm belief in the fate awaiting sinners and the less penitent.Nicole Kidman is as pale, brittle and delicate as porcelain in the role of Grace. As her grasp on the control of the house slips with ever-increasing speed, her world begins to falter and it is entirely possible that Grace will shatter under the pressure. She believes in a loving God yet he appears to shun her when she needs him most, whilst the fight against evil appears to have robbed Grace of her husband. Outwardly she tries to maintain the restrained chill expected of an upper-class woman in the 1940s, yet inwardly this is a loving mother and distraught wife, desperate for some form of emotional support.The children are central to the film - there is none of the preternatural adulthood offered by Haley Joel Osment, these are very real children. Nicholas (James Bentley) is at the age where he is stilltrusting of everyone and tied firmly to his mother, a very real innocent. Anne (Alakina Bentley) is older, just at the stage where she is starting to show independence and at an age where children are capable of very real cruelty. Much of the narrative is driven by Anne's interactions with the remainder of the cast, and Bentley proves more than adequate for the task, sometimes frighteningly adult, at other times a helpless child.The servants are characters from the pages of Dickensian fiction, the slightest of the roles is Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) a disconcerting mute who clearly knows something about the house's past, but cannot, or will not let on. Eric Sykes plays Mr Tuttle the gardener and manages to cast off a long history of comedy roles to give a subtle, almost otherwordly performance. However it is Fionnula Flanaghan's Mrs Mills who provides the counterweight to Grace. She gradually unveils herself as the movie progresses, starting off as the sweet-smiling, efficient servant, but slowly transforming into the centre of power in the house; threatening, all-knowing and truly terrifying. Mrs. Mills is a worthy successor to Judith Anderson's legendary Mrs. Danvers from Daphne du Maurier's 'Rebecca'.Extraordinarily, this very British movie is directed by Spanard - Alejandro Amenabar who has redefined the genre with complete mastery much like Ang Lee's take on 'Sense and Sensibility'.'The Others' is an astonishingly beautifully made movie. Each scene is set and lit like an oil painting. Shadows and the darkness play just as important a role as the warm glow from oil lamps and the fires. Daylight where it is allowed to intrude is a frigid blue-white colour, bleaching life and colour from everything it touches. Sound plays an important part in telling the story, there are plenty of minor chords and shrieking strings to set your nerves on edge, but it is the quiet that is the most memorable. Entire scenes are played out in near silence serving to heighten the almost unbearable tension of the latter part of the movie.So is the movie scary? Undoubtedly yes, the pacing is perfect with enough false climaxes and unexpected shocks to keep even the most demanding horror fan happy. It takes its time to set up all of the pieces, but as the whole story is put into place, the screw is gradually being tightened. Situations becomes increasingly claustrophobic, Grace's nerve falters and Mrs. Mills appears to feed on her weakness - where is it leading?
Fortunately the end of the story is extremely satisfying and comes quite unexpectedly. In retrospect, or on a second viewing you will see all of the clues to the solution littered through the narrative, but none are so obvious that you will put the whole thing together until the director is ready for you. Oh and I didn't sit comfortably at all.",The Others
410,Nivera,This is how you make a horror movie,10,13 March 2021,"The Others is an example of a slow burn done right, developing the compelling characters while slowly and subtly revealing the twist in a chilling and shocking way. The story and atmosphere was amazing and the characters were written and acted fantastically. It was slow but kept me interested with its dark atmosphere and engaging mystery. This shows that you don't need jump scares or gore to make an extremely effective and memorable horror movie.",The Others
411,firedude440,"Slick, stylish, scary and sweet",9,30 August 2001,This will defanantly get your heart beating very fast near the end as you figure out an excellent ending almost better than the 'The Sixth Sense.' The ending might not be as good but the movie is way better. A lot more horror. Strong performances by every one in this movie. There is not one actor that did a poor job in this film. Even newcomers Alakina Mann and James Bentley as Nicole Kidman's kids Anne and Nicholas. This is defanantly one movie you shouldn't miss out on and you have to watch absolutely every single little thing because there are many things that I nearly missed and I had gone to the bathroom zero times. This will defanantly be one of your favourites as it is one of mine. 9/10,The Others
412,hasekamp,"Very Surprising, but too slow",7,14 August 2002,"This movie really has a very unexpected ending and, so, a very good plot. I didn't know what to expect of the ending while watching the movie, and I was greatly surprised by it indeed. Of course I cannot tell anything about the plot without spoiling your viewing pleasure! Anyway, for the plot only my mark would be close to 10/10.Sadly the story develops very slow. In fact I believe that the first hour or so could have been told in half the time. That could have created extra time to raise the suspense or to put us even more on the wrong leg. The last half hour gives us what lacks in the first hour, however. The plot moves fast towards the climax then. Acting (especially by Nicole Kidman) is great. Photography is beautiful and the plot -as said- is very good. Didn't the makers see the flaw in the movie or did they lack some more creativity to repair it? My mark: 7/10.",The Others
413,Cinesnatch,"Exquisitely tempered pace, wonderful casting, and a crowd-pleasing ending make this one of mainstream Hollywood's best film in years.",10,8 May 2003,"The concept is lovely: Supposedly deceased husband from the war leaves behind wife (played by Nicole Kidman) and two children.  The kids are photosensitive to light so the curtains throughout the mansion must remain closed at all times.  Wife hires a new staff of three and then strange things begin to happen.The story is so well-thought out to most every detail, which makes the ending so sound and shocking.  `The Sixth Sense' precedes it by two years and regenerated an entire film genre in the Hollywood spectrum.  Typically, that film would stand as the measure of the subsequent submissions, which would slowly degenerate into paler imitations until the phenomenon faded out.  However, I believe that not only has `The Others' one-upped the sense and raised the stakes, but will hold up much better over time.  Not only is the first viewing exciting, but the second viewing shows just how well done this film is.  The mansion that is the centerpiece for the film is masterfully shot from the attic to the kitchen, with Kidman opening, closing, and locking doors everywhere she goes all the time, as well as constantly drawing the drapes.There isn't really a weak link in this small troop of a cast.  Kidman delivers an especially anal, unreserved performance as an over-protective British mother who teeters on being borderline psychotic.  The kids are like Christina and Christopher Crawford: the overly headstrong sister and cute, lovable and innocent younger brother.  The maid's kindness, with her sidekicks the mute and the groundskeeper, turns deliciously ominous as we get closer to the secret they carry with them.""Open Your Eyes"" and ""The Others"" have been two of the best films I've seen in the last five years.  I am looking forward to Alejandro Amenabar's future endeavors.9: Highly recommendable, creepy, psychological ghost story.  Inspires repeat viewings.",The Others
414,prylands,A visual delight but mentally undemanding,6,13 January 2005,"This film has a lot to recommend it and yet I found it ultimately rather predictable and little more (in terms of plot) than a protracted tease.Having said that, it is beautifully shot - lots of shadow, fog and flickering lamps. The camera angles are intelligent and the screenplay is thoughtful and convincing.I rather feel that this film will appeal to those viewers who like ghost stories and do not expect any more than dramatic music and a sinister build-up to the denouement. It does not have the Gothic magic of Sleepy Hollow but the acting is impressive - especially from the two children Alakina Mann and James Bentley who were both fantastic. It was also wonderful to see Eric Sykes in his cameo role.Nicole Kidman does a good job with what she has to do but I feel she is too good an actress to spend ninety minutes looking wide-eyed and frightened.Worth seeing but not a truly great film.

By far, the 'little girl wedding dress' scene is absolutely the most chilling scene in the whole film.

Even saying it is a ghost story from the ghosts' point of view might warrant it. It begins with Grace (Kidman) waking up screaming from a nightmare - and the tone is set. With a patient, meticulous script both the mood of the story and the story itself are carefully and almost lovingly built up until the catch is sprung on you. Viewing it a second time - like Sixth Sense - it hangs together nicely. That's really all I can say except that I was impressed by Kidman's versatility here and also by the children's' performances. Alakina Mann was particularly unsettling at times as Anne, the mysterious, mistrustful daughter who first sees the 'Intruders'. A fine yarn and a fine film.",The Others

Although the set-up has some originality and there are some good performances, once you figure out the ending 'twist' (well before it's revealed, if you're smart), it becomes hard not to hate this movie for the 'been there, done that' feeling you get.I can't believe the film is so highly rated and getting such good reviews.

419,panduh,When was the last time you saw a scary horror movie rated PG-13?,8,28 March 2002,"Yes! This movie eschews all the special f/x, cheap scares, gore and viscera. None of the typical big budget Hollywood scare tactics in movies like Scream and the hideously bad remake of The Haunting.  The Others is a genuinely creepy, suspenseful movie that uses psychological cues to increase the terror.  PG-13.  Can you believe it?  This is actually a scary movie that an adolescent can watch.  But take my word for it, it will creep you out even if you are in your 40's.  The atmosphere is dark and unsettling, and the acting by Nicole Kidman, and the two child actors are convincing.To tell you the truth, after some reflection, nothing particularly ""terrifying"" or ""scary"" ever actually happens in this movie. It is the acting by the characters that really makes you frightened.  Their fear is palpable and it conveys itself to the audience.  You feel as if though you are there with Grace in that big empty house, hearing voices and footsteps, and seeing things in the corner of your eye.  You can actually sense the slow burn Nicole's character is going through as she creeps toward possible insanity.  Magnificient.  Kidman should have been nominated for Best Actress for this role as opposed to her role in ""Moulin Rouge"".I definitely recommend this movie for ghost-movie and scary story fans!",The Others
420,LoveCoates,Easily the Best Film of 2001.,10,25 May 2002,"Lord of the Rings??? Ha! This was the best movie from that year, hands down...better than Moulin Rouge, Monster's Ball, Shrek, In the Bedroom, A Beautiful Mind and all the rest. Many people have compared this movie to The Sixth Sense, but note: this movie was written BEFORE the Sixth sense ever came out. Alejandro had this eerie little gem planned for years, which makes it even more of a marvel.This is also the superior movie because of the all-around great acting that Sixth Sense lacked in places. Fioluanna Flanagan -- an all-time underrated character actress -- plays the maid with stunning precision. Compare this to her other great ""maid"" role in the TV movie The Legend of Lizzie Borden. And Eric Sykes as the bumbling-yet-creepy Mr. Tuttle does extremely well, delivering the movie's funniest line...you'll know what I'm talking about. It's made hilarious simply because of his pitch-perfect delivery.Also, these child actors, Akina Mann & James Bentley, are unbelievable -- I kept wondering where on earth the casting director found them. They're sort of a dark version of the Mary Poppins kids and every bit as good if not better. Bentley, especially, manages to be cute and terrified without also coming across as annoying and over-the-top like other, more-acclaimed child actors.Nicole Kidman is gorgeous here. She's really hot. Besides that, I do believe Kidman's performance here is inferior to the role in Moulin Rogue -- people simply think this one is better because it's a dramatic film (most people do not realize how hard it is to do comedy well, let alone musical-comedy). In fact, this movie is more of a dramatic chilly family melodrama that horror. It's not really scary or even suspenseful; that is, even if you figure out what's going on early on, the tension and the dramatic storyline will still keep you watching, as happened to my best friend when we saw it. However you count it, Kidman is definitely a goddess, starring in the two best movies to come out of one year. The Others is just well-done, nothing fancy, but with a few brief moments that will have you screaming at the screen. Well-acted, extremely well-written (very, very rare nowadays), and brilliantly directed...this is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion.",The Others

422,hosolo,Oooh - Australian actors,10,21 July 2006,"A couple of movies I've watched lately, have all involved Australian actors. Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain, Hugh Jackman in X-Men, Guy Pearce and Nicole Kidman. I completely forgot she was an Aussie. Her portrayal of an overprotective British mother is incredibly good that when I played the DVD extras, that Australian accent came back on. Kidman, Flanagan as the lead housekeeper, the two young children especially give great acting performances. And like Ledger in Brokeback, when the acting is superb, and the story well told, repeated viewings are a must. I don't know why some people call it ""slow"". From the opening scream to the surprise ending, The Others kept me involved, not knowing if the housekeepers were diabolical or ""Grace"" was really mad, as her daughter suggested. Director Amenabar wrote, directed and composed the score for the film, which greatly enhanced the mood at certain scenes. The music gave a clue of what was happening but it was still effective. A really enjoyable nighttime flick, one that will make you shudder, and very well made.",The Others
423,A Jay,Fantastic,9,4 November 2001,"What a brilliant film. I was impressed from beginning to end. All the characters built up the suspense brilliantly, with their constant shifts from hateable to likeable or vice versa. I didn't think any of the characters were out of place. All of them fitted into the plot perfectly. Nicole Kidman is a very under rated actress. Her performance as Grace was wonderful and she bought out the whole atmosphere of the film. I don't just want to praise Nicole though, the child actors gave a solid performance that was believable and spine chilling.  Every other actor involved was very convincing and Eric Sykes was an unexpected bonus to the cast list. The film itself is well written and beautifully directed by Alejandro Amenabar. The story is interesting and the 1945 setting is an interesting choice. It will make you jump a few times, but along with the rest of the audience you'll nervously laugh it off. A fact I noticed was that there was barely any special effects. Frankly the film would have been ruined if special effects had been put in.I respect a film that relies mostly on acting ability and plot to build up atmosphere and horror rather than having someone hack a limb off someone else just to frighten you.Possible spoilers below I won't give away to much of the ending (because I hate people who do) apart from to say it is unexpected and leaves you guessing right up until the final 5 minutes.

And just when I thought I had everything figured out, more details came to the surface to jolt me some more!  In a year of woefully substandard movies so far, ""The Others"" stands out as a film of intelligence and real chills without flashy special effects.  It is a return to solid storytelling, intriguing characters, and the mark of genius, in that it transported me to another time and place and involved me so much, that I thought I was part of the story.

And Nicole Kidman shows she can actually act.I suppose for most of us these days gorged on a diet of gory, in your face horror films we're unused to this throw back to early mood pictures like The Haunting.  Everything is suggested rather than seen, understated rather that overstated - just the way is should be, and the basis of real terror.Possible spoiler:Did anyone else feel that The Others gives a reverential nod to the William Castle film ""The House on Haunted Hill"" when the scary old lady appears?",The Others

So we checked this movie out, and I'm pretty damned happy I did!  I don't know where to start...EVERYTHING in the movie was gorgeous. From Nicole Kidman, to the kids, to the house...pretty much everything. This movie made me jump at least three times, and that's without ever showing and blood or deranged killers stalking people in the house.  The ending had me in awe!  While some people guessed it, I did not, and that made the movie that much more enjoyable.  Be warned, though.  Don't go if you are sleepy or tired, and the first 45 minutes or so are spent setting up the rest of the movie, and could be considered ""slow"".  Didn't really bother me, though.

From the minute it starts (and the starting is really brilliant!) you get the image that The Others is not as cliché filled and normal kind of thriller. I liked the way the film was full of good little scary parts and not just a horrifying end and nothing happening in between like in many lame horrormovies. The music and the zooming with the camera were effective. And what a great idea it is to make a horror movie with two children allergic to light! Scary movies are supposed to be gloomy and grey looking and the allergy gives a ReAsOn why the movie is darkish.Nicole Kidman gave a strong performance and I was very pleased of her but mostly I was impressed with the two children. They were absolutely great, natural and true. Expecially the girl, Anne, she had a hard role in her shoulders but she handeled it like a professional actress.
And the ending...of course I´m not going to tell about it because it is a delicious treat if you don´t know what happens in it. I WAS suprised!",The Others

A couple of things do annoy me slightly like some of the plot is just spelt out too obviously but apart from that I really cannot find fault.The acting is very good, even the children - especially Anne are exceptional. The constant low lighting and over panning really help the over all eerie feel and sense of the severity and urgency regarding the children's ""condition. It also gives a very claustrophobic feel to the point where you can see how much the lifestyle would drain anyone to the point of distraction. And I genuinely felt for the characters in this one, many emotions portrayed very well. ""The twist is fantastic and you really do not see it coming till the end unlike many films that have tried to re create this since.SO, to sum up-I would recommend this highly to anyone and I don't recommend horrors lightly as I'm very picky and don't frighten easily!",The Others

I wasn't at all tempted to see this movie until I saw the high rating (8.3/10) on IMDb. That made me curious enough to go and see the movie. I'm glad I did. THE OTHERS is a great classic ghost story right up until the end when the viewer is shocked with an amazing twist. The acting is good, even the children were good in this one.  Don't expect some masked and deranged fellow pop out of nowhere and start jabbing people with a huge knife. This is a good old fashioned ghost story, which means that there's no gore and no real violence.

The story is based on a woman who lives alone with her kids in a old mansion. Her kids suffer from a strange disease which makes them allergic to light. With the arriving of new servants The lady starts to notice that strange things are happening in her rather grey home, A piano that sounds when apparently nobody is playing it, her older child claims to have seen strangers in the house, and many other extrasensory phenomena that creep the nerves of the already worrisome woman.

I regard that film as being brilliant for its story and its twist but on seeing this one, I never even thought about Sixth Sense until now. Just because they have a similar idea doesnt mean that it blackmarks this film one bit and the shock from this twist fat outstripped the one from the other film.Simply put, this on first glance seems like a strandard horror tale told slowly and carefully and doesnt *seem* to have anything special about it until you see the point of it all at the end. While other users have posted spoilers, I have no intention of doing so but this is one of those films that shows how much it shines when you *think* back on what you saw through the film. Just like Sixth Sense, the twist raises the film to new heights. The acting and cinematics are brilliant as is the mood throughout the film and it gives a new *perspective* in horror films - a perspective not told many times before to my knowledge.Heartily recommended as a benchmark for future horror films.",The Others

Nicole Kidman brought us into her tormented world very quickly as did her children.  The three members of the house staff were the icing on the cake, keeping us guessing as to their real intentions.   The presence of the intruders in the house was pure 'Hitchcock' suspense.

I really only want to tell you that it was a terrific story and fabulous acting by all......I do want to say more than that because anything I say could spoil it for you.  The only thing I found which was remotely close to being a fault with this movie was the darkness it seemed to be shot in through out. It made sense that it appeared that way but as a movie viewer, I am just not accustomed to that.I would suggest that you do NOT drink before or during this movie because you really dont want to miss a second!

It's smart, you don't get anything handed to you - it requires that you make an effort to figure out what's going on, and pays off beautifully. It's not just the story, because that by itself is not that original. It's the way the idea was expanded and executed by a very talented writer-director. Nicole Kidman handled her role extremely well, but I was expecting her to, having read a ton of positive reviews. Also, I've always considered her a very talented actress. But I was just amazed by how well the two children did: they were simply brilliant, especially the girl. In fact, The Others was well acted all around.  Some reviews claimed this movie was slow. Huh? Maybe in that there were no explosions or video clip editing. So what? If the writing, design, cinematography, music, and everything else mentioned before work so well, who cares?

This movie could have easily been done in a half hour and all the good scenes would not have to be edited out! I thought Nicole Kidman was playing the part of my aunt Ginny in this flick! I guess I feel uncomfortable watching a woman be over-bearing to her kids that she ""claims"" she loves and subjects them to cruel punishment.
The ending to the movie explains basically what's happening during the rest of it. This is the kind of movie you need to watch a second time to get the whole picture, but let me ask you something - Why would you? Ghost or Human, after a thousand hints, I would believe SOMETHING was going on! But then again, when you see women like Nichole Philpot live in this world, you would believe Nicole Kidman would play a character THAT messed up to actually believe it was ""just the wind"". MAN!!!If I did not wake up in a cold sweat dreaming about my aunt at nights after watching this I may have given this a ""4"", but unfortunately I do, so I gave it a ""2"" not to only show my displeasure of this movie, but to get it out of the top 250!

449,foundyouhere,"More than just ""Scary Stuff""",10,16 August 2001,"To write my review I would like to rebuttal the comments that continually compare this film to that of the Sixth Sense.  The major difference between The Others and The Sixth Sense is that The Sixth Sense is a psychological drama with supernatural elements.  The Others is a psychological MYSTERY, with possible supernatural elements.  Two different genre's of film-making, two different ways of telling a story.  The surprise ending is usually a mandatory constituent of a mystery film.  The surprise ending to The Sixth Sense was interesting but raised question to possible plot holes.  The other remarkable device The Others presents is theory and conception.  The Sixth Sense lays out exactly what is trying to be achieved and the ""surprise"" ending is not out of character of the whole plot.  The Others ending may not have been a surprise to a select few audience members, but that's the point of a mystery, combining clues to theorize a climax ending; figure it out, congrats, to the rest of us who didn't, surprise!  In the end what is important is how you leave the theater, and while my friends and I left the The Others talking about possible theories the ending presents and what parts made us jump completely out of our chair,  leaving The Sixth Sense we were questioning the obvious plot holes that the ending left us with.   Everything about The Others is chilling.  Cliché?  Perhaps, but what is more satisfying than an old English mansion, surrounded by fog, with child inhabitants who fear seeing the sun at the medical risk of death? Especially when telling a horror story.  Not one drop of blood is shed in order to scare.  No CGI monsters, no running through the house as the floorboards are lifted from beneath them.  Noises, voices, mystery and psychological drama are the tricks to create fear.  The performances were creepy and admirable.  The sets were perfect.  The story was masterful, is this really a haunted house or haunted minds? Who are the caretakers, whats up with the husband, what happened to Grace to make her children more afraid of her than the possible ghosts?  So much mystery and all answered wonderfully.   Bone chilling, thought provoking entertainment.",The Others
450,Stevenuccj,"Best supernatural thriller since 1999's 6th Sense, BWP, Stir of Echoes",6,16 August 2001,"This movie succeeds on a number of levels, but also fails to overly impress us with it's story or it's climax.First off, it is very refreshing to see a movie such as this at a time where recent horror movies have been the pathetic ""Forsaken,"" and the mediocre slasher rip-off ""Valentine."" What do we have to look forward to?  ""Jeepers Creepers"" (sigh).In this company, The Others may well go down as the best horror film of the year.The acting in The Others is one of it's strengths.  Nicole Kidman, contrary to what I heard prior to seeing it, gives a strong performance as the authoritarian parent who doesn't know how to deal with the freaky happenings in the house.  The kids both give good performances, especially the daughter, in what may be the best performance of the movie.  The housekeepers are decent but not outstanding.The lighting in The Others is really quite amazing.  The whole movie is lit by candlelight, and it plays out very realistically and adds to the atmosphere.  The cinematography is done flawlessly.  Director Alejandro Amenábar has shown he can film better than most directors today. 
The movie takes a long amount of time getting to the climax, but it keeps us interested.  Had it taken just a few minutes longer in getting there, the audience likely would have lost interest.  The problem with the movie lies with the climax and resolution, which doesn't quite make the trip getting there worthwhile.  There are good twists at the end, which I will not reveal, but at the same time we expect something more to happen which never does.  Part of the blame for that must go to the lack of important things happening leading up to the climax.Overall a decent but not great movie, which seems like a godsend to horror fans at a time like this.",The Others
451,scree,Great all-around movie,10,22 June 2002,"This movie is a brilliant piece of work! The acting is superb, right down to that of the children. Nicole Kidman pulls off a cool English accent and fills her part excellently, being much more suited to this kind of role (like Dead Calm) than her tough-chick (The Peacemaker) or black comedy (To Die For) attempts. There are just enough characters to keep it all interesting, and the old mansion and outdoor scenery make for some great cinematography for the time period (WWII). And the suspense factor is just enough as well, not overblown or cheesy at all. If you liked The Sixth Sense, then this movie will rank right up there with it for you!",The Others
452,invincible_seattle,A fresh and refreshing look at a familiar subject.,8,5 August 2002,"I was able to get around to viewing this film for the first time just the other day.  And it is one of the most beautifully made movies of the past several years.As I viewed it, this film struck me quite quickly as a cross between ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999, M. Night Shyamalan) and ""The Haunting"" (1999, Jan de Bont).  The eerie sound effects are reminiscent of the latter, with a plot that loosely follows the former (Grace's daughter Anne is able to see and talk with the spirits in the house, while Grace herself cannot see anything at first, much like Cole Sear and Bruce Willis in ""Sixth Sense"").The things that attract my attention in a movie aren't so much the dialogue, but the look of the film, the way it feels and flows and the way the actors portray themselves.The look of the film, just from looking at it, must have been very difficult to photograph in such low light.  Although it features a production crew made up of people I've never heard of, they managed to put together a magnificent set and managed to be able to photography every single square inch of it.  Photography was obviously well rehearsed, with the low-light visuals and excellent angles used throughout the film.The feeling of the film is very emotional and has a religious theme.  It's really quite amazing to see how much influence religion has in horror/suspense films.  The emotions flow primrily from Kidman, who excellently plays against her usual roles to play a very protective mother in 1945s post-WWII United Kingdom.The fact that Kidman looks a great deal like Grace Kelly was, if intended, a magnificent choice for the film.  Grace Kelly, for those that don't know her, was a deeply family-oriented woman who even quit her movie career to dedicate herself to her new family shortly after marrying the crown prince of Monaco.  In the movie, Kidman aggressively tries to keep her children in line and under control, and for the most part, succeeds.This is one of the most striking films I've seen in a long while.  It's fresh and masterful approach to a familiar subject is a welcomed refreshment.",The Others
453,MovieShrink7,Awesome movie...until the ending,3,2 February 2012,"I saw The Others several years ago in the theater. It was so packed that me and my two friends had to sit separately from one another because there simply were not enough seats. The movie did not disappoint. The Others was just subtle enough to lure you into a sense of security before it through another jump at you. The music was perfect because, in most mystery/thriller types the music gives it away but in The Others you keep thinking that you know what you're getting and just when you're ready to call it a false alarm, something else comes out of the shadows. The kids are deliciously creepy and the servants make you wonder what secret the house and its occupants truly hold. I was particularly intrigued by the mute servant. Throughout the entire film I could not wait to hear what dreadful secret she possessed that would compel her to give up speech. Then the end came and I was so disappointed. Not only did the Sixth Sense literally just come out a few years before so the twist was completely played out, but the way they did it was so damn cheesy! Nicole Kidman is ripping up a piece of paper and then it cuts to a piece of paper ripping in midair in front of a séance group. The effect was lame and lazy. The whole thing was lazy. Cool, I'm glad you realized you killed your kids (which was creepy, I'll give them that) but she probably still should have been alive. Or something, I don't know. All I know is that I was let down. The rest of the movie was brilliant and the ending felt like a wrap up from a scooby doo episode. Boo!",The Others

The intelligent scripting and the surprise twist and turns in the story will keep you thinking throughout the movie. It's not like one of those Hollywood blockbusters where all you do is sit back and let the special effects, explosions etc. carry you along. In this movie, the story unfolds through the dialogue from scene to scene. Nicole Kidman's performance is wonderful. The supporting cast is also good as well particularly the children. This movie is a definite must see!!! The frightening parts may be few and far between but there is always a sense of eeriness, which is unsettling throughout the movie. And probably the best thing about this movie is that most of the scares are provided not through gory or frightening visuals (such as a blown off head, a scarred face, people hanging from ropes ala The Sixth Sense) but rather through simple visuals such as a photograph or a hand reaching out.",The Others

458,BermudezLievano,Perfect.... a master at work,10,26 November 2001,"Alejandro Amenábar is a very young and talented director, born in Chile and raised in Spain. He revolutionized Spanish cinema when he arrived on the scene with Thesis, at only 24 years of age. The came Abre los ojos, a very powerful second film that immediately put him aside some of the leading directors there, like Pedro Almodóvar, Carlos Saura, or Fernando Trueba. The others is only his third film and you can now see a hint of who may become one of the best around in a couple of years (he's only 29). The best comparison I can make of this film is to a piece of clockwork. Precise, exact, nothing is gratuitous or excessive.... What a subtle charm this film works on you as a spectator. The screenplay is one of the best of this genre I have seen in the last few years, very carefully revised and misleading, yet at the end everything makes perfect sense, not the mention on the second time you watch it. It is true that many of the film's features and details may be traced to classic films of the genre, but there is nothing wrong with that. The director himself said it was an homage to directors like Alfred Hitchcock (to whom he has been compared somewhat prematurely.... he may reach such height but he still has a long road to walk). That is one of the great things about the film; it takes the best of the genre, the best that has been made by the best directors... it's a film lover's delight. I had never thought Nicole Kidman could have been at the height of the project, as I really have never considered her a great actress. All I can say is I am still dumbfounded by her extraordinary performance... really, a large percentage of the film's success can be related to her. Sober and discreet when needed, yet grand all the same... It does remind some of the most elegant names of classic Hollywood cinema like the Bette Davis of All about Eve or the Katharine Hepburn of The African queen. But it would be really selfish to give her all the credit when she was supported by an extraordinary cast. Fionnula Flanagan (the sweet old lady from Waking Ned Devine) is trully magnificent as the governess, Mrs. Mills, and very surprising performances of a mute and an old gardener are given by Elaine Cassidy and Eric Sykes. The children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) are also fantastic. Finally, I cannot but mention the crew of the film. It is even a more fantastic job when you consider that the film (many people don't realize this) is chiefly a Spanish production. The production design by Benjamín Fernández and specially the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe are extraordinary. Just as in the best painting of figures like Goya or Rembrandt, light and shadow reveal the objects and the people. I do not hesitate to say that this is really one of the best films of the year 2001. I am still waiting to watch Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, La stanza del figlio, The shipping news, The hours and Italiensk for begyndere, but I know it will remain amongst those at the top. A 10/10 is really fair for a film that has it all, a perfect machinery that arrives at a time when we seriously need intelligent films and not blockbuster deceptions. I can only say I hope its director won't jump to Hollywood in search of big-time projects that waste his potential. It is a film to feast on.. to savour, to enjoy, to remember....",The Others

467,philip-63,Nothing new - at ALL!,4,10 January 2002,"A creepy Victorian house surrounded by fog. Things that go bump in the night (and at other times). Creepy servants, scared children. A twist you can see coming a mile off (unless you've never seen a film at all like this before). Well made, solidly but unspectacularly made, and technically perfectly competent, but with a story and an ambience that is nothing new. Anyone who has seen 'The Woman in Black' (on stage or TV) or any of a score of British ghost flicks of the 1960s or 70s will find everything here amazingly familiar. That 'The Others' is being touted as a possible 'best film' for 2001 is a extraordinary (unlike the film).",The Others
468,kazar-2,Sometimes You Have To See Things Without Using Your Eyes,9,8 September 2001,"For most of us, we have to see stuff to believe in them.    Before we could see a fire burning in a fireplace, we must see the flames or the smoke coming from the chimney.  Even without a fire burning, we know what a fireplace is used for.  Do we have to see a ghost before we start believing in them?  Do we have to believe before we can see a ghost?  Should we believe in ghosts and never see them?   When you read the premise of Nicole Kidman's THE OTHERS, you know it is a ghost story.  Her place is haunted. Yet, her character is unwilling to believe in them.  She hears them, but she doesn't see them.  Watching this film, it was very captivating for various reasons.  The children are unable to go outside because they are very sensitive to the light.  Nicole's character locking the doors, which is a significance to the pressure that she feels.  She feels closed in.  The house has basically become her prison and the ""Intruders"" want her out of the house.  So, does she give in and leave with the children or does she stay and fight the ""Intruders""?   The script was well written and the acting makes the situation believable.  We believe that there are ghosts in the house, but are there?  Nicole's character went mad, so her madness could be returning and using her daughter's ghost stories as her means to express it. If you have seen and enjoyed Sixth Sense, you would enjoy this movie.  I am thinking that you might have to see this movie, again, to fully comprehend it.  It has many questions.  Like a maze, the movie has many enjoyable twists and turns.  The movie is spooky, so you might have to prepare yourself to be jolted by some of the scenes.  So, after watching this movie, you may have to see the movie again, but using something other than your eyes :-)  The tagline should be  ""Believe in ghosts because they believe in you!""",The Others
469,showdown,"Good enough to see once, but will it become a classic? (Last paragraph: possibly spoiler)",7,27 January 2002,"For me this one is a ghost story in the most traditional way: it creates a frightening atmosphere, there are few very well set shock effects without any blood/gore. The story is quite good, but could have been asking more questions (and some of them being answered).After seeing a movie I ask myself mostly the same key questions: Did I like it (and why/why not)? Was it so good that I would want to see it again? Can I recommend it? Was there something new/original in this film? Yes, overall I liked it and I can recommend it, it is worth looking. I would watch it again, but only after a longer period of time and not in cinema (although the surround sound effects were really impressive). Maybe it is not quite fair, but the similarity to ""the sixth sense"" is close at hand. Compared to ""the sixth sense"" this one loses a bit, and not only because I saw ""the sixth sense"" first. There were not enough new things to make it a classic of the genre. Unfortunately I could not sympathize so closely with the characters as I did in ""the sixth sense"".
! Warning: possibly spoiler ahead! I think the story is incomplete in some ways: for example in the end the question ""why did Grace do it?"" comes up, but there is no hint of an explanation (""crazy"" is not satisfying enough) and I could not detect a sufficient motivation for it in her acting before. But I see this as a lack in the script, not in the acting of Nicole Kidman.",The Others
470,emily_16,Twists and turns! WARNING: SPOILER!,9,15 November 2002,"I'm such a wimp when it comes to horror movies.  I was 8 when I saw Poltergeist and I have been deathly afraid of clowns and under the bed ever since. (Even though I'm 14) So, seeing this movie was extremely frightening for me! In it we follow this depressed woman who has lost her husband in the war. She lives in her dark secluded mansion with her 2 children, who can't be near the light because if they are exposed to it they will die.  So, the movie is all dark, which is freaky.  In the movie Grace Stewart (the mother) played by Nicole Kidman is slowly going insane and she has hired some new servants to replace her old ones, who just disappeared one day!  Grace is noticing all these strange things happening in her house and she suspects Natzis are hiding in it, though soon the suspicion turns to ghosts because of the freaky pale faced daughter, who can see one of them.  The servants know what's up, though they are acting like they don't.  Then, Grace begins investigating all of this, and looks at old books and tries to find out if the house has a bad history.  She even finds a book of the dead, which has pictures of dead people in it, all dressed up.  grace gets really freaked out, and tries to walk into town to get help from the church, but during her walk, fog surrounds her and she finds her husband!  She takes him home, and he's all depressed, and doesn't seem to know what's happening, though again the servants do.  The children are absolutely ecstatic to have their daddy home, but then begin telling him terrible things that their mommy has done to them.  Because, children, mommy went crazy!  So, the next day the father disappears, and more terrible things start to happen.  Grace knows the servants know something so she sends them away because she thinks they are evil.  Then, that night, while looking through the book of the dead, she sees that the SERVANTS are in there!!!!  They were ghosts.  Her children, who have snuck outside, have just realized this because they see their gravestones in the yard!  And the servants are creepily following them!  So the kids run inside to their mothers arms, and Grace tells them to hide upstairs, while she tries to stop the 3 ghosts.  But, while upstairs, hiding in the closet, the kids notice that there are even more ghosts there!  And then you see this horrific old woman's face open the closet!  Meanwhile, downstairs, the ghosts are telling Grace that they just want to help.  She runs upstairs into the room where her kids are hiding, and sees a group of people at a table.  The old woman is writing some stuff very fast, and the kids are telling her what their mother did to them!  Grace screams, and takes all the papers and throws them in the air and destroys them. Suddenly, the scene changes and we see it from the other people's point of view!  The papers are flying up by themself, and they are trying to reach the ghosts that live in the house!  So, now we find out that Grace and her children, and the servants, and the lost soul of the father are ALL ghosts! Apparently, one day while they were alive, Grace went crazy and suffocated her children with pillows and shot herself in the head.  It appeared to Grace and the children that they had survived and that God had given them a second chance!  But, sadly, that was not the case.  They were ghosts.  It ends up with the servants telling Grace that they didn't know they were dead either, and wanted to break it gently to her.  They also say that once in a while they will make contact with the other world, but only sometimes.  They decide to stay at the house, especially since now the children can be exposed to light, (because they're already dead) It really made you think and it was a great horror movie.  All great movies make you think, not like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, both of which are terribly predictable.  There are so many twists and turns in this movie, and it was really freaky in the theatre!  Go see it, or if you have, watch it again!  Out of 5 stars: 4",The Others
471,ambercatgoddess-484-733898,I Abhored This,1,9 October 2012,This was a horrible movie. It was boring and uneventful. The movie idea itself was laughable..I normally enjoy Nicole Kidman and her roles she is very talented. But this movie was a nightmare.I was bored from beginning to end. I knew what was happening before anyone else did. So for me it was a wasted time in the theater. I was waiting for it to end as I already knew what was going on. I like a movie that surprises me.

As a lover of horrors I know how difficult it is to do a good thriller, and as a matter of fact despite my love of the genre, there are only a few good ones I had actually seen in my long life. It shows you how difficult it is to do it well. Therefore I am still on the quest for masterpieces such as above movie. I was absolutely impressed and just wish that Alejandro Amenabar would do another horror as sophisticated as this one. And acting should also be mentioned as superb. Nicole Kidman of whom I am not a special fan,is to my surprise excellent in her portrayal of deeply depressed, psychotic wife; Fionnula Flanagan - fantastic actress with amazing voice and presence, and two other actors also splendid - the producers couldn't choose better players. And children were also great compared with typical Hollywood annoying kids who speak like adults and behave in the most artificial, phony manner. Please, watch this movie. It is not just your plain horror taking place in a spooky house but psychological drama about religion, motherhood and mortality. And dear Mr. Amemabar - make another horror. There are excellent stories written in Victorian times. Take one and show young viewers something besides vampires and zombies.",The Others
473,novella221,Great acting&great storyline!,9,28 July 2005,"'The Others' is a film I never get bored of. It is beautifully made. I don't want to give too much of the film away so i'll keep it brief. Basically, Grace (Kidman) is living on her own with her two children , Anne and Nicholas, after her husband went to war. She advertises for some housekeepers who come in the form of Mrs. Mills and co. You can tell there's something not quite right about the housekeeper's and they in their own right are quite scary. There is paranormal activity in the house, and child Anne believes she can communicate with a young boy named Victor. A story unravels throughout the film coming to an amazing, unpredictable and dramatic ending.The storyline is well thought out. This film is so good and different from you're typical ghost film. The acting of all members of a small cast is brilliant, especially the two children. I was shocked at how good those playing Anne and Nicholas portrayed their characters. The acting skills of such young children is worth to watch for on it's own.If you haven't seen this film yet then make sure it's next on your list!",The Others

One of the old horror techniques is to place the dead individual in a place where they couldn't leave, hence fog. Charles steps out of the fog and tells his wife he has come to say goodbye because he has to go back to the front.

478,benyg,A little bit too The Sixth Sense for me,7,11 May 2003,"Nicole Kidman stars as 'Grace,' the Mother of two photosensitive children whom reside in a large Victorian house in this great yet reasonably predictable film.Towards the beginning of the film things start to stray from the formulaic horror-film plot and from then onwards it does not look back. It is this most of all that keeps you watching  - if The Blair Witch Project scared you then this will scare you too.Personally, being part of the 'American Werewolf from London' generation only in-your-face horror frightens me but nevertheless this is a tempting film that urges you to keep guessing where the plot is going to go next. You may guess correctly on the first plot twist but the second will probably elude you. This surprisingly does not detract from the film and my attention was not detracted for a moment.75%",The Others
479,Dark Hellion,"Good, but...",7,28 November 2001,"By the time I got around to seeing this movie, many of my friends had already been to see it, so I had a pretty good idea of the spread of opinions out there. Some claimed it was the best thing since sliced bread, but upon examination, it turned out most of these people were self-confessed Nicole Kidman fans. And hey, us Aussies tend to be a bit parochial at the best of times. But an upswelling of opinion worldwide that's enough to propel this movie into the IMDb's top 250 is something you simply can't ignore.
The first thing I noticed about this movie as a whole was the art direction. The cinematography was not necessarily anything to write home about--it was above workmanlike, but not as outstanding as other films I've seen this year--but the set design, the layout, the costumes, the lighting, the sheer *beauty* of this film really made me sit up and take notice.
Perhaps unfortunately, for me art direction is a means by which plot can be expressed. In films where it's appropriate to think about the plot (and as a cerebral horror/suspense movie, this one falls squarely in that category), Plot Is King. SPOILERS AHEADOkay, if you're still reading and you don't want to ruin any surprises, STOP NOW!!! Right. When we reach the end of the movie, we learn that Nicole went mad and smothered both her children before shooting herself with a rifle. They've been seeing 'ghosts' throughout the movie, but these 'ghosts' are actually real live people that have moved into the house. At first only the Nicole's little girl can see them, but as the truth becomes more apparent, that the only real ghosts are the protagonists themselves (and their servants, but that's a side-plot), the real people become properly visible.
Obviously, this is always going to draw parallels with The Sixth Sense...and if you haven't seen *that* movie and don't want it ruined, stop reading now too! Bruce Willis discovers he's dead at the end of that movie--murdered by an intruder to the house he shares with his wife. Some have said that The Others handles the revelation better, others have said it's worse. I fall into the latter camp. The thing is, when you're watching The Others, you're wondering where it's going throughout the entire movie. There's no sense of purpose. There's definite interest, and you don't get bored, but there's no secondary plot to keep the audience engrossed in a storyline, nothing to stop them from picking the movie apart at each step. The psychologist/patient relationship between Bruce and Haley in Sixth Sense offers that. Plus you get a greater sense of backstory in the history of Willis' character's life.
Also, unlike Sixth Sense, The Others refrains from having subtle pointers to the real truth. Instead, it opts for one big pointer, and then a lot of red herrings. Where the path to the truth in Sixth Sense was obvious once you knew how, the path to the truth in The Others is littered with what appear at first glance to be inconsistencies and plot holes. Put simply, I preferred Sixth Sense on its ability to *draw* the audience into the storyline, to bring out an interest in the characters' situations and for its masterful working of the backdrop behind it. Sixth Sense is a less beautiful movie, that much is true. However, there are so many little things that could have tipped you off to the truth in it.
Sixth Sense brushes you lightly with a feather every now and then in an effort to make you see the chicken. The Others tries to bludgeon you with the entire chicken once or twice and then throws fish at you just to make you think about something else for a while. Having said all that, it's still a very good movie, and one I'd recommend going to see. A pity that it's just not quite as good as it might have been.
Pros: Atmospheric, beautiful, highly suspenseful, and well worth going to see. Plus the two kids are the best I've seen on screen since...well...Haley Joel Osment, really. Cons: It just doesn't *quite* get there. Likely Oscar nominations: Largest budgetary allocation for light bulbs, 2001. Verdict: If Sixth Sense was on the highest salary in the country, The Others can still put its kids through private school, university and afford braces for them both. However, it'll never afford the mansion on the hill. Good...but could have been better. 7½ out of 10.",The Others

482,portia-1,A film that entices our interest in ghost stories.,9,13 January 2005,"I watched this movie for the second time on British TV last night and enjoyed it immensely - isn't hindsight a great thing? When I saw it originally, Nicole Kidman was in Moulon Rouge around on DVD at the same time so it was interesting to see just how very different the two roles were. As Grace in THE OTHERS she plays the proverbial, religious up tight woman who is clearly suffering from mental illness due to the absence of her husband who has not returned from the war. It's '1945 so where is he?Jersey was occupied by the Nazis for some five years , well of course he died . AS the film moves along very slowly and Grace becomes more and more highly strung by the 'supernatural happenings'she rejects, it is clear to the viewer that all is not what we are meant to believe and it is true that if you are familiar with Amenabar's work, you will start to figure out where the film is heading but not how, however I don't believe all those who said they guessed the ending in the first half hour because the action and the plot is handled too well. To keep comparing it to the Sixth Sense is a spoiler in itself and unfair to audiences who have not seen the movie. For those who could not understand why the husband returned only to go away again think I have grasped it. He returned in the fog looking suitably haunted, he is already dead but as a ghost has come back to the house to confront Grace as to why she killed his children. I think we have to assume that she has not been a ghost that long when he returned or indeed when the film starts and that the main reason for her despair was the loss of her husband, she probably killed the children towards the end of the WW11 and killed herself when she realised he would not return. He had to leave her because he did not die there with her but in the War somewhere else, and therefore returned probably only in her imagination. Her existence as a ghost who cannot rest is guilt driven by the violence of her own death and that is why we are seeing her(not realising at the time that she is a ghost),as a mirror image and she is a dysfunctional, not very kind woman driven so strongly by religion and by a sort of paranoid protectiveness towards her two children who are both excellent in their roles. Other viewers may interpret this aspect of the film differently but I think it does answer the plothole regarding Christopher Eccleston's character.THE OTHERS is a highly enjoyable, extremely watchable old fashioned ghost story that is reminiscent of what is best from the genre - no swearing, no violence and no blood. It is a well told and well directed movie which will keep those who have not seen it guessing until the end, and it is explained at the end which often fails with other films of its type. Kidman surpasses herself and Amenabar should be proud of such a absorbing piece of work.",The Others

This movie is a little hard to review because I felt like the setting of the story was great (love period horror), and the performances were great (Nicole Kidman is strong as usual). The story itself has some uniqueness to it, and I appreciate the ending. The reason for my ambivalence is that I watched it in two sittings because I started it late one night. But I wasn't dying to finish it. I sat on it for several days - watching other things in between before I came back to it - so I guess I found it a little slow.

While the actors weren't terrible, or even bad, it was obvious from the start that they were just actors there to play a role. You don't get attached to any of them. Also, if an actor is going to have to fake an accent, then that actor needs to be able to pull it off.

485,Venom-5,Moody and Brooding,7,24 August 2001,"Movie Review:  The Others (2001)Towards the end of World War II, Grace (Nicole Kidman) lives in a mansion near the English Coast with her two children Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann, James Bentley) where they are waiting for her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) to come back home from the war.Grace is unbearably religious and does not believe in nonsense like ghosts which her independently minded daughter Anne likes to talk about, claiming to have seen and spoken with them.Anne and her brother Nicholas have an allergy to light; so the curtains must be drawn and doors must be closed and locked before the next one is opened, to keep the light out because the light will hurt the children; beautiful, pale sad children.There are no great special effects in this movie, it is very slow and i do not recommend it for those who need action.  Most of the time i need action and i do wish this movie had more movement to it, but i still enjoyed it. It is a moody and broody movie.  It is wonderfully heavy on atmosphere.  And It has a story.All the servants have disappeared into thin air and replacing those servants are Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs. Mills,  Elaine Cassidy as Lydia, and Eric Sykes as Mr. Tuttle.   They play the housekeeper, the nanny and the gardener.  But one quickly learns they are not what they seem.  Why do they return to this house?  What are their motives?Soon after the arrival of the servants Grace begins to hear noises and to sense something diabolical is living in her home.  Is Grace imagining these things?  Is Anne creating these effects in order to gain attention?  Are the servants trying to undo her in order to take control of her home and to hurt her children?Grace despite her rigidness and strictness has a vulnerability to her. Maybe too much vulnerability since according to her daughter she has once suffered madness.  Nicole Kidman plays her perfectly.  She can express feelings and thoughts with a mere look.All are perfect in their parts; and the dialogue is excellent in it's poetic feel.

""the others"" is a work of art.*****spoiler*****it's hard to say what i liked best about this movie; everything was great. the imagery was familliar, but not at all ""comfortable"", and the time period was morbid enough without help. the effect of the book of the dead, on me at least, manifested in a deep ""agh crap!"" feeling in my stomach. i've had an aversion to photographs of people anyway, but just the thoughts of living in such a place during that time and then finding an artifact created deliberately to devise an afterlife... *shudder*.i once lived in a house where many of the same phenomena occurred... and the people who say this movie is slow and boring seem as if they just can't ""get it"", perhaps due to a lack of similar experience. the subtle changes in atmosphere in the house, the sounds, the frantic search for the curtains; all these built up to an ambience that must have spooked, if not terrified, some of the more intellectual audiences. towards the end, when we learn that the living have been haunting the dead, i was forced to wonder if nature could actually be as such... i was definitely creeped out and very awake for hours after.unfortunately for me, my experience was dampened by a crowd of rude yard-apes in the back row who insisted on shouting, walking around, and loudly cackling throughout the whole movie. i had to fight the urge to turn around and flood the dark with loud obscenities several times, and once complained to a security guard who had to come in and sit near the teenagers to keep things down. i almost never attend movies in theatres, expressly because of rude children and the laws against throwing them over the sides of the seating area. i'd recommend seeing this movie at a late show during the week, primarily a monday, tuesday, or wednesday. you definitely don't want distractions and disturbances for this one.as a footnote, i was reading other reviews, and i couldn't help but notice how so many people (predominately male, from the looks of it) initially said this movie was boring and slow... is anyone else reminded of max headroom? you can't condense a good story into ninety minutes of brainless chases, screaming, shooting, stabbing, or the like. i once saw ""terminatory 2"" on tv, condensed to just an hour. it was absolutely horrid. good storytelling takes time and good characters take time to develop. it's good to see i'm not the only person fed up with gangly teenaged actresses running around with their arms flailing and braless tops flying everywhere in productions that amount to little better than tommy hilfiger ads.",The Others

492,phonenumberofthebeast,Brilliant chiller,9,13 August 2006,"""The Others"" is a phenomenal ghost story brilliantly told by master filmmaker Alejandro Amenábar, who, since winning an Oscar for ""The Sea Inside"" a few years back, seems to have vanished into a ghostly netherworld.Nicole Kidman, in what I consider her only enjoyable performance, plays Grace, a mentally frayed young mother driven to the edge of hysteria by her singularly impossible situation. It is the late 1940s on the isle of Jersey, one of the few regions of England to suffer under Nazi occupation during the war. Her husband, who went away to fight, has not returned, and she's been told to give him up for dead. She finds herself in lone charge of her vast, dusty old manor after the help suddenly disappear without warning. This is doubly difficult because her two children are photoallergic; they cannot tolerate any light brighter than that of a candle, or they blister, seize up and eventually die. No curtains can be left undrawn; no doors can be left open. The children's universe is a house-sized black cocoon. This has meant that Grace has spent most of her life alone; bringing them up in what she herself describes as a ""prison of darkness."" Not surprisingly, she suffers from migraines and cannot stand even the slightest sound.With this ingenious setup, Amenabar creates an ideal horror atmosphere: an old house lit only by candles, kept in a state of near silence. It also allows him to orchestrate a series of situations governed by one of the all-time great suspense concepts: ""Whatever you do... don't do that!"" Usually in a horror film the darkness is to be feared; in this case it is sanctuary. It is the light, advancing like a predator, that is to be fled.The children, brilliantly played by remarkable young actors, are left pale and ghostly by their lifetime of confinement. Their perpetual isolation has left them sullen, resentful and lonely, and the daughter in particular is beginning to rebel. Grace, realising that her control over them is slipping, literally puts the fear of God into them through her strict religious instruction. But the daughter has read her Bible, and can give as good as she gets.If Amenabar had merely played this scenario as was, without a supernatural element, it still could have evolved into a superior Gothic domestic drama. But he's too in love with the fantastic to leave Grace's world unturned. At the film's beginning, a trio of housekeepers straight out of Emily Bronte show up her door, claiming to be answering an ad for help they could not have known about. Suspicious but desperate, Grace agrees to take them in. It becomes increasingly obvious that they have a hidden agenda, though what that agenda is is unclear. For a time, things go well. And then the Others arrive.The children notice them first; the son claims to have spoken to them. They laugh invisibly in the halls, play the piano when the doors are locked, and, most disturbingly, draw the curtains and unlock the doors, leading Grace to conclude they are engaged in a war against her and her children. Under siege from a force she cannot locate, Grace begins to step over the edge she'd been skirting for years, and fall finally into madness.This is an intricate tale, brilliantly constructed. Not a single scene or line of dialogue is wasted. Indeed, from a simple storytelling angle I would say it is superior to ""The Sixth Sense,"" to which it shares many similarities, including a shocking, brilliant twist ending. However, although there are moments of pure terror and an overarching theme of dread and despair in this story, ""The Others"" isn't quite as scary as Shyamalan's masterpiece, mainly because Amenabar perpetually pulls the rug out from under the audience's expectations, so that the Others, unlike the Dead People stalking poor benighted Cole Sear, remain a complete mystery until the film's conclusion. Are they ghosts? Human intruders? Some plot by the new ""help"" to drive Grace mad? Or simply all in Grace's increasingly distracted mind? As such it is often difficult to know whether one is supposed to be frightened or not, and for the most part this film takes on the air of an old-fashioned Gothic mystery, rather than a horror film. But when the plot finally unfolds completely, nearly taking Grace's sanity with it, the audience is treated to a sustained climax of genuine fear that leads to a mind-bending conclusion.",The Others

This is a very good movie and I DID NOT see that climax coming. The best twist ever. Acting is excellent and cinematography is worth a mention.",The Others
494,francois-massarelli,Coming to terms with one's death: Amenabar's the Others,8,28 March 2006,"The third of Amenabar's features is both the most academic and the most intriguing of this trilogy of the macabre. Before next step, the critically-acclaimed Mar Adentro, the three films were a comment about death, in one form or the other. The Others tells of a family, settled in post-war Jersey, consisting of Grace(Nicole Kidman) and her two children. They were abandoned by all: the domestics have gone, the husband went to the war and never came back, and the whole island seems to be deserted, apart from three servants who one day present themselves at the door, and a strange, ghostly presence in the house... Thus taking the shape of a very classic ghost story, with plenty of creepy scenes, based on an interestingly spooky setting, the film is a success thanks to the incredible sense of timing of all concerned, Director-writer-composer Amenabar first of all, since he manages to direct his 7-or-so actors as if they were puppets while allowing them to use their talent in the construction of lovable, believable characters. This last effort is probably the most rewarding of all, since one of the most annoying drawbacks of Amenabar's Open Your Eyes, his previous effort, was the incapacity of both the director and the actor(Eduardo Noriega) to make the character sympathetic, or just nice(the same could be said, however, of Tom Cruise's over-the-top characterization in the remake by Cameron Crowe)... But despite Nicole Kidman's efforts to render Grace neurotic, obsessive, authoritarian and narrow-minded, we still care for her. She has, after all, good reasons to her behavior: her children live, and share with her, an incredible everyday hell, suffering from an incurable disease making them allergic to daylight: this is the source of multiple compulsory tasks: opening doors, closing curtains, lighting candles, that are repeated throughout the film by the main character so as to avoid contact of her children and too much light... No wonder she got to be on the edge. Besides, we learn at one point how mad she got prior to the beginning of the plot, and her killing her children and shooting herself becomes almost understandable. Another important innovation over the previous effort is the confrontation of Kidman with Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs Mills, who steals the show more than once with her mineral presence and her masterful acting that makes her both lovable and mysterious. Add to this the very solid composition by Alakina Mann as Ann, Grace's daughter, and we have a very engaging cast, that contributes significantly to the success of the film. The entire plot revolves around the final discovery that the three characters are ghosts, and the presence they felt in the house(The Others)is that of the living, not of the dead. This idea allows Amenabar to toy with an Innocents-like mood all the way through, going as far as to quote one of the most frightening moments of Clayton's film around the end, when three ghosts approach a window. This shot, by the way, is also reminiscent of a famous sequence in Tod Browning's Mark of the Vampire(1936), thus we can safely think that the young Spanish master knows his history of Creepy Classics... But the most satisfactory aspect of this film, in spite of its very entertaining use of mystery and the author's mastery of direction, writing AND music, making Amenabar the full author of the film, is certainly first the way he deals with his favorite theme, having Grace slowly, but surely dealing with her own death and that of her children and accepting the fact as relief, thus going one step further than Cesar in Open your Eyes; and secondly, of course, the parallel that the viewer can establish between Grace's obsessive Catholicism and Amenabar's identity as a Spanish author, who grew up in an obsessively catholic environment. This can't be a coincidence, and Amenabar's wit(Grace, about the book of the dead: ""How could these people be so superstitious?"")shows he has probably come to terms with what might be part of an identity crisis. Again, the torment of Cesar, in Open..., had him begin to realize he was in such a crisis; so The Others really cleared the way for Almenabar's next step, Mar Adentro, the film that looks death in the eyes.",The Others
495,kitsuyuutsu,Great thriller!,10,26 November 2017,"At first, I wasn't sure about this movie. It seemed odd and I found the ailment of the children a bit ludicrous. Not that people don't suffer from it, but both children having the same rare ailment is a bit far fetched. But if you can look past that and continue watching, you soon get drawn into the story. It seems like your normal, creepy haunted house story, but the more you watch, the more hints that are dropped, you start to wonder if this movie is more than that. What I enjoyed best were the twists that you never see coming. Think ""The Sixth Sense""... If you enjoyed that movie, you'll love this one.

497,mattrett,Like Goobers for your brain: A treat,8,12 August 2001,"I went into this movie hoping for a nice, old-fashioned suspenseful horror movie. I was rewarded with that PLUS some brilliant performances, nervous chuckles and emotional pay-off to boot. I am not a Nicole Kidman fan (especially after MOULIN ROUGE, ugh), but I thought she was sensational in this, or as Tom says, ""Nic is pitch perfect."" She really is, capturing her control-freak, jittery, yet deeply maternal character to a ""T."" With another, less mesmerizing lead performance, the kids would have totally stolen the show. Instead, they just add on to the fun--the little girl is like a BAD SEED aspirant and the boy is adorable. You feel for his terror as he's tortured by his big sis, his controlling mom and the house he lives in. To milk so much psychologically from such a basic premise, the writer/director gets a LOT of credit.",The Others
498,vrillusions,One of the best thrillers in a long time (8/10),8,13 August 2001,"I am usually not that big a fan of scary movies, since they are usually very typical.  People run around, then they all die along the way, until usually one or two people walk away.  This is BY FAR not typical.  But it is typical in psychological thrillers in that most of the film doesn't make sense until the last half hour or 15 minutes.  But the rest of it is amazing.  Although slow at times, its slow in a way that your still interested enough to pay attention.  All the actors were great, and the twists and turns that take place during the course of the movie are amazing.Rating: 8 out of 10 (Worth the prime time theater prices, and will probably buy it when it comes out on DVD)",The Others
499,bacoby13,Classic Ghost Story,10,11 August 2001,"It seems that in a long line of stinkers this summer, there was no hope for any movie to wow us, like 1999's The Sixth Sense, or last year's Gladiator, but this year we have a winner. The Others is a tense, carefully crafted ghost story,similar to the Sixth Sense, but different in so many other ways as well. The slow build up only adds to the suspense, and when finally you get to experience ""the others"" as I guess they are called, the whole audience burst into screams ofpure terror. The dimly lit scenes give you an odd sense, where dark is morecomforting than light (due to a disease that can kill the children if they are exposed to bright light). Nicole Kidman really knows how to act, and she shows it. It wasn't until this year's Moulin Rouge that I realized what an talented person she is, and with two incredible movies in the same year, her career looks to be going up, even without her hubby. This review is sparce, simply because there is too much that could be revealed that shouldn't. The less said is always more for the unsuspecting viewer. Go see this movie for a good scare and a great time. It doesn't disappoint.10/10",The Others
500,bacoby13,Not as familiar as some would think.,10,15 September 2001,"The beautiful thing about this movie is its slow pacing. Most would write it off as boring, but to many, the pacing only adds to the tension. ""The Others"" is a slow-paced thriller that offers some familiar territory, but if one re-examines, realizes the differences are abound.First off, Nicole Kidman's performance is dead-on perfect. She enchants, much in the same way as earlier this year with ""Moulin Rouge"". She is one of the greats as far as actress go, and this movie displays her at her best.The story is confusing, but rightly so. So many unanswered questions that leave you wondering where this movie will go. Although sometimes it is a little obvious, the way they are presented never fails to surprise.
Another bright point of this film is the mood. While most thrillers/horror movies rely on the dark to frighten, this movie uses light. This is due to the conditions of the children, where they are sensitive to light. There are many particularly frightning scenes in which a spot of sunlight sends chills down our spines. The film has a noir-ish look to it, and at some points, almost looks black and white. The twist in the end is what turns most off. But, to those who ponder it, they will walk away satisfied. At first you may think your experiencing deja vu, but relax. Its a lot more clever than you think.  I've never been to a film that had the audience so attached to their seats, screaming and laughing at the same time. This is a rare gem in a particularly drab summer. See for yourself why this movie is so fantastic. 9/10",The Others
501,phantom1515,Better the The Sixth Sense...,10,17 August 2001,"If (when) The Others becomes a fairly popular film, then many comparisons will be made to The Sixth Sense. The only real reason that it would even be compared to The Sixth Sense is the shear fact that The Sixth Sense was the last decent psycologial horror film to come out. The Others is a completley different film, except for the fact that the children can see ghosts (or can they...) The Others, who's only star is Nicole Kidman, is a tense, creepy, and sometimes just damn horrifying, expericence. I wont give away any of the plot, it's too complicated, but I will say that where The Sixth Sense relied on one big twist to pull everything together, The Others has several. The Others is a film that was thought out, well written, and then executed with perfection. In reading other user comments, I have noticed that some didn't like the end twist. I personaly thought it was more cleaver then The Sixth Sense. But that's just my two cents worth.",The Others
502,pheed,"Well executed, but predictable and not scary (SPOILER).",6,22 May 2002,"The Others is a very well executed film.  The script andperformances are near-flawless.  However, the suspense is sodrawn out that it keeps you guessing until you are forced to figureout the big secret.  The clues are too overwhelming and obvious toignore.  My wife and I had figured out the secret before the film washalf over.My other main complaint about this movie pertains to the treatmentof Nicole Kidman's character (SPOILER).  The movie seemed tobe a little overly-sympathetic to an admitted child murderer.  Canyou imagine the reaction if someone made a movie with SusanSmith as the sympathetic heroine?  It would be outrageous.My only other complaint was that it seemed that Nicole Kidman'scharacter had learned nothing from her family tragedy.  Even as aghost she encourages her children in their denial:  ""This house isours.""  Will she ever learn?  Personally, I find her character quiteunsympathetic.",The Others

504,LtCol_Kilgore,"Suspenseful, stylish horror film ***/****",8,26 September 2001,"The others ***/**** ""The Others"" is a suspenseful horror film unlike many these days. Most are concerned with blood and gore, teenage girls getting naked, body count, and not scary. ""The Others"" is atmospheric, spooky, bloodless, and carried by strong acting and fleshed out characters. Yet, it takes too long to make an impact and the final payoff is not as shocking as it should be. The plot is simple and not especially innovative (your average ghost story), but it seems fresh thanks to strong acting and a well-crafted, eerie atmosphere that rivals that of a Tim Burton film. Nicole Kidman is Grace, a beautiful young married mother who must raise her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) alone in their gigantic (actually, ridiculously large) mansion on a British isle, around the end of WWII. They are alone, for the husband and father has been at war and has not returned, and their housekeepers mysteriously vanished. Suddenly, a trio of friendly caretakers arrive one day. Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) is the amiable old lady, Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) is a mute young girl, and Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) is the not-so-social gardener. However, there is a strange, arcane facet to the trio; they have little background and had no way of knowing that Grace was offering positions at her manor. Aside from this, Grace must deal with her children, who have a deadly allergy to light, which means that the house must be dark all the time, allowing for a spooky dark, shadowy ambience. Anna and Nicholas, most importantly, have been visited - by a family of ghosts. Noises - crying, piano music, and running - have been heard. And curtains that stop light from entering the house are opening and closing by themselves. The film is based around Grace's efforts to solve the enigma.I love the atmosphere of ""The Others,"" set in a nostalgic and ominous 1940's estate. Snowy mist blankets the grass and crisp fall leaves. Murky waters of a lake border the chateau. Elegant furniture, polished marble and wood floors, neatly-woven blankets, tautly fabricated furnishings of wood and olive green cloth, coal black German sedans, lightly wrinkled sweaters and jackets are all seemingly authentic from the era. One spectacular and tense scene has Grace haplessly stumbling through an impenetrably thick ocean of milky fog that weaves through overhanging trees and a ground of crunchy bronze and russet leaves.The action takes a while to get started up, which is a major negative. This is due to the director, Amenabar, spending time to develop an involving plot, 3-D characters, and the aforementioned décor. While Amenabar succeeds in those respects, we find ourselves wishing something would happen. Many people will easily become bored, feel tempted to sleep or leave, etc., but I, while not exactly enthralled by that point in the film, was still enjoying it.When we finally are treated to doses of suspense and chills (not so much horror and terror), it is satisfying. You most likely will find yourself on the edge of your seat or huddled in a ball anxiously awaiting the potentially fatal results of Grace's investigation. This is not so much because you care about her character, but really because you expect a sudden scream and heart-stopping outburst of maniacal ghosts. Most scenes are chilling, including the door shutting in the piano room, the old lady in the white dress, and the final chaotic conclusion. However, I can not say that I was truly horrified and paranoid from this film, unlike ""The Sixth Sense,"" where I was freaked out for months. I was still very entertained.I must commend all the actors in the film, especially Nicole Kidman. The acting was down to earth and realistic, despite Nicole Kidman forced into saying some foolish lines (""Something.. Diabolical!). The two child actors, Mann and Bentley, were excellent in a fairly difficult role for children. Another important downside to the film was the ""shocking"" conclusion. While I must admit that I found it brilliant, it lacked the powerful punch I wish it had. I don't know why this is, it just isn't. I am disappointed at how much potential the ending could have packed and how little it did. Overall, I found ""The Others"" a highly entertaining thriller with magnetic milieus and plenty of startles.",The Others

Very few ghost stories have ever been able to obtain such an amazing level of horror and at the same time maintain its dignity.It's very refreshing to see a ghost movie that does not rely on computer effects and cheap, make-you-jump-out-of-your-seat moments of shock (but don't fret, you WILL jump out of your seat more than once).  It achieves its horror through subtle lighting and sound effects, something that's virtually impossible to find in most modern-day horror movies.It starts off a little slow, but quickly grabs you attention and doesn't let go until the end.

As such, the quality of shocks and tension on offer has similarities with the original version of 'The Haunting' (rather than the inferior Catherine Zeta Jones remake.)Nicole Kidman is Grace who lives in a mansion in the middle of now where with her two children who suffer from a rare photosensitive skin allergy which means the house has to be kept in near darkness most of the time. When three new servants appear out of the fog one day saying they have answered an advertisement. But did they?  Things take a turn for the weird when one of the children starts seeing ghostly figures in the house, doors close on their own and pianos start playing themselves.The tension is cranked up slowly and the fact that this is a house where the curtains are closed all the time adds to the atmosphere.

Well, mine will go down in infamy.""The Others"" certainly gives proof to the fact that a film does not have to contain sharp weapons of any description, heavy breathing, or copious amounts of blood to scare the wits out of a person. This film definitely played on your subconscious, rather than conscious state of mind. But it was more than that...after all ""The Blair Witch Project"" was said to do the same, and to compare the two would not be dissimilar to a comparison made between double oscar winning Tom Hanks, and Tom ""Well, I played the back-end of a horse in my high school pantomime"" Joe Public. I can safely say that alongside ""Scary Movie"", ""The Blair Witch Project"" has got to be one of the most overrated, tedious pile of crap I have ever had to waste 2 hours of my life watching.""The Others"" is in an entirely different class.

The fact that the children suffer from a skin disease that prohibits them from strong light exposure darkens the essence of the film.That film carries a flaw though. For those of you who have seen The Changeling, you will probably find the séance in both films are quite alike. The catch is The Changeling was released sometime around 1979 - 1980.

It spends the entire movie with a setup for a ""surprise"" ending (which is not very surprising). Without the ending, the movie just states facts about its characters and the situations they are in (not what they are doing).This would have been better suited for a short (like a TALES FROM THE CRYPT type story). Stretched over the course of 2 hours, it is very thin. There are also some ""plot holes"" which took of a point for me.

And to an extent, this movie delivers.However, the premise is let down by terrible acting (especially the children), and a script that seems to be setting you up for a surprise ending which never arrives.  It contains many of what I thought were red herrings, leading you away from its true finale, but they were simply pointers to where the movie was taking you.Another recent movie to do this was The Sixth Sense.  Where that movie differs was the fact even if you did guess the ending, the characters, acting and story were all top notch, so the entire movie didn't just rely on one twist.And the worst crime of all for a horror movie:  the characters were all so unlikeable and annoying that you really did want to see them suffer.  You can't be scared for someone if you don't identify with them.This sort of movie has been done a number of times, and usually with more success.

It is chilling, well written, great performances, excellent photography and above all great story! I just saw this movie yesterday and i'm still  thinking about the ending, you just can't imagine the end of the story, i was really impressed by it! i think Alejandro Amenábar scored big with this one, all i have to say is go and see it, if you haven't you won't regret it! especially if you're fan of the genre.",The Others

Still great to watch in a crowded theatre though!",The Others
525,antra_chief,A great horror movie,9,6 September 2006,"This movie surprised me a lot along with The Sixth Sense as their twists are rather similar to each other. What I liked about this movie is that it does not rely on blood, gore and explicit violence that most horror movies today show us as an attempt to frighten the hearts of us viewers. Instead most of the frights comes from the eerie atmosphere of the setting and scenario. Most of the time the film is shot quietly which some viewers might find boring but this only adds to the suspense and tension if continued watching. The director was able to include the most basic and necessary methods of a standard classic horror movie to ensure a frightening sensation. Such method includes the use of creepy sound effects. When I say this I mean footsteps being heard, floorboards creaking, voices of little children echoing down the hallway, heavy breathing sound etc. The film is mainly shot with the curtains drawn as well. This is because Grace's children suffer from a disease which does not allow them to stay in front of the sun for too long otherwise they will shrivel up and die. This is a great excuse for having dark settings most of the time and it provides a great deal of tension. If you look at the house from the outside, you would think that this family is non existence. I particularly like how Grace's personality is portrayed. Nicole Kidman did a very good job at being the strict and over protective mother who follows and impose certain rules around the house. For example closing and locking every door behind them. Grace is very strict about this particular rule and its frightening, as the viewer to see her being very sensitive about it and it makes you feel the same shock and insecurity as she feels when a door is left open.Also the arrival of the 3 servants serves a purpose in creating tension as well. These 3 strange servants which one of them includes Mrs. Bertha Mills played brilliantly by Fionnula Flanagan makes us doubt their existence and that they have something to do with the 'intruders'. Set during the WW2 period its to no one surprise to see Grace being paranoid at thinking that there is a German soldier in the house. Mrs. Bertha Mills constantly tries to reassure Grace that there are nobody else other than themselves in the house. She gives the impression that she is a loyal harmless servant which everybody buys until the point where she and Mr. Tuttle end up covering the gravestones. She plays a frightening character indeed and this what makes it more intense and scary.The use of camera angles is well placed showing the pivotal angles of a scene. The angles which some would say shows off the most intense and frightening aspect of that scene. The close up shot of the door knob, the low down angle of the staircase all adds to the tension and suspense. The use of lighting also plays a vital role as the whole film is set around dark areas of the mansion. Since they don't have electricity they resort to using candles and oil lamps. The flicker of the flame casting shadows around the house actually provides a great deal of tension. Its almost as if these moving shadows are representing the 'others'. Overall this is a great horror movie, even today it still stands out as one of the best. Its far better than recent horror releases because it actually provides you with frights and scares rather than the usual gross out sickening and disgusted look when you see a man's arm being chopped off or an eye ball being cut off. This film does not need any of those disturbing scenes to create a frightening sensation. It prefers to use old classical methods in creating tension and this is something which Alfred Hitchcock might be proud of. Top marks for Nicole Kidman in her portrayal of Grace but the star of the show to me really goes to Fionnula Flanagan.",The Others
526,FightingIrish,Intense chills and an interesting ending...,7,20 September 2001,"""The Others"" Review:
    Pros- A very scary and mostly fun thrill ride through a haunted house. Decent performances, by a good cast; and an interesting, somewhat original story-line help the movie. The ending is also very creative.    Cons- Some performances are weak. The story is VERY complicated and confusing at brief points. A little disturbing in some areas. The setting is god-awful, which really makes the stroy less interesting.    Bottom Line- A fairly good horror film with a decent cast and some spine-tingling sequences. You should, however, probably rent it, rather than see it in theaters.
    My score(0-10): 7",The Others
527,Punky Monkey,Can so many people be so sheltered?,2,12 January 2005,"I'm astounded by the hype.When The Others was first released on these shores, people were talking about it as if it represented a groundbreaking new genre. It was as if the critics had never seen a haunted house movie before - and despite the glowing recommendations and boundless praise, the 'highlights' that got screened on TV to promote the movie seemed cheap, obvious and just plain silly.So, in light of all the hype, I avoided the movie until it was screened on TV this evening.What a load of cobblers.For a start, The Others isn't creepy in the slightest. Robert Wise's original version of The Haunting was creepy. And some of the scenes in Peter Medak's The Changeling were unsettling in the extreme. The Uninvited got it right as far back as 1944, and yet The Others succeeds in doing little more than rattling chains and shouting BOO! Perhaps part of the problem is the lack of subtlety - I got the whole story at the end of the séance sequence. It said all that needed saying. But just in case you weren't paying attention we're treated to a painfully contrived monologue that renders many of the most effective sequences utterly redundant. It's this lack of regard for the viewer's intelligence that ultimately lets the movie down, as it degenerates into cheap cliché rather than genuine chills.Or maybe the problem is its lack of originality. I love horror movies. In particular, I love the really scary ones - which are usually very different to the really gory ones. In watching The Others, it seemed as if Amenábar were simply making a list of 'things a ghost story should have'. At times, I felt like I were being treated to selected scenes from The Haunting or The Changeling, but without the tension or elegance of either.And - spoilers ahoy - the moment I saw Eric Sykes cover those gravestone, I saw the ending coming a mile off. But let's not have any more comparisons with the Sixth Sense, as we'd already seen the same shock ending in movies like Dead and Buried or Blade Runner - and I'm sure they weren't the first to do it either.In all, The Others proved to be as engaging, frightening and unsettling as Jan De Bont's laughable remake of The Haunting.If you've never seen a haunted house movie before, please have fun and enjoy The Others. If, like me, you've been spoiled by all the really great stuff that came before, and genuinely enjoy a good cinematic scare, give it a very wide berth. Check out The Devil's Backbone instead - it's pure undiluted terror by comparison.",The Others
528,ectoplasmicspace,Classic Ghost Story,10,13 August 2001,"I was really waiting for a good ""horror"" film to come out, because I don't think I've seen a good one since the 80's (and even that's questionable.) It seems every attempt at the ""horror"" genre has been plagued with its slew on teenage fodder who scream & yell and are snuffed off, one by one. Well... the only entertainment value in that is seeing these useless snots being mutilated in various ways... but it's fake... so who cares... they just bought a new car with the profit!So that brings me to my thoughts on ""The Others.""This was FABULOUS! I haven't seen anything this classy in the ""horror"" genre since Alfred Hitchcock was still making films! No blood, no gore, pure suspense... classic ghost story... and unique! Perfect twist in the end... I felt it had the same kind of ""twist"" that ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Stir of Echoes"", & ""Unbreakable"" all had in common... one that throws you a total curveball. Thats the way a horror film should be! Suspenseful, & mindblowing in the end. It doesnt have to be gory... if its gory... its not scary... if it stirs up your senses, and you get edgey... and you get embroiled in theplot... and the slighest noise makes you jump... THAT'S HORROR! That's what ""The Others"" did.I'm not even gonna say what happened... I dont want to spoil it... just go see it!This was by far the best film I ever seen Nicole Kidman in (of course I have yet to see Moulin Rouge!)  10/10!",The Others

533,keyser_soze4321,A Masterpiece of Film Making. Well Written & Brilliantly Acted.,10,19 July 2002,"Alejandro Amenabar (writer,director) has used all the appropriate elements (light & dark, Noise & silence, action & reaction) as tools to create a masterpiece of film making. Using an Old English Mansion as the back drop to a ghost story maybe cliche'd, but it's meant to. This movie, like all great thrillers, works on our assumptions. And this is a great super-natural thriller. Amenabar's story is pure genius. It has been compared to the 1995 title 'Haunted' directed by Lewis Gilbert and starring Aidan Quinn. It has also been compared to M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' starring Bruce Willis. In my opinion 'The Others' makes the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense' look Second Rate. The story, the directing, and the acting is far superior. Kidman is brilliant as the lead (In my opinion her best performance). And she is well supported by Flanigan, Sykes & Eccleston. The children are played by Mann and Bentley and are quite remarkable. Especially Mann, who is going to be an absolute star (even bigger than Haley Joel). This Movie is an all-time classic. It deserved higher praise from the critics. If you enjoy quality film making you will like 'The Others'. Quite simply it leaves THE OTHER movies in this genre looking amateurish. Check it out.",The Others

I'm not a critic...and just can't put my finger on what I found wrong...but when the movie was over, I wondered ""What was everyone so excited about?""To its credit, there was one scene in ""The Others"" that literally made me jump and a chill go down my spine that has rarely happened when watching a film.

536,Kyle007,"What a twist!!! Scary to the last moments, specially at the last moments",9,11 March 2005,"First of all, i have to say that this year (2001) is the one that established Nicole Kidman as a superstar, she was an ""A"" actress, but here she became ""A+"", first and mainly with Moulin Rouge and then with this superb movie, i have to say that i saw a few people who gave this great movie a 10, i rate it with a 10 only because there is nothing higher, but i'm sure it deserves a lot of credit.And i have also seen many people complaining of the ""borrowed storyline"" (Comparing ""the others"" with ""Sixth sense""), bah they touch the same topic of life (and death actually), but this one has a more religious view, and makes you think a lot about that.Nicole did a great job in this movie, nobody can't deny it, her role as a lovely but at moments almost gone crazy mother of 2 was a dualistic and strange thing that fitted perfectly well in the story. All the supporting actors did a great performance as well.The plot, the plot, i think it couldn't have been better, i don't want to tell you anything about it, so you can have the surprise i had when i first saw it, but the best of all is that you are almost as surprised the first time you see it than the second, and the third, and the fourth...... You just want to see it again, because you experience a feeling that only a few, but a few few movies give you; a strong chill crosses your whole body, it is fear, but you like it anyway, it is a fear that awakes curiosity, curiosity for what is happening next...And what a spectacular, but necessary addition is the environment of the movie: an old mansion at the times of War world II, permanent darkness and haze, dead-like servants, photosensitive children so that the house had to be kept in an absolute darkness, no electric light........could it be more scary?? I don't think so.And by the way, this is a proof that a movie doesn't need amazing special effects, even more, i think this movie doesn't even have special effects, it is all in the way the story is told, nothing more....and nothing less, something that seems to be hard these days.........But i'll stop talking, if you are reading my comment, just stop and go to your nearer video shop and buy it, or rent it at least..........you won't be disappointed..............believe me.",The Others

Interesting to write down now how I feel about it from memory and see if I still have that opinion after re-watching it.When I watched it, it was very late at night. I only had some candles burning in my living room and a mug of hot chocolate. Usually I love that atmosphere, it's cozy. Not while watching this movie though. Suddenly the living room seemed too dark and eerie in the candle light. Eventually I had to pause the movie and run to the switch to turn the lights on. Only then did I manage to finish watching this movie. And I'm no easily scared by horror movies, I've seen too many of those. I did not guess the twist in the end. The story telling was amazing and Kidman a surprise in a movie like this, but she was great, as were all actors and actresses.

If we do, we will not have problems with the scene in which the ape and human kiss...But The Others succeeds in putting us in a context that we can hardly comprehend.  Not do we go through the experience of the others, we also come to understand psychologically about Nicole's character before all these things happened -- again the others.

540,synefra,A truly worthy tale of suspense and intrigue,10,9 October 2001,"I walked into The Others not expecting much. Most 'ghost stories' today are just bloody messes with no real plot, nothing to keep you interested. I constantly find myself looking around the theater to see if anyone else is as bored or disgusted as I am. Not The Others. First let me say, I am a huge fan of literary ghost stories, well done, frightening tales that don't use blood or gore or any other media than written word and your own imagination to scare you. I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was amazing, the plot very well thought out, and remained true to what I consider real Suspense. This film proves you don't have to be a bloody gore-fest or a plot-less, mindless killer-kills-all-girl's-friends-in-really-bloody-ways-for-no-real-reason. No suspense, no intrigue, no thought needed the only thing that scares people in those films is the gore, not the story. The Others really takes you into it, I forgot completely I was in a cinema, and was completely engrossed. Having read, as I said, a great many 'suspense/horror' novels I kept mentally trying to see where the story would go, but while I did guess a few things, I could not guess it all and was thrilled beyond words by the cleverness of the tale by the end. I was truly held in thrall every moment waiting to see what would happen next and was blissful with the style it was carried out in when I left the theater. I cant say enough good about this movie. Nicole Kidman (who I thought was amazing in Malice and Moulin Rouge, and Far and Away) really astounded me. Her performance was stupendous. I dislike Tom Cruise as an actor and a person, and I don't want to give him any credit for this fantastic tale, especially since he was just one of 9 producers and they really don't do much but pony up some cash, so give the credit where it is due, the actors (especially Ms Kidman), and the writer and director, Alejandro Amenábar.

But in hindsight, I always like being entertained first. Thus in this movie I found my 'figuring out'what was going on, changing several times through out the movie. With an Oh! and a smile. That's the well-craftedness of the movie. Along with thoughtfulness, I was both touched and entertained by how the writers put it together.I say it does no service to read in detail what the movie is about, for it would take away from the entertainment. I will say that it would not take away to say that the movie at first gives no evidence that it is a ghost story, evidence more at first is like that it is a psychological thriller.The people who made this movie did it much justice.

If there is one fault, it is the part half way through when Christopher Eccleston appears as Kidmans husband.

The rest of the cast did a great supporting job, adding greatly to the intensity of this story.I really liked the way the story slowly unraveled, it did not feel rushed and events seemed to happen very naturally.  I found myself easily getting into the rhythm of this movie and was never bored even though there is very little real action.The only complaints I have deal with two specific scenes, the first is when the caretakers see Nicole K's character go off towards town.  Instead of them speaking I would like to have seen the old lady just point at the headstone.  The other is when the caretakers are in their attic room talking; again I would have preferred silence or just to cut the scene.  In both cases I felt that less would have been more.  Otherwise, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys well written, directed and acted suspense thrillers.-Thanks",The Others
554,tj_carlsson,"I'm not fan of horror movies, but this was great",8,26 February 2005,"I reluctantly sat down last night and watched this movie. I'm no fan of horror movie, since it's mostly stuff like ""boo!"" and the only purpose is to make you jump, but this film is different. It's subtle and it builds up the tension all the way to the surprising ending. There's hardly any special effects and the film relies a lot on the actors, whom all are excellent (especially Kidman and the children). This movie is made in a simple way, but it's so much better and effective then the big budget, CGI filled ones.A break down of the plot then: A women (Kidman) lives alone with her two children on the Channel Islands just after World War II. Her two children are allergic to strong light which means that the house must be in semi darkness all the time. When three new servants arrive, strange stuff starts to happen.Great, absolutely great. This movie feels so realistic. I highly recommend it for someone that wants to see a smart, well done, well written, effective horror movie8/10",The Others
555,NancyLarned,GOOD movie!,9,20 December 2008,"The Others is one of two films I've seen in the past year that actually made me afraid to fall asleep. The film is a stylish thriller/horror with a well developed dramatic back story that is actually very powerful. One of the great things about this film is its lack of effects. Much like The Changeling (1980), it delivers subtle chills without using a drop of blood. The writer backed it up with a mysterious and sad story about the family, and he spends much of the movie developing this - making the ghostly moments all the more frightening.This film is proof that the film-making industry still makes subtle horror movies without blood, gore, teenagers getting mutilated, and without sex! Let us hope more films like this can be made.9/10",The Others

House servants are eerily the best. You never know what to expect and as a result you never quite how to react to what you hear and (think) you see. WOW! This is Sixth Sense in retro. See it again to appreciate what the screenwriter and director are trying to say. As for Nicole, the kids, servants and her husband...they did their part...you just might not get it the first time!

I knew I had wasted my money when I had everything figured out after 15 minutes or so.  This film was so drawn out for nothing that I actually slept through parts of it, and yet, I didn't miss a thing.  The dialogue was irritating, the plot was poor and overall (spoiler coming up)this film appeared to me as a ripoff of a recent thriller with Bruce Willis.  It's been a long time since I went and saw a horror/thriller and heard nothing in the theater (i.e.  gasps, screams, etc...).  I think it was due to the fact that I was sleeping, as were the others.Wait for the television premiere of this one.  It isn't even worth the $4.00 to rent it.",The Others

560,gkleinman,A Unique Ghost Story,6,26 July 2001,"The Others isn't your typical ghost story; there isn't the quantity of jump-out-of-your-seat thrills you'd expect to find in a film like this. In fact, The Others is virtually chill-free for the first hour. But what The Others lacks in quantity, it makes up in quality. Instead of a roller coaster of cheap chills and thrills, The Others takes a much denser and darker approach to the ghost story.The Others takes a considerable amount of time to set everything up - almost too much. Halfway through the movie I wondered if there was going to be a pay off. Ultimately there is quite a pay off, but it takes so long to get there you might not feel it's 'worth it'. Despite the fact that I found The Others to be quite slow, I did enjoy it. Nicole Kidman does a great job as the neurotic and tortured lead, and she's backed up by a strong supporting cast. Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar lights almost the entire movie by candle light, something I haven't seen since Barry Lyndon. This gives The Others a soft and warm look that is uncommon to the genre. Amenabar also makes light a character in the film, where daylight becomes much scarier than the warmth and comfort of the dark. If you're planning on seeing The Others, I'd advise you to avoid reading any reviews which talk about the plot. The film takes a number of twists and turns which can easily be spoiled. This might be a good film to wait for DVD, except for the risk of the plot getting spoiled before you get a chance to see it.",The Others
561,adrian-77,A very special movies,10,13 November 2001,"Although""The Sixth Sense"" was a very good movie, the histrionics it generated were largely due to the performance of the child actor, and the supposedly unguessable twist. ""The Others"" has two marvellous child performances, two hammer-blow twists and Nicole Kidman in a display that is in my opinion, the best by an actress since Frances McDormand's Oscar in 'Fargo'. And yet it is not as if the film needs such a performance to carry it. Everything, from the lighting, to the fluidity of the camera, and the mesmerising music, knits perfectly to a truly magnificent whole. I hope it gets the credit it deserves come oscar nomination time. The first real must-see film of the year.",The Others
562,kalisa2001,A Classic Haunted House story,10,15 August 2001,"I found it to be a fascinating and eerie haunted house story that actually made me afraid to sleep with the lights off for a night or two.  The only other movies that ever accomplished that were Poltergeist and The Changeling.  The more common teen slasher horror movies aren't all that scary or interesting to me.  I do so hope that this movie does well enough at the box office, so that fans will be able to see more diversity in the horror movie genre in upcoming years.  I honestly didn't see the ending as being cliche, as others have noted.  Instead, I found it rather original in a roundabout way.  The Others is still quite different from the movie that it is often compared to.",The Others

Amenabar created such an eerie, scary setting, the movie just looks so wonderful.  The twist is effective and thoughtful causing you to rethink the movie.  The movie reminds me of good old ghost stories like The Haunting (the original that is) relying on an effective story and great performances rather than special effects to create scares.",The Others
565,DrKnow,It could have been so good,7,26 September 2001,"Nicole Kidman stars as a single mother of two, left alone in a large mansion as her husband goes off to war.  Their home is completely isolated and it is constantly smothered in fog.  To make matters worse, their home has no electricity, and her children are deathly allergic to sunlight.  In the first five minutes, this movie had all its ducks in a row, to create a chilling thriller.  It could have been so good, but writer/director Alejandro Amenabar failed to turn this wonderfully eerie setting into a scary movie.  It was like the haunted house that looks creepy and scary from the outside, but has nothing frightening once you get inside.Early on in the movie three strangers approach the house seeking work. Grace(Kidman) welcomes them in to work, commenting that her previous staff had recently disappeared.  Immediately we are aware that there is more to these three than we are being told. Grace's daughter Anne has seen people in her house that nobody else can see. Are there ghosts?  Or does an simply have an active childish imagination? The remainder of the movie seeks to answer these questions, with Kidman's character seeming to lose more and more of her sanity along the way.There are a few very excellent qualities about this movie, the first being the previously addressed setting.  Also there are very strong performances throughout this movie, which is extremely important sice the movie revolves around a very small cast.  Firstly, I am not normally a Nicole Kidman fan, and so to say that she was fine, is to say that she did not annoy me.  That is quite a compliment in itself.  Secondly, her children are wonderful. Particularly Alakina Mann in the role of Kidman's young daughter.  There were scenes between her and Kidman that I thought that she completely stole. Finally, Fionnula Flanagan as the elderly maid Mrs. Mills held this movie together.  Every time I got bored and disinterested, she would come on the screen and renew my interest.  I know that these are not familiar actors, but they were wonderful with what they had.  The problem was that they had very little.  This movie plods along with nothing really happening.The one other very strong quality this movie offers, is the final ten minutes.  These final minutes are wonderful and priceless.  I only wish that all of the writing leading up to it had been as interesting.  Unfortunately I can not recommend sitting bored for 120 minutes, only to enjoy 10 of them. If that ratio is fine with you, then enjoy those last ten minutes.Ultimately this is a movie with much promise, much potential, but sadly lacking in substance.  Thrillers must either create tension, or scares, and there are too few of either one for me to recommend this movie.  Wait until it's out on video and then you can fast forward as necessary.

It starts so slowly and harmlessly, although with this mysterious atmosphere that keeps you watching like in hypnosis. Then you begin to realize things and you start thinking about what could be wrong in the house. You start to suspect things and several theories start evolving within your mind. But whenever you think you've almost figured it out, something happens that makes you chase another even more horrible theory. And in the last 15 minutes of the movie when the horrible truth is revealed, you lose your breath about how brilliant this movie really is. Although there are almost no special effects in this movie, the atmosphere together with the superb actors (especially the two children and Nicole Kidman herself) and the brilliant storyline make this one a real treat.

571,Bergmaniac,"Boring, slow and overrated",4,17 May 2004,"Why this movie is rated so high on this site will remain one of the misteries of the Universe to me. The only reason I can think of is because of the people's obssession with the twists at the end. But even so, the ending of this movie is not that good either. But even if it was excellent, it still couldn't have been able to make up for the boring hour and twenty minutes before that. Possible SPOILERS:I would also have to make the comparison with ""The Sixth Sense"" which had very similar plot twist and story. But the difference is that ""The sixth Sense "" was still interesting and engrossing movie even though I knew the ending before i started watching it(a stupid newspaper review spoiled it for me). It had characters who were very well developed, smart dialogue, great acting, superb directing. All those those things were sorely missing in ""The others"". And for me, ""The others"" had a lot more plotholes. I figured out most of the famous twist about 15 minutes into the movie, although it took me much longer to guess the other part, and it still surprised me a little bit in some details. But really it's not that good and when you think more about it, doesn't really make sense. END SPOILERS Leaving the twist aside, it should also be said that for supposedly horror movie this one wasn't scary at all for me. It had all the classic elements(the haunted house, ghosts, the constant fog, the suddenly booming music) but couldn't make it work. The  mediocre camera work also didn't help. The only times I got scared a little bit was because of the sudden sound ""explosion"", which combined with the constant whispering in the dialogue created some scary, but in the most boring and non-creative way, moments. I don't like being scared by such cheap tricks, and it was more of a surprise than a real scare. The acting wasn't that good too. I love Nicole Kidman, she's a great actress which gave some stunning performances in ""The hours"", ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Dogville"", but here she's far from her best, whispering and shouting all the time, looking too rigid and wooden and didn't gave me the impression of being really scared when she was supposed to be(you can hardly blame her for the last bit though, those ""scary"" scenes were pretty lame). The children were good, but nothing special. I must say that this film was moving extremely slowly, even though it's only an hour and a half long. Too many repetitive scenes, too much repetitive dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, this movie had one of the worst I have seen of late. One example of that is the fact how many times the characters said to each other ""Stop breathing"" or ""Don't Breathe"". Overall, a big disappointment for me. 4/10",The Others
572,Henbaine,Brilliant!,9,11 May 2013,"I love this film, have watched it so many times and never tire of it. A couple of things do annoy me slightly like some of the plot is just spelt out too obviously but apart from that I really cannot find fault.The acting is very good, even the children - especially Anne are exceptional. The constant low lighting and over panning really help the over all eerie feel and sense of the severity and urgency regarding the children's ""condition. It also gives a very claustrophobic feel to the point where you can see how much the lifestyle would drain anyone to the point of distraction. And I genuinely felt for the characters in this one, many emotions portrayed very well. ""The twist is fantastic and you really do not see it coming till the end unlike many films that have tried to re create this since.

573,daykaseya,Wicked storyline,8,25 October 2011,"There aren't many negatives to ""The Others"" especially in terms of plot development, imagery, and acting/casting. The only thing I can say is that if you are a huge blood/gore horror movie fan, bypass this one. If you like eerie atmospheres and spooky ambiance, you'll be pleased with ""The Others"". Nicole Kidman plays overbearing and religious mother, Grace Stewart to perfection. She's obviously overprotective, due to her two children's medical condition: xeroderma pigmentosum, or a sensitivity to sunlight. The two children, Anne and Nicholas are delightfully frightening in their own right. Grace's husband has left to fight in WWII, leaving the family alone in a large, and apparently haunted, house. Grace is alone with three, also frightening, housekeepers. She is overbearing, and her rules are extensive which leads to tension between Grace and all of the other characters in the film.As Grace becomes more and more aware that there is a presence (or several) in the house, thanks largely in part to her daughter, her behavior becomes more and more erratic. ""The Others"" is full of delightful plot twists, and the children themselves are so hauntingly accurate in their portrayals of light and socially deprived children that the blood and gore so common in today's horror cinema is not missed. The film picked up in the last half, which is when I caught on to several of the subtle hints that lead you to a not-so-obvious conclusion. Even though I swore I had the entire plot figured out, I was still delightfully shocked by some aspects of the ending. Viewers will be satisfied, I'm sure, and horror fanatics will be delighted by a film that strays from the norm of the genre. Easily an 8/10, which is only because of the rather slow-moving beginning. Happy haunting!",The Others

Another thing that bugged me was Nicole Kidman, I have nothing against her, as I think she is a top draw actress, BUT in the scenes with Chris Eccelston (and why he is not a star I'll never know) Mr Eccelston dominates the screen when he is on. Eccelston made this more interesting for me to watch, and it's a shame he was not in more often.The whole film looks like it has been copied from 6th Sense (which is a much better film), but the people who made it, and made little changes in it, and marketed it to make it look a new idea.",The Others

The Others seems to repeat the same scene over and over for the entire first half of the movie. I started to get bored with the whole idea, hoping for something, anything to happen.

580,Jaime_Fernandez,Amenábar is the copy-paste master,2,10 September 2001,"We can begin with the best thing in The Others: Kidman, no doubt.And the film itself is not a bad movie, but something worse. You can wonder what's worse than a bad movie? The answer is a non-original movie. And talking about Alejandro Amenábar a non-original movie is something really serious, because this boy has no one single original idea in his brains.I mean, everything in his movies is copied from another film. In this case, even the idea and the lights are copied from another movies and not only the images, so this is something incredible. People who doesn't know much about cinema (or that are too young to have seen much movies) can see an obvious linking between The Others and The Sixth Sense (Night M. Shyamalan, 1999), but that is just one of the multiple copies of this film. And I write copies and not references or tributes, because I truly believe that Amenábar is a master in the copy-paste style. When you pay attention to The Others you can see images from The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973), Room at the top (Jack Clayton, 1959), The Haunting (Robert Wise, 1963), The Changeling (Peter Medak, 1980), La Chute de la Maison Usher (Jean Epstein, 1928), The Shining (Stanley Kubrick, 1980), Barry Lyndon (Stanley Kubrick, 1975, here the use of lights), and many others, including also Luis Buñuel (Viridiana, 1961) or Federico Fellini (Amarcord, 1974). So, there is an absolute lack of new ideas in this movie, what is an incredible pity, but a cruel reality. So, why much people love Amenábar? Well, it's really easy. When you are young you have no idea about what is already filmed. So you can create something incredible out of modern style just going to your videoclub and copying every single scene you love. But there is also another question more difficult to answer? Why do experts love this movie? OK, there are different possible answers. First, they are also too young and they have to learn much more. Second, they are Amenábar's friends (in Spain there are a lot of them, but even here there are some critics that have seen much copies in this movie than in any other filmed by the director). Third, they are in love with Nicole Kidman (and that's really normal). Fourth, they haven't seen the movie (this is not so impossible. I am a journalist and I know people who do it). Fifth, a mystery I don't understand. Summing up, Alejandro Amenábar is not a genius neither a clever  director. He is just a lucky boy who knows the best way to make a movie without wasting a single minute of thinking: to copy. And in that he is really a master, or at least, one of the best plagiarists of the world. Congratulations for that.",The Others

It's beautifully crafted, with excellent acting from the entire cast - especially Nicole Kidman, who should have received (at least!) a nomination for an Oscar for this role. I liked the fact that nothing is thrown in your face, that the tension builds gradually and that the story is very strong. Everything adds up just right, nothing is left to chance. The cinematography means a lot in this movie, but no detail is left at chance, from the beginning to the end. Maximum points for this movie, and I recommend it to everyone.",The Others
583,Manuel-30,The best movie I've seen this year,10,8 November 2001,"""The Others"" is, by far, the best movie I've seen this year, and I haven't seen a lot of good movies this year. ""Traffic"" was awesome, ""Pearl Harbor"" was good... but ""The Others"" is the best. I usually go to the movies with my mind packed with everything about the movie I'm about to see. But this didn't happen to me with ""The Others"". I didn't even know who was in it!!! A friend told me: ""It seems to be nice, Nicole Kidman is in it"". Well, I gave it a try, and I thank my friend for the tip. It scared me since the very beginning (you'll know why), it captured my attention since the first minute and it didn't let me go. It doesn't, actually. It's still stuck in my head. By the way, I've seen it twice.I'm not telling what the movie is about, you can find that in the plot summary link. I'm just telling you my comments about it, and my comment is, as I said it earlier, you should give it a try. Don't go to see it with the idea of watching ""The Sixth Sense Part II"", both movies are different. Don't go with the idea of trying to discover how it's going to end (to my point of view, you'll never find it out). Just go with the idea of getting into it, feel the atmosphere and have a great time. The spooky elements (it's not predictable as you may think), the great acting (the kids and the housemaid are superb in their acting, Oscar material, definitely), a great direction, a smooth photography and the ending sequence (which left all the audience shut) will do the rest. Go see it twice.",The Others

It has a great story that is presented perfectly and keeps you guessing what's going to happen next. I know that everyone is comparing this movie to The Sixth Sense, which is unfair in a way, as this movie deserves to be looked at for what it is, a great flick. One thing that it does have in common with the sixth sense is that there are enough story elements and clues that lead you to the big ending, and when you watch the movie a second time, all of the dialog and actions take on a whole new meaning and it's like watching a totally different movie. This is definately a movie you shouldn't miss, go see it before you have the story blown for you.",The Others

This movie is, thankfully, short on special effects and long on atmoshpere and mood. The setting, an old house in 1940s Jersey, is inspired (no Americans, thats not near Trenton)! The acting is first rate and the English kids are much less ""cutie pie"" than their American equivilants, which is a real bonus. This is a genuinely scary film, but not for those who enjoyed ""Scooby Doo- The movie""",The Others
586,nchng,This film is testament to the power of dramatic tension in horror,9,7 September 2001,"Only once in a very long while does an excellent horror flick happen to be playing in that cinema that you swore was offering a horror flick when you paid that ticket price.  More often that not, what you are offered is a special-effecstravagansa that's like that cold spaghetti you stuck your hand into at the carnival when you were a kid.  It's sensuous, definitely horrible, but not really all that scary.Then again, once in a while, someone like Amenabar demonstrates what we all knew as kids: Nothing bites in the dark like your own imagination!  The atmosphere of ""The Others"" is, as you might expect, dark and cold, set upon the classic Lovecraftian tale of a tragically broken family trying to live in the past.  The tone of the movie is established *very* quickly (there is no time wasted!) but allowed to mature more slowly as bit by bit we discover more about Grace, her family, and the mysterious servants.  The tension rises slowly; ""The Others"" teases you with whispers and creaking doors, relying on the marvelous use of consecutively dark and bright rooms to generate a kind of confusion between the reality and nightmare that permeate the house. 
Don't worry though, when ""The Others"" wants you to jump, you'll jump.  My housemate was airborne, while I'd much more sensibly taken cover behind the seat in front of me.  I haven't done that since my Dad took me to see ""Misery"" when I was twelve!  The beauty is that it isn't usually the events themselves that are scary; Chainsaws, Baseball bats, and/or men hanging from the ceiling are notably absent.  When you walk out of the theatre, you're not talking about inconsistencies, or how original the story was.  You're just trying to convince your friends that you weren't just ducking under the seats to cower with the spilt popcorn!Verdict:  CGI gore and freak-a-minute junkies stay away.  This film is testament to the power of dramatic tension in horror. 9/10(I will admit that biblical tirades are getting tiring though)",The Others
587,bowers4,"One of, if not, the best scary movies this year!",10,21 August 2001,This was one creepy movie. I saw the preview for this movie before Scary Movie two and I knew I had to see it. Every thing about this movie was great. The acting is all done very well. The one thing that surprised me was that I didn't get bored. For the past couple months I have been getting bored and impatient towards the end of movies. But this one is paced very slowly and I didn't even get bored once. The Book of the Dead was one of the very creepy things about this movie. Those pictures were just scary. And one thing that I liked about this movie was the fact that special effects weren't used. I myself prefer special effects but I'm glad none were used here. They weren't needed. They just used creepy noises. The Haunting was all about special effects and I hated it. Now any one who says the ending was predictable was very wrong. I was very surprised. Unlike the Sixth Sense(5/10) I couldn't see it coming. This movie is way better! I am probably going to see it again. I'm surprised that this didn't make more at the box-office. 11/10,The Others

589,wilder_jw,Perhaps the best of 2001 ...,10,6 December 2002,"Like ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Others"" is a somehow melancholy, leisurely exercise in slow-building suspense.  Unlike ""The Sixth Sense,"" where those properties were used to good effect and contrast with the modern setting, ""The Others"" places its characters and their various sadnesses in post-war England.  The film, although clearly modern, and extraordinary in its production values, feels and moves like a classic ghost story.The acting is uniformly amazing.  Like Haley Joel Osment, the child actors in ""The Others"" are accomplished beyond their years.  And though I'd always liked Nicole Kidman's charisma, this was the film that made me truly respect her acting.Finally, make no mistake: slow-paced though it is, dependent on twists and turns it may be, but this movie is truly frightening, in a way that ""The Sixth Sense"" was not.  (And I don't get scared in movies very often.)  As I'm typing this, the film is in my VCR; I originally saw it on the big screen.  Despite my knowledge of the plot, it's creeped me out enough to have to pause mid-film for a web-surfing-and-review-writing break.See ""The Others.""  Even if people have ""spoiled"" it for you, you'll still get remarkable enjoyment from it.",The Others
590,antonio02es,The BEST HORROR MOVIE in years,10,9 February 2002,"This movie is the number 4 in my TOP at this moment. It has a good line story, only comparable to ""The Sixth Sense"". I like very much suspense movies, and more if are about ghosts. I enjoyed Shyalaman´s film in a time, but last Summer it changed.I´m spanish but I don´t like very much the films of my country. I prefer American movies. ""The Others"" is a co-production between Spain and USA, and this thing liked me. Alejandro Amenábar had one of the best casts I´ve seen, overall Kidman and the children;---SPOILERs--- every actor makes you feel frighten and you don´t know in what state (living or dead) are them. Yeah, the first twist (the servants are dead) is very easy for the public recognize it. But the other twist (think about it more than a minute and you will feel more fear) is only perfect (the idea of live together dead and undead).--- ---END SpoilerSThe photograph, the lightning, the actors, the scenary, the direction, the score... all are good for create a dark and intelligent atmosphere. For the fans of fog use in films (I remember ""Sleepy Hollow"" as a good use of this Special Effect) this is a good instead.For last, I think this is a classic and the best haunted house film of cinema history. I´m waiting for the next film of this young talented director.IF YOU LIKED ""ABRE LOS OJOS (Open your eyes)""9/10 YOU´LL LOVED the OTHERS (10/10)_______",The Others
591,STEVEN_SEAL,A film that makes you feel fulfilled after watching,7,5 November 2001,This has to be the most entertaining movie i have possibly watched at the cinema. This and 'Saving Private Ryan'. The Others I can assure will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. The suspense is excellent almost straining on your senses to just give you that big scare that you actually want. The jist of the plot is fairly straight forward but the film itself is truly out of this world. Nicole Kidman is a mother of two living in a huge but pretty much scary house who is waiting for her husband to return from war. Her children have some sort of condition where they cannot be exposed to direct sunlight which can harm and possibly kill them. Therefore for the majority of the film they have to stay in dark rooms with candles as the only light source almost living like vampires. The candles in the house only add to the intensity of most of the scary scenes eg. was that shadow moving something or was it just a shadow flikering from the candle. These questions you cant help but ask your self throughout the film. Even during the day you cant escape from the scary atmosphere with the curtains pulled in every room and the lingering fog which never lets up. On the whole this film is fantastic. it's not just an excellent horror film it's an excellent film. Nicole Kidman is an extremely talented actress and is a very sexy women and her kids do there job especialy the small girl who was the better of the two also the the actress from 'Waking Ned' Mrs Flanangan was also great. On a whole again this film you should watch. My girlfriend almost gave me a blood clot on my arm she was so scared.,The Others

Do not waste your time and money.",The Others

Nicole Kidman gives a very good performance, so do the kids... But I found the movie too slow. For a thriller or horror movie, it was too slow and too long... The plot was really interesting though, and it keeps you interested it till the end of the movie... But it didn't scare me at all... Neither did the Sixth Sense... It was just purely entertaining... Nice movie to watch with your friends in a good theater with good sound, when you have nothing better to watch / do... But nothing special. Not really scary or especially interesting...",The Others
595,noveed,Instant Classic,9,21 January 2002,"This movie is amazing. It hooks you, makes you get the chills, and at one point literally makes you jump out of your seat. Those who see the movie will probably know what part this is. It was the only time I have really heard a whole audience scream all at once.Aside from being a great work of entertainment, it displays fantastic acting from Nicole Kidman, the two children, and especially the servant lady. The plot twists and turns with much cleverness.The Cinematography is what catches most people's eye. Although the others doesn't have any flashy special affects, the camera glides around suspiciously at the house, and the people, adding to the suspense.This movie is the best of 2001, and so far the best of the decade. The only thing that disappointed me about this movie was the rating. COME ON PEOPLE, there was no blood, no sex, no nothing, so why did it get PG-13? Do a better job next time on that one.Actually, I was glad that there was no blood or sex, because that usually makes movies dull and boring. Good job guys! You created a masterpiece for 8 and up!

596,Andrei-10,Clever plot but not that scary.,10,25 November 2001,"When I first heard about this I thought it was going to be a classic haunted house story, I was expecting an updated version of ""The Haunting"" (1963), creaking doors and shadowy figures. What I got was similar but it didn't seem to flow as well, I seemed to be waiting for the next spooky scene, though when they appeared I wasn't disappointed. I was expecting a spectacular twist in the plot and I wasn't let down, its a very clever idea. The film isn't really a haunted house story its more of a look at ghosts and well I can't say anymore without spoiling the ending but all the scenes are leading up to the clever twist at the end. Overall a very clever and original film but not really a horror. But still 10/10.",The Others
597,shakycam3,A Classic Haunted House Movie,8,4 September 2001,"I know a movie is creeping me out when I feel like someone or something is going to grab my ankles from behind my seat.  This film did that, with gusto.  I found that the incredible performances all around, most notably Nicole Kidman's turn as the frazzled lady of the house, made up for a VERY predictable ""twist"" ending.  The scene that I found the most unsettling was when she found the photo album, and it stuck with me.  The setting was incredibly ominous, and the shocks kept coming, even though I correctly predicted how it would end halfway through.  A film this predictable has to have some very strong merits in other areas to get a good review from me, and this one has plenty.  Destined to become a classic, because it already feels like one.  This is a film that could easily have come out 40 or 50 years ago, and that's a great compliment.  The  lack of special effects HELPED the movie, in my mind.  I remember giggling insanely at the ""ghosts"" in 1999's ""The Haunting"", and thankfully, the effects were muted, if not non-existent here.  This is a classic haunted house movie, and it delivers.",The Others

As second lead, could she be nominated as best supporting for the Oscars?Nicole Kidman is superb (as I have come to expect).Eric Sykes (British readers will know him as a farceur) plays straight, to good (and not distracting) effect.Interestingly set in Jersey 1945, and written and directed by a Spaniard (can I presume he was brought up a Catholic) there is a full diet of subtexts played out here, but without going into spoilers it's difficult to discuss them.I rated it a 9 rather than 10 because the younger child (son) grated once or twice.Worth seeing, definitely, but don't expect a horror film - it's a ghost story in the tradition of MR James.",The Others
599,el-d,"A classic ghost story, which isn't necessarily a good thing",5,20 August 2001,"From the trailer I expected a scare-a-minute creep fest. What you have is a slow , theatrical based story with good performances, nice lighting, no special effects,  period costumes and one or two jumpy moments.The atmosphere started to build eerily enough, but as the red herrings started to fall unfortunately so did the number of story revelations. Combine that with a totally pointless appearance by Christopher Eccleston who does little more than mumble 3 or 4 lines and wear a blank expression I became bored. By the time the middle hour was over and the plot started to pick up speed I didn't care.SPOILER
If you've read or seen Haunted by James Herbert you can probably deduce the major twist a mile away. Some of the ""surprises"" are bookmarked by really obvious and out of place dialogue. Christopher Eccleston wandering out of the fog unexpectedly saying ""sometimes I bleed""??

600,SugarLandDave,"Pain, suffering, forever....",1,8 September 2001,"For those who perhaps do not know, ""The Others"" is a movie produced by Tom Cruise starring his estranged wife, Nicole Kidman.That is all that I can say good about this farce which through clever advertising would pass itself off as some sort of horror thriller.  It is in due time about as thrilling as having chewing gum stuck to the sole of your shoe.  Sitting through the whole movie is as pleasant as removing the afore-mentioned gum from your shoe.Early in the film while speaking about religeon, Ms Kidman mentions pain, suffering forever.  That is what you will feel if you sit through the whole film.......If Ms. Kidman could act as well as, say, Sissy Spacek in ""Carrie,"" if the children acted like accomplished child actors rather than like a couple of kids you picked up at the corner store, if someone (Tom?) cared about making a good flick rather than a fast buck then perhaps the screenplay could have been rewritten to have some redeeming moments.  Perhaps the cast should have just improvised the whole thing; it could not have been any worse.It is a shame Hollywood can put out a movie as awful as this, and it will make money in spite of it's being a stinker.  Everyone involved with this fiasco should be ashamed of themselves, but of course, the money will assuage their pain.  Shame on you, Hollywood!  Shame on you, Tom, Nicole! And shame on you, dear reader, if you should fall victim to this film and fail to tell your friends how very bad it is!",The Others

The thoroughly weird things happening in the house are cleverly built up (you really are willing to suspect anything up until quite late on).My only gripe is that the ending is not as sharp as it could have been.

602,SteveMadcow,"""THE OTHERS is a creepy film... that reminded me of an old 40s or 50s ghost story.""",10,2 December 2001,"The Others is yet another in a long list of great horror movies of the new millennium. I have always loved ghost stories, and this film has easily become my favorite ghost story ever. It's like one of the great old black and white ghost stories but better. It takes you on a slow, and uncomfortable ride.The story is simple. Grace lives in a mansion with her two children, both allergic to sunlight. That little twist on the story was just great. It makes the film completely opposite than other ghost stories, with Grace not afraid of the dark, and making sure to keep the light out, to save her children. This provides us with a very creepy, and dark atmosphere. Plus the mansion is also a creepy place. Not to mention, that in the film everyone who enters the house, must close the previous door, before opening the next.
Nicole Kidman is perfectly cast in The Others. This may be one of her best performances ever (She was also great in this years Moulin Rouge). She was really very believable in the part. The two kids in this film were also fantastic. Alakina Mann as Anne was terrific. She played the bullying sister great. She and James Bently, who played Nicolas, really seemed like siblings. Awesome job by both. Fionnula Flanagan was also fantastic as Mrs. Mills. She really creeped me out, and I didn't know where she stood. Was she good or bad? I didn't know, but her acting was right on the ball.Alejandro Anemabar directed The Others with such atmosphere. The dark lighting is creepy, and the cinematography is beautiful. This guy's has got a bright future. To accompany all the atmosphere we get a fabulous score by the director, Alejandro Amenabar. The music is creepy, and really adds to the feel of a 50's ghost story. It also sets the mood of the film, and makes the scary scenes, even scarier. The score is fabulous. Not only did Alejandro Amenabar direct, and score, but he wrote the great, and well-developed screenplay.The Others is not without a great twist ending, that should shock everyone. I did not see it coming, and it's such an original concept to use in a ghost story. It worked well, and I was speechless after the film. Outstanding finale.This film is yet another horror film that proves that big budget special effects suck! This film is scary, and it only had a $17m budget. The Others did great at the box office, and deserved every buck it earned. It's a creepy film, that has its very scary moments. This is a film that will not be forgotten. It'll be stuck in my mind for a long time. This really reminded me of an old 40's or 50's film. I highly recommend this film to every fan of ghost stories.The Others: 10/10, A+",The Others
603,ca_localgirl,Chilling!!,10,24 October 2001,"This is one of the best movies I have seen all year, and one of the top horror stories ever told.  It's creepy, simplistic, and eerie.I was impressed by the enchanting simplicity of the plot, the lack of need for ""Hollywood"" special effects, and the haunting atmosphere that loomed over everything from beginning to end. The first half, or even three quarters, seemed to move along a bit slowly, but it felt necessary to build the suspense to the point where I was biting my nails in anticipation of the inevitable.Nicole Kidman's character, Grace... I was torn between empathy and disgust for her at times, but she definitely succeeded at captivating me with their lives and story.  Predictable in parts, but it still leaves you guessing. This was a quality ghost story, with an old fashioned ambiance; downright spooky. I was in awe of the ending, a fairly intelligent premise. It's the kind of movie that lets you escape reality for a while by entertaining you, but at the same time, returns you to the ""real world"" with your spine tingling, wondering if there isn't some possibility of truth...

604,Schweiger,Part two of that other movie (*possible spoilers*),7,14 January 2002,"Sixth Sense - emotion + creeps = The OthersDo not take me wrong, this is a good movie, I was really at the edge of my seat most of the time and this one moment near the end nearly made my heart stand still. But it had that 'been there, seen that' right across its face. Unfortunately I had heard about the Sixth Sense-like twist before watching it and so figured it out half way through the movie.I also felt kind of cheated at the start when you were constantly made believe something terrible is about to happen soon and then it doesn't. Reminded me of the first half of The Shining. Perhaps the director wanted that buildup but I didn't like it.If you don't know neither Sixth Sense nor The Others and would have to decide which one to watch first and which one to skip (cause you'll know the 'surprise' by then): Watch 'The Others', if you like thrills. Watch 'Sixth Sense', if you like feelings in a movie.",The Others
605,a-trane,Dejavu in many ways,6,20 January 2002,"Not very original and in terms of the acting little convincing, yet stylish flick with a twisted finish that reminded me (and some of the other reviewers here) of ""The Sixth Sense"". Rumors spread that Amenabár wrote the script before ""The Sixth Sense"" came out, but even if that would turn out to be true, it wouldn't make ""The Others"" a more valuable film.
Amenabár evolves a very conventional haunted house plot, with Nicole Kidman in the centre of attention, as she gives an above average but not compelling performance as a strict and at the same time desperate mother, concerned about her two kids. The youngsters are over-sensitive to light of all sources as a result of a rare disease. Since they can't be exposed to daylight, all windows of the inhabited mansion are permanently darkened. Three domestic servants move in and strange things start to occur, like the floor board creaks without anybody walking and the kids begin to hear voices and so on.The film is too much about Nicole Kidman's character and the kids aren't believable for most of the time, showing once again the difficulty of finding talented low-aged actors. All in all ""The Others"" looks somehow dated and creates tension just in a few good moments. The photography is quite good though.Rating: 5-6/10",The Others
606,franzwinkler,Don't know what everyone else saw,4,25 December 2002,"All of my friends told me, that this is a masterpiece. Excellent acting, brilliant cinematography, extraordinary music, great atmosphere, etc., etc.,....... So I wanted to buy the DVD without seeing the movie, because my friends are nearly always right in case we do have the same predilections. Luckily another friend of mine borrowed me his DVD.As I had been very excited at the beginning, I was bored beyond believe while watching this one. It is so in lack of story, that even the brilliant twist at the end could not change my misery. Sure, technically it is great, the twist is awesome, but that does not make a masterpiece. Especially not, if the first 90 minutes are boring and stupid as hell.  The music is not bad, but when it rises up, the actress turns around and nothing happens, so I just asked myself: So what? By the way: Nicole Kidmans performence is breathtaking. I hope, that someday this gifted woman receives the Oscar she deserves so badly. Becaus in my opinion she was passed over for: To die for, Eyes wide shut(supporting) and of course: Moulin Rouge! But back to this movie.Some cinematography and directing are just selfish. The plot with the husband (a totally give away of Christopher Ecclestone) could have been cut out. It is just repeating the ""pillow-story"" the third time and adds nothing new to the picture. But most responsible for killing ""The Others"" is the weak writing. But I don't want to make you think that everything is bad in this movie. So here are the good things: Sometimes great atmosphere is built up. Sometimes destroyed by the selfishness of the cinematographer and the director. Same thing with the direction itself. The music is really good composed and arranged, but sometimes unnecessary (as read above). The performances are all very good and believeable. But all in all, and in this case I keep it with Martin Landau in ""Mistress"": I think, the story is an important element!So, if you like nice pictures, good acting and a brilliant twist: Go and rent it! So many people liked it.But for me: I give it 4/10",The Others

609,realtab,"Great performances, retread storyline, slightly dull, most predictable movie ever",5,13 August 2002,"The Others is very well acted, the performance by Nicole Kidman is I assume is the reason people glow about this mildly entertaining movie. Also the supporting cast is very solid especially the daughter who with patience, training, and proper film selection really has a chance to have very successful career she can steal the scene scenes from the more veteran Kidman. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT****As far as the story goes it failed as a suspense thriller because of its utter predictability. I had without trying or thinking about it at all, figured out the ""surprise"" ending. I admit that even the best crafted thriller can be guessed or figured out but usually it is by actually trying to. 5min into this film literally I had already guessed every twist and turn that was to be offered. These kinds of films can be completely ruined for most by too many hints much less knowing the outcome so I won't say a word other than trust me you have probably seen this film at least a few times under different names and pulled off more successfully. Another problem The Others has is mediocre to poor pacing, it dragged and then rushed and back again. Mostly it had a slight drag which causes the movie to be just a little dull. The Others has many strengths in my opinion good acting, the direction is good but not great (the pacing), the script is solid, cinematography, and honestly a good twist on second hand concept. Still for all it has going for it The Others comes short of it's goal which is to keep me guessing and on the edge of my seat.****END POSSIBLE SPOILER****Great suspense for those who ALWAYS say ""I could never have guessed"", and those who pay little attention to the visual aspects of a film. Predictable middle of the road entertainment for everyone else. WARNING this film is no classic it does not bear multiple viewings, gets more flat each time you see it. DO NOT PURCHASE. Better uses of your time in this genre may be Psycho, The Shining, and Dead Again.

I feel the tone of this movie is Nicole Kidman. I see very little flaws with this film. The cinematography completely captures the power of light in the film, and it sets a great feel. The directing is very strong, helping portray the confusion and struggle of a family realizing that they arent alone in the house. For anyone with an attention span longer then a commercial, you will thoroughly enjoy this film on a second, third, fourth e.t.c viewing. I feel there is nothing in this film that is unnecessary, and everything helps build up to what is in my opinion one of the most dramatic and completely shocking endings I have ever seen from a movie.

And the story was not enough to really get into the movie. But I must say the ending was surprisingly good. The only problem is that you have to watch 90 minutes first.

The isolated mansion, the fragile woman alone, the sinister servants who know more than they can or will tell and  the darkness inevitably combine in unworldly ways.All of these elements are used superbly by the director to create a movie that is scary with out being bloody.  No bodies hang from trees and no skulls fall from the closet shelf.  Yet something is wrong, very wrong. It might be the voices that the daughter of the house hears or pretends to hear.   It might be in the new servants who conveniently showed up shortly after the prior employees vanished without giving notice.

Anyone who has seen HAUNTED with Aidan Quinn plus the episode ""My So-Called Life and Death"" of the short-lived TV anthology NIGHT VISIONS will not be surprised by THE OTHERS.  And there are probably many other previous tellings of the same basic story.  It all adds up quickly: No electricity, no telephone, the postman never comes, and the priest doesn't visit anymore.  It's not too hard to figure out the ""twist"" and where Victor and his family fit into it. ********END SPOILERS******Despite finding the story predictable, I'd recommend this movie to people because the story is told well and with atmosphere.

I first saw the preview for THE OTHERS when I saw MOULIN ROUGE on opening night and knew that I had to see this movie. I absolutely adore Nicole Kidman, and can't wait until THE HOURS with Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore.  Anyway, I have seen it twice so far, and you most likely have to.  After seeing it, and TOTALLY BEING BLOWN AWAY BY THE ENDING!!!! you have to see it again to fully understand it.  One of the best movies I have ever seen!!!",The Others
620,rsanders,Chilling and exquisite,10,30 August 2001,"I'm not normally a fan of scary movies, but this film accomplishes with atmosphere, good pacing and solid acting what 1999's disappointing remake of The Haunting couldn't with all the computer generated wizardry in the world. This is a stylish and spooky masterpiece.",The Others

Hollywood watch out - your time is up!",The Others
622,defazio76,Totally amazing...,10,18 August 2001,"This movie was absolutely incredible. Nicole Kidman is amazing in it, but what else is new? Fionnula Flanagan ('Waking Ned Divine') also gave a chilling performance, as did Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy (Who, having virtually no lines, superbly managed to make you even jumpier throughout the movie just by looking at her frightened facial expressions) The two that surprised me the most were, of course, the children. According to the IMDB, this was a first movie for both Alakina Mann and James Bentley, but they seemed like Hollywood veterans up on the screen. Both are wonderful actors and adorable kids. This movie really brought back the feel of films as they were long ago, you know? I mean, yes, it takes place in 1945. But there was no gore, which I think made it about a billion times better than those movies that people think are so phenomenal because they show some dead people. Don't get me wrong, I liked The Sixth Sense. I've heard a lot of people compare The Others to it, but honestly- The Others is even better. Although, The Others is definitely the same as The Sixth Sense in that they both need to be seen a few times for you to really understand every detail. I've already seen it twice and am going back again this week. An utterly chilling movie. Probably the first to ever make me so frightened that I literally began to shake. I give it two very enthusiastic thumbs-up!",The Others

What may be amazing to the avid reader of the Gothic tale is that the subject matter had never before been broached.Slow-moving, atmospheric and the very opposite of Ed Wood camp. Unbelievable story!

624,jmmiras,Hitchcock influenced suspense,8,17 May 2006,"Since his first feature, Amenábar has been characterized for liking the plots with suspense and a great commercial success. For this film, he fronted a minimalistic story but with lots of suspense.Highly influenced by Hitchcok imagery and visual style, this film suggests more than it really shows. The atmosphere is extremely well created, the international actors are very well selected and the fit very well to their characters, Amenábar was able to create a very suggestive atmosphere with the soundtrack and the script do not have any fissure.This film is clearly influenced by several masterpieces such as Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING or Hitchcock's REBECCA.In my opinion, THE OTHERS should be considered as the best Amenábar film (up to date).",The Others
625,matti0,"Amenabar strikes gold, beautiful but mildly predictable",8,22 August 2002,"I have became a big fan of Amenabar since I watched Abre los Ojos and Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky. This movie obviously looks more like a big budget Hollywood film than Abre los Ojos and the visuals are much better.If it had been a small budget pic, it would probably had the same sort-comings of Abre that Vanilla Sky rectified. The Others greatly improved Amenabar's status as a writer and director in my eyes and I see no room for improvement for this story. But, unfortunately, I had the movie figured out pretty early because one scene was sorta close to one from (now hold your laughs) Beetlejuice. Those who have seen both movies might make the connection... But, all in all, he made another movie I myself would have loved to be in on. Kidman's performance was good, to me it was a 7 and a half, maybe an 8, out of 10. And kudos to Amenabar to keeping to movie to 104 mins., any longer would have been overkill. This one is worth watching, and for Amenabar fans, it's a keeper",The Others

This is definitely a movie to be thoroughly respected and enjoyed!",The Others
629,justine_3,Promises more than it delivers,5,26 November 2001,"This is director Alejandro Amenábar's first feature film in English,having previously worked in Spanish, and certainly the film doeshave a European quality to it, making a welcome change from therecent crop of Hollywood thrillers such as What Lies Beneath andUnbreakable.  However, this is not to say that The Others is anoutright success.   Nicole Kidman deserves credit for taking achance on a relatively unknown director, but despite when of herbest performances to date, her character is too  neurotic and herreligious fervour which she inflicts upon the children, prevents herfrom gaining our full sympathy.   However, the main reason that The Others disappoints is that itsimply isn't scary enough.   The children lack any kind of creepy oreerie qualities, so we never believe they are malicious, whichwould have added an extra dimension to the suspense.  Likewise, the servants are too homely to ever really be scary and inparticular for a British audience, Eric Sykes as the gardener isnever going to be spooky.   The children's allergy to light wasintended to subvert the horror convention of dark bringing fear andlight bringing salvation.  Unfortunately, this doesn't quite work andinstead just seems like a convenient device to allow most of thefilm's action to take place in the dark.  Nazi occupation of Jersey is mentioned, but doesn't form a majorpart of the plot, which is certainly a missed opportunity to exploremore interesting themes than the straightforward supernatural linethe film chooses to follow.",The Others
630,chris-4071,Tremendous movie; very engrossing,9,23 September 2006,"The performance of Nicole Kidman in this is outstanding. She plays the part extremely well and had me utterly convinced that she truly was the conservative, sensible-shoe-wearing, overbearing mother in the piece, though quite captivatingly beautiful she is too. It does make quite a refreshing change from the regular formulaic Hollywood type 'horror' films that seem to be proliferating theatres and DVD shelves these days. You won't find yourself shouting ""don't open that door"" like one does in desperation at so many awful b movie characters - you'll be looking at Ms. Kidman's face and you'll be right there with her.This film is set some fifty years ago. Now, normally with some type of period pieces, things start well before some character uses some modern slang/colloquialism and it pulls you right out of the movie. I can assure you that in The Others, the dialogue is simply sublime. Every detail has been attended to to ensure it is faithful to the era; from the behaviour of the children to the address of the servants.The children actors here are simply outstanding. With the help of the excellent dialogue they deliver an awe-inspiring performance that absolutely makes the film.Storywise, it is excellent and original in my opinion - and horror movies are my favourite, so I believe I've seen a few in my time.So if you're tired of clichés, of the group-of-teens.. .camp-in-a-graveyard.. .as-an-initiation-ritual-then-get-killed type movies then perhaps you'd appreciate this eerie, evocative, and downright chilling horror movie as much as I have.",The Others

Everything looked really realistic and the ghosts were very frightening at times.  I screamed a couple of times in this movie too, when that elderly lady pops out from the closet.  Oh my god, I don't think I've ever been so scared in my life. Well maybe that's an exaggeration but pretty much.  This movie should definitely be nominated for an Oscar this year.  Some people may not think so, seeing the competition but i think that it could actually have a pretty good chance.  But who knows what will end up happening since this year's nominees are very good. But i was very surprised when i saw this movie at how good it was.  I wasn't exactly planning on it being that good, but things surprise us everyday of our lives so who knows.",The Others
632,supafly323,Feh. (to quote another critic) *MINOR SPOILERS*,4,13 August 2001,"*MINOR SPOILERS*Ahh... a mansion surrounded by fog. ""Eerie"" characters and events that the director holds back from us, like we care, to create suspense. And many cliches later, you have the ultimate cliche, which would, yes, be that funny little cute little twist that smacks of The Sixth Sense. I liked it with Bruce Willis. I was ready to walk out after enduring an hour and a half of Nicole Kidman in one of the worst-scripted roles I've seen in a while. (She chases ghosts with a rifle - yes, it's true - and I was trying hard not to laugh out loud and disrupt the theater.)Not that she can act very well, either, but that's beside the point; i'll give her the benefit of the doubt here and put Eyes Wide Shut, and this bomb of a script, out of mind.What's good? Atmosphere. Kids.What's the worst? Waiting for nothing. I mean really, nothing. I knew it would come out why the girl is mute, i knew they would tell us the big deal with all the ghosts, it was just a matter of time. It's usually the responsibility of the director (and writer; in this case, the same unfortunate soul) to make sure we care why the girl is mute. In this case, feh. You know, I liked the candles but I didn't like Kidman drawing out the explanation, like it's some big mystery, like maybe we won't find out. Of course we find out. So tell us up front. Waiting on something like that does not make a movie. And that waiting WAS the entire movie. The entire 100 minutes that felt like 200, easy.two stars out of five, for Nicole Kidman being easy to look at, for the kids, and for that glassy look on the husband's face...",The Others

True: the end is not that amazing, and you can easily guess what is going on. But, not less true: even if you guessed it, you are going to jump out your seat.No doubt Amenabar is going to be the next Hitchcock. And well, he already found his own Grace Kelly.",The Others

The story unfolds in an excellent manner, allowing the viewer no chance to question what will occur subsequently, but only to absorb every piece of information thrown to them, and to try to decypher what it is actually taking place.  The end is excellently thought through and transforms the entire film from a shock-horror into a well crafted tale of misinterpretation and retrospective reasoning.I felt the acting throughout was strong, with especial mention to Nicole Kidman, who not only commanded the English accent and demeanour of the mother brilliantly, but also gave to the audience a character whom they could follow, as we discover the truth as she does. The children were entirely convincing, and delivered their lines with the skills of someone much older and more experienced.

It is classy, brilliantly acted, and mysterious. Plus, it packs a massive punch in the end that'll overwhelm you. I predicted the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"" before I'd even seen the movie, but I just didn't see this one coming.""The Others"" will amaze you.

Kidman plays the role of a single mother, trapped in a big mansion because of her two children's sensitive and allergic problems with sunlight. Suddenly ghosts are hunting the house. Kidman, her kids and the servants are disturbed by this and the movie shows us the fight on how they try to solve the problem. But the movie is deeper. It is about trust and believing. It is about what the past, present and maybe even the future can tell us. What is present anyway? It's all relative. > Kidman's son in the movie is really convincing and makes your hair raise on your arms and your head. Really worth watching.

We get that she likes it quiet in the house, but it gets pretty exhausting after a while. The plot is not that complicated, but it tries to seem mystical by not uncovering any details until the end. A very annoying tendency that this director has, just like in Abre los Ojos / Vanilla Sky, which started out good, but was ruined by an ending that explained everything, and simplified the movie extremely. The movie was instantly changed from being a fairly good metaphoric movie, to a simple sci-fi flick. I felt that nothing really happened in the movie, other than when there was some dialogue, and the characters revealed a bit of their story to each other. Very disappointing, as I felt like 2/3 of the movie had been a total waste of time, as it had no influence on the story whatsoever. Why this director is so overrated, I don't understand.",The Others

Nicole Kidman is incredible as a stressed- out mother trying to deal with two children who have a deadly light-sensitivity condition. In addition to having to live in a neverending existence of locking and unlocking doors and in no more light than lantern light, she has to deal with the possibility that her big English Gothic mansion is haunted by 'the others'. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The creepy-but you don't know why daughter-the housekeeper who seems aware of something but doesn't give it away-the poor mute maid and Kidman's perfect teetering on the edge performance all adds to the tension. What is beautiful and brilliant about this movie is they way it unfolds without allowing the audience to 'figure' out what's really happening.

That isn't to say that the movie didn't possess elements of the genre, just that enough of them simply weren't present. The movie's setting is very moody, and the fact that it takes place entirely in a relatively dark area makes the suspense level rise incredibly, and the direction is enough to keep you on your toes. The cast isn't one filled with big names - save Nicole Kidman - but the characters don't exactly need to be deep to fit the part. Kidman's performance was good, but seemed a little eccentric and dragged out during most of the scenes.All in all, the movie is more of a suspense thriller; it does deal with ghosts, but not in a conventional sense by any means.

There are also lots of things that can be interpreted in different ways. It seems as if the mother is mentally unstable, but there's no proof, causing you to question everything else. Is any of it actually happening, or is it just a grief stricken woman having a nightmare? You can't and don't know, which makes it a brilliant piece of psychological horror. It's been months since I watched it, and I still wonder what the true story was. A must see for fans of ghost films, twist endings, or anyone looking for a psychological horror film, as opposed to the cliché gore films that we see all the time.

""The Others"" (what a dull title) managed to scare and entertain me most of the way, but it didn't make much sense until our requisite surprise ending came out.

The costumes, the set, the dialogue... They are all very beautiful. It was not as scary as i thought it was going to be but i guess thats just because the movie was made out to be SO SCARY in the trailers but it isnt that type of movie, its more of a ""freaky"" drama.

It's wonderful to see that there still are a few chair-gripping, CEREBRAL (to the dense, ""cerebral"" means ""boring""), good scripts out there.  Another good thing is that ACTING involves facial expressions, eye expressions and (heaven forbid) emotions instead of blood, gore, and cursing, flying around amid shallow car chases set to bombastic and robotic ""music"" that is used to overwhelm and distract the viewer from the lack of script and acting abilities.""The Others"" is a fantastic find. Nicole Kidman is excellent in this. I never gave her much of a chance before, but now see that she is very talented. Julia Roberts couldn't have pulled this off. Nicole's expressions and eyes screamed volumes as she made me feel what the character felt without having to say a word. The children's performances were some of the best I have seen by kids. The other three main characters were perfect as well! They kept me guessing!I find most movies completely predictable and the soundtracks to be overblown and distracting. That is not the case with this one. I loved the quiet moments that were used to build up the suspense and to allow the viewer's mind to race with ideas---------something that has been sorely missing from films for years. The music ENHANCED the movie!! What a nice change that is! It was perfect and added mystery, eeriness and helped solidify the aura and tone of the film, instead of banging you over the head and being annoying and obnoxious.""The Others"" has terrific acting, a wonderful story line, an enhancing soundtrack, is full of feelings, emotion and fear.

I loved how the whole movie was in the dark, which was of course due to Grace's children, however, it was an effect that made the movie truly horrifying.

The whole point of a suprise ending is that you don't expect it.  It wasn't suspenseful so count that out.  It was obvious through the whole movie that something didn't fit.  Maybe that's what they were trying to accomplish: showing us how obvious it should have been but how hard it was for them to realize the truth.  It wasn't a bad movie but it certianly wasn't a good movie.  It copied Sixth Sense in so many ways but totally failed where Sixth Sense succeeded so dramatically.

I, fortunately, hadn't read the other reviews here of it before watching the movie, so hadn't made the obvious comparison to the surprise ending of another ghost story that came out at the same time, ahem ahem...but I didn't mind it. It was different enough, in my opinion, to still be likable, and it had come as quite a surprise to me. And really, excellent as the other movie was, it was NOT the first ever to use such a concept.

On top of it all, Ms. Kidman (again, one dares to say) plays with superb talent and is extremely convincing as the neurotic, uptight, and religious housewife. Marvelous.THIS is why I love to go to the movies (and why I'm waiting for the DVD to come out on R2).",The Others

657,Lanaaia,Excellent Thriller,10,16 August 2001,"This movie was a new and interesting different perspective of a ghost story. Some parts may have seemed a bit corny and overdone, but overall I found it thrilling. It's quite confusing up until the end, where the truths and mysteries unfold, and the viewer then finds a true appreciation for the story. I was a bit confused however as to what the message of the movie was. I know there had to be one, the story was very profound.",The Others
658,stefanflotti,Excellent!!!!,10,2 December 2006,This movie is grate!!!! i love it it makes me scared always when i watch it. I think Nicole Kidman is so grate in this movie. She creeps my to death. This movie is about a woman(Nicole) and two of her kids. One day three people come to her and want to work for her. When few days past the girl(one of her babies) starts to see a boy and the mom punishes her. Later the mom starts to hear voices. And all the doors are opening and the girl still sees the boy. Then the mom goes kinda craze and fires the work people. When see does that the work people go to the garden and reveal gravestones. Later that night the children's go out and find the gravestones and on them are the name of the workpeople at the same moment the mom finds pictures of the workpeople dead.,The Others
659,NKJMfan,Amazing chills,10,12 August 2001,"Nicole Kidman is once again amazing. She leads the cast in a movie that you better see quick, because someone may spoil the plot for you. It reminded me of 'The Sixth Sense' in that there were many twists, especially the ending. The two child actors did an amazing job. This movie will make you think about life and death a little differently... Breathtaking, chilling, amazing, film. A 10. ~*Nicole Kidman Rocks!*~",The Others
660,DrNorton,One of the best films of 2001...,10,8 January 2002,"I love a good horror movie, I really do. When I went to see The Others, I had no idea that it was actually supposed to scare you, and that made it even better than I first could imagine.Basic story: Nicole Kidman lives alone in a very large house with her two small children. The children are sensitive to light, if exposed, they will develop skin complex and eventually it will kill them. One week prior to where the movie begins, all the servants of the house they live in just disappeared. When the movie begins, three people arrive at the house as to be the new house help. They are told how to handle the doors in the house - ""no door must be opened without the previous one being closed first"". The reason, of course, is that the children must not, at any time, be exposed to light. ""This house is like a ship, where the light, as water, must be contained at all times""...or something like that (can't quite remember exactly what's being said).Anyway, I was frightened by this movie - I had to see it twice in as many days just to get a better look at it. The images are beautiful, and old, gigantic house, the fog (oh yes...the fog) and the lighting is great. Nicole Kidman is a great actor, the children (especially the little girl) play great parts, as does the others.If you like to be scared and like a good movie, I can only say one thing: go see this one. Right now, if you can.",The Others
661,evieanderson-83174,A Classic Gothic Horror,10,9 June 2021,"'The Others' has quickly found itself on my favourite horror movies of all time list. Nicole Kidman shines in this post-world war II gothic horror film, and her performance isn't the only one that makes this film as great as it is. Despite this being both of their first acting credits, the children are compelling, and help create the spooky atmosphere with their performances. 'The Others' doesn't need to rely on gore or cheap scares to get you sitting on the edge of your seat. The cinematography, composition, story, and chilling performances leave you with that feeling of adrenaline and satisfaction you get after watching a good horror movie. This movie is 20 years old and still manages to keep you guessing. Even with its PG-13 rating 'The Others' will be guaranteed to have your heart racing by the time the credits roll.",The Others

Nicole Kidman was excellent and so was the entire movie.The movie was a little slow in the beginning but it kept speeding up. Overall if u want to be spooked and liked the Sixth Sense you'll love this thrilling movie of the year. Grade: A-",The Others
663,hweber,Twist at the end is worth waiting for.,9,20 August 2001,"'The Others', while not a horror film in the sense of the 'Halloween' or 'Friday the 13th' series is none the less disturbing.  The twist at the end, a la, 'Sixth Sense', is worth sticking around for. Nicole Kidman does a fine and believable job as the protective, religious, single mom.  I consider this one of Nicole's finest works.",The Others
664,jawsiv,Other Side of Bad,5,7 October 2001,"After suffering through two of the worst films ever made that fall into the same subgenre as The Others (if you had to guess, its The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill- the remakes) I was definitely starved for a subtle and spooky ghost story. So, why didn't I like The Others? It had a good cast, great set, a whole lotta fog. I guess what it really lacked was a feature length story. Not much actually happens in this film, simply because the story could have been told as a high brow episode of Tales from the Crypt. Too many of the shocks turn out to be nothing, simply because the movie is just dragging you along to its twist ending, and has to spend at least an hour and a half getting you there. Another detraction to the film is the characters. Not the performances mind you, just the characters being portrayed. As a filmgoer I do not demand moral, pure or saintly protagonists, just ones who I do not wish to throttle every time they speak, or don't speak in the case of one character. The lady of the household is a fussy witch. Her children are just a mild step up from brat. The servants are so docile and old they might as well be dead. I guess the servants were alright. For those in the mood for a quiet and haunting cinema experience, The Others may be just what they need. Me? I'm still looking. 5/10.",The Others

It was worth seeing, but I was let down with the ""big surprise ending"" that everyone has been buzzing about. My hubby and I had the ending figured out not even half way into the movie. Don't get me wrong.. Nicole was great in this role and visually, it was great and all but honestly, how many times can the whole ""Sixth Sense""-type thing be done? It's just not surprising anymore and it's getting a tad stale...",The Others
667,KBean5588,RIVETING AND ASTONISHING!,9,26 May 2002,"This is by far one of the most suspenseful and thrilling films I have ever seen. Nicole Kidman gives the performance of her career as a suspected widow in 1945 England. She lives alone with her two children or so she thinks. She begins to realize that what her daughter is saying, that they are ""others"" living in the house with her, may be right. There is one problem. They cant leave the house. Dense scary fog and photosensitive diseases make the children unable to evacuate. They are allergic to sunlight. Three suspicious servants arrive that make the plot full of even more twists. This was an excellent masterpiece with one of the most shocking endings that have ever been made.",The Others
668,OyeMiCanto33,top notch,9,15 December 2007,"This is a real winner, and the only reason I cannot go with a 10 is because I had to fast forward and rewind a number times to try and understand what was said. It is full of whispering in thick British accents, not a good combo for me even with the volume full blast, and there is still a couple spots where I'm still not clear what was said. Other than that, is it a brilliant story that offers subtle hints to point to the ending but you'll still be surprised. IMO, Alakina Mann, the little girl who played Anne, upstaged the rest, though Kidman was plenty good. I sure hope this young British girl (near an adult now) continues in acting as she is an ace.",The Others

670,sidhu-karna,Horror in its original sense,10,19 April 2014,"This movie is about horror- not disgusting horror of mutilated bodies but horror of realizing a simple truth in the end.Amenabar redefines the horror genre which he did once already with ""Open your eyes"". Acting is top notch. Nicole Kidman including the kids draw us into the world of their banal existence. All the characters have their own quirks which is a treat to watch. The most original thing is the minimalism presented. There are no ear shattering music to irritate in the name of shocking you. Everything including the dialog and the music seem have a reason for existence linking it to the story.A must watch!",The Others

Why no violence other than kidman shaking the old lady for a few seconds. Why did the husband leave after returning from being gone for years? Nothing is explained in the movie, you are just left to guess at everything, and the ending was just plain awful.I will be sure to ask people whose opinions i respect before watching a ""supposed"" great movie again in the future.Now, I must try to sell this piece of garbage to some fool on the net.TERRIBLE movie.",The Others

This movie is long and boring if you don't know the ending and if you are like most people and see it coming in the very beginning of the film then it is excruciating to sit through. It has been called ""spooky"" and ""eerie"" and ""atmospheric"" by other reviewers - but in my opinion it is over produced and in your face and at no time let me forget I was watching a movie.

I've seen hundreds of horror, suspense, mystery, thriller movies since my childhood till now at the age of 28 but i have never ever in my life said to a movie's climax ""WHAT THE HECK!!!!!!!"" and literally jumped off the chair. Yes, this movie has such a climax that may give you the same experience.. If this movie will get any negative points by critics it will only because of the entire movie moves with slow and dull pace towards its climax, but once you are there you ought to stand up and applaud as you might just never watch such end in any other movie ever again. Such brilliance and uniqueness at its best",The Others
676,iKnowFilm,very refreshing!,8,22 May 2011,"I just finished watching this movie and it was very very refreshing. I am a big horror/scary movie fan and even though I didn't think this movie was very scary it was very suspenseful and very well made. The reason it was refreshing is it's not like most modern ""lets scare them"" type movies. The storyline was well done along with all other elements that go into making a movie. It didn't rely on sex/blood/gore/cursing or any of the other things that film making rely on to get people to watch. It was a VERY VERY clean movie and was a nice step back from most of the modern movies. It also wasn't corny. Many horror/scary movies are very corny but this one was well done and doesn't leave you saying, ""I saw that coming an hour ago."" It's plot and twists aren't obvious so it leaves you curious and keeps your attention. It is a slow build up till the climactic end and well worth waiting for.All in all this movie will leave you very satisfied...I'm sure of it.",The Others

I left the theater thoroughly convinced I just saw the best damn ghost story ever made.Despite having no special effects at all, and the absence of any hint of gore, Director Alejandro Amenabar managed to put together a truly creepy and chilling masterpiece. The dark atmosphere all throughout the movie was perfect, and the plot was gripping and very well written. The actors gave outstanding performances, especially Nicole Kidman. Alakina Mann was brilliant, and Fionnula Flanagan was creepy as hell.The story revolves around Grace (Kidman) and her two children Anne (Mann) and Nicholas (Bentley), who are both suffering from photo-sensitivity and cannot be exposed directly to sunlight. This is why their unusually large house needs to be dark all the time. Following the arrival of their new servants, they begin to suspect that their house is being haunted.Although the pace of the movie is slow, the rewards the viewer will get when they stick with it through the end more than make up for it.

The movie is complete in itself giving you all the feeling you expect from a horror movie. The sound effect could have been more horrifying given the environment in which the movie is shot. The screenplay is just awesome linking the various events of the movie to give an unexpected ending. Horror movies should scare the audience and its not about the bloody bodies or dancing demons or distorted faces, its about the plot and story which should give you the creeps. This movie definitely has those points and it is a must watch for it's storyline. It is the uncertainty of the events which brings this movie to one of the must watch horror plots.",The Others

I felt it was cleverly thought out and, despite the many comparisons to the Sixth Sense (released 1999, two years before), I would emphasise that it is a completely different film. True, in concept, the ""surprise"" ending is the same, but the way the film reaches that conclusion is very different. In fact there is less of an attempt to hide the ""truth"" as numerous clues to the final outcome are indicated all the way through The Others, whereas The Sixth Sense is more subtle and subliminal requiring a second viewing. With The Others you think ""ah yes, of course"" whilst The Sixth Sense was ""wait a minute, that's not right"".Also, this film is a refreshing change from the recent Hollywood approach, that would have no doubt sprinkled the film with high-speed camera views rushing through the house, numerous special effects, a full compliment of glamorous nubile (american) teenagers, a few gory murders and a more conclusive ending. No, like the Blair Witch Project, The Changling and The Haunting the horror is often in what you don't see - allowing the viewer's imagination to do all the work.As for Nicole Kidman, I'm not so sure, but Fionnula Flanagan probably carries the film anyway. Nice to see Eric Sykes as well.8/10",The Others
685,bazina,a plea for visceral enjoyment,9,11 November 2001,"Firstly, I'd just like to say I've read many of the other comments here, and I do not understand why some people feel the need to belittle the intelligence of those who enjoyed a film, when they themselves did not. Enjoyment of a film can be visceral - it gets you in the gut, your adrenaline rushes, or you may be overcome with waves of inexplicable dread or melancholy. This kind of enjoyment does not need to be intellectualised - it is felt or it isn't. Even a technically bad film can produce such affects in some members of its audience.So your wife fell asleep in the film, and you were bored. Does this make you a superior being to the people who sank low in their seats, voraciously absorbing the gloomy atmosphere, and feeling our insides turn to ice water? I fell asleep once in Jean Luc Godard's 'Breathless' (however I've managed to stay awake during Tarkovsky films - no mean feat according to some). And yet that film is considered a masterpiece by many. It just didn't resonate with me.Anyway, I think you can tell that I loved 'The Others'. It's haunted me all weekend. I saw some things coming but resisted the temptation to 'second guess' the plot, allowing the film to reveal itself to me in its own time. The children - let's not compare them to Haley Joel Osment for that kid is a freak of nature - were pinched faced and touching, reminding me of my relationship with my own malleable younger brother when we were that age, and I could make him believe anything (hehehehe).In a time when most films with a supernatural bent rely on what is seen and what horrors can be made visible through special effects, it was refreshing to find a film which relied on what was hidden. It was more about sound than vision. I'll be seeing it again, hoping to recapture some of the delicious ambivalent dread of my first viewing.",The Others

Easily the best film I saw in year 2001 I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a film with a great plot as opposed to all out action.It is essentially a story of woman who believes that the house she and her two children live in (just after the 2nd world war)is also inhabited by ghosts.Watch it and prepare to be blown away by its twisty,turny final 15 minutes.Mark",The Others
687,ReeRee,"Boring, not breathtaking",4,6 October 2001,"In spite of the outstanding performances of Fionnula Flanagan (""Waking Ned Devine"") and Nicole Kidman (one bad movie after another), the film dragged.Amenábar developed the characters and setting quite early in the film with the ""light-allergic"" children reciting catechism and clutching a rosary at the direction of their fixated mother who practices psychological denial as effectively as her martyred saints who refused to deny their Christianity.So why did the audience have to wait so long for any suspense?

Her giant, creepy house in the mists of England must be kept constantly dark, and doors kept closed because of her children's ailment. This is a wonderful device because it allows for several creepy door-opening moments.Is the house really haunted?  What is with this strange housekeeping staff?

While I'll admit my hearing is not what it once was, I can still understand all the dialouge while watching the older films. Now, I sit down with the remote in my hand while watching a video, volume up for dialouge, volume down for special effects. This is one of the reasons my wife and I stopped going to the movie theaters three years ago, the Dolby Sound now employed by most theaters, just gives us both one heck of a splitting headache, which I assure you, is not due to the dialouge.",The Others

I thought the acting was excellent-especially on the part of the two children, Alakina Mann (Ann) and James Bentley (Nicholas). Nicole Kidman was pretty good as the seemingly-frigid/paranoid mother. The plot was complex and thoughtful and included a twist at the end that rivals that of The Sixth Sense.

Sure I jumped maybe once or twice, and the setting was a little eerie, but I was never scared. The previews made this look as if it was ""the sixth sense"" meets ""what lies beneath."" Acting was good, and the plot had a foundation to build on, but it was built upon poorly. This story could have been much better than it was. Good main idea, but in the end the two didn't work out together. The ending was unsatisfying, but I'll leave that for you to find out yourself.

Grace lives in a secluded mansion with her two children. Her husband went off to war and never returned. One day, three strangers appear at the doorstep of Grace's house. She hires them as servants and then strange things start to happen. The movie has some great scenes which scared the pants off of me! There are many twists in the movie which add a nice flavor to it.

But The Others would have been a mediocre Hitchcock, and is above average modern American flick.  A lot here is taken from the Sixth Sense school, but not done as well.  Surprisingly, it's the story that's a bit weak and predictable here, bogging down excellent cinematography, directing, acting, etc.  The mechanics are wonderful.  Way too many scenes of Kidman in a gloomy hallway with an oil lamp... Enough already.  There are no secondary plots here of any interest - the main one may be enough to carry the movie, but not make it great.  As for the amazing surprise / plot twist at end --- I honestly had it pegged in the first 1/2 hour, and I normally am pretty darn dumb when it comes to ""figuring out"" surprise endings....

Gave me quite a good fright too. Maybe it's a bit slow, but better than fast-paced and shallow. It had quite a European feel, not Hollywood all bluster and little substance.",The Others
700,adrienneanson,unearned high praise,6,24 August 2003,"This film is entertaining and makes you jump a little, but the reason it received such praise is that it's very similar to original and creative movies such as The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.  The filmmakers have done a really good job of copying excellent ghost story movies and movies with twisted endings and thus have made a movie whose praise is piggy-backing on the praise of other movies that have really deserved it.",The Others
701,PrncssCFA,Wow!,10,17 August 2001,This movie was absolutely incredible.  Nicole Kidman was amazing. The little girl who plays her daughter is also wonderful.  The way they play out their tense relationship on screen is spectacular. One of my favorite things about this movie is that it has one of those endings where all of the sudden the movie gets that much better.  You're not expecting it at all especially since the different characters esspecially the servants are confusing you more and more.  I found the ending to be one of the ones that leaves you talking after the movie about what a clever twist it was. I can't wait to see this movie again because the ending makes me want to watch again and see if I can pick up on the clues.  This movie can easily be seen again and again because you will pick up on new details every time!  I gave it a 10!!,The Others
702,rayncloud9,this one was hard to sit through.,1,14 August 2001,"horrible, unintelligent retelling of the horror formula utilized by the haunting, sixth sense, and the shining. the score is so incredibly cliched that i caught myself laughing at several points. the performances aren't very good by anyone, sadly, i think the best were the two kids. the screenplay made the ""twist"" ending so undeniably evident after twenty minutes that i really found myself questioning why they continued to even build on it. i think its amazing how many times the same story can be rewritten and still have people buy it. the only reason probable is the low standards we've adopted in recent years. these really are sad times for the cinema.",The Others

This movie has suspense and thrills that are hair-raising and makes the audience jump out of their seats (at least when I saw it, they did). It even has some comedy in it, when Anne was teasing her brother Nicholas. (I thought it was funny.) Plus, ""The Others"" has two unsuspected twists that made the whole audience go dead quiet (You could practically hear the person next to you breathing.) and gasp in awe. GREAT MOVIE!!!!",The Others

Too many so-called ""scary"" movies are really just poor excuses for interesting special effects, but this one delivers on its promise of ghost-story chills.

707,operca,A pice of art better than the sixth sense,10,18 September 2001,"It´s incredible to see how Alejandro Amenábar grows in each films he do. ""Thesis"" and ""Open your eyes"" are very good movies, but this one is probably the best film of the year. The script (Alejandro wrote it 3 years before ""the sixth sense"")it´s a very intelligent mixture of drama and horror. The anguish is in every part of the film and that happens for three things: 1) Nicole Kidman has done her best work on this film. We don´t know if love or hate this ""Grace"" because of her human character. She has to win the oscar because is (at least in this film) the best actress of the moment. 2)The director of photography, Javier Aguirresarobe has made a pice of art: the darkness, the fog, the forest... It´s really superb. 3) Alejandro Amenábar: a genius. The music, the script and the direction, and in those three categories has done a very good job.Please, you have too see this movie. You will thank you me.",The Others
708,veronica-l,Excellent,10,29 September 2001,Nicole Kidman does a wonderful job as the somewhat hysterical mother of two young children in a huge old house in Jersey. Scary without the need for blood and gore. Sufficiently slow to be able to savour the wonderful setting and details. The ending came as a surprise to me. I thought the housekeeper was excellent too.,The Others
709,Phoenix77,Nicole Kidman is having a good year,10,12 November 2001,"The Others is a scary and well-executed ghost story with a great script and excellent acting. It seems that Nicole Kidman is having a great year movie-wise despite the split-up with tom cruise, putting in her best performance to date (in my opinion) in this movie. The character of Grace is complex and of a nature not often seen in movies. She is elegant yet near-hysterical at times, with a hint of mystery about her that suggests she is not what she seems, which of course she isn't. The brilliant twist at the end (which works a lot better than that of The Sixth Sense) would probably lead people to hate Grace if she wasn't played with the skill that Kidman uses.  She carries the movie and gives her character the extra layer of emotion that cannot be written in words and is the resposibility of the actor. The film has some very scary moments.  Though it is slow to start, the movie would not have worked at all with the fast pace of most horror movies which takes away all scariness.  The Others becomes downright creepy at times (ie the part with the old lady with the girl's voice, and when the servants are standing at the door to the house after the first twist) and the scary parts only come when they are needed to advance the story. Fionulla Flannigan makes a great semi-sinister nanny, with just the right amount of menace mixed in with friendly motherly qualities.The children give very apt performances, particularly the girl, although the boy is occasionally grating. The Others does have a few humorous moments.  One part in which the little girl informs her mother that only children who haven't been baptised can go to limbo, is quite funny and the expression on Kidman's face is classic, as she displays the comic ability and timing that was ever-present in To Die For. Overall, The Others is definitely worth watching (a few times even) and contains some scary moments that actually make a lot of people in the audience scream aloud, and top-class performances.  I really think Kidman will get an oscar nomination for this, and Flannigan has a chance as supporting actress.  The photography was brilliant too and sacrifices flashy visuals for moody shots and ambience.",The Others
710,8ellisd,Chilling tale with a twist,8,9 December 2001,"This reminded me of an old ITV program called ""Tales of the unexpected"", mainly written by Ronald Dahl who told usually creepy tales of murder and ghosts. Maybe this could of been one of those tales, but it was alittle bit too long and drawn out. Still it was told well and made me abit scared. Well worth a viewing with the curtains drawn (of course) and by candlelight.",The Others
711,alotafagina30,An Excelent movie for suspense lovers and cinematography admirers..,9,7 January 2002,"First of all, I have to say that I have admired Alejandro's work since he made his first feature length film, Tesis.  The Others, even though it's his third film, it's his first english spoken film, and what a thrill ride it is.  As the film goes deeper into the plot you feel totally immerse into it.  The casting was great and even though I personally don't like Nicole Kidman as an actress she excels in this role as well as the two kids that play her son and daughter.  this unique film comes from the mind of a practically new film maker who has taken Hollywood by surprise with this moderately budgeted film that earned millions at the box office. Alejandro has a way of telling a story by images, words and music (he directed the film, wrote the script and also composed the score) that he seams to be ahead of the audience all the step of the way.  He uses cinematic techniques that film makers now a days have forgotten or refuse to use and that is what makes him special.  The film does not require stunning special effects, or the overuse of sex to involve the viewer.  With simple lighting he was able to create an atmosphere which lots of films fail to produce.  In these days films often have twists and turns, but few have the creativity of a genius behind the scenes.  Besides the suspense, the jumping out of the seat and the twists and turns of it all, I enjoyed the cinematic work of art the most.  I Highly recommend this film if you're into it.  I also recommend ""Open your Eyes"" and ""Tesis"".",The Others
712,tonio_r2,"Sad and beautiful, clever and sober",9,18 February 2002,"Is this movie really an horror film ? Obviously yes, as it is often chilling, and full of very classical elements from very classical horror films (ghosts, frightened children, haunted house lost in mist...)But it is much more sober, less silly (and bloody) than most of the so-called ""horror movies"" - perhaps because, actually, it's a genuine psychological drama, at the same time striking, beautiful, sorrowful, with unforgettable atmosphere and plot. For that reason it may recall more ""Rebecca"" than ""Shining"" (another fantastic familial drama)No spoiling here, I'd only like to say that the surprises of the script are much less artificial and sheerly mechanical as in most movies with ""coups de théâtre"", because they finally give a totally different approach to the psychology and the attitudes of the characters.Eventually, I recommend this beautiful movie to all the people who enjoy suspenseful films, with surprising, clever plots and some genuine human depth ... and with, as only special effects, Kidman's anguished face, whose beautiful expressivity here is simply unforgettable !",The Others
713,minnaely,intelligent movie-making,10,5 April 2002,"The Others made me shiver. Indeed it was the old-fashioned fear that hides in every corner of a 19th century mansion surrounded by fog and such tension it's almost touchable. The Others could happen in any place or time but director Alejandro Amenabar has chosen the post WW II period to be the set of his two hour traffic. Grace(Nicole Kidman), a mother-of-two lives in rare conditions: her offspring has a disease which keeps them inside the house, curtains closed. The story begins to open after her new household helpers arrive. It is amazing how such little can sometimes turn out to be the best. Amenabar plays with our smallest fears which tend to get more frightening our minds twisting them. Everything in this movie is ment to be.The cast is troughoutly talented and wonderful. N. Kidman does another great part in a year which in it's diversity to Moulin Rouges Satine shows her changing capability. Grace does have the air of coolness surrounding her appearance and reminds Kidman's previous screen personas but this time it actually has a positive effect. The children, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, do have both innocense and confidence in their performances.The story is calmly revealed bit by bit but it manages to keep the viewer focused. Amenabar's directing is one hundred procent quality: He does not offer answers on a plate and visions and the story based on the 40's subtle atmospehere surprises -literally.",The Others
714,sjurh,I've never been so scared!,10,17 February 2002,"My favorite genre has the last 10 years been horror-films. Films that chill you to the bone, films that makes you not want to go to sleep. It all started with watching ""The Omen"" when I was 12. I was scared to death, and I fell in love with the feeling. Since then I have tried to find a film that would give me the same feeling as ""The Omen"" gave me back in '92, but I have never found one. Until now... ""The Others"" is a extravagant film that we have not seen in the theaters in a long time. I was so scared I could feel tears popping out of my eyes and it felt wonderful. My girlfriend even asked if we couldn't leave because she was so scared, but I just wanted the film to last forever. To keep injecting this fear-drug into my blood. You might think we are very easy to scare, but I wouldn't say we are. This film is really scaring, the only film that can come up to this would be Robert Wise's  ""The Haunting"" from 1963. Alejandro Amenábar has made what others for so long have tried to accomplish. He has chilled us to the bone.",The Others
715,jgsmeall,Who knew horror movies could be this terrifying?!,10,17 March 2002,"""The Others"" is surely the most superbly executed movie I have ever seen. The film tells the story of Grace, a hypochondriac Catholic mother who tries to protect her children from their morbid allergy to sunlight, despite the schemings of three new servants, and a mansion gone suddenly awry. The terror of ""The Others"", unlike other horror movies of the ""spooky old house"" brand, relies not so much on flashy special effects as it does on perfect timing, a suitably chilling soundtrack, and, most noticeably, the believability of its actors: Nicole Kidman delivers stunningly as a fiercely devout British mother who seems constantly on the verge of some horrifying fit of insanity. Alakina Mann and James Bentley never fail to frighten as the precocious and decidedly innocent children of Grace. And Fionnula Flanagan, veteran Irish actress, stretches thin the line between amicable housekeeper and fearsome hag with an ulterior agenda. From the unsettling opening scene, through a tightly wound web of suspense, intrigue, and a select few well-placed scream-packed moments, to the genuinely chilling conclusion , ""The Others"" never fails to terrify and amaze its audience with its innate sense of style, and a simple, but ultimately gripping, plot construction. Recommended",The Others
716,fw-1,Bof !,7,25 May 2003,"Definitely overrated by the critics. This movie may be a masterpiece in comparison with most gore movies with liters on blood shed on every plan, but apart from that, it is quite dull and finally not so thrilling. Remove the ""sudden noise"" effects that make us jump a little, and you'll discover that there is nothing left to scare us. In what the plot itself is concerned, it has a taste of ""déjà vu"" (the sixth sense, abre los ojos - from the same director -, el arte de morir - another spanish movie -....). So, how long will this kind of plots surprise us, really ?. If you really want to be stuck to your chair with thrill and atmosphere, watch ""Gaslight"", a movie which is considered as a reference for this one. It was shot by George Cukor in 1944 and this is a masterpiece !

718,brianface5@yahoo.co.uk,"An exhilarating, intense and fabulous film.",10,23 August 2002,"The Others is; Nicole Kidman's best film and best performance to date. She is simply STUNNING and MESMERIZING as Grace - a truly top notch performance as all of the performances are in this classic. This film is NOT a copy of the Sixth Sense. The idea is taken from a COMPLETELY different angle to the Sixth Sense.The screenplay was written BEFORE the Sixth Sense was released AND in my humble opinion anybody who thinks it is a copy is being VERY UNFAIR . It was one of the best films of last year and the only people who didn't like it probably didn't understand it, or, like different genres, and, probably enjoyed incomprehensibly idiotic, brainless, pathetic, painstakingly awful, critically panned films of 2001, such as Tomb Raider, Pearl Harbor, Jurassic Park and some of those ridiculous comedies etc.[ no offense to anyone who liked these, everyone's entitled to an opinion] -basically unoriginal laughably acted films with waferthin plots and even thinner performances. The Others is a thinking person's, intellectual horror film/thriller. The Others is a VERY clever and unpredictable film. It is an elegant, stylish, beautiful, intense, unsettling, horrifying, chilling and haunting shocker that should not, has not and will not be forgotten. A classic if there ever was one!",The Others
719,brianface5@yahoo.co.uk,Brilliant! ***** Buy or rent it now!,10,25 September 2002,"I have to say I saw The Others before the Sixth Sense and I have a few comments to make; Sixth Sense fans who say that The Others is a rip off of the Sixth Sense, don't flatter yourselves- the Sixth Sense wasn't THAT good.The Sixth Sense wishes it was this good. Think about the twist. It isn't at all the same as The Others' twist.Stop comparing two different and unique films just to be bitter and cause annoyance to The Others fans. This is a BRILLIANT film,last year's best and one of the genre's best to date. Nicole Kidman gives what can only be described as a spellbinding performance in this critically acclaimed and haunting shocker.- definitely her best performance to date. With more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and a suffocatingly intense atmosphere, The Others is undoubtedly a winner. Fionulla Flanagan is superb and the two child actors are on level footing with, dare I mention Haley J Osment and overall, this film is not to be missed. Sixth Sense fans, get over yourselves !!! The Others is an elegant, beautiful, intense, unsettling, horrifying, chilling and haunting shocker.Truly unpredictable, with spectacular performances all round, particularly from Nicole Kidman who gives an unforgettable performance- without a doubt her best ever. She is truly mesmerizing as Grace and definitely deserves the huge amount of critical acclaim that she's received. She plays the part to perfection and her English accent is superb. This film is a flawless masterpiece. A wonderful cinematic experience that's not to be missed! Just view the reviews below for a taste of the acclaim it's received by fans and critics alike!

720,Shinan,Scariest I've seen in a long time...,9,8 May 2002,"I had only read a few reviews of this film before I saw it. I had heard that it took place during WWII (more or less) and that there were something about children with a weird illness and that it was horror (more or less).So I went to the cinema and I saw a film that frightened me... And it was good. (Scary Movie frightened me too but that was mostly because it was horrible... In the meaning that it was a bad film [ot]) After seeing it I felt hypnotized, there was something about this film that made it ""magic"". The lightning and sounds were superb (even in the low-class cinema we have where I live) and there were no blood... only a ""scare of the dark/light"" (much like Blair Witch Project.. which had a similar way of scaring... you saw nothing but imagined a lot).Also the ending was quite good, I found myself wondering how they would end this without it feeling too ""over"" (Like I felt in Ninth Gate and Thirteen Ghosts). I must say it turned out well, thinking about how hard it is to make a satisfying ending.And just to mention if you see this film I strongly suggest that you don't watch trailers before (or atleast not think about it) you go see it. I downloaded the trailer after seeing this film (to ""steal"" screenshots for my homepage's review) and I felt that the trailer revealed too much...

721,myrto1,THIS IS A FILM YOU'LL REMEMBER,10,8 July 2002,"I would dare to say that one of the best films of the last decade is `The Others'. `The Others' has a very interesting and original plot. It tells the story of a young mother who lives with her two photosensitive children in a house, somewhere in England, after World War II. After the arrival of three servants, the family starts to suspect that the house which has to be kept in darkness because of the kids' illness is inhabited by an other family. In other words it's haunted. What I enjoyed the most about this movie is first of all the unexpected, totally unforeseen ending which really renovates the horror film genre. The performances of the whole cast and especially of leading actress Nicole Kidman are natural but brilliant. The photography with its game between `light and darkness' is excellent and the settings are perfectly attached to the chronological period represented. The mysterious, sentimental score and the well balanced direction of Alehandro Amenambar give this film its unique atmosphere. This is undoubtedly a film worth seeing as it combines drama with horror. The movie leaves us with a bitter taste afterwards and questions which remain unsolved. What it teaches us for sure is that hell  - if it really exists - is never the Others. What scares us the most is the ability of human beings to cause terrible pain to those whom they love most.",The Others
722,blakepfeil,"True Film-making at its best, a classic for all generations",10,27 September 2002,"""There is something in this house... something diabolique... something... that is not at rest.""With these words, you know you've run into a good, elegant thriller/drama, starring Nicole Kidman.  Yes... you've run into ""The Others.""  Although the total effect this movie has, I think the particular standout in the movie would be the main star: Nicole Kidman as Grace.Amazing.  That's the word I'd use while describing Nicole Kidman. Absolutely fantastic... amazing.  She is the single most talented actress of the 20th and 21st century, besides the beautiful Grace Kelly.
No.  Even better: Nicole Kidman is the Grace Kelly of today's Hollywood world.  She is truly unforgettable in any role that she portrays, at all. Whether it be the spooky teacher in ""To Die For"", or as an 'whore' in ""Moulin Rouge"" (which she was nominated for an Oscar this year), or as a Russian 'spy' in ""Birthday Girl.""  She is truly a ""wow"" of our time.But now to ""The Others.""  This movie really hit me as one of the most wonderfully ever produced thrillers ever seen on the silver screen.  It really, is truly, awesome.  And what makes it awesome?  Nicole Kidman. Flat out, she should've at LEAST been nominated for the Oscar this year for her flawless performance as Grace, the spine-tingling mother who is on the edge, every moment she's on the screen.It's the aftermath of World War II.  The Nazis have been beaten and controlled.  Grace is haunted from the fact that her husband went off to war and never returned.To top it off, she has two children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a serious, deathly allergy to light.  Because of this allergy (known now in modern day as ""XP""), the house must always be kept in the dark, no daylight must shine in.The movie starts off with Grace, just having woken up from a terrible nightmare, screaming in her bed.  As soon as it's over, we start to unravel the mysteries of the new, mysterious housekeepers right away.  We meet Mrs. Bertha Mills, Mr. Edmund Tuttle, and a girl named Lydia, who've come to the mansion in hopes that there would be an opening fit for them as housekeepers and gardener of the estate, which rests on the Jersey Islands in England.
Grace already knows what the 3 have come for, and invites them in, showing them around the house.  As she gets to explaining things, she mentions that the last servants disappeared ""into thin air"" almost a week previous that day.And then she introduces them to the children.  Almost immediately, they take a particular liking to Mrs. Mills, the kind and gentle ""grand-mother figure"", who will be their Nanny.Soon after, strange things start happening.  And this is where ""The Others"" gets to the top point of the film.  The portrayal and mystery of the lighting that Alejandro Amenabar played with is more than fascinating. It's a ""cinematographers dream"" as Nicole Kidman states in the documentary on the special edition DVD, come out in May.The performances in the movie are both moving and worthy of any award you can find and offer.  Nicole Kidman as the edgy Grace; Alakina Mann and James Bentley as the scared and curious children, with the allergy to light; Fionnula Flanagan as the mysterious, yet sweet Mrs. Mills; Elaine Cassidy and Eric Sykes as the two quiet, humble, mysterious companions of Mrs. Mills; Christopher Eccleston as the grief and war striken husband Charles; and last, but certainly not least, Renee Asherson as the ""old woman"" or ""witch"" who's calm and soothing voice makes you want to fall into a deep sleep.The overall effect this movie produces is a scary and moving, touching one. There are those moments where you can be on the edge of your seat and those other times where you feel yourself tearing up at the destruction the war has caused.Sets and costumes were perfect for that era, and the lighting especially sticks out when chase scenes within and outside of the dark, creepy house begin.  The lighting was crucial to the overall effect, because you are put in that view that the children have had their entire lives: a dim, eerie light.Alejandro Amenabar is a true genius.  Writing a flawless screenplay is something you rarely fine these days... it is a true work of literature. Although their are the occasional goofs and obvious flaws in the film once or twice, the direction Amenabar put out was truly amazing.You must rent ""The Others"" tonight... it will blow your mind!Kudos, Blake",The Others

The others was good solid suspense. The ending was surprising unless you had seen the sixth sense previously and there arn't bucket loads of effects in it unless you count the blue screen used for the fog.

Sometimes she appears as a kind-hearted nanny, but at times - very sinister. The plot is widely known to have an unusual twist, but regarding the title of the movie, i guessed approximately in the middle. It didn't spoil my pleasure, and later i rewatched the movie a couple times just to grasp the details of the other view of things.

Moreover, because I knew ""the punchline"" I was able to pick up some clues immediately, but it didn't spoil the fun - it enhanced it.A must-see not just for fans of horror, but for fans or the best that modern cinema can offer.",The Others

typical horror movies. The sudden twist in the storyline towards the 
ending is very surprising but at the same time also fascinating. 
The tension is there from beginning to end.I want to see more horror movies like this one. 
This one easily already counts among the classics
even though it's of 2001. There is alot more to be said about it 
but I will keep it short.
Besides there's also a chillingly beautiful Nicole Kidman in it... ;-)This movie is worth to be watched anytime. 10 of 10 stars.",The Others

Atmosphere, characters, not too over the top. I was funny cause I was trying to figure out the story but its so good that I never figured it out till the end, I wanted to watch. Now thats the way a scary movie should be. Most of the time I know the whole story before it even starts. heh. Ending was great, I was like whoa nice. All in all it gets my recommendation. Still Its one of those stories that I doubt they could make a sequel to. It loses its surprise that I first had. But hey you never know. Never the less ya it was great. Everyone should see this movie.",The Others

736,plimtuna,A horror film with no Special Effects! YES!!!!,8,24 August 2001,"Just a quick review to share how I enjoyed The Others.First let me clear some things up.1.  It is not long and boring.  It is about 105 minutes.  As a matter of fact when it ended I was surprised that it was over, I thought we had only gone about an hour and half.2.  It is not a Sixth Sense rip off.  It is if you have only been going to the movies for the last 6 years.  This movie harkens back to the old classics within the genre.3. The climax is revealed early on.  I have to totally disagree with this. Both my wife and I were lead to several different conclusions throughout the movie.  I only figured it all out after they hit me upside the head with it in the climax.4. There is no great fear moments in the first hour.  Once again, I disagree.  We jumped in our seats a few times in the first hour.  Remember, quality comes all in good time.  You don't rush wine do you?In conclusion - my wife and I thought it was good - great movie (I gave it an 8 at IMDB).  It is not typical Hollywood fare and therefore receives some bad reviews.  We love suspense without blood.",The Others
737,acsmith,Finally a great Suspense Movie!!!!,10,24 May 2002,"I haven't seen a great suspense movie since the days of Hitchcock!  It seems that Hollywood is finally getting away from the blood and the gore, and getting back to good ole basics; letting one's own mind do the work.Yes I did figure out what was happening about 30 or so minutes before the end of the movie, but that is what type of movie this was--one that creeps you out, yet wants you to think for yourself.Unlike the ""gore"" flicks where I could tell you exactly when the ""bad guy"" was going to jump out, or who was going to get gored next; this movie really made me think and had a twist almost at every turn.I will def. recommend this movie!!!!!!!!!!!",The Others

Had I been alone I would have left long before any so called ending. In ""OTHER"" words, I did not enjoy this movie and I certainly do not recommend it.",The Others
740,overthetop10,Nicole Kidman rules!,10,15 August 2001,"If I had to sum up this movie in a word, it would be ""chilling.""  The Others is a delightfully atmospheric suspense film.  It's tense, scary, and very memorable -- I don't think I'll ever forget the image of a terrified Nicole Kidman clutching her rosary beads around her shotgun as she tears down the halls of her dreadful Victorian mansion.Writer/director/composer Alejandro Amenabar creates a dark, dark atmosphere, in which you feel like you can't trust anyone.  Nicole Kidman, in her brilliant performance as Grace, is supposedly the ""heroine"" of the film, but as I watched the movie I found myself more frightened of her than rooting for her; steely and overbearing, with a hint of psychotic hysteria in her icy eyes.  And then the children, (held their own and even stole a few scenes from the more experienced players) were just hellishly creepy.  The little girl was one of the most ominous characters I have ever seen in a film.  And the servants (who were also finely played) will keep you guessing the whole way through.  Every time you think you have it figured out, some of the household help will pop up and throw the whole framework off-kilter.The real attraction in this film is Nicole Kidman, following up her bravura performance as Satine in ""Moulin Rouge"" with a woman teetering between insanity and iron control.  Grace has so many layers, and Kidman reveals almost all of them through her face.  The film is anchored by her presence, and she plays off the other actors extremely well -- note the tense relationship she has with Anne, her daughter.  When the two lock eyes, it's like watching two trains crash head-first into one another.The only disappointment in this movie is the ending, which is slightly anti-climactic.  When you get to it, you'll be satisfied, and it ties up everything that's happened in the movie up to that point quite well.  But it seemed almost anti-climactic, and I was left feeling a little bit let down.Overall, I gave The Others a 9/10.",The Others
741,barblight,Best film of the summer.,10,17 August 2001,"A stylish thriller, not to be missed. The Others is another great example of Amenabar's  brilliant talent.  This man can write, direct and even compose the music for a great film. Kidman is perfect, the children specially the girl will blow you away. If you are planning to see a film, don't think twice, The Others is a must see. And if you are interested in Amenabar's work, you should check out ""Tesis"" and ""Abre los ojos"", they should be available at any rental store in the foreign section.",The Others
742,richieanne,Awesome!!!,9,10 August 2001,"If u like What Lies Beneath, you'll love this movie.  Very simple yet unique.  The story evolves in 1945.  Imagine there's only about 7 main characters in the story. The suspense is eye-popping, if you think that the main characters are haunted... you have to see this movie.  Sure it was kind of boring in about 30 mins. however, it started to build up.  The 3/4 part of the movie was the most scary for me!!! You got to see it to believe... The Others.",The Others
743,wheelers,"A slow but, more than worthy scare!",10,19 October 2001,If you like a good ghost story this is the movie for you to see.  Nicole Kidman deserves the Oscar for this.  Her nervous 1940's Englishwoman was played perfectly.  I certainly hope the girl that plays the daughter is nominated for best supporting actress.  I've paid to see this movie 3 times. It starts rather slowly but all the while the plot certainly thickens on the fog shrouded island that lends atmosphere to this project.  To me it was like seeing the best of a 1940's thriller for the first time.  Then I had to see it again to pick up on clues.  Yet the third time I went was the time that made me jump the hardest.  The plot is truly engrossing and you're never really sure exactly what is happening until the final climactic moments.  You'll leave the theater with your mouth hanging open.,The Others
744,jigga978,Best Movie I've Seen In Years !!!!!!!,10,12 May 2002,The Others is a clever masterpiece and Nicole Kidman really showed how a great actress she really is. This movie was more thrilling and chilling than The Sixth Sense. This movie should have been nominated for Best Picture at The Oscars because of it's plot and development. The Others was underrated in the summer movies of 2001. It was only supposed to bring a mere $40 million and made a whopping $96.5 million and the summers most surprising movie gross. I recommend this movie with a large amount of respect. Rent or buy this movie. I rate this movie 10/10,The Others

Come on, you can at least come up with your own idea for a movie.  If this was original, I would have been wowed (like when I saw the Sixth Sense for the first time), but it just stinks that this movie would be considered.  It is typical Hollywood though where they will play an idea to death till America is sick of seeing it (ie still photography like in the Matrix).",The Others

The history is correctly presented and you end up knowing about the characters' life, something other films never achieve. Maybe not so scary as many Horror movies, no blood, no knives, no explicit terror, but subtle one. Alejandro is a genius, and we're only waiting for the next one. Run for a ticket, now!",The Others

Nicole Kidman gave an excellent performance, as did the rest of the cast, and her English accent was spot on. The location/set was attractive and wasn't too clichéd, and the music fitted with action like a glove. All the way through this film I had shivers running up and down my spine and my eyes were glued to the screen from beginning to the incredible end.

751,skankskater182,Question life? Or this films existance.,5,18 May 2002,"okay so I'll be honest, i went into this hungry and i didn't really want to see that so I am already cranky and annoyed. The others starts out really plain. Horrific imagines shown as drawings to not tell you a damn thing about the plot and a setting of darkness. We open with a fog filled screen with a huge house and a tag Jersey, 1946, or something to that extent. Hmm so the scene is set and we start into the great journey that is this film. We meet the main charectors an overprotective woman that is forced to close and lock everydoor as she walks around and is rude to the hired help that has just arrived. The acting is okay if you totally try and ignore Nicole Kidman for certain scenes, such as the one were her and the children are sitting around a candle lit table with their books. ""Bad little children go to limbo, and bad people go to hell""(or something similiar) begged the question Where do bad actresses go? Answer Jersey: 1946. I knew that opening would come in handy. I would not call this film scary. Dramatic, slightly suspenseful seeing as they don't tell you what the hell is going on and there are plenty of inexplicable events such as The husband just reappearing. Even the end doesn't explain how that happened. Your left with the only obvious answer to why it happened. To be 100% honest i was bored, but i wanted to know what was going on and had plenty of theories.  As a whoile it is good. The ending packs enough punch to make somethigns come together and fulfill the whole movies premise. However gettting their is not half the fun. Sitting through countless scenes of Nicole Kidman's charector being rude to everyone in sight, whether it be the three hired help people that appeared out of nowhere or her own children gets really old. The movie runs at about 90 minutes I belive. It could have been a 45 minute television show and made as much sense. IT might have satisfied me more also. However, we all know that audiences don't pay to watch good quality 45 minute movie, they pay 8 dollars to see a good 45 minute movie with an additional 45 minutes of pointless filler. We found our selves waiting for the notoriuos ""i am your daughter"" scene, and getting so exited once she was in the dress that we knew that took place in. Watch it, it's not a complete waste of time but it is a little boring. I rated it a 5, apparently most people liked it more than that.",The Others
752,ignaciomgm,"Amenabar saves the summer, let's hope he'll save this (lately) chaotic world of cinema",10,7 September 2001,"Amenabar is called to be the genius who takes the art of cinema to where it belongs: excellent writing, perfect direction and great performances. I hope he goes one in his way of originallity, lack of unnecessary effects and having the best of the actors and the characters. The film is not so long or boring as many people say. I think the people who say this is because they went to the cinema alone and they were simply greedy of the couples that were scared and holding each others hands and arms very tight because of the fear. For those who say that its a copy of the sixth sense, let's remind them that the story was written long time before the release of this film (just check out). NIcole Kidman is the actual ""woman on top"" (of her career). She's at her best in this film, as the rest of the cast. The name of the character (Grace) and her style is a clear homage to the late Grace Kelly, Hitchcock's muse. The whole film looks like an all time classic, like Rebecca or Vertigo. Its photography is near perfection, the music and the timing make your heart nearly stop, the story is really well thought and it makes you suspect of somebody, then of somebody else, then think one thing, then another, and at the end everything make sense...I can't tell yo more than that you have to go to see this great movie... Anyway, time will tell, but I wouldn't be surprised if Amenabar will be considered, in a few years, like a new Hitchcock or Welles. He has the talent, the genius and he's very intelligent to get caught in the star system of hollywood... Good Luck Amenabar, you are the savior of the ""old-style"" cinema (the only one that can be considered art).",The Others

The person falling asleep infront of me and my friends was more interesting to watch.  There was absolutely nothing to this movie until the end. Half the time, me and my friend were laughing at the movie. Nicole is beautiful, but holding a shotgun was hilarious. I was tempted to shout ""Hail to the king, baby!!"" And then with the door, who didn't know that was going to happen? And the kids screaming because of light, reminded me so much of the part in Interview with the Vampire, where Kristen gets fried.

I will just say that this was a fantastic film!!! Despite some people's comments that it wasn't scary, I found it wonderfully gripping and far more terrifying than any film in recent memory. Then again, I don't find the usual Hollywood Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street pap scary at all. Gore is gore and granted it can be appealing if you like that kind of film, but it's not SCARY. This is film is psychologically scary, especially if you have ever been afraid of being alone in a haunted house or even remotely scared of the possibility of ghosts. What makes this film scary is that it preys on your own fears in much the same way Sixth Sense did (another great film, better than The Others in fact, but only by a bit). And if you find it slow, then you are probably one of the sorry victims of too much MTV and instant gratification. If you like Hitchcock, Sixth Sense, or a horror film that engages your mind, then you'll probably love this film. If you hate it, then you'll probably take comfort in the fact that you can always go home and watch your collection of crappy Hollywood horror crap (ok fine it can be enjoyable in the same way a B-movie can be enjoyable, but admit it...it's crap) and unplug your brain altogether. Then again, perhaps a lot of you could fall into the latter ""sub-gerbil"" intelligence level.

755,milesmonroe,Excellent Psychological Horror Piece,10,14 August 2001,"In a horror market filled with useless gore and pointless plots, it's a breath of fresh air to see a quality scary movie. Looking back on the film, there wasn't an abundance of frightening scenes. Instead of the usual ""visible"" ghost activity, the writer/director Alejandro Amenabar relied on an eerie atmosphere; you get the feeling something supernatural is occurring, without being shown what ""it"" is. There are no flashy special effects or CGI monsters. At times, the expressions on the faces of the characters, heightened by an eerie soundtrack, composed by Amenabar himself, are enough to chill the viewer.If you have read any review of this film, you know it has a surprise ending. Thus, you may spend the entire duration of the film trying to add things up and figure it out before they reveal it. I did this, and managed to only figure out part of the surprise. The rest shocked me.Fans of Polanski and Shyamalan will love this movie. Many critics have compared it to the ""Sixth Sense"", but I don't think the two come close to eachother, plotwise. They are related only in the use of atmosphere to scare the audience.This is probably not a movie for the ""Hollywood Blockbuster"" lover. It requires a lot of thought and imagination. Many will find it slow and laborious. Others will find it to be a breath of fresh air in a stale and formulaic genre.",The Others

It was classy and engaging, but I left feeling that it was a deliberate attempt to imitate the Sixth Sense.  I don't want to give anything away, but the enormous reaction to the Sixth Sense's twist ending, made this movies plot twist fall short.  I felt like I had seen this movie before.  Without having seen the Sixth Sense, I'm sure that this movie would have been highly rewarding.See it for the creepy sets and dialogue.. and have fun trying to figure out exactly who 'the others' are... just don't expect to see anything new storywise.",The Others

762,WiseJoeyD,Nicole is two for two,9,4 November 2001,"Nicole Kidman is a lucky girl.  She's got two great movies out there.  All in the space of a year and both showcasing her ample talent.  The Others in particular, while devoid of OTT performances, costumes and sing along songs, will appeal to a lot of people.  People who enjoyed 'Sixth Sense' in particular will enjoy it, and those who're into X-Files' will surely enjoy this too.  However, it isn't a slasher thriller, with some ditzy teenagers running around a school chased by a homicidal fisherman. No, it's much more intelligent and, to me, seemed a far slicker movie than even  'Sixth Sense'It's focus is on a family, after the war, living in an old mansion (prime ghost story location!  Why can't they have a nice semi detached?!).  The children are photosensitive and the house must be kept in darkness and this creates an imposing atmosphere from the off.  The characters, including the mother played by Kidman, seem to have more to them than we are led to believe at the start.  There are noises in the house, the children say they've seen people walking around, the mother seems to on the edge and about to break, and all the while, the creepy atmosphere grows and grows.
It's strength lies in the fact that it doesn't simply throw the characters into scary situations, (e.g. some man chasing them around the house) to get a reaction from the audience.  It instead creates a sense of dread.  The director uses the camera and sound to merely suggest what's there.  The viewer's mind is allowed to make up the rest (and is much more effective than several million dollars of special effects).  The sound of whispering in an empty room, or the haunting sound of a piano playing from a locked room.  And having creepy maids and gardeners puts the audience at unease, trying to second guess if they're good, bad or evil.The story takes a lot of dramatic twists and turns.  And in the end, everything is, to paraphrase one of the characters, ""...Changed.  It'll never be the same again.""  The conclusion is one to rival 'Sixth Sense'. You're feelings are towards the characters are completely different, and ""The Others"" of the title are not who you'd have thought they were.The mother is, of course, the main focus of the story.  Treading, it would seem, a fine line between exploding, and being ready to give up.  At first, it seems sure fire who's good, and who's bad.  But then you feel a growing antipathy towards some characters, and to a certain extent, the mother.  In the end, though, you only feel extremely sorry and sad for the characters, yet angry at some of them too.This movie, along with Moulin Rouge' was a pleasure to see (well, it was a pleasure in hindsight.  It was definitely in the `too engrossed to move' range when I was in the middle of watching it) and I would recommend it to anyone (except those with baby's or heart conditions)",The Others

766,kamikaze_camel,A masterpiece... absolutely brilliant!,10,1 December 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** The Others has got to be one of the best films of the year. Infact I would say that it's the best, behind that other Nicole Kidman starrer, Moulin Rouge.It all starts out well and good. Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her kids are alone in their Jersey mansion. Their servants have disappeared into thin air and Grace's husband is lost at war. Then one day three strangers show up at their door. Mrs. Mills being the leader (Fionulla Flanigan) along with the gardener (Erik Sykes) and a mute girl, Lydia (Elaine Casasidy). Nicole needs the help so she hires them on the spot. She shows them the kids, Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann and James Bentley). The two have a rare disease that makes them break out in blisters and sores whenever light hits them. So atall time everyone must follow the simple rules. No door can be opened until the one you just walked through is locked and  make sure all curtains are closed.Soon enough strange things start to happen. Curtains open in the middle of the nights, crying is heard from someone who doesn't seem to be anywhere in the house, whispering is heard aswell as the piano being played inside the locked room when everyone is in bed. Could the house be haunted? Anne seems to think so. She claims to of seen them. There's Victor, a young boy, aswell as a mother and father and an old woman.Grace wont have a bar of it but she does start to suspect something but instead of the paranormal... she suspects the servents. And rightly so, they are damned creepy.Anyway. Along the way Grace's husband returns (played by Chris Eccleson) from war and the kids discover something sinister about the new servants.The movie is expertly made. Great performances by all involved (Nicole Kidman, Fionulla Flanigan and Alakina Mann being the standouts. I would love to see Nicole get an oscar for this but I liked Moulin Rouge more. A Supporting Actress nod could go the way of Fionulla or Alakina (Remember Anna Paquin got one when she was young!)). Alajandro Amenabar has created a world of haunting beauty. The interior scenes all have a great atmosphere and the rare outside scenes are given a wonderful touch or mystery by the surprisingly eerie use of fog). The directing, writing, cinematography, set design et cetera are all top notch.The ending is great. I never saw it coming. The subtle clues Alajandro gives us are good enough as to not give away the ending but to make us think whether what's happening is real/fake/imagined or possibly even a big nightmare (the movie starts with Grace waking up from a nightmare, screaming).Oh and there is some scary stuff going on in this film. We don't get scared anymore by the latest whiz-bang special effects (see Lost Souls, House On Haunted Hill) but Alajandro creates a sense of fear from what he are thinking. Take for example the scene where everyone in the house is asleep and then the downstairs piano in the locked room starts playing. We are unsure what is going on but we are all know something is going to happen and we get scared by that feeling. Special notice must go to the end scare with the kids in the closet... everyone in my cinema (600 people) jumped/screamed/curses/covered their eyes... everyone was caught by surprise.10/10 A+-SPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING FROM NOW-
The movie's ending, which has been called a rip-off of The Sixth Sense, is actually a lot better than that movie's ending. Where in that movie they gave it away with the obvious ""I see dead people"" line the ending of The Others is given away in a much more subtle way and is thus a lot harder to guess.I was totally taken by surprise with the ending. And in aftermath only started to piece it all together. ""Mother's gone mad... again"", Grace's migraine's, the husband coming back from war then leaving again, the curtains etc...excellent.A must see.",The Others
767,kojak-1,Breathtaking Classic,10,31 August 2001,"This is an excellent film, and trust me I am not a thriller fan. The peformance given by Kidman is simply outstanding.

Maybe it was meant to just make the audience dumber from watching it so that they would think that it was good. This movie rode on Nicole Kidman's coat tails, basically needing her fame to succeed with any type of movie-goer response.  i really cannot believe that i made it past the first hour... but i have a thing against walking out on movies.  the not-so-surprising twist at the end really leaves you with the feeling that you can never get the last two hours of your life back.  i could have been sleeping!",The Others
773,indie_music_martian,What A Film!,10,18 November 2001,all I can say is WOW!I was completely taken aback by this fab little thriller which actually spooked me!I went to see this yesterday and didnt really know what to expect-having only a 12 certificate I thought it wouldnt scare me and so went along anyway!I could not take my eyes from the screen throughout the entire movie-some say it was too slow but i really didnt notice anything slow and thought that the time flew by!The build up of tension was great and the whole film had a really edgey and spooky feel to it and then every so often there was a shock moment that made the entire audience jump from their seats!Nicole Kidman was amazing as were actually all the characters-particularly the two children who were really convincing. But the last 20 minutes of this film were the best-some say it ripped off another film *not mentioning any names* but i DID NOT think so. I really saw the first part of the twist coming and was disappointed thinking that this was the major twist-BUT then the twist arrived and smacked me on the head and i'm sure my jaw dropped to the ground! overall this movie is soooo good and much better than the average slasher as it has far more brains and actually builds up the scares rather than relying on gore infested scenes! see it NOW or you will regret missing it on the large screens-dont go alone! ***** 5/5,The Others
774,lennon_emu,A Big Disappointment!!,3,23 November 2001,"I had heard good things about this movie and arrived full of expectation but unfortunately left thinking what a complete waste of 2 hours. The film is very slow and I was constantly waiting for something to happen but it just never does. Despite valiant efforts the film failed to create any sort of atmosphere, despite the fact it commences in almost total darkness I was very rarely on edge. To me the film appears to be a feeble attempt to recreate the affect of the sixth sense but it fails miserably. The 'twist' at the end is rather predictable and even if you do not see it coming it does not fill you with any shock, you will just be anxious to escape the cinema by that time.  The only glimmer of light in this dismal production was the performance of Nicole Kidman who does carry the lead role very well, although talk of an Oscar may be a little optimistic. The film is entitled 'The Others' and I would recommend you see any of the other films available before this one.",The Others
775,okane,"A beautifully realised, scary film",10,8 January 2002,"A quick comment first: I loved this film.Of course that should be apparent from my review, but lets not leave it to chance.The Others is a reminder that a lot of work goes into making a film and that, at its best, cinema is art. The director, Alejandro Amenábar (try saying that three times after a few drinks), has done a superb job of crafting this film.The basic plot line involves a woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) who lives with her two photosensitive children in a mansion on Jersey, towards the end of the Second World War. They live alone with their newly hired servants as they wait for the return of the husband/father from the world war. Needless to say, there is a suspicion that the house is haunted and the tension skillfully generated in the film is a result of this suspicion.
The film succeeds in conveying a tangible feeling of Grace's isolation as she struggles to raise her, sometimes wilful, children alone. Amenabar, through the plotting, cinematography and soundtrack produces a stirring experience, the film is genuinely moving and totally involves the viewer.Nicole Kidman is magnificent as Grace and manages to say ""Oh"" 15 times in the same scene without it appearing repetitive, she acts with great subtlety appearing both fragile and strong at once. It does not hurt that she is also beautiful - Tom Cruise, what were you thinking?The other cast members are equally brilliant, with the children especially good. Alakina Mann was so good as the elder child that I wondered if it was an adult who had been minified (a-la Mini-Me) to play the part.In addition, the end of the film is a triumph. Before I saw the film I had heard that there was a Sixth Sense-like ending. I was straining my brain throughout the movie to ascertain what the twist could be. However, I did not see it coming, and, like all great twists, it made perfect sense in the context of the movie and left me with a wry smile on my face asking What the?This is cinema as it should be - well done to all involved.",The Others
776,arxantes,Not scary but extremelly clever,10,19 December 2001,"I don't want to say much about the film but only the main points. Here we have the establishment of a new genre, it is the school of ""sixth sense"" ladies and gentlemen. A very talented director, a script that deals with the life(sorry, death-life) of ghosts and an unexpected end. It was in fact a very good film and Nicole Kidman's performance was a surprise for me. Very good photography and direction.",The Others
777,sexy_grandpa,ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!! FLAWLESS!!! AN EASY 10/10!!!,10,10 January 2003,"I think I can positively say that this is easily the best movie of 2001! Definitely one of the best ever made! Where do I begin?ACTING: The acting in this film is absolutely amazing! Kidman puts on an extremely convincing performance as Grace. By far the best she has ever done. Fionulla Flanagan (is that what it is) is also exceptional and Ed Sykes is great and adds some humour to the movie without being stupid or ridiculous. But the absolute stars of the show were Alakina Mann and James Bentley as Graces two children! The acting these youngsters put on is absolutely MINDBLOWING!!! Mann (who plays Anne) is unspeakably brilliant as Anne and is totally convincing. It is very difficult to describe her performance. It is brilliant beyond words. Bentley, who plays Nicholas, is absolutely jawdroppingly brilliant also. He looks genuinely terrified in the suspense scenes. These two actors deserve a future in acting. But as we all know, most of the best kid actors end up going nowhere (see Danny Loydd from The Shining or Linda Blair from The Excorcist.) But enough of that now.DIRECTING: Alejandro Amenabar does outstanding direction in this film. The angles are all appropriate and add to the atmosphere. Not one is out of place.  The lighting is in my opinion the best ever in a film. The atmosphere of this film is truly intense.SCREENPLAY/SCORE: As well as directing the film, Alejandro Amenabar also wrote all of the screenplay and the score. These are both outstanding. The music adds to the creepy atmosphere and fits together perfectly.OTHER: One of the things I admire most about this film is the fact that it doesn't rely on Gore or visual effects of any sort to scare. There is not an ounce of violence in the entire film. Suspense is what scares the most, and this has it in bucketloads! There are a couple of shocks, but that doesn't make it at all less scary!MATTERS OF THE SIXTH SENSE: One thing about this fim I can't understand is the fact that people can possibly compare it to THE SIXTH SENSE, let alone call it a RIPOFF!!! The only thing that they have in common is the (!***SPOILER***!!!)twist at the end. Its like saying Apocalypse Now is a rippoff of The Deer Hunter because they were both set in the Vietnam war! I read a review on here saying it failed to capture the spirit of the 6th Sense. This is ridiculous! Its not even trying to catch that spirit! It is unique and IMHO is FAAAR superior to that movie!Another thing I fail to understand is that people say it is long, boring and slow. This is completely insane!!! The movie is only 100 minutes! I found every moment completely engrossing and entertaining! The people who thing it is slow must have a serious case of A.D.D!!! If you want slow and boring, watch the English Patient, because THE OTHERS is NOT SLOW!!!So if you havent seen this movie, I don't know what you could possibly be waiting for. Because in my heart, it is beyond classic status!",The Others
778,buddaht,The ends are not always worth the means.,5,18 April 2002,"Overall this movie was far too long and uneventful.  Once the movie is over you get a sense of revelation, and you say to yourself ""oh, thats what's going on"".  The ending almost saves the film, but not quite.  Having an interesting five minutes at the end of a movie does justify putting the audience to sleep for nearly two hours.

This was the first movie I've ever seen to actually send chills down my spine. Everything is done beautifully in order to create a genuine scary atmosphere. It doesn't use cheap tricks to be scary, it takes its time to build a good story and bring the audience into it. And I haven't even mentioned the ending yet. I guess all I have to say is that it took me a while before I was able ""got over"" what I had seen and get up and get on with my life. I went to see this film without knowing anything about it except that it was a thriller staring Nicole Kidman. Now I realize how lucky I was for that because it made the experience even more intense.

782,and-kuratov,"Too many goofs, too little fog",3,17 February 2019,"I've watched The Others for a second time and was largely disappointed. The horror movie proves to be abounding in goofs. How come the spectres move about so noisily? How come they sleep and eat to keep themselves alive? How could they make love to each other? How come they use keys to lock and unlock doors? How come they can hold (and keep) the keys, to say nothing of a rifle? How could the spectres remember everything but forget their own graves?
The director lets us see what happens to the papers as Grace tears them violently in front of the humans (we see only humans, no Grace). If Grace and her husband and kids are invisible to the human eye, then the rest is dark and trite comedy rather than horror.
I can hardly name another movie as rich in goofs and so blatantly one-off. You can enjoy it but once. And even then, after a while, you can't help putting too many uneasy questions to the director and his crew.",The Others

However this movie was so interesting that after 5 mins for finishing watching this movie, I thought of writing a review. Just like Sixth Sense, this movie has got a very interesting end. The end of this movie was the most interesting part.I never thought Nicole could act so well. Every character in this movie played a very important role.

784,melissaknepp,"Creepy, mysterious, chilling and amazing!!!!",9,24 April 2011,"What can I possibly say about this movie other than it's one of the most exceptional films ever made. The cinematography is wonderful, the score is pitch perfect, the acting is stellar, and the script is just chilling and fascinating. The Others is in a word: AMAZING!! The premise is simple. A woman (Nicole Kidman) lives in a secluded house with her two young children and is waiting on her husband (Christopher Eccleston) to return from the war. She hires three caretakers to come live with them and at that point, things begin to happen. I won't go into any major details here as to not ruin anything but suffice it to say, this movie will give you a genuine feeling of fright and will make you question many things after you have finished watching it. The movie is superb and I believe this film is one of the greatest of all time. I still can't quite understand how it got no Oscar consideration at all. This is one of Nicole Kidman's finest performances and Fionnula Flanagan is wonderful as the mysterious Mrs. Mills. The ending is quite simply brilliant and will leave you in such a profound place of shock for a few minutes afterward. If you have not yet seen this movie, trust me. You need to. It's too good to pass up.I give this movie a 9.5/10 and the only reason it doesn't get a 10 is due to a few minor details. It's not quite perfect but it's dang near close.",The Others

I can imagine that MAYBE you'd enjoy the movie slightly more if you hadn't known the twist and went in with a completely blank slate but even then I don't think I personally would've enjoyed it.

Personally I think Sixth Sense was a very good film with excellent performances but the so called twist was a little obvious. Surely it was obvious that Bruce Willis was already dead, he got shot at the beginning? He then had no interaction with anyone in the entire film apart from the boy, who could see ghosts, not to mentioned that he said halfway through the film that he sees dead people, but they don't know they're dead...Personally I enjoyed The Others more but Sixth Sense is really good film. Ghost stories are often associated with haunted & old houses The Others had atmosphere & great performances, particularly from Nicole Kidman. & the ending... I think Its rare that an entire film is taken from ghosts perspective so that was interesting & a different take on a familiar story. Some people may have seen the twist coming but it wasn't obvious that an entire family lived in the house & clairvoyant was trying to make contact.",The Others

789,sacredrite,The perfect ghost story,10,28 June 2005,"Only the mildest of spoilers.This movie is perfect. Normally, if I'm watching a horror movie, I prefer a balls-to-the-walls frightfest like 'The Excorcist'. And I'm always disappointed by horror movies with no gore. But after watching 'The Others', I think it actually might be my favorite horror movie ever. The dark atmosphere is delicious, the plot is just excellent, and all the performances are top-notch - especially that of Nicole Kidman, who despite her character's numerous flaws, manages to make you like her and care what happens to her. The dialog written for her character is so authentic; it's so refreshing to finally see a film set in the past where the characters actually use the appropriate kind of language & tone. The language in this film made me feel like I've never seen a 'period piece' with authentic language.'Rosemary's Baby' is often mentioned as a prime example of a film that creates a great sense of tension without any killing or monsters or gore. But I'd have to say that 'The Others' far surpasses 'Rosemary's Baby' in it's bloodless delivery. You are not left with any disappointment at all. After 'Rosemary's Baby', I thought ""Well done, but they should have at least shown the baby."" But 'The Others' is absolutely perfect. There is nothing that they should have shown. There is nothing that could have made it any better. And how nice to finally have a great horror movie that is truly spooky that you can actually watch with your kids?",The Others
790,llamalover350,Original Thriller,8,14 June 2005,"""The Others"", starring Nicole Kidman, sustains its classic horror setting without being super formulatic (though at times it is). It has a brilliant surprise ending, but some people may not understand it the first time watching.Grace Stewart (Kidman) is a stressed-out and enormously religious English housewife whose husband has gone off to fight in the war (I think it's World War 1). Her children are allergic to sunlight, and can only live by candlelight. The family lives in an enormous, evil-looking mansion on an English island, where it's always foggy and huge black gates protect the sizable estate. The house looms over the grounds, and - huge surprise! - there's a small cemetery in the back. Now who would guessed - a horror movie? With a cemetery?!!!! Anyways, Grace hires a crew to tutor the kids and be general servants. It's an odd crew, featuring a witch-like elderly lady, an equally wicked-seeming gardener, and a timid servant girl who never speaks a word (this part is awkwardly played by the actress). Once the crew is hired, strange things start to happen - including a stupendously filmed scene involving a forbidden piano playing in the night. Grace connects the bizarre happenings with the ever-odd crew, whose eccentricity seems to be growing with the surreality.Despite some awkward acting and horror movie deja vu, this is an amazing movie that will scare you long after you finish watching it.",The Others

Alejandro Amenábar has done a great job as a director. The acting of the entire crew is awesome. Nicole Kidman has given her best performance till date.

I was recommended this movie because I wanted a good, suspenseful movie with a plot twist (which is the only thing I got). Throughout the whole movie I remained bored. I was never once scared, although I did jump once. (But that does that really count?) This movie has a VERY predictable plot with two major plot twists, only one of which was good. The only scene I enjoyed contained the second plot twist. Which is why I was nice and rated this movie a 4. Nicole Kidman's performance was good, but the long, drawn-out and boring plot did not help her. As I feel as though I wasted two hours of my life, during which I could have watched a way better movie, I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good scare.

In this movie, the War is the reason behind Grace's madness because her husband, Charles, had died on the front. She went mad, suffocated her kids and committed suicide.
However, symbolically, the title of the movie, "" The Others"" stands for Germans who are intruders.

Not to mention that everything so chaotic you don't realize why things go that way you don't realize why the boring characters act that way. I'm not sure if the director realized what should be the next scene, so he just filmed everything in a chaotic manner.

Me and the friends that watched the film together even laughed at several scenes. I think that in a good horror film this isn´t suposed to happen.

798,Falcon-43,"Wow, what can I say. The best movie I've seen all year.",10,1 November 2001,"It was with some trepidation that I went to see the Others. Although I'd heard a lot of good things about it, I've just recently seen Jeepers Creepers, and had begun to fear that all of this years hallowe'en movies were going to suck. Over the first 45mins, I really thought I had made a mistake, little did I know that the film was slowly and cunningly drawing me deeper and deeper into the story. Although it is very slow to build, without this, it would have fallen flat on its face very quickly. You can't help but begin to feel for the characters and you also find yourself terrified of the house.Not only does this film encourage you to second guess the events as they unfold, it is constantly revealing tiny snippets of plot which throw you straight off the scent. In fact, it is so clever that any more mention of the plot will spoil the entire film. Suffice to say that the Sixth Sense'll never know what hit it when this film opens.Nicole Kidman was excellent. She really is a good actress, the nuances of her performance, and her interaction with her children and the servants is superb. Mrs Mills (can't remember the actresses name) was also great. The real revelation of the movies was the two young children. They gave great performances laced with terror, but with a humourous touch. Their childhood naivety conflicting with the things they have read and seen.Recently, I've noticed a trend for the studios to reveal far too much of the story in the trailers for their films. For example, all of the funny parts of American Pie 2 were in the trailer, slightly dulling their impact in the film. Those of you who have seen the trailer for The Others may think that you've seen most of the plot and that it will have been spoiled. Don't be fooled, the trailer hardly scratches the surface of this wonderful piece of film-making.Overall, I can hardly fault it. The acting is fantastic, the direction is superb. The lighting was uniformly excellent. But most of all, the plot and story were thrilling. Go see this film. But if anyone tries to talk to you about it, cover your ears and run away. You really want to enjoy it in all its glory.",The Others
799,Nicholàs,Very cleverly-conceived movie (contains spoilers),9,6 July 2003,"Alejandro Amenábar did a superb job on the screenplay for this movie. Also, the set, casting and acting were near-perfect.Many people have complained how this film was a ""rip-off"" of the Sixth Sense, but I disagree. For a start, the screenplay for The Others was apparently written before The Sixth Sense even came out; and secondly, the twist contained in The Others was superior.The Sixth Sense for me contained only one point of shocking realisation -- only one critical moment where everything you saw previously got turned on its head.The Others, however, contained a whole series of such moments. For instance, the first minor revelation came when the whole attitude of Mrs Mills changed -- it was at this point that I became very suspicious of the three servants. Such suspicions were confirmed when I heard the servants' comments about the gravestones and the difficulty of ""convincing"" the children and their mother.The second revelation came when the two children escaped the house and Anne saw the names on the three gravestones. Only half of the twist registered with me at this point.The third revelation appeared when Grace meets up with ""The Others"" -- and then I finally realised that the true nature of Grace, her children, and the three servants was indeed all the same.But the final revelation was the one that completely turned everything on its head. It took me a couple of seconds after Grace's confrontation with""The Others"" before the true gravity of this astounding twist registered with me.Overall, The Others is a film that I enjoyed thoroughly. It does not rely upon your stereotypical Hollywood special effects to cause fear, but rather it relies upon the psychological impact that it creates with its incredibly sombre, haunted atmosphere. It is a movie which must be watched at least twice so that you can go back and see how the whole twist fits in flawlessly with the storyline.I give this film 9/10.",The Others

801,robinhud,"a very good film, with a beautiful very clever N. Kidman",10,18 April 2002,"I went to see this movie without knowing anything about it. I was soon fascinated by the atmosphere of this movie, a dark, gothic one, that reminded me the great movies of 50 years ago. N. Kidman (I hadn't still seen her as actress in a movie and I was doubtful about her real cleverness)is simply beautiful, she reminds me Grace Kelly in Hitchcock's, and very very clever, perfect in her part. The movie is very well made, good photography, peculiar care, dark serious atmosphere, original and surprising plot. I gave the vote 9 : it was really a fine surprise!",The Others
802,matteblacke,Shyamalan only better...,10,18 November 2001,"A mother on the edge and her two children in a creepy fogbound house, complete with odd servants. The film creates a rising atmosphere of oppressive, paranoid dread that makes you feel genuinely uncomfortable and disturbed. Kidman's performance is faultless as a woman who appears to be teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown. Her highly strung characterisation only serves to complement the sense of foreboding that flows through the film. Brilliantly, the film gives nothing away, and throws nothing at you, but leaves you to do the work - acknowledging that the viewer's imagination is far more vivid than any film-maker's art. Very little, physically, happens in the film - but by the end you feel as if you have run a marathon. The final denouement is something to behold - and will have a certain director of 6th sense weeping into his morning coffee. BRILLIANT. WATCH THIS THIS FILM!!!",The Others

It is a change to see a spooky movie without loads of Digital Effects and just with good acting and music. It confirms the old saying that the most frightening things are the things we can't see. I won't say what the ending was but there was a ghost story on ITV television about 25 years ago with the same title and the same basic story, though with less actors. I can't find it on the IMDb but it was very highly praised at the time. I doubt if any recording exists of it now so it must be coincidence that this movies has the same plot and title. I recall the same can be said of Topsy Turvy which was almost exactly the same as a TV play about G&S about thirty years ago.",The Others

I am a big fan of films that follow the ""less is more"" school of thought ... no flashy effects ... just a great story and a lot of well crafted suspense.  Unlike some others who have commented on this film, I have an attention span that lasts more than two minutes and did not feel that this movie was slow paced at all.The Others is a suspence film ... not a horror film and is better labeled as ""Haunting"" or ""Spooky"" and not ""Scary"".

I love this film. I've appreciated the details, the development of the script, the real thoughts of the characters. Please see the face of Fionnula Flanagan: she's obviously thinking on another things (the true secret of the others and themselves) when she talks. Also, is the daughter telling the truth or a lie? This film doesn't tell a story like another films do. This film is giving us information about the past life of the characters from the beginning to the end. It's a discovery movie. It has got the most perfect scares I've seen in a movie in years. It's full of suspense too. Amenábar is a very clever guy. And the best of all: he's young!, he can do a lot of masterpieces like this in the following decades. We the Spanish are very proud of him.The end is not only original, is wonderful too, plenty of humanity. I've cried with the final family hug, when they find all out. It's a very beautiful story about a family. Can you see? Crying in a scary movie! Because of that this is a very different film. Finally, the cast is simply perfect. Can a woman be so beautiful? (I'm talking about Nicole Kidman). Can a laugh be so innocent and frightening? (I'm talking about the daughter). A note: this script is previous to The Sixth Sense.The Others will be remembered for a long time among the people in the world and will be studied at cinema schools.(I'm sorry if I've written some spelling or grammatical mistakes)",The Others

Genuinely frightening - the kids all around who were chatting and giggling at the beginning stopped about halfway through and paid attention, and my wife actually bit me on the shoulder in the piano scene...My only qualm was that the concluding revelation scenes were, I felt, a little overwritten - the film didn't need quite so much explanation.

As for Nicole Kidman's acting...WOW!!!...what an actress! She will be robbed if overlooked by the Academy Awards for her performance of Grace, a woman on the verge of a ghostly mental breakdown.  With the exception of Dead Calm and To Die For, I've never been a fan of Kidman's.  But after viewing her magnificent performance in this past spring's Moulin Rouge and now The Others, I am proud to admit that she is my favorite film actress of modern day.

But at first it did not seem to indicate that the hostess was different, but that she had come across three particularly different servants there was also a strange family in the room, the presence of her husband, and so on the Qing festival hinted that the audience was not so simple. The play did not directly show that she had killed her children, perhaps such a story is sad, but think about it, she is also forced by feelings, love is not there, only she alone to look after the sick child, can think of that kind of her desire for love.

Although there are indubitably some classic horror flicks that I deem satisfactory, I find myself often hoping that there must be some stones left unturned. Unfortunately, this film was quick to disappoint: I found it to be unoriginal in plot and slow-paced in execution. However, there were a couple of redeeming points-- Nicole Kidman's performance which I find to be rarely disappointing, as well as the revelation at the end that I actually did not predict, thus saving the movie from being an utter disaster. I find it tastefully done in some aspects that the film does not rely on blood and gore to portray its horror, but it fell flat in more ways than one. Painfully mediocre.",The Others

I spent the better part of the first 45 minutes of this film waiting for something suspenseful to actually happen.  Slamming and creaking doors just didn't do it for me.Most people will figure out the ending long before the people in the back wake up from their nap.One scene has Nicole Kidman check out the upstairs piano room.  She locks the piano cover so that no one can play it.  After the door slams shut as she leaves, she returns to find the piano unlocked again.

I'll say this, if you don't see the ending coming half way through this movie, or sooner, then your dumber than a post (and that's insulting dead wood).  The visuals of this movie were nice and there were a few ""boo"" parts that left a few giggling with nervous laughter in the theatre after they were scared, but on the whole I was disappointed that the ending was broadcast so far in advance. My recommendation, wait for the rental or better yet cable or rent the original version of The Haunting, The Haunting of Hill House or The Haunting with Liam Neeson (a bad version but still more scary than The Others).",The Others

No crazy graphics... No disgusting/flying creatures... and no tasteless and cheap Hollywood 'CGI' scares!
Creative camera work, Clever integration of sound and music, a creepy cast in a creepy environment... and a version of Nicole Kidman that only Tom Cruise knows, all make for a chilling film.The movie traps you in an old fashioned way and probably should have been filmed in Black and White.

Borrowed theme but still worthy of theater viewing.,10,11 August 2001,"I've never been a Nicole Kidman fan, but found her disturbingly authentic here as a prim and proper widow on the edge of her coping skills.  Her neurotic orthodoxy and nunnery-brand discipline are simply crutches to carry her character through what would be a ghastly existence of having to raise children in a large, necessarily dark and gloomy mansion... while silently grieving the loss of husband and father killed the war.  Who wouldn't go a little nutty under such circumstances?The Others does borrow from the plot of another recent hit movie, but is different enough in style and execution that it certainly warrants a movie theater viewing.

The writing of this movie was brilliantly written and was undoubtedly portrayed from the opposite side and/or ""Other"" side.  It was suspenseful, yet boring if you can understand that.  The mom (mum) (Nicole Kidman) was one of most uptight, dead ghost I've ever seen in my life.  I mean, get a grip, lay down already. I guess she was the ghost with the most!  The daughter definitely had issues and the son, if not already dead, would have definitely needed therapy and a good psychiatrists couch for the rest of his life.  I pretty much figured out what was going on during the first 15 minutes of the film and I really was not surprised.  It was kind of stupid that the husband would come back and be sitting on the bed right across from the mirror and have no reflection, and in the same instance, in the attic, Nicole Kidman has a reflection and they are both dead.  In any event, this movie left a lot to be desired.  It was ok for what is was, but it was nothing like I expected.

Many here have blamed this movie for being ""too slow"", but I always figured it was building towards something. How could you call it slow, when at every turn the plot cleverly, shifted the gaze of suspicion from one set of characters to others.HUUUUGGGGEE Spoilers Below:
Yes, I said HUGEEE, so tread forward at the risk of ruining your own film experience :PPlot was full of these subtle twists and excellent exchanges. For instance, Initially my suspicions were about Mrs.Mills, Mr.Tuttle and Lydia being just ordinary humans who probably came in there to scare Grace and her family away. (Which was kinda reaffirmed by the fishy exchange of dialogues between Mr.Tuttle and Mrs.Mills (Mr.T and Mrs. M from here on..) Then towards the end when they figured that Mr.T, Mrs.M and Lydia(L) had been dead for so long, my hunch was that they want to get rid of Grace and her family, but the trio of L, Mr.T and Mrs. M are obviously not human. Then the scene towards the end when, those 3 are standing outside the door of the Mansion and they say that, we know what's to be done, right now you are in there with intruders and your kids. I thought the ""intruders"" must be ghosts and Grace and her kids are in danger.... but the climax was awesome...the whole scene where the realization sets in was as good as the SIxth Sense climax.
MY QUESTIONS: 1. Movie didn't give and explanation as to why Grace killed the kids (with the pillows). Not that it is very relevant, but I Think the clue to this was when Anne said to Nicholas ""remember the last time mom had gone mad""...Maybe she was depressed at the loss of her husband or felt cheated by his absence and missing love. Although all this perfectly explains, why she was overprotective of her kids and actually said that she was happy to see Ann still alive after pillow episode and was thankful to the lord for giving her aother chance.2.Also, although we could figure that Grace's husband was dead too (No image in the mirror,when they were talking on the bed), and also the fact that he didn't eat even once despite being so weak, or Slept with his eyes open. Then why did Grace and her family do the normal human things like eating and sleeping. My hunch is that because they still had not realized what they were and there are no obvious harms of doing those things.",The Others

The irony is that the reason the movie succeeds is also the major problem I have with the film.  The movie owes a lot of its spirit (no pun intended) to the Sixth Sense.  Problem is, the pay-off to The Others is essentially identical to that of its predecessor.  I couldn't help feeling a small bit of ""Oh, not THAT story again..."" at the end of this film.  It seemed a little TOO similar for my taste.That said, this film is a great one on its own, and I enjoyed it tremendously.  I didn't have the same issues with pacing that some people have had.

I try to see all horror films, because I like to be scared, but until this movie I haven't ever really been scared.

Yes, it starts so quick, you get into the mansion and into the plot so fast, and after that you could see that time stops. But it's because time has really stopped. I won't do any spoiler about the film, but all the ""slowness"" that people find is the way to show how is Grace suffering, you have to live with her every second of agony. The film is superbly elegant, and this ""slowlyness"" is a important part of it. I really think that the only mistake is the trailer, it's trying to sell a horror movie, and it's really not. It makes you jump a couple of times, but it is not so scary. It's by far a drama, with a suspense atmosphere. And it's great. And about the final, it's by far the better I've seen in years. Predictable or not, I won't complain on that, because there are SO many clues all about the film. And it's not like the Sixth Sense, its simply the other point of view!

841,claudinev,A chilling and unique experience,10,14 September 2001,"I have always been an avid fan of horror films but despite of this, I still can decipher which are the good ones and which are the bad ones. Personally, this is one of the good ones.  I extremely loved this film! It's story is truly original, one that you thought you knew how the story goes, and then suddenly you find out that your wrong.  And then from there you think you know how the story goes, and then BOOM, you're wrong again. This is one of the things you don't expect in a horror film.  In most horror movies, you expect to be scared from right to left with the bombardment of visual effects, scaring you with what is on the surface.  Werewolves, vampires, witches, ghouls, or ghosts and the looks of them and how they mingle with characters in a film are mostly what keeps a horror film going. But this one had an added element, a good twist!  The twist of the story line is very good.  It came rather unexpected and surprising which made this film worth seeing.It is also because of this, that personally, I believe why The Sixth Sense was such a success. Something new and something that wasn't just merely a kid who saw dead people.  We've seen a lot of films where people can see dead people and that somehow they find out that they need to help the spirits of these dead people.  But personally, I think what made this movie good was something that no one was expecting, the nature of the character Bruce Willis played.  But between the two films, I liked The Others more in that I never guessed the outcome.  In The Sixth Sense, I've had friends who said that somehow they got the twist of the movie, but with The Others, they, including me, didn't.I highly recommend this film and I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed with the performances of Nicole Kidman, Alakina Mann, James Bentley and the rest of the cast.  The spooky backdrop, the sombre costumes, terrific performances and the great twist made watching this movie a chilling and unique experience.",The Others

I like when a movie can trick me into the unexpected.  The Others is a definite must see, and on a scale of 1 to 10, is a 10 in my book.  I am going to recommend this movie to my friends. I did not expect it to be as creepy as it was,  the dark feeling to it made the movie that much more enjoyable.  After all I am a fan of the macabre. This is my must see movie of the year, and is now on my list of favorites. See it, and hopefully you will love the movie as much as I did.",The Others

After seeing the trailer one could think this movie is indeed very cool, but IMHO the trailer shows you all the good stuff and there is nothing more in the movie itself.Maybe I've seen movies like The 6th Sense too much, but I could figure the whole plot after a few minutes... Furthermore I almost felt asleep during the movie, 'cause it was SO very slow. No excitement at all! Dull is an understatement for this movie! No horror, no sudden, scary moments, nothing at all...So was it all bad? No, I also agree with ppl here who say Nicole Kidman did a gr8 acting performance.

This is definitely one of the best movies I have seen in a while.This movie was also beautifully cast. Nicole Kidman did a great job and the mother. I thought the mother was a nut case and Kidman did a great job portraying that. I also fell in love with Lydia. Although she did not speak, I found her to be somewhat ""adorable"".

Its about a governess who comes to take care of a young girl and insists the house is haunted but can't prove it. It was a very chilling movie for its time so it should be worth the time to find it and/or watch it. You might want to consider it if you can find it anywhere.

A genuinely creepy and unsettling film with moments of sheer unadulterated terror - the scene in which the little girl is trying on a bridal dress, for example, is particularly nightmarish... I'll say no more.Avoid finding out too much about the plot before seeing the film, and in particular make sure no one tells you how it's going to end. Should anyone reveal the devastating twist to you, you would be quite justified in cutting off his ears.",The Others

But it doesn't work, because these are all stereotypes. The only stress I got from this movie was because of it's stupidity - there's no logic. Why don't they all leave the house if they are so afraid? Why is the mother not going to a doctor with their children who both have this strange disease? --- The only answer can be: because then there's no plot for a movie.

In my opinion it is tied with Sixth Sense as the best movie of it's type.  The ending is as good as Sixth Sense where it really all hits you at once, and there is not much chance of guessing it using foresight.A good friend of mine pretty much summed up my current feeling on movies: The longer the movie goes before you ""get it"" the better the movie is; until the ending, where if you don't ""get"" everything, it becomes a very bad movie.Following that line of thinking I think it is one of the best movies lately. However, about half of the people that I have talked to now, I have had to explain the ending.  My guess is that if you ""get"" the end, you will put it along with your favorite movies, otherwise you will feel like you have wasted your time.I would have compare the movie along the lines of ""Sixth Sense"" for it's general direction, and surprise ending.  The ending however is as good as movies like ""Momento"", ""The Game"", and other movies where you never quite know what you are in for.",The Others
863,lassebo,Great horror film,10,13 June 2002,"This is movie is one of the best I have seen in the thriller-genre. All actors do an amazing job, thoroughly directed by the young director Alejandro Amenábar from Chile.What Amenábar uses instead of computer graphics and explosions, is the art of being subtle. Things are often more frightening when you don't see them, but can only sense them or hear them. The movie itself is very brilliant visually, and Amenábar has made the eerie music that goes with it, too.
Though the story takes place on a british island in 1945, the location (a house) was found in northern Spain. The house, that is the 'frame' of the whole story, had to have some gothic elements without being a stand-out cliché. The house they found was perfect for this story. One final thing I have to praise, is the acting of Nicole Kidman, but also of the 2 children. Alakina Mann and James Bentley acts so naturally, that one can not help believing their characters and being swept into their tiny world. This movie is a modern classic that will have a special place in my heart forever. An absolute 'must' for thriller-fans!",The Others

It has been worth the wait. This is the first time I have ever had goosebumps all over my head! I am usually completely unaffected by so-called ""thrillers"" and I find horror movies to be laughable. But ""The Others"" is in a class by itself.After my first viewing of this beautifully-acted, beautifully-filmed, intelligently written story, I had what I call ""movie hangover"" for a couple of days. I was intrigued, and I knew I would watch it again. Scenes and lines kept coming back to me, along with the impression of all of the amazing performances in the film.Tonight I watched it for the second time, sharing it with my two 13-year-old sons. They were blown away, and wanted to discuss it long after it was over. We talked about not only the movie, but also questions of the nature of life and death. For me, the second viewing was far, far richer than the first, as I was able to pick up on dozens of clues about which I was ""clueless"" the first time around. My boys can't wait to see it again.

The only one which I thoroughly enjoyed was the subtitled French Film, ""A Pure Formality"".  At least back in 1996 it made me interested.One friend told me that this film was very scary.  In fact they had trouble sleeping afterward.  I find that almost laughable now...  Once you discover the stale theme (and sadly I was about 15 minutes into the movie and I almost turned it off), then the ""scary"" scenes (all three or four of them) become almost senseless.I also got rather bored with the plot apart from the overplayed ""twist"". How many times can the woman mistreat her children and complain about being trapped in the house in the first half of the movie?

And that, that is very disappointing indeed. It may not be very long, but it certainly feels like it. But I admit that Nicole Kidman's constant terror of every single object in the house, whether it's door-knobs, skillets or furniture, will make your skin crawl.

The acting I thought was brilliant from the two kids (especially Anne) and from Mrs. Mills. Kidman, on the other hand, horribly overacted in a couple parts.

If you think deeper,the idea of photophobia is really genius!It sets a really dark and atmospheric setting where the plot takes place.Moreover,it is one of the very few films of its kind,which does not make you wonder:""Why the hell don't they turn on the lights?""or""Why don't they open a window""etc. The plot has many surprises,some of which quite predictable I must admit,but it manages to keep the viewers interest till the end.Nicole Kidman is quite convincing and shows that she can be a very good actress.

881,myselfishgene2004,The Best Psychological Horror Of The Decade,9,5 June 2004,"Before deciding to right this review, i read the reviews on Amazon and on the IMDb. After reading these, I got so wound up about people saying that this film is not scary or is boring that i wrote this. This IS a horror film, granted not an obviously scary film or a slasher film. If you like films like Friday 13th then the chances are you won't like this. This is a very intelligent film and granted very slow, however this enhances the tension and the ambiance of the film.The acting is near perfect with Kidman putting on a fantastic performance. However for me Flanagan is the stand out star. She is both genuine yet creepy at the same time. Another reason why this film is so clever is that it is completely unreliant on special effects which is a very pleasing to see, and the isolation the character feels is emphasized by the location on a Gothic country house on Jersey.There are only a handful of characters which is another pleasing sight so you are not always trying to remember names. The children are very well acted although the boy has a tendency to be rather annoying especially in the last two scenes. You genuinely felt empathy for the characters and you cared about them unlike in recent films.As for the twist at the end, anyone who says they predicted the twist in the first twenty minutes, is lying. The ending is truly surprising and appropriate.I love this film and the DVD is one of my favourite in my collection. The film has replay value but is best watched when its dark.

The atmosphere was chilling and the actual plot was a very well written and quite a scary ghost story. Its a shame the movie was let down completely by acting. What could have been a great psychological horror ruined by a cast that seem to think they are in a comedy film. The accents, the facial expressions and some of the dialogue (more how it was expressed) made parts of what could have been one of the best horror films of the 2000's unwatchable. I gave this movie a 3/10 but i can understand why it is rated highly down to the plot. Id say if you have plenty of spare time watch this movie anyway if you can see past the terrible acting, if not i recommend 'the orphanage' a similar but much better acted Spanish film that will genuinely creep you out",The Others

Is it possible she did this because the Nazis occupied the island? I agree with other posters that this did seem WWI, the clothing anyway. Her commitment to quiet, lack of phone and radio only added to this.Why didn't the dead servants want her to go to the priest? Wouldn't it be good if she discovered she was dead?

I guess most of the people who watched this title don't know the movie IS NOT a Hollywood production. It was done before than ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" and therefore it's impossible that the movie would have copied the idea of ""The SS"".Maybe specially people used to watch typical Hollywood productions find this movie different because of lack of the over and over again repeated special effects and might consider this title disappointing. I really enjoyed it. I am not specially fan of Nicole Kidman but I must admit that her work was refined and beautiful. Amenabar did a perfect job as a director, the kids were believable, the secondary roles were done with good taste and professionalism.

Anne (Alakina Mann), the daughter of Grace, informs her mother that there are other people in the house, but her mother does not believe her. In the end, the true ghosts of the movie were the main characters themselves. Grace, Grace's children, and the servants are haunting a family in that very house.The Others is a very good horror film. From the beginning to the end, The Others will keep the audience guessing what will happen next. There are many plot twists throughout the movie so the audience never expects what will happen next. The ending of the movie has a plot twist, which makes the audience think. Because of the ending, the audience now knows why everything happened. The whole movie ties together and doesn't leave the audience confused.It is dull at times, however, each scene is very suspenseful. Suspense is what makes The Others such a good movie. Also, the mechanics of the film are flawless. Music plays into the suspense the audience feels. It is very eerie, and keeps the audience alert and on their toes. Each scene has perfect lighting. The lighting adds mystery to the movie since no one knows what's going to appear. The ending of the movie is a plot twist. Grace, her family, and the servants are really haunting the family living in that house. By including this scene, the audience understands what has been happening the whole movie. Everything comes together in the end making the audience satisfied with what they have watched.",The Others
886,millienj,Performance is important,10,29 May 2005,"As a future film director, the look the film is different than any other drama. A space within the main house that was set us as if you were to sympathized with the house and its characters. The house has a scary heartbeat and breathes on the back of the necks of its residence. The atmosphere itself is one that plays to its own script and the director Aleandro Amenabar feeds on that but camera shot that can show the life of the house. Nicole Kidman's intonation and eye can speak and play off of each other. Since The Others is not the typical horror/drama film it was able to set up its own beat that it marches to very well.",The Others
887,srivignesh-bs94,Perfect thriller!!!,9,28 January 2015,"Do you want to watch a movie with COOL turns and FANTASTIC screenplay? Then here it is... Yeah!!I watched this movie recently with my mum and bro. The goosebumps!!! Wooaoww. Unable to explain... Will chill you.. So, I wanna share some bits here.Nicole Kidman pours down her best acting skills in this movie. Alejandro Amenabar's direction will force you to bite nails (if you have them grown :P)Even though the scary sounds and music doesn't play a major role here (as it does in many movies), the variation in the expressions shown by Nicole and scenes will surely amuse. What? Wait! Will amuse you until the CLIMAX part.The relationship between Nicole and her children are beautifully portrayed. It shows how one should and shouldn't take care of their children. They are extremely cute and you will love them throughout. And the servants, of course, somehow they get involved in this Mother-Children religious life.Oh yeah! The climax. Well, you won't expect this kind of climax. You can't digest this final sequence. Perfect ending. Finally, this movie is a good one to watch. A perfect nail-biting Thriller. It's not like THE OTHERS. Must watch for all SUSPENSE LOVERS. You wont get disappointed! For sure!!I would give 9/10 :)",The Others
888,fionajgifford,one of the best horror movies i've seen in a while,10,1 November 2014,"With all the terrible horror movies I've seen before I was really hoping this was going to be a good one and it definitely was, with a fantastic cast and brilliant acting from all the actors and an amazing storyline it was definitely worth watching. Nicole Kidman in particular was fantastic in portraying her character with so much emotion which really helped to convey the deep issues of the movie. Without giving anything away it is a great story from start to finish with plenty of jumps and some tense moments and an ending that completely shocked me I would say it's actually worth watching just for that aspect alone. I would definitely recommend it.",The Others

Seriously.. yeah I know, total spoiler but you were going to find out anyway, might as well let you know before you get even more disappointed.Appearing as 'your typical ghost story' is complete rubbish.

891,simondavies852,"Excellent first class ghost film, a rarity",10,22 May 2005,"Not much time to write, but wanted to say that this is a first class ghost film, for people who like genuine suspense/chills, and a clever twist and interesting storyline. Most importantly for me, it is realistic and fulfills my belief in ghosts without overdoing the connection between 'living' and 'dead' worlds i.e. the whole thing is believable if you believe in ghosts unlike many so-called horror films which rely on silly sudden 'shocks' or effects or people with half their face hanging off but forget the underlying realism that is needed; you could probably find faults with it if you wanted to but if you want a creepy ghost film which has a sinister undertone throughout, and a few, although I would say enough, real shocks, then this is highly recommended. Yes there is a similarity between the endings when compared to The Sixth Sense, but that does not detract from the originality of this story; the ending in my opinion is absolutely superbly done, not a let-down at all. Also, well-directed and acted. The maid has a wonderful ambiguity about her, she is warm and understanding while also distant and a bit spooky - fantastically done. Sorry, need to expand more on this but gotta go. Simon",The Others

I watched this one because of Nicole Kidman, who is, in my opinion, the most amazing actress I've ever seen, and I knew she'd make the movie good.But, it wasn't just Nicole Kidman who was amazing! The whole movie was! Full of twists and turns, and sometimes you're so sure of the answer, then you find out you're completely wrong! I won't spoil this movie for you, but I'll tell you know, the ending is so unpredictable it's amazing! I could watch it over and over again...oh, wait. I already have! GO SEE IT NOW!

After the arrival of three mysterious servants and the horrifying evidence thats there's something at the house that can't be alive, Grace is suddenly immersed in a chilling fight to save her children and to stay sane.World-wide acclaimed by the critics, the unpredictable turns of this acclaimed film will keep you at the edge of your seat for the entire 95 minutes.",The Others
894,Valtter,Very nice movie with a good atmosphere,8,22 August 2005,"The movie is a story about a woman living in a big house with her two kids and servants. Her husband is in war and the kids have an extraordinary allergy with sunlight, so the rooms must be darkened at all times the kids are around. Suddenly strange things start to happen in the house and the family is starting to figure out that everything isn't completely normal. Normally i hate horror movies and Hollywood thrillers, especially psychological thrillers (meaning the main character is a schizophrenic)but this movie made an exception. If you like to keep up a good tight tension while watching a movie i really recommend this one! Nicole Kidman played her role convincingly and the plot was interesting throughout the movie. It kept in few sudden scary moments which made my heart stop but mainly it was a interesting film that kept me hooked all the time. |!!This part may contain a small spoiler!!| The only thing i didn't like about the film was that the ending was totally the same as in Sixth Sense: All the main characters were actually dead and the dead ones were the ones living. I mostly enjoyed this movie more than the Sixth Sense but the final catch was the one thing i think they shouldn't have copied. After all the Others was a really enjoyable movie that you shouldn't miss.",The Others
895,wera33,"The child was allergic to sunlight , the mother was frustrated and killed the children.",6,8 November 2005,"The movie started in a very unorganized and mysterious way.After seeing the house you can tell there is a big secret behind those walls. Kids allergic to sunlight doesn't seem right and real. The mother is just crazy and insecure, left by her husband who went to war (later on when he is coming back for a couple days and then he leaves again, even though he really doesn't have to) . We would recommend the movie to the people who like to analyze and solve problems which appear in the movie.It takes a person who is very interested in this kind of movie to be able to get it.If you are not interested you won't get the moral of the movie.",The Others
896,patricia-pristasova,Critique-The Others,9,21 November 2005,"Though we see the family of three is very knowledgeable in the bible, by the end of the film we see that the mother loses faith in what she has devoted her entire life to. After taking the life of her children and her own, she believes that God has given her another chance when she pulls the trigger and she is still standing there. In the end, when she comes to the realization with the fact that she is a ghost, she is confused about the existence of God. It is our opinion that she loses the belief that there ever was a supreme being. There is no explanation as to why this has happened to them. One of the last lines in the story is the housekeeper saying that the mute girl's last lines were ""What now?"" We feel that Grace came to realize that there is no God. She has come to the finalized thought that she is to live in that house, their house.This is why we recommend this story. It is a story that could appeal to any type of audience that like suspense, mystery, question of beliefs or just have some time to spare.",The Others
897,robmccolley,An assault on your ears,1,1 November 2017,"There's an Oscar for good sound editing. As far as I know, there aren't criminal penalties for egregiously awful sound editing.In this case, the sound editor may not be to blame. It's got to be a directorial choice. Jarring noises are the primary tool for provoking shock.These explosions of sound will probably make you jump. Apart from that, there's not much that's scary about the movie. There aren't any evil characters.Apart from waking your neighbors and permanently damaging your hearing, the huge imbalance of sound levels will insure that you spend the duration of the film manipulating the volume.

I recommend this movie because of all this. But even more because I can't get this movie out of my head. The end is very very good. Please take the time for this one!! I hope you enjoy this one too.

902,luizhenriqueayalazimermann,THE OTHERS REVIEW,8,23 October 2018,"ARE THERE REALLY ""OTHERS""?
For most people classic creepy movies will always be the best ones. Movies like ""The sixth sense"", ""The others"", ""Meet Joe Black"" and ""When a stranger calls"" are some of the unforgettable horror, thriller and drama movies of all time. More fascinating than the great scenery of second world war (1945) is Nicole Kidman's performance as Grace, the main character of ""The others"", a thriller movie premiered in 2001.
Grace is a devout, determined and protective woman who lives in a huge mansion in Jersey, the Channel Islands, who is waiting her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) return from the war. She's the mother of two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), who suffer from a terrible disease against sun light, what makes the house always seem dark, mysterious and scary. Grace also has some weird rules in the house. Another door can't be open before the previous one is locked.
The story really begins when some new candidates appear out of the blue, even without Grace requesting them, to substitute the employees who had disappeared. The new employees, Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and a speechless young woman called Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) seem to know the house very well and have a bunch of secrets.
While the movie runs, Anne starts talking to a boy called Victor and his family. She tells her mother, but she doesn't believe in her daughter. After a few times, when she listens the piano playing, even though it's locked, she starts believing there's someone else between those 50 rooms.
Besides, when Grace is looking after the invaders she finds a book with pictures of all families that had lived in that house before. That's the time all parts of the movie are connected and it goes to the supernatural world. Most characters also talk about ""the day Grace got crazy"", which makes us watch it until the end and it has an unexpected ending.
The Australian actress (Nicole Kidman) is the only well-known actor in the cast, but as well the movie is amazing. The Chilean-Spanish director, Alejandro Amenámer, in just 105 minutes, really made a mixture and a great relation between the living and the dead world, also reaffirming the real power of the connection between the members of a family. This is an astounding movie for the ones who likes supernatural stories and a little fright.",The Others
903,hpnemes,Greatest film of horror industry!,10,27 June 2007,"Tremendous film! A magnificent thriller! It's definitely needs to be seen. Fine Nicole Kidman's playing only strengthens impressions of film. Brilliant film! The best horror-movie since Alfred Hitchcock's times. Having looked this film really you start to fall in love with it. If you really appreciate horror-films, you simply should not pass a picture ""The Others"". Film is removed so stylishly and unusually, that it is pleasant to watch it. All film holds public in a pressure. The fine atmosphere created by the maestro Alejandro Amenabar combined with an original plot and perfect actors. Film is an unequivocal masterpiece! 10 +!",The Others
