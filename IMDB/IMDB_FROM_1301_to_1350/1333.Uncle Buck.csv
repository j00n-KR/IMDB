0,TheLittleSongbird,A seriously overlooked jewel of a comedy!,8,11 May 2009,"There are some very negative critical reviews on this movie, which I think personally is unjustified. This film is very funny indeed, especially when the bowling ball falls on Buck's head. John Candy gives possibly his best performance here as Buck Russell. John Candy was one talented actor, evident in Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Cool Runnings, and I think comedy lost a truly great actor when he died, and I don't think he ever got the respect he so rightly deserved. This film is very funny indeed, sometimes the jokes are a little over-familiar, and the sentimentality gets in the way at times. Out of the child stars, who were all excellent, Macaulay Culkin of Home Alone fame is a standout. Cute and self-assured suits Culkin like a glove. There was great chemistry between the stars, and in conclusion, see this gem, of which I will award an 8/10 Bethany Cox.",Uncle Buck
1,bkoganbing,At least chronologically an adult,7,4 August 2018,"Uncle Buck is never included many times in a list of good John Hughes films and
I think it's because our protagonist is not an adolescent. Uncle Buck is a forty
something man who at least is chronolically an adult. He's the kind of footloose
character who just won't settle down.It's a crisis at the Russell household as Elaine Bromka's father has a heart attack
and she wants to rush to his side. In this emergency the only available baby and house sitter is her husband Garrett Brown's older unmarried brother good
old Uncle Buck played by John Candy.The younger two Gaby Hoffman and MacCauley Culkin are happy to have their
Uncle Buck there because in many way Candy is not that much more mature than them. His real antagonist is teen Jean Louisa Kelly who is not real happy
about a lot starting with the Russell family recent move from Indianapolis to
Chicago. In this comedy Candy plays a lovable oaf who does a bit of growing up himself
in his babysitting gig. Candy and Kelly are a pair of nasty antagonists and she
won't believe him when he says that Jay Underwood who is hot to trot for her
lacks character. I mean wouldn't you think so if the character had the nickname of 'Bug'?Candy also gets a chance to reassess his relationship with long time girl friend
Amy Madigan. These two have been going out longer than Nathan Detroit
and Adelaide.Best scene in the film is when Candy pinch hits for mom at a parent teacher
conference with Suzanne Shepherd, a most uptight assistant prinipal. Him
telling her off is priceless.One of John Candy's best films, still very funny indeed.",Uncle Buck
2,Leofwine_draca,Watch it for Candy,6,9 October 2015,"A much-watched John Hughes classic, this marked a move away from his teen angst/coming of age style movies into more family-focused films with broader appeal. And Macaulay Culkin. Culkin is so funny in this, he got the HOME ALONE films and huge international stardom from it.Anyway, UNCLE BUCK is a must watch for fans of John Candy, because it seems almost to have been written as a tribute to the larger-than-life star. Without him, the film would be awful, but with him it's a lot of fun. Candy plays the unlikely babysitter who's tasked with looking after three kids while the parents are away. Lots of hijinks ensue, with Candy seeming to play a version of his slobbish-but-lovable character from PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES (he even has a dodgy car that he drives).As usual, Candy is head and shoulders above everyone in the acting stakes, acquitting himself well in the comic and slapstick routines but bringing emotion to the part too. Culkin is very funny too (especially the classic quick-fire questions scene) but I could do without the stereotypical obnoxious teenage daughter character and the ending is way too twee and sentimental. Still, fans of Candy will find this unmissable entertainment and some bits (like when he invades the house party) are fantastic.",Uncle Buck
3,SnoopyStyle,John Hughes + John Candy = Pure Joy,8,24 September 2013,"Uncle Buck Russell (John Candy) is an unreliable bachelor. His brother needs someone to look after his kids (Jean Louisa Kelly, Gaby Hoffmann, Macaulay Culkin) while he and his wife go see her ill father. Buck is the last guy she wants for her kids but they have no choice.Uncle Buck gets into all kinds of trouble in this fish out of water movie. But his street smarts and good nature win over everybody, and help the family get closer together. His long suffering girlfriend is played by Amy Madigan. This is one of the most joy-filled movie in the happy career of John Hughes. This has to be included in John Hughes' greatest collection. It's due in no small part to the inherit joy in John Candy's nature. He exudes joy and happiness. And it's inevitable that everybody get their happy Hollywood ending. After all this is a John Hughes movie.",Uncle Buck
4,kosmasp,Uncle Candy,8,19 August 2019,"Watching this, it makes it clear why John Candy was so loved. By his co stars, by the audience, I would assume by almost everyone. And while he is only acting here, I would guess he was a fine person too. But that aside, because I can't know myself (apart from all the actors confirming that that is), the movie is really funny and I am glad I had a chance to watch it recently.It is quite predictable and some jokes may not have aged well (or may not respond with first time viewers of a certain age). But overall the comedy is way funny! You can be offended by some of it (especially when it comes to subjects of violence), but you would be missing out on all the fun. This is a movie after all and John is supposed to channel a few things and do those things that we can't do. He also is supposed to be a role model and I would argue a pretty fine one, even if quite un-conventional! Watch and have fun and don't judge if you can",Uncle Buck
5,lee_eisenberg,and to think that those sorts of things eventually killed John Candy,6,19 July 2006,"Mostly an excuse to be silly, ""Uncle Buck"" is lovable nonetheless. John Candy plays a seemingly worthless guy hired to watch his nephew and nieces for a few days. In what seems like an eerie prediction, Buck announces that he's quit cigarettes, and then says ""I'm on cigars now. And then I'll be going to pipes, then chewing tobacco, then nicotine gum."" Didn't those sorts of things eventually kill John Candy? Anyway, it's great as plain entertainment, but don't expect a religious experience. That scene at the party is fairly entertaining. It's just too bad that John Candy got typecast in these kinds of roles. Also starring Macaulay Culkin.",Uncle Buck
6,jboothmillard,Uncle Buck,6,25 August 2007,"Just a year before Home Alone, its child star and writer/director John Hughes made this enjoyable family comedy, this was the start of Hughes first film focusing on childhood rather than adolescence (Ferris Bueller and The Breakfast Club). Anyway, basically Cindy (Elaine Bromka) and Bob Russell (Garrett M. Brown) and their family have recently moved from Indianapolis to Chicago, but the kids were happy where they were. One night Cindy receives a phone call from her aunt that her father has had a heart attack, and they immediately make plans to visit him. But they urgently need someone to babysit the younger kids, since teenager Tia (Jean Louisa Kelly) refuses to be responsible, and even though Cindy doesn't like, Bob thinks his brother Buck (John Candy, in one of his only great leading roles) can do it. When they are gone, Buck is doing the best he can to please and help the younger kids, Maizy Russell (Gaby Hoffmann) and Miles (Macaulay Culkin, leading towards to stardom), same for the despising Tia. Buck's sloppy but lovable personality and presence have the kids bonding, but he still struggles to please Tia, who he knows has a boyfriend Bug (Jay Underwood) only using her to get sex. Also starring Amy Madigan as Chanice Kobolowski, Scream 2's Laurie Metcalf as Marcie Dahlgren-Frost, Brian Tarantina as E. Roger Coswell, Dumb and Dumber's Mike Starr as Pooter-the-Clown and Suzanne Shepherd as Mrs. Anita Hogarth. It is impossible to hate Candy (character or actor), even with his sloppy nature, Culkin is cute and the perfect choice for Home Alone, and there are plenty of one-liners and near-gross jokes to please everyone. Good!",Uncle Buck
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Candy Is Dandy, But The Kids Turned Me Sour",4,11 June 2007,"Of the four main players in here - John Candy, Jean Kelly, Amy Madigan and Macauley Caulkin - the only one I've never heard about (at that time) was the one that annoyed the heck out of me and ruined the film. Well, she must have done a decent job of acting to make me want to throw her and the VHS into the garbage pail. I am referring to Kelly in the role of teenage brat, ""Tia Russell."" Ironically, six years later she played a stunning and extremely likable role in the person of ""Rowena Morgan"" in ""Mr. Holland's Opus.""Candy, as usual, is fun to watch as ""Buck Russell,"" or the title character, ""Uncle Buck."" Few actors were better at playing a lovable, hapless slob than Candy. I enjoyed his character in here, but I cannot watch that spoiled teen girl more than once. Also, in the first few minutes of the film, the little boy ""Miles"" (Cauklin) says the word ""G-damn."" How bad is that, having a six-year-old kid saying the Lord's name in vain on film? These Hollywood people are such sickos. No wonder many of their child actors turn out to be mentally screwed up, Caulkin being a case in point.",Uncle Buck
8,Tweekums,John Candy is on top form,8,5 December 2015,"Bob and Cindy Russell live in a large house in the Chicago suburbs with their children Tia, Maizy and Miles. When Cindy's father has a heart attack they must go to Indianapolis but first they must find a babysitter. Bob suggests his brother Buck and after all other options are exhausted Cindy allows him to call Buck. We can see why he was the last choice; Buck is a slob whose idea of work is betting on the occasional fixed horse race. He arrives late at night and immediately gets off to a bad start. Things don't get any better in the morning; fifteen year old Tia is not impressed with having to have a babysitter and the two younger children don't even recognise him as it has been so long since they've seen him. His strange ways soon amuse Maizy and Miles but horrify Tia who feels humiliated by the situation especially when Buck starts threatening her boyfriend then lectures her about how she needs to be more careful. She is determined to get her revenge.This film is a lot of fun; largely due to John Candy's portrayal of Uncle Buck; the character is a slob and acts like a psychopath at times but thanks to Candy he is still a likable character this is of course helped by the fact that despite his flaws he really is looking out for the kids. Jean Louisa Kelly does a good job as Tia; a character who is harder to like at first but inevitably improves as the film approaches its conclusion. Gaby Hoffmann and Macaulay Culkin are cute and do well in the roles of young children Maizy and Miles on the strength of this it isn't surprising that Culkin went on to take the lead role in 'Home Alone'. There are lots of laughs to be had; mostly provided by Candy I particularly liked his speech to Tia's boyfriend about burying the hatchet; both hilarious and rather menacing. The ending was inevitably a little twee but it didn't affect my enjoyment of the film.",Uncle Buck
9,moonspinner55,"John Hughes concoction...meaning it is outlandish, wise, 'human', and silly all at once",3,14 May 2009,"You have to hand it to writer-director John Hughes. With enormous success behind him in the misfit-teenager/high school vein, he managed to branch out into other areas of comedy, finding in the bargain a great ally in comedian-actor John Candy. Here, goof-off adult Candy becomes a better person after agreeing to babysit his brother's wiseacre kids; it's a surefire formula designed to please both cynical teens as well as their parents, and it isn't any wonder the film was a winner with theater audiences. Still, Hughes relies almost completely on Candy's charm to put the scenario over, and one may eventually grow tired of the repetitious gags with the star front and center. The kids are sitcom-smart, the other adults shapeless blobs, and Amy Madigan is too intense, too hyped-up playing Uncle Buck's girlfriend. Later became a TV series, which is befitting since the material was already television-perfected. *1/2 from ****",Uncle Buck
10,Quinoa1984,One of Hughes' best,10,4 November 2000,"John Hughes' Uncle Buck is a comedy that isn't as recognized as much as his acclaimed films (Home Alone, Pretty In Pink, Weird Science, Breakfast Club, 16 Candles), but this is just as funny and heartwarming as the others. Courtesy mainly of the lead John Candy as Buck Russell.  He brings to the screen sarcastic humor that works best for him.  Enjoyable throughout, even if sometimes the mushy stuff is unbearable.  Favorite line ""He, he, he, you ever hear of a ritual killing?  hehehe"".  A-",Uncle Buck
11,hitchcockthelegend,Amiable piece showcasing John Candy's strengths.,6,14 March 2008,"Buck Russell is a slob, but as a last resort during a family crisis, Bob & Cindy Russell agree to let the oafish Buck babysit their three children...Perhaps a tad too sugary with its moralistic social commentary? Director John Hughes has none the less crafted an entertaining, and at times, heart warming film. Watching Buck bulldoze his way through a series of standard chores is never less than entertaining, but it's the interplay with the three offspring of his brother that is the film's successful core.The two youngest children take to Buck straight away, to them he is like one big clown, but the relationship with the teenage daughter is fractious at best. Yet in typical John Hughes fashion, Uncle Buck becomes a rites-of-passage piece, where family values come shining to the fore from whence there was merely mirth.It's John Candy's show all the way, he puts enough skin on the bones of Buck to keep him interesting in spite of the almost crass make up of his persona, and as usual the comedy moments only serve as a reminder that we lost a comic talent when the big man passed away.Uncle Buck, a very safe and enjoyable viewing. 6.5/10",Uncle Buck
12,grantss,"Sweet, funny movie",8,7 November 2017,"Bob and Cindy Russell have a dilemma: Cindy's father, who lives far away, is sick and they need to go see him. However, who will look after their three children for the several days while they are away? Out of desperation they turn to someone whom they have grave reservations about in terms of his suitability for the job - Bob's single, layabout brother, Buck.Sweet, funny movie, written directed by the master of the poignant- yet-funny 80s comedy-drama, John Hughes. I didn't have high hopes for it initially, suspecting it would be a slapsticky adults vs anarchic children caper. However, while it threatens to go in that direction every now and again, the movie manages to stay focused. Very engaging, and much more than just a comedy. The transformation of Uncle Buck, played superbly by John Candy, from a single slacker to a responsible adult with better parenting skills than most is quite heart-warming and makes the movie into a great drama.Some quite hilarious scenes too, so a good combination of comedy and drama.Unfortunately, probably thanks to some scenes in this movie and Macaulay Culkin's role in it, John Hughes did go down the silly adults-vs-kid (with the kid as the hero) slapstick route soon after this. Within a year, he wrote Home Alone...",Uncle Buck
13,view_and_review,I Want An Uncle Buck,7,13 February 2020,"I'm convinced that teenagers are a different species, and that's me speaking as a person who was a teenager and now one who has teenagers. Even still, Tia Russell (Jean Louisa Kelly) was a special brand of evil. She may have even been spawned from the devil. In another movie--let's say a thriller--she would've been responsible for Uncle Buck's death or imprisonment.Uncle Buck (John Candy) didn't deserve any of the treatment he got from his niece, the emo teenage mutant demon in teenage girl skin. He was a solid dude from day one. Maybe he was afraid of commitment and maybe his babysitting was a little unconventional, but he's an uncle I would love to have.Uncle Buck has to be my favorite John Candy role. His look, his demeanor, his whole persona just fit. He was the semi-committed, carefree, happy go lucky uncle all of a sudden entrusted to watch three kids (well... two adorable little kids and a hellhound). What was cool is that he actually took the job seriously. He wasn't sure exactly the best way to care for the kids, but he knew he had to care for them and he did it even when it wasn't wanted. ""Uncle Buck"" is a great family movie that will have all ages laughing.",Uncle Buck
14,bombersflyup,Buck: Do you think she hates me? Maisy: With a passion.,8,29 October 2018,"Uncle Buck is a feel good film, with a great cast.The lovable John Candy in one of his finest roles and two exceptional child actors. The film isn't quite full of laughs like one might think, it has laughs, but it's the characterization and heart that deliver this baby. Each character's well defined and likable, without being one-dimensional. Quality music throughout.As negative reviewers wanted a laugh riot, I find some of the unnecessary silliness to hinder the film.",Uncle Buck
15,AaronCapenBanner,Not So Funny.,3,4 September 2013,"John Candy plays uncle Buck, a perpetually unemployed man who is called over to his brother's house when they unexpectedly have to leave town on a family emergency, since they cannot take their three children with them. Buck, not a father himself, tries to win over the kids with happy talk and big homemade breakfasts, but while this works on his young niece and nephew, his older niece Tia is not impressed or interested, just wants to date her boyfriend ""bug"".Schizophrenic film has some moments of warmth, but hints at a serious dark side to Buck; he threatens bug with a power drill after kidnapping him, and putting him in his car trunk! Not to mention the infamous scene where he confronts his young nephew's guidance counselor and throws her some change and tells her to spend it to have a rat remove the prominent wart from her face! Mean spirited and totally uncalled for;What were they thinking there? Later a brief TV series.",Uncle Buck
16,movieman_kev,Hughes' last truly great film,8,30 April 2006,"With their backs against the wall when Cindy Russell's father has a heart attack and having desperately to search for someone to watch the kids as her and her husband have to go visit her ailing dad, they have no choice but to ask Cindy's husband, Bob's slovenly brother, Buck to babysit. John Candy is hilarious and endearing as the titular Uncle Buck trying to win over the affections of his nephew and nieces that he hardly know. And the film wouldn't be half as good without his larger than life presence. John Hughes made so many flat out amazing films in the '80's and it's a huge testament to say that this film, as great as it is, isn't even in the top 3 of his films. That being said, it's still so much fun and is highly watchable. Reminds me why John Candy will always be missed and in the hearts of so many forever. Followed by a horrendous and thankfully very short-lived TV show spin-off.My Grade: A-",Uncle Buck
17,Aaron1375,Uncle boring is more like it.,2,4 April 2003,"This one did not appeal to me at all.  I like John Candy and all, but this one just wasn't as funny as it could have been.  The poster of it makes it look like a laugh riot, but for the most part I found this one rather dull. The premise has the parent's of three children having to go somewhere and they need someone to watch the kids.  They turn to the father's brother. Instead of being really funny though, this one is only worth maybe a couple of chuckles as it takes itself to seriously at times and it mainly becomes Uncle Buck and the older daughter fighting and challenging each other's authority.",Uncle Buck
18,Wuchakk,John Candy as a misfit uncle watching his nieces and nephew,7,28 December 2015,"Released in 1989, ""Uncle Buck"" stars John Candy as a black sheep uncle who housesits in a Chicago suburb while his brother and sister-in-law take an emergency trip. The teen daughter, Tia (Jean Louisa Kelly), takes a dislike to her eccentric uncle and he doesn't help matters by opposing her boyfriend, Bug (Jay Underwood). Amy Madigan is on hand as Buck's sorta girlfriend while Macaulay Culkin and Gaby Hoffmann play the younger kids.This movie has garnered a decent reputation over the years, but I didn't see it until last night. It's an entertaining, but unexceptional dramedy with Candy as a likable slob, which he plays well. There are quite a few laughs and the conflict between Buck and Tia is entertaining. The redemption of one character and the growth of another are kinda heartwarming.The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in the 'burbs south of Chicago.GRADE: Borderline B-/B (6.5/10)",Uncle Buck
19,zetes,"Sloppy, but sometimes funny",6,9 August 2009,"I remember wanting to see this when it was released, when I was 10 years old, because I was a huge John Candy fan. I never got around to it for some reason. It's an okay movie, but nothing special. John Candy is quite funny, but it suffers from the general slovenliness that I associate with writer/director John Hughes (as much as I hate to speak ill of the dead). The major conflict of the film, between the estranged titular uncle and his teenage niece, is pretty poorly developed. We're not really given much to work with in Jean Louisa Kelly's character other than that she's a moody teenager. She has some ill defined problem with her mother, and apparently doesn't like that Uncle Buck has been absent from her family's life for so long (though her insistence on family togetherness seems contradictory to her general character). The film is at its most amusing when it's just dealing with Buck and the two younger kids, Macaulay Culkin and Gaby Hoffmann (though the film can definitely suffer from an overdose of cutesiness at times, too), or just Buck on his own. Like all of Hughes films, the film finds a lot more energy when it gets to the setpieces, whether they work or not. My favorite bit was when Candy tries to pee at a urinal in an elementary school.",Uncle Buck
20,Sylviastel,"Hey, Mom. Next time you take off in the middle of the night, why don't you hire a murderer to watch the house?",9,13 May 2006,"My biggest upset with this film is that I think it's too short. They should have had more in it but it's a great comedy. John Candy stars as the Uncle Buck who comes to the rescue of his brother and his sister-in-law when they have to travel to Indiana for a family emergency. Elaine Bromka is brilliant as the mother. Jean Louisa Kelly from ""Yes, Dear"" plays the oldest daughter, Tia, with a chip on her shoulder. She doesn't like the move to Chicago and misses her life in Indiana. Laurie Metcalf plays the neighbor who sets her sights on the not so quite bachelor Uncle Buck. I can't forget Amy Madigan as the girl who steals Uncle Buck's heart. Their relationship is no less entangled by Tia's tricks. I think this is one of John Hughes' best films. Macauley Culkin before Home Alone fame plays the younger brother in the film. Anyway, the cast is always great and the writing is more believable. The film was so successful that they turned it into a failed sitcom. But without John Candy as Uncle Buck, it wouldn't have worked out anyway. He is the heart and soul of the film. John, we miss you down here.",Uncle Buck

22,SimonJack,A very good and sweet comedy by John Candy,8,20 February 2021,"John Candy was a very talented comedian whose short film career varied greatly with its ups and downs. ""Uncle Buck"" is one of his very good films. Candy's Buck Russell is the goof-off, out of work, easy going bachelor brother of strait-laced Bob Russell, played by Garett Brown. When Bob's father-in-law has a heart attack and he and wife Cindy have to leave town, the only person they can get to stay with their three children is Uncle Buck. But, Cindy (played by Elaine Bromka) can't stand him.Buck turns out to be the most responsible, sane and sensible one of the lot - even with his quirks. Cindy and Bob are uptight parents in a dysfunctional family. Buck's biggest challenge is to corral and tame teenage daughter Tia. But, before heading out to the Russell house in the suburbs, he has to tell his fiancé of several years, Chanice, that he won't be able to show up for work at her business the next day. This is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. Amy Madigan plays Chanice and provides some of the humor. Macaulay Culkin is the young Miles Russell and Gaby Hoffmann is the younger sister, Maisy. They hit it off right away with Uncle Buck.This is a very funny film, with some nice lessons for all involved. The comedy comes mostly in situations. Another very funny one is Buck's doing the laundry in a microwave because he can't get the washing machine open. As the rating indicates this film is PG. Even with that, some may be put off by the language in places.Here are the funniest lines in this film.Buck Russell, ""Chanice, I'll be honest with you. If I could think of an excuse that you would buy, I'd use it.""Buck Russell, ""Hey, I, I stopped smoking cigarettes."" Cindy Russell, ""Oh, good."" Buck, ""Isn't that something? Heh, heh, heh. I'm onto cigars now. I'm on a five-year plan. I eliminated the cigarettes, then I go to cigars. Then I go to pipes. Then I go to chewin' tobacco. Then I'm onto the nicotine gum.""Buck Russell, ""Stand me up today and tomorrow I'll drive you to school in my robe and pajamas and walk you to your first class. Four o'clock okay?""Tia Russell, ""Did you ever have anyone embarrass you like this?"" Buck, after a long pause, ""No.""Tia Russell, after Buck drives away while her boyfriend leans into the car to kiss her, ""Are you crazy?"" Buck Russell: ""I can be."" Tia Russell, ""You could have taken his head off."" Uncle Buck, ""Yeah, but would he notice?""Buck Russell, ""The guy's a predator and you're his prey.""Buck Russell, ""Did you, uh, brush your teeth?"" Miles, ""Yeah, you can even feel my toothbrush."" Buck, ""You know, I have a friend who works at the crime lab at the police station. I could give him your toothbrush and he could run a test on it, to see if you actually brushed your teeth or just ran your toothbrush under the faucet."" Maisy Russell, ""If that's true, we're gonna really have to start brushing our teeth.""",Uncle Buck

Its a film with a big heart!'Uncle Buck' Synopsis: Bachelor and all round slob, Buck, babysits his brother's rebellious teenage daughter and her cute younger brother and sister.'Uncle Buck' works because Hughes constructs a solid Screenplay. The Writing is extremely sharp, and the protagonist is very well-defined. There aren't many sub-plots, and even the minor ones that are laced in the Screenplay, don't come across as unwanted guests. Hughes's Direction is decent, as always. Cinematography offers clarity. Editing is rightly done. Performance-Wise: The Late/Great John Candy brings Uncle Buck to life, with a stupendous performance. He's cute, lovable & genuine, all through. Undoubtedly, this is among his best performances ever. Jean Louisa Kelly is highly effective, while Macaulay Culkin & Gaby Hoffmann are adorable.

25,Smells_Like_Cheese,Another under rated John Hughes film,8,31 July 2006,"Uncle Buck is one of the funniest movies I have seen. Oh, how I miss John Candy. He is by far one of the best comedic actors that we need today. Uncle Buck is just another fine example of his talents. He is just incredibly funny and this is a film for the whole family. That's what I liked about it. It was clean humor that anyone could enjoy. I think my favorite part was when Uncle Buck had Tia's boyfriend in the trunk. Also, Maculy Culkin(yes, I know that's the wrong spelling) and Uncle Buck, when Mac is interrogating him, that was such a great scene. They just fed off each other and each cue was so perfect. I really wish we could find more of Mac lately. He is a very gifted actor. Also Uncle Buck's old beat down car, just when you see it, you'll understand what I mean. Despite being a bit predictable, I think you'll love this film. It's another great film by John Hughes.8/10",Uncle Buck
26,MovieAddict2016,"""John Candy uses his natural comedic charm in this film; he is loveable and huggable.""",10,25 February 2003,"`Uncle Buck'If you have read my other reviews, you would have realized that one of my favorite directors is John Hughes. Not because of his teen movies, but because he made my favorite comedy ever: `Planes, Trains and Automobiles' with Steve Martin and John Candy. But that has little to do with Uncle Buck; if you want to read my review on `Planes' it is on this site. AnywayJohn Hughes' second to last film he directed was a little, low budget comedy named `Uncle Buck,' about a guy named Buck (John Candy) and his ordeals of the week.Basically, to make a long story short, Buck's brother and sister-in-law are called out of town because of a family emergency. But, unfortunately, they cannot leave their three children (a teenager and two smaller kids) at home, alone. After calling many neighbors to no avail, Buck's brother realizes that the only option left is a big, large slob named Buck.
John Candy brings his warm screen presence straight outta' downtown Chicago to watch the kids for `A week at the most.' Little does he know what will ensue. Buck has no idea whatsoever how to care for kids. One of the most endearing things about this comedy is his chemistry and connection with the smaller children.Another funny thing is how Buck handles the teenage girl. She is used to being free, basically; but Buck, like most parents and adults, has been through things before, and knows everything going on in her life and what it will lead to. He sees right through her boyfriend `Bug' to his real intentions.`Uncle Buck' has some very, very funny moments. Some of the gags fall short a bit, but it is still a winner. Some of the best parts are stretched-out, making it even funnier. The thing about `UB' is that unlike many comedies, there are long segments that are funny, instead of individual jokes throughout like `Airplane' and Mel Brooks films. `Uncle Buck' is NOT slapstick. It is a comedy, plain and simple. But this does not mean it doesn't have any good lines. There are some funny one-liners that have John Candy saying things like `Ever heard of a ritual killing,' etc (anyone who's seen the movie knows what I mean).John Candy uses his natural comedic charm in this film; he is loveable and huggable.Macaulay Culkin has his best role in this film. He was not yet an annoying brat, and could actually handle his lines, for once, without sounding like he is reading off a piece of cardboard (see `Home Alone' and/or `The Good Son').John Hughes directs the film in his typical fashion. I'm not sure what that fashion is, but whatever it is, it's good.Basically, when it all comes down to it, `Uncle Buck' delivers everything you want in a comedy. It's great for a Friday or Saturday night. It may not be as great as `Planes' but it sure as heck is funny.
Every time I see the freeze-frame ending it makes me want to cry (well, I feel sad, at least), because like `Planes' the freeze-frame captures John Candy at his best, with his heart shining through. I think that is why he is one of the greatest comedians ever. It makes me sad when I think of his death.We miss you, John.John Candy: 1950-1994",Uncle Buck
27,sddavis63,Typical Candy Performance,6,5 May 2003,"One must concede that John Candy had the role of the lovable loser down to a perfect ""T"". Over and over again he plays variations on the same character and does it well. Here he plays Buck Russell, a shifty type who makes his living apparently by fixing horse races and who is suddenly forced by circumstances to look after his brother's children for a few days.It's billed as a comedy, but to be honest I didn't find it all that funny, although there were a few chuckles, particularly as Buck tries to protect his niece Tia's honour (very much against her will.) But in spite of the lack of laughs I found the movie strangely compelling and never had the urge to tune it out. Jean Louise Kelly put on a marvellous performance as the attitude-filled Tia, and it was interesting to see a very young Macauley Culkin in something other than the ""Home Alone"" series, playing her brother Miles.Overall this is certainly not a masterpiece, but it's an OK timewaster in spite of the lack of laughs.6/10",Uncle Buck
28,ElMaruecan82,"John Candy has always been ""Uncle Buck"" for me...",8,22 December 2017,"And ""Uncle Buck"" used to be one of my favorite as a kid although I only saw it two times, but it left some nice memories. So, I thought after reading Ebert's review, and listening to his negative comments (approved by Siskel), I would look at the film with more perplex eyes, but no, I think there's a lot to like and well, the stuff to dislike has aged better than many seemingly irreproachable movies.Still, having watched it again, after 25 years, I think there's a sort of darkness and sadness about the whole material that I failed to notice as a kid. I realize it deals with leaving your hometown, which I can relate to, or difficult relationships, which I also can relate to. I realized that there's a real dead-end as far as communication goes between the mother and her girl, and it's not like there's any breach where you can get some air. Jean Louisa Kelly really creates some tension in what should have been your quiet little suburban house life.But again, I didn't notice that, as a kid. Maybe because the main character is played by the lovable John Candy and it's just impossible to see anything dark behind that big, huggable, teddy-bear of a man. I feel like reducing the actor to a specific range of characters he used to play but to put it simply, that's what made any of his movies enjoyable on the simple basis of his presence, he really illuminated the screen.He had already graced the screen in John Hughes' classic ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" but after being Del Griffith, I think Candy needed a character as rough and rugged and somewhat twisted as Buck, to explore a much darker side albeit not on an ethical level. Sure, he's the 'lovable uncle' and outsider of the family but he could speak for himself, use some subtle threats and even engage in a battle of wits and wills with the troubled niece.In fact the film is driven by two opposite dynamics, funny and touching interactions with the two good kids played by Macaulay Culkin (in his pre-Home Alone) and Gaby Hoffman and the more serious rivalry between with Kelly, played the bitter adolescent. One thing about Culkin, he's really a scene-stealer and I'm pretty sure the film convinced the producers to hire him for ""Home Alone"". But there's just something about Culkin as a secondary character, like in the movie ""My Girl"". He's present enough to make himself memorable (I just loved that rapid-fire exchange of random questions) and not too much to be a sort of 'gimmick'. There wasn't much interactions with Gaby Hoffman's character though and she was barely noticeable.Retrospectively, I think the bitterness of Tia while being a plot driver was overplayed, not overacted but sometimes, she was so angry and bitter, she was like Daria, you know the animated perpetual malcontent. I couldn't really accept her defiance toward Buck because she felt the same toward everything, there wasn't something to make him the target of her insults. So yes, the film is a comedy but it does have some mean-spiritedness about it. The way the arc of their relationship closes is also problematic because it only depended on Buck being right about the kid she hanged out with, but there was nothing in his behavior that indicated he could be a potential rapist.So there's a sort of hidden truth that Buck is the 'right man' because unlike Tia's father, he doesn't live in the comfortable suburban life but he's a street-smart guy who knows the rope and is capable to be a good father figure. Ultimately Buck is another facet of Del Griffith with more assurance and more fitting with the reality of the world. But his personality does indicate a change in Hughes' tone. After that, the iconic 80's director went on writing the ""Home Alone"" series which feels more like a cartoon version of the heart-warming youth stories he made.Maybe he's less interested in Tia's existential troubles than the idea that an adult knows life better and she should trust him, in fact, even the romantic subplot with Amy Madigan's character says that Buck should value the adult in him before trying to be the ""big kid"". ""Uncle Buck"" marks a real departure from Hughes' usual messages, kind of an end of an era for the ending decade.The film is enjoyable while not being in the Top 10 comedies of the 80's. And it's also the last, or one of the last memorable shining performances of John Candy who could never really prove his magnitude as an actor, but showed in ""Uncle Buck"" that he truly had the potential to be something else. I'll cherish this film as the first that made me familiar with his face until I would say in a good dozen of movies in the early 90's. I still remember that the day my father told me he died he said ""Uncle Buck"" died. That says it all.",Uncle Buck
29,g-bodyl,John Candy At His Best!,9,24 April 2015,"Uncle Buck is another highlight on John Hughe's film reel. It's a screwball comedy that is safe for the family, but luckily has many laughs to go along with that statement. John Candy is a comedian that died before his time, but thankfully he was able to make this movie as this is one of his best roles. The movie has a sweet message and it shows that even the slob of an uncle can show love. John Hughes's film is about a man named Buck who has a very lazy life and has a girlfriend who is very disapproving. After a tragedy occurs, Uncle Buck is called to his brother's house where he is tasked to look after the three children: two younger ones and a rebellious teenager. Uncle Buck must prove that he is up to the task. I think the film has some pretty good acting. John Candy is at his best in the lead role. Always the sweet guy and it is not hard to root for him despite his clumsiness. Amy Madigan was pretty good at playing the angry girlfriend. Before Macaulay Culkin became known for Home Alone, he was good in this role as one of the young children. Overall, Uncle Buck is a very sweet comedy. Perhaps it's too sweet for its own good, but this is a great bet if you want to watch a movie with the family. It's funny, but its not vulgar. I do like those sort of comedies, but when I want something safe and pleasant, I now I can count on the talents of John Hughes and John Candy. My Grade: A-",Uncle Buck
30,Irishchatter,Very good film of John Candy!,8,6 August 2016,I always thought John Candy was the best comedic actor out there and it's just too bad that he died so young. He definitely looks like an Uncle figure rather than a dad figure to be honest. Im this film like you would badly want an Uncle like him. He's just so brilliant and talented with his jokes! I also thought Jean Louisa Kelly as the eldest daughter was like the sibling you always hate. She honestly looked cute though for playing as a red up plus annoying teen. I felt so irritated by her like I almost crushed my phone with squeezed my fists haha. She's a really good actress! I couldn't believe how Malcahy Culkin was so tiny in this! He looked so small that now he is a big tall man with long hair! You would still think of him as that little kid from Home Alone but he didn't seem to have a good life after that though. At least he's getting better and looking handsome as a man! Really good late 80's movie and I give this 8/10.,Uncle Buck
31,CuriosityKilledShawn,"'Buck Melanoma, Moley Russell's Wart'",7,20 February 2011,"John Candy is Buck Russell, a character very similar to Del Griffith from Planes, Trains & Automobiles. It's not surprising since John Hughes is the writer, producer and director of both films. Buck is a simple man with simple pleasures. He likes his freedom, his leisure time, and his bowling. He has a girlfriend who desperately wants him to grow up but...he can't be bothered.But when Buck is called to the wintry, affluent suburbs to look after his brother's kids for a couple of weeks (much to his sister-in-law's horror) he learns what it's like to be a responsible adult and does surprisingly well with his extended babysitting chore (in his own unique way).Uncle Buck was Candy's fourth (of five) collaboration with Hughes and the role is clearly tailor-made for him. He may be a slob, and the underdog, but he's the kind of relative you'll all wish you had. The comedy is underplayed and quiet, and the drama involving without being overbearing. It's all just easy-going entertainment that's perfect for brightening up a dull afternoon, and yet another reminder that Hollywood lost someone very special in March 1994.",Uncle Buck
32,The-Sarkologist,A funny movie that unfortunately gets too bogged down in the dramatic.,7,27 December 2013,"The main problem with this movie is that it really doesn't seem to know if it is supposed to be a comedy or a family drama. It opens with a real snotty teenager snobbing off her parents and them acting really dramatically over her actions and then a family illness interstate.This movie stars McCauley Culkin and John Candy. I cannot remember the movie's advertising, but it seems that they push it as a cute McCauley Culkin movie. Personally I really don't think it is, rather it is a John Candy movie, and he stands far over Culkin and is the main focus of the movie, while Culkin really only takes a supporting role. Personally I am happy with that, because I really think he is one of those over-rated actors who only succeeds on the cute factor, and I really don't think he is all that cute.The movie is about a bachelor, Buck, who comes to house sit while the parents are away dealing with a family tragedy. Basically it is the story of an irresponsible man put into a position of responsibility and thus is forced to change. He has been leading a woman on for a long time and really doesn't want to commit himself to anything, but after a couple of weeks with the kids and being a parent, he comes to realise that he is wasting his life.Personally, I think the way he handles the teenage girl is quite impressive. The reason he does this though is because he knows what the guys she hangs around with are like, and that he is only doing what is best for her. Her parents seem to let her do what she wants, but Buck has taken a much more interventionist stance with her. As such she resents him and tries to undermine his life, but really she is lost and confused and finally realises that Buck is cool.I actually think that this is quite a funny movie, but unfortunately it gets bogged down in places (like the beginning) where it tries to be more of a family drama. It is really something that irritated me because it did not seem to be able to make up its mind. Even then, once it gets moving, it becomes quite a cool little movie.",Uncle Buck

35,tomgillespie2002,John Hughes' most underrated,6,5 July 2011,"Having recently re-located from Indianapolis to Chicago, Bob Russell (Garrett M. Brown) is awoken in the middle of the night to the news that his father-in-law has had a heart attack. He and his wife Cindy (Elaine Bromka) must leave urgently and must need to someone to babysit their two young children Miles (Macauley Culkin) and Maizy (Gaby Hoffmann), and their angst-ridden teenage daughter Tia (Jean Louisa Kelly). Everyone seems to be unavailable, and they are forced to call Bob's brother Buck (John Candy), an overweight, lazy, jobless slob who is more than happy to his brother a favour.Perhaps one of John Hughes' lesser remembered films (compared to the likes of The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Weird Science), it is also one of his underrated. While hardly reaching the heights of Breakfast and Bueller, it is still warm, nostalgic, and funny enough in its own right. As formulaic as the film is, Hughes' nack for the heartfelt sets it apart from the other similar films. And although he made very few films that were good enough to show his comedic ability, it reminded me just how funny and lovable John Candy could be before his unfortunate death (a sentence I never thought I would say/type).The character of Tia has to be one of the most annoying characters in a Hughes movie since Anthony Michael Hall in Sixteen Candles. She is selfish, selt-pitying, and quite frankly, a bitch. This is clearly the point but I was just wishing Buck would get it over and done with and give her a good beating, rather than trying to 'understand' all this teen angst crap.It does allow for a very funny scene involving Buck kidnapping her two- timing boyfriend. An arsehole of a character getting hit in the head with a golf ball is always a winner in my book. And over a decade before Austin Powers made fun of a mole, Uncle Buck delivers possibly one of the best lines of the 80's - (to a stuffy teacher claiming his niece is a 'bad egg') ""take this quarter, go downtown, and have a rat gnaw that thing off your face!"". Even though the film threatens to be ruined by an embarrassingly unrealistic and cheesy ending, this is still a fun film. And one I remember fondly from my childhood when I watched it religiously on VHS, after my granddad purchased it from my father's record shop, uttering the immortal line ""a-we're buying it"" (private joke between me and my brother so apologies everyone else).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Uncle Buck

37,zkonedog,"Without Candy, This One Would Really Be Rough",5,14 November 2021,"It is clear and obvious that writer/director John Hughes had the pulse of 1980s suburban/teen comedy and drama, what with films like ""The Breakfast Club"" & ""Home Alone"" on his resume. When it comes to ""Uncle Buck"", however, those themes are sparse to begin with and largely overshadowed by the goofiness of the whole piece. Were it not for the physical comedy of star John Candy, this one might have been a complete disaster.For a very basic overview, ""Uncle Buck"" tells the story of a suburban family whose mother (Elaine Bromka) hears news of her father's heart attack and must quickly skip town. The only recourse to take care of the children in her and husband's (Garrett M. Brown) absence? Buck Russell (Candy), the juvenile ""black sheep"", of sorts, of the family tree. When Uncle Buck comes to town, he struggles mightily to win the affection of recalcitrant teen Tia (Jean Louise Kelly) and little tykes Miles (Macaulay Culkin) & Maizy (Gaby Hoffmann).Without a doubt, the biggest draw here is Candy. His enormous stature lends itself admirably to a unique brand of physical comedy that is almost unmatched. Scenes of him bowling and dancing around the kitchen are truly hilarious. Truth be told, I wish this was utilized more throughout the film.There are also at least attempts at relevant themes in ""Uncle Buck""--things like the titular character's struggle with being a sort of man-child as well as the usual teenaged angst that is a staple of all Hughes flicks. Unfortunately, most of these attempts at emotional material are all but completely undercut by the high level of slapstick or goofy humor (over-the-top visuals and even sound effects, at some points).So, while it was fun to get a few laughs out of Candy and interesting to see the genesis of he and Culkin's roles in the later ""Home Alone"", ""Uncle Buck"" isn't one that will stick with me. The setting and themes are pure Hughes, but the tone is all wrong to have any of it be taken seriously (or even at face value).",Uncle Buck

43,yusufpiskin,Oldies always goldies,8,6 March 2020,"There are eighties movies that are impossible not to love. John Hughes had the monopoly on those films with classics like The Breakfast Club or Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but the manic comedic brilliance that was John Candy was brought to the screen in another of Hughes' films,family favorite, Uncle Buck.
The fish-out-of-water scenario of an oafish bachelor being tasked with babysitting his brother's kids always had great scope for hilarity. Slobbish man-child John Candy was perfect as the caring uncle trying to do the right thing for his brother and sister-in-law following a family emergency. From the obvious pitfalls of dealing with a temperamental teenager with an attitude, to the gentle exuberance with which he endears himself to the two younger kids played by Macaulay Culkin and Gabby Hoffman, this isn't all about Candy, but its close. With Hughes doubling up as both screenwriter and director this doesn't disappoint with Candy given the materials to deliver one of his most iconic roles. Culkin also gave us a glimpse of what he would become less than a year later with his precocious turn as the young Miles, surely the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple.
Candy's early death at the age of 43 in 1994 was a tragedy, but he did leave some fine comic moments. From Cool Runnings to Planes, Trains & Automobiles, he did leave a legacy. A guy who could literally do anything, (just look at his turn in JFK) it was still his comic timing we would all miss so much.

A couple of parts I really liked the most were when Tia (Jean Louisa Kelly) got reprimanded and when Buck caught Bug (Jay Underwood) doing something I don't want to mention. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""If I ever have kids of my own, I'm going to show this to them as soon as they're seven.""

He stars as ""Uncle Buck"", a bit of an irresponsible character who suddenly finds himself in charge of his brother's three young children when the parents are unexpectedly called away.Candy manages to extract a few laughs from his character, though some may find much of the humour more offensive than funny. Generally though the comedy is good, and Candy fans, as well as Hughes fans, should find it enjoyable. Only when the film tends towards the more serious side of matters is it a failure. John Hughes ought to know better than to dabble in areas other than comedy.The sad news of John Candy's death will surely make his films all the more loved, and he will be dearly missed by all who derived pleasure from his many humorous roles.

47,eric262003,One For The Family To Enjoy,10,17 November 2014,"""Uncle Buck"" is a wholesome family film that was written and directed by the late John Hughes who steps out of his parameters of teen comedies and casts John Candy as the bumbling but lovable slob named Uncle Buck who reluctantly but graciously watched over his brother's three children while he and his wife (Garrett M. Brown and Elaine Bromka) go to Indianapolis to attend her sick father. Uncle Buck has found the approval of the two younger siblings Miles and Maizy (Macaulay Culkin and Gabby Hoffmann), but is in a battle zone with his eternally bitter and moody oldest niece Tia (Jean Louisa Kelly). She's the typical rebellious teenager who's going through this stage in her life where she wants to be independent and doesn't want any adult rob her of her happiness let alone Uncle Buck and is in a relationship with an obnoxious punk named Bug (Jay Underwood). This was the pinnacle film for Macaulay Culkin who would later become the top grossing kids star from 1989 to 1994 when his bravado faded out. One of his moments was when he started trivializing Buck with personal questions and Buck responds with quick, passive-aggressive responses, which ends with hims saying, ""I'm a kid, that's my job."" Gabby Hoffmann has also went on a subtle movie career after this including her affectionate performance in the Kevin Costner vehicle ""Field of Dreams"", she also was very charming as the equally intelligent youngest child Maizy Russell. The two characters that truly are the centrepiece of this film is the performances of John Candy and Jean Louisa Kelly who plays the angered Tia. One of the remarkable things about Buck is that he can understand her psyche that seems rather blind to her parents. He also strangely knows what's going on the the cranium of her boyfriend Bug. When he tells Tia that Bug is just using her for some intercourse, he tells her that Bug was the character that Buck was at one time. He's never afraid to humiliate Tia any way possible even in front of her friends just to make his point clear. By the end of the movie, she learns her ways and realizes that he's not as dumb as he looks and she also tries to repair his estranged relationship with his girlfriend who sells tires Chanice (Amy Madigan). Buck also seems to provide more entertainment to the younger kids which is more than their parents could provide for them including having a pancake feast to celebrate Miles' birthday. He also confronts a drunken clown who can barely raise his fingers to reach the door knob. Buck can multitask and handle any problem with the snap of his fingers. John Candy was a brilliant comic actor. Even when he becomes snarky, he's still lovable like a teddy bear. He even had that certain edge to him like other great clowns reminiscent to the silent film era. When he's verbally abused you just want to hug him like a teddy bear. Even when he can't finish telephone conversation only John Candy could pull something like that off. Uncle Buck is a caricature taken from the penmanship of Mr. Hughes and combined with a warm heart and funny dialogue, you can't help but adore the lovable charm that Uncle Buck provides. He will stop at nothing to defend his family's honour including a memorable scene where Buck goes to Maizy's school and confronts her principal who sports an ugly mole on her chin. When she tells Buck that Maizy isn't at the same pace as her other students, he retorts back at her and ends by telling her to get a rat to gnaw off that ugly mole off her face. As the 1980's were coming to a close, ""Uncle Buck"" was a memorable John Hughes film. It also carried a character that comes closet to the real character that the late John Candy was. It also made Macaulay Culkin the most watchable child actor of the 1990's. Other notable performances are from Amy Madigan and Laurie Metcalf. The character Uncle Buck himself can be a real person to. If you have an Uncle Buck in your family, consider yourselves as one of the lucky ones.",Uncle Buck

He saves his young niece from being ""taken advantage of"" by a high school lover. Made a year before Home Alone, with a very young McCaulay Culkin. A few minor cuss words, and adult situations, but otherwise toned-down quite a bit from a typical ""Hughes Production"". Maybe an ""8 or 9"" for everyone else but a ""10"" for John Candy fans.",Uncle Buck
51,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Here Comes Buck!,10,14 August 2014,"Tia is a lonely and mouthy fifteen-year-old mad at her family for moving her from her childhood home in Indianapolis. She often curses and swears at her brother Miles and sister Maisie, and is very sarcastic. One night her grandfather has a heart attack, and her parents are forced to leave her and her siblings and dog in the company of Buck, an overweight, unmarried slob who has never taken care of a child in his life, heck, he can't even take care of himself! This situation provides tons of comedic moments, but Buck wants to prove that he cares for his nieces and nephew. When Tia is almost raped at a party, Buck rescues her, and she realizes he isn't just an irresponsible loser like she thought.Uncle Buck is hands down the funniest movie I've ever seen! One scene has stuck with me in it for years: Buck goes to Maisie's school and meets the principal, who has a large wart on her face. After she tells Buck that Maisie has too much imagination and is a ""bad egg"", Buck loudly lectures her on her bad methods of teaching and concludes with, ""here... take this quarter, go downtown... and have a rat gnaw that thing off your face! ...Good day to you, Miss."" Uncle Buck has classic and unique soundtrack, and great acting. It was great seeing John Candy as Buck and as Miles, the child star of Home Alone and the Good Son.Uncle Buck was a laugh riot from beginning to end, there are no changes I would have made to it. Buck stands up for the children every time, from beating up the sleazy drunk party clown who shows up for Miles' birthday to standing up for Maisie at school.Definitely a comedic and dramatic movie, best one I've ever seen to be honest!",Uncle Buck
52,wisewebwoman,John Candy gives a great performance....,5,18 August 2006,"in spite of working with some thin cliché-ridden material. John Candy had excellent comedic timing and he makes the most of it here in a well worn plot of parents being away, a scraping of the bottom of the barrel for a sitter for the children in the shape of the nogoodnik Uncle Buck who fixes horse-races for a living.Uncle Buck can't settle down and has the proverbial long term successful girlfriend with a heart of gold. You get the two young adorable children, the sullen teenager that you know will do a 180 turn before the end of the flick, and you predict a happily ever after ending with reformed characters everywhere. You are not disappointed when all this comes to pass.In the meantime, Uncle Buck displays a disturbing dark side: witness his interaction with the school vice-principal and his treatment of his niece's boyfriend. Not jocular at all. Also that neighbour woman, how strange was that? H'mmm. More to this than a simple comedy, it appears. Almost like two movies pretending to be one. 5 out of 10.",Uncle Buck
53,michaeltrivedi,Classic,7,18 December 2019,"Funny movie. Culkin is great, and so is Candy. It's really a great movie, not just fun and games. It's about a slacker with nothing going for him, taking care of his sisters kids. He learns a lot from doing so, and the kids learn something about life and themselves too.Very good film. Not the very best, but great nonetheless.7 stars",Uncle Buck
54,Rabical-91,''Get in your mouse and get out of here!'',10,6 September 2017,"Even after two and a half decades, it is still impossible to grasp the fact that comedy legend John Candy is no longer with us. No longer with us in the physical sense, that is, for in the minds of us all he still lives on strongly as a comedic genius. The hulking, bulky frog faced actor gave pleasure to millions during his life, one of which I was one of the millions. 'Uncle Buck' is my favourite John Candy movie of all time, superbly written and excellently acted. It was brought to life by John Hughes, who had earlier worked with Candy on 'Planes, Trains & Automobiles' and 'The Great Outdoors'. It is also here that both Hughes and Candy worked with future star of Hughes' 1990 blockbuster 'Home Alone'.It stars off like this - Cindy and Bob Russell ( Garett M. Brown and Elaine Bromka ) have moved from Indianapolis to Chicago following promotion at their work, much to the consternation of their eldest daughter, the bitter and resentful Tia ( Jean Louise Kelly ), who was happy with their life in Indianapolis. Their two younger children, Miles ( Macaulay Culkin ) and Maisie ( Gaby Valentini ), also find it difficult to adapt to their new life in Chigaco. One night, Cindy receives a phone call informing her that her father has suffered a heart attack, prompting them to travel back to Indianapolis to tend to him. The problem is, they do not know where to find someone to watch the kids at such short notice. Bob suggests that they try his brother Buck. Cindy pours scorn on the idea, disapproving of his working class roots, but eventually ( though reluctantly ) relents as he is the only person available. Buck, who is in a difficult relationship with his fiery girlfriend Chanice ( gorgeous Amy Madigan ), upon his arrival immediately hits it off with the two younger children however Tia is less than accepting of him, particularly when he comes between her and her lecherous boyfriend.Buck finds himself dealing with a lot of hilarious situations, such as attempting to do the laundry, making giant pancakes for Miles' birthday, cutting Maisie's horrid school mistress down to size for her berating of Maisie, standing up to a drunken clown who almost ruins Miles' birthday party. Despite his scuzzy ways, he is not without some morals and, in some cases, is proved to be more sensible than is given credit for. Tia eventually makes her peace with Buck when she discovers that her boyfriend was two-timing her and, as well as reconciling with Chanice when she was wrongly informed of Buck being unfaithful to her.'Uncle Buck' is by turns funny, touching, believable and poignant. Real chemistry between Candy and the rest of the cast make the film both memorable and entertaining. Sadly, the man's weight problems took him from us in 1994, aged only 43. Amy Madigan is also superb as the impatient Chanice though sexy Jean Louise Kelly is the one who shines most in her time on screen with Candy. Macaulay Culkin is hilarious as Miles and it was his performance here that won him the role of Kevin McAllister in 'Home Alone', which would soon make his name and fortune. The scene is which he interrogates Buck about what he does for a living is a golden moment of classic comedy. Gaby Valentini is annoying however as the whining Maisie and I could not take to Elaine Bromka and Garret M. Brown either as the snobbish parents. That really is the only drawback of this otherwise perfect movie. Ira Newborn's wonderful soundtrack also lodges itself in the memory.The following year, a television sitcom based around the character of Buck was made, with Kevin Meaney taking on the lead role. It flopped immediately ( a similar problem that blighted the sitcom adaption of the 'Police Academy' movies ) and to this day has never been screened outside of America. Hardly surprising. After all, trying to follow Candy's act is nigh on impossible.Funniest moment - the altercation between Buck and the drunken, foul mouthed clown!",Uncle Buck
55,areatw,John Candy is hilarious as Uncle Buck,7,2 April 2020,"'Uncle Buck' is a likeable film with a fun story and an entertaining lead character. John Candy isn't an actor I was familiar with before watching this film, in fact I think he passed away before I was even born, but he definitely suits the role of Buck role down to the ground.The success of this film obviously hinged on the title character and had Candy not brought the laughs, it would have been a different film entirely and for the worse. Thankfully though he brings a lot of energy and eccentricity to this role and it makes for a very entertaining watch.Even though this is the first time I've seen 'Uncle Buck', it does have that 'rewatchability' about it that all great comedy movies do and I'm sure I'll watch it again in the future.",Uncle Buck
56,mattymatt4ever,Entertaining fluff,7,26 April 2002,"It's a John Hughes flick, don't expect anything deep and philosophical, or even anything unpredictable.  What counts is John Candy is the star, and watching this movie on the Disney Channel helps me better realize how much of a great comedian he was.  It's been a while since his death, and that's why it's good that they show this movie to pay homage to the great John Candy.  The script is sometimes lame, and some of the bits don't work, but most of it does due to Candy's funny antics.  His perfect handling of comic moments, including frying up a giant pancake and beating up an alcoholic clown, helps overcome the predictable, fluffy script.  Plus, since the movie was made in the late 80s it was great to hear Tone Loc's ""Wild Thing."" 
""Uncle Buck"" is harmless family entertainment--far from great, but definitely watchable and quite funny.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",Uncle Buck
57,Karl Self,John Hughes cut a diamond out of a clunker,8,4 August 2010,"A well-to-do couple is forced to ask the deadbeat brother-in-law to babysit their precocious offspring for a few days. What sounds like the recipe for a cinematic disaster is turned into a witty, captivating and timeless (I saw this a few days ago, 21 years after it was shot) movie - - for what it's worth, a masterpiece.That said, I once again stumbled over John Hughes remarkably antiquated sexual ethics, as shown up by ""uncle Buck""'s attitude towards his sixteensomething year-old niece Tia. Buck takes umbrage against his niece smooching some boy from her school. In what I would describe as a fairly creepy reaction vis à vis normal, healthy and age-adequate behaviour, Buck tries to ""protect"" his niece against what he sees as a ""sexual predator"" by threatening the would-be Romeo with silly lines like ""I could circumcise a gnat with an axe"". Eventually Tia sees her error and presumably decides to save herself for marriage -- which could take some time, as demonstrated by uncle Buck's girlfriend, who, at roughly 40, still has to wait for her love interest to drop the question ...",Uncle Buck
58,Beta_Gallinger,"While it's no ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"", this is a pretty funny John Hughes/John Candy film with some good sentiment",7,16 April 2010,"I've seen several of the movies John Hughes made in the 80's (the decade I was born), none of which have failed to impress me. I first saw his 1987 film, ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" starring John Candy and Steve Martin, in 2006, and thought it was a great comedy. I watched it for the second time late last year, over three years after my first viewing, and this didn't change anything. ""Uncle Buck"" is another movie written, directed, and produced by Hughes and starring Candy, both of whom are sadly no longer with us. I had known about this film for quite a while by the time I finally saw it, and I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the 1987 movie, which it isn't, but it was still enough to leave me with a good feeling.Bob and Cindy Russell recently moved from Indianapolis to Chicago with their three offspring, Miles and Maizy, who are both under ten years old, and Tia, who is now a teenager. Cindy is informed that her father has just had a heart attack, so she and her husband plan to go to Indianapolis to visit the ailing man, but first, they will have to find a sitter for their kids. After several failed attempts, it seems they have no choice but to call over Bob's unmarried brother, Buck Russell to take the job, even though he is a lazy, irresponsible slob, which means this could lead to disaster! Nonetheless, Buck agrees to come over and stay with Miles, Maizy, and Tia while his brother and sister-in-law are in Indianapolis. Inevitably, his presence in this household does lead to some trouble, especially with Tia. She does not appreciate her uncle's presence and is currently going through a phase of teen angst and rebelliousness.At the beginning of this movie, it's not all that great. When Tia (played by Jean Louisa Kelly) first appears, it doesn't take long for one to realize that she is a very unlikable, snotty character, though there are some fairly funny lines in that very early scene with the Russell siblings. I also didn't think Macaulay Culkin (in the role of Miles Russell) talking about a certain dog being a ""ball-sniffer"" that funny. However, as I had hoped, John Candy does a great job playing the title role. He plays the same kind of character here as he did in ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"", a lovable slob. I think his talent really helps carry this film, and his character's antics are probably the main reason why so much of it is funny, with the slapstick and comical dialogue. Around the time when the character leaves his apartment and goes to the family's house, I was laughing very hard, with scenes such as his phone conversation before he leaves and Buck knocking on the wrong door when he arrives. If it stayed this way for the rest of the film, I would be giving it at least an 8/10, but it doesn't. Tia continues to be snotty, and for much of the film, I laughed a lot but not as hard as before, but Candy's antics still make much of this film entertaining, sometimes hilarious, with the lead character annoying Tia, scaring her boyfriend, the explosion sound his car engine makes, his conversation with the elementary assistant principal, etc. It helps that there are also some good dramatic moments in the movie, especially towards the end.Basically, what makes this flick inferior to ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" is that it's not as consistent as its predecessor, and the 1987 John Hughes/John Candy collaboration certainly doesn't have any characters that are as off-putting as the Tia character is here. In between those two films, Hughes wrote but didn't direct a comedy entitled ""The Great Outdoors"", which also features Candy in the cast, but I haven't seen that one, so I don't know how it compares, but ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" and ""Uncle Buck"" are both funny comedies which can also be serious in some scenes, with good sentiment, and Candy really stands out in both of them. The two movies can also easily leave viewers with a good feeling at the end. I can understand why ""Uncle Buck"" doesn't have the appeal of its hilarious predecessor, but there is a lot to make it watchable, and it can remind us of the talent Hughes and Candy had.",Uncle Buck
59,SanteeFats,Good stuff,8,27 June 2013,"John Candy, rest his soul, plays an understated role here. He is funny as usual but low keyed about it. His portrayal of Uncle Buck, the untrustworthy, unreliable, black sheep of the family I thought was excellent. When a family emergency comes up Uncle Buck is the only available person to watch the two kids as the parents must leave. He ends up teaching the rebellious teenage daughter a few things about life and rescues her from a tight situation, causing her to reevaluate her Uncle Buck. The young brother is at times an adversary and at others an ally. So to some it up all ends well and when the parents return expecting a disaster they find everything is okay.",Uncle Buck
60,Mister-6,"""Buck"" wild....",8,9 November 1999,"Time was when you saw John Hughes' name on the credits, you could be assured of a good time at the movies.  Like here in ""Uncle Buck"". He writes and directs Candy et al in a movie where family values, personal worth and hungover clowns are all dealt with head on.Candy was always the perfect foil for a movie like this: genial, jovial and handy with a drill.  He does his best babysitting his brother's kids, even when his best is often considered other peoples' worst.I crack up every time I see Candy and Culkin engaged in that ""Dragnet"" discussion at the kitchen table (""You have a lot more hair up your nose than my dad.""  ""How nice of you to notice.""  ""I'm a kid: that's my job."").  Love it.In fact, the whole movie serves as a reminder that Hughes is or was) a good writer.  Note the more slim use of violent slapstick here and the more subtle dialogue.  Signs that Hughes hadn't become immersed in the world of the Three Stooges just yet.You want a good light laugh?  Watch this movie at all costs.  Guilt-free laughs are hard to come by nowadays.Eight stars.  Just say ""Uncle""!",Uncle Buck
61,Atreyu_II,Good comedy,7,16 August 2007,"""Uncle Buck"" is an okay movie with lots of hilarious moments. This is no slapstick comedy, but it contains some dark and morbid humor... in a funny way, without going farther than that, which is a good thing. John Candy is pure genius here. The role of uncle Buck Russell was perfect for him. Buck is a very clumsy yet lovable guy, not to mention that he's got a great sense of humor. I also like the other side of his humor: black and sarcastic. He says many funny lines, being «What's his last name, Spray?» only one among numerous others. John Candy was a great comedian. It's sad that he's no longer with us.Jean Louisa Kelly does a great job by portraying the rebellious and vindictive Tia Russell. Tia has a terrible temper and is spoiled and bratty. Strangely that makes her funny (probably because this is in a movie) but in real life I couldn't stand someone like her.Macaulay Culkin and Gaby Hoffmann (two talented kids from that time) star as the brothers Miles and Maizy. Both are cool kids, but Miles is the coolest and cutest of the two.Other actors good in their roles are: Amy Madigan as Chanice Kobolowski, Garrett M. Brown as Bob Russell, Elaine Bromka as Cindy Russell, Laurie Metcalf as Marcie Dahlgren-Frost and Jay Underwood as Bug. (that's really his name? lol)Another strength of this movie is in its soundtrack. There are plenty of nice and catchy songs, such as ""Rhythm of life"", ""Tweedlee Dee"", ""Juke Box Baby"", ""Mr. Sandman"" and ""Wild Thing"".Uncle Buck's car is awesome. What a cool piece of junk/old land-yacht! It's a 1975 Mercury Marquis Brougham. That car produces unbelievable amounts of smoke through its exhaust pipe and the engine does that explosion-like noise, which only accents the comical effect. But in real life, a car polluting the air like that would make the driver get easily caught by the police. As much as Buck's car is an old wreck, it seems to be a strong car, although a slow one. I also like very much that mouse-like gray Volkswagen Beetle (Pooter-the-Clown's car) - it's sooo cute!",Uncle Buck

Nothing feels forced although the comedy for me wasn't the greatest and I felt the movie got slow. Some scenes in the movie I felt were unecessary made the film drag a little to long.
Not to mention it got cruel at times towards Buck and the mother/father are practically forgotten about for half the film.

Hughes' comedic genius is undeniable, along with the drama in this movie. Not only it is a good comedy but another thing that John Hughes proves in this movie is that how stupid teenagers can be, and how valuable spending time with family members you don't remember or have never met can really be instead instead of spending time with teenage losers of which Tia used to consider friends.",Uncle Buck

The story is very simple and far from anything complex, but it is very entertaining and you really grow to know and like all of the characters.  This is a very well written film.John Candy pulls off one of his best performances in his career.  It's so sad to think that there won't be any more John Candy films, I miss the guy. John Candy has such an great style about him, he's very good at being both comedic and dramatic, he does an excellent job of shifting gears rather convincingly in all of his films.  Jean Louisa Kelly does a very nice job as well, she has one heck of a scowl in the film.  Gaby Hoffman and Macaulay Culkin are two little gems in the films.  They are two tremendous little actors, where have they been all these years?  Amy Madigan was a nice touch in the film, she played her part very well.  Director, John Hughes, pulls off another great credit to his name, I hope he keeps up the good work.If you are a fan of John Candy, definitely see this film as soon as possible, I'm sure you'll like it.  The film has a very nice story to it and is quite touching at times.  There is virtually nothing I don't like about this film, if you like comedic family films, then you need to check this out.  I truly hope that you enjoy the movie as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Uncle Buck
66,Horror-yo,Experimental 'Home Alone' before the real 'Home Alone',6,21 February 2017,"This is basically a reversed 'Home Alone', where instead of parents leave kid home alone and villains try to break in and chaos ensues, it's parents leave kids home alone and good guy uncle steps in and chaos ensues.The formula was always going to work, the family values, relatable characters from the youngest toddler to the grownup teen, her annoying boyfriend, the big old annoyingly happy uncle... but they had to give it that little bit of extra flavor and they at least somewhat managed that. Some of the scenes are genuinely funny, and one couldn't say the humor is completely lazy. They also do well at creating a good uncle/niece-nephew relationship and therefor do what they set out to do.All in all it's certainly a forgettable late 80's mainstream comedy, but John Candy does well, it somewhat introduces Macauly Culkin to the public (who would go on to star in 'Home Alone' a year later by the same writer) and beautiful Jean Louisa Kelly who plays 'Tia' in the film holds her role very well, which isn't always easy.",Uncle Buck
67,grendelkhan,Do you really need a review?,8,16 October 2012,"I doubt another review is really necessary; but, hey, I have an ego to feed. Uncle Buck is another in the line of John Hughes family comedies that dominated the 80s and early 90s. They are all pretty much the same; precocious kids, clueless parents, wacky outsiders, etc, etc. However, Uncle Buck rises above due to John Candy's wonderful performance, ably assisted by young Macaulay Culkin (and a few others). The film has a wonderful cast, with Amy Madigan and Lori Metcalfe adding some character touches, and a nice cast of talented (and cute) kids.Candy plays Buck Russell, black sheep of the family, who comes to the aid of his desperate brother. His father-in-law has had a heart attack and they need someone to watch the kids while they travel to be with him. The family already has a strained relationship, with oldest daughter Tia at odds with everyone, but especially her mother. Buck may be a screwup, but he's there when family calls.Candy has a great rapport with the young actors and much chaos and silliness ensues. The height is the well documented (in the trailer) scene of Culkin and Candy, in their take on the classic Dragnet back and forth. However, the film reaches beyond just the cute moments, with Buck trying to bond with Tia, the only one of the children he has a history with. Nothing he does seems to please her; but that doesn't mean he isn't afraid to call her on her BS and bad attitude. His tough love actually starts getting to her, though it takes a while to finally get through.In the end, Buck matures from the responsibility of caring for the kids, while they have a great time with their ""black sheep"" uncle. Tia mends fences and Buck moves into a new area of his relationship.The film has many great scenes and has a fine story, even if it is predictable from the opening credits. Much like a Frank Capra film, you know how things will turn out; but, the cast are talented enough to get you to set that aside and enjoy the film.Uncle Buck demonstrates what a tragic loss John Candy's death brought to comedy, and how Macaulay Culkin's issues sidelined a talented actor. Still, it draws you into its little fantasy world and entertains you while you're there. Definitely one for everyone.",Uncle Buck
68,bregund,Comedy with some heart,7,24 June 2018,"John Candy was a brilliant performer, I watched him from his start on SCTV, where he honed his craft to perfection. Come to think of it, most of the actors/comedians on that show are brilliant: Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Andrea Martin, Dave Thomas, Rick Moranis, Martin Short, all of whom have turned in star performances at one time or another. Some of the other reviews have said this is his best role, and I tend to agree, Hughes could really get depths of comedy and pathos out of him. The humanity of this film escaped me when I saw it on its release, and at the time I dismissed it as meandering, but Tia's transformation makes much more sense to me now, and the film as a whole works. But there are two things that bother me about the movie, one of them being Cindy's disdain for Buck, who actually doesn't seem like that bad of a guy. She really doesn't like Buck because his girlfriend works in a tire store? The other thing that bothers me is the over-the-top scene with the vice principal, which doesn't fit the rest of the film, the character is too severe and unrealistic, and gives the impression that it was put there to pad out the film or give Candy an opportunity to mine the scene for laughs. All in all, I'm glad I revisited this film thirty years later, I can appreciate Candy even more, despite the fact that he was eating himself to death. Clearly he gained weight during the shooting of the film, he's obviously heavier by the end.",Uncle Buck
69,richieandsam,"A good film, but not the best Hughes film.",6,15 October 2013,"UNCLE BUCKThis is a ""classic"" film from the 80's that I have never seen before.The film is about a lazy slob who has to babysit his brothers 3 children while they go away urgently. Buck has never looked after anyone before and can barely look after himself what makes it worst is the teenage daughter hates him and will do anything to make the babysitting harder than it has to be.This is a John Hughes film. John Hughes was a genius at writing comedies. I don't think there is anyone who has the same vision and imagination he had. There are so many great comedies out there with his name on them. This is not as good as some of the others, but it is still good.There are some really funny moments in this film. It helps that the main character is played by John Candy. I don't mean to throw this word out there too much, but John was a legend also. I love John's work. He has also made so many really good movies. I was gutted when he died. The one scene that had me in stitches with laughter was when Buck tried to use a urinal in a school it is hilarious watching him trying to pee kneeling and squatting. Haha! There were a few other moments that had me laughing too.Other cast members were Jean Louisa Kelly playing the moody teenager Tia. She was OK, but there were moments where I found her annoying. Not because her character was horrible, but because I thought she struggled to act certain scenes. There were moments where I thought she just wasn't very convincing, but at other points she was OK. Gaby Hoffmann and Macauley Culkin. They were not very good at all but I always find that 99% of child actors can't act. There is the odd exception though. Macauley Culkin made this before he hit it big in Home Alone. And he was even more annoying in this than in Home Alone.All in all, this is a good comedy that is very entertaining, but the story is nothing new. It kind of reminded me of Big Daddy although Big Daddy was made after this. It is generally a story about someone who should not look after anyone has no choice but to look after children.I will give this film 6 out of 10.""Here's a quarter buy a rat chew that thing off your face!""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Uncle Buck

If you love Candy - who doesn't??? - then you'll love this movie.

75,mOVIemAN56,"A Funny Family Film, Candy As Good As Usual",8,25 April 2005,"Uncle Buck was a film that was overlooked in my opinion by many people. It is after John Candy's glory days of Spaceballs (1987), Planes, Trains, and Automoblies (1987), and The Great Outdoors (1988)but this movie kept him going for a few more years.Cindy Russel's (Elaine Bromka) father is ill. Along with her husband, Bob (Garrett M. Brown) they will leave three kids behind to travel to Idianapolis to be at his side. Resorted to the last choice for a babysitter, Bob calls his brother Kurt (John Candy) to watch the kids. On his first day, he scares Miles (Macaulay Culkin) half to death and earns an enemy from the eldest daughter Tia (Jean Louisa Kelly) by trying to be nice. It is obvious that Kurt has no idea what he is doing but is able to adapt to the kids (except Tia) and be a mentor. Problems arise as Tia becomes more of a renegade and runs off late at night. Candy's ingenious ways of persuading the kids to brush their teeth or drying the clothes by attaching them to the ceiling fan are funny and inventive. He is protective when he needs to be and supportive when confronted with the problems of the children.The film is a funny family film. John Candy is smart and likable in this and Macaulay Culkin is supportive in one of his earliest roles. The film portrays a family message of togetherness and love, it is effective and fun.Uncle Buck. Starring: John Cnady, Macaulay Culkin, Laurie Metcalf, Jean Louisa Kelly, Gaby Hoffmann, and Jay Underwood.3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",Uncle Buck

77,TheHonestCritic,This comedy film is a classic! How does it hold up?,10,5 July 2021,"""Uncle Buck"" (1989), I remember when I first watched this movie, I loved it right away! John Candy is one of my top ten favorite comedic actors, and I think that this is his all-time best film, in my opinion. Not only is it John Candy's greatest movie, but it's also on my top ten all-time favorite comedy films list. Every time I watch it, I laugh just as hard, if not harder whenever I see it. ""Uncle Buck"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a phenomenal soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, a bachelor and an overall slob babysits his brother's defiant teenage daughter and her younger brother and sister. That's about as basic a plot as you can get. Ordinarily, in a lot of movie, it would be too simple. However, since this is a comedy film, a simple storyline is warranted. In comedy films, the simpler the plot, the better. With an easy but effective plot, there is more room for jokes, humor and also slapstick in your screenplay. ""Uncle Buck"" takes every advantage it possibly can and has fun with every single one of them. Every joke and humorous moment is a home run and the story itself is also heartwarming at the same time. That's a hard thing to pull off, making a comedic and heartwarming movie. The whole film is fantastic! But, my favorite scene in this movie is where Uncle Buck meets with Assistant Principal Anita Hoargarth. I won't go into any details about it, but it involves a wart. Trust me when I say that whenever I watch that scene, I laugh out loud. Seriously, my laughter is just shrill! The whole film is just as hilarious as that one scene, but in my opinion, it's the funniest part of the movie. Overall, the story is outstanding from beginning to end. You will be just as intrigued, as you will be laughing. All of the acting is phenomenal, from the whole cast! But, John Candy steals the show here. It's a shame that he died so young, he could've made so many more great films. This movie, as well as the others that he plays in, are comedy gold. But, this movie is his best one. The rest of the cast is just as strong, their chemistry on the screen is impeccable! All of the sets/locations are perfect and give the movie a beautiful atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Ira Newborn is perfect and it definitely helps set the perfect tone for the movie. What else can I say about the film score? Except for the fact that Ira Newborn nailed it! ""Uncle Buck"" is a comedy masterpiece in the world of cinema and it belongs on my top ten all-time favorite comedy films list for good reasons. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Uncle Buck"", go and see it today, especially if you're a fan of John Candy. However, if you're looking to get into his movies and don't know where to begin, start with this one. To end my review, let's have a moment of silence for the late, but great, John Candy (R. I. P.) Go check out ""Uncle Buck"" any way that you can. Or else, Uncle Buck may strike you with a golf ball!",Uncle Buck
78,nomoons11,John Candy at his best,9,20 January 2012,"Right off, this is easily John Candy's best film. Most when asked..""You know John Candy?""...More than likely the answer will be..""Oh yeah...Uncle Buck."" Like many other John Hughes films, Uncle Buck relies on Comedy and a little bit of love. John Hughes was good at that. This was a precursor to Home Alone and when you see both back to back you'll notice the obvious similarities. A lotta comedy and a lotta love.Another one of John Hughes' strengths was casting. He couldn't have picked a better bunch to round out this gem of a film. The 2 kids are just perfect for what this film was made to do. There are so many moments involving these youngsters that'll make you laugh it's just not fair. Goes to show you don't need grownup dialog to get big laughs.For me, what I remember the most when I watch this film is the last shot in the film. I'm not ashamed to say every time I watch this film the last scene makes me cry. I grew up on John Candy all the way back to SCTV and when I see that parting shot of him waiving goodbye, it always reminds me of his death. He died way too young but what a perfect way to show what great actor and guy John Candy was.Man I miss John Candy.",Uncle Buck
79,deepfrieddodo,Classic Comedy,8,20 December 2020,"A really fun film with genuine laughs throughout, it does exactly what you would hope it to. Candy performs perfectly and has great chemistry with the kids. The eldest is a little irritating and quite often the film jumps from one scene to the next without much flow, shoehorning skits in wherever possible, but it's entertaining and so it gets away with this. An easy watch, can't be any complaints.",Uncle Buck
80,cosmic_quest,John Candy at his best,8,23 May 2006,"The late, great John Candy always came across as this big, lovable rogue of man who had a heart of gold so 'Uncle Buck' really plays on these attributes to bring together a wonderful comedy that will leave you alternating between laughter and feeling all fuzzy! John Candy stars in the title role of Uncle Buck, the slob bachelor uncle who is grudgingly called upon to babysit his sensible brother's three children while the parents have to go out of town visiting a sick relative. Buck copes admirably with the adorable eight-year-old Miles and six-year-old Maisy. However, his work is cut out when it comes to dealing with the eldest of the children, fifteen-year-old Cindy, who is a sullen, cynical teenager who has no time for her uncle's light-hearted, down-trodden ways. It doesn't take long for the battle of wills between slob and teen to thunder through the house.Watching the film, it certainly seems that Candy was born for such a role. He really brings the character to life, portraying Buck's slovenly side as well as what makes him such a genuinely nice, decent guy who you would love to have as an uncle. Jean Louisa Kelly, as Cindy, nicely compliments him by depicting her initial disgust that she is related to such a man but later discovers they do have a few things in common (such as a sadistic side!) 'Uncle Buck' walks a nice balance between being a hilarious comedy, as we see Buck's antics in dealing with the alien territory of family life, and being a warming family film that doesn't delve into being overly-sentimental. Highly recommended even if it is just to see how Buck curtly deals with Cindy's sleazy boyfriend Bug!",Uncle Buck
81,eskimosound,Wonderful Movie...,10,8 May 2020,"John Candy was such a star, this is one of his best, if not his best movie.
It's just well crafted, funny, heartwarming and generous.
John Hughes (another wonderful movie maker taken from us too soon) movies are all nice, gentle, clever and funny and John Candy fits his style.
Look out for the Home Alone reference!!

82,gitrich,It's funny and touching and is one of Candy's best efforts.,10,7 November 1998,"John Candy as Uncle Buck is exactly the right role for this talented comedian. The film is the story of Candy (Uncle Buck) taking care of his brother's three children for a few days. Uncle Buck's niece, a teen, creates some problems that must be dealt with. This is a good comedy with several touching moments too. Along with Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Uncle Buck ranks as one of John Candy's best films.",Uncle Buck
83,gitrich,"A sensitive, often touching film that was made for John Candy's talents.",10,4 December 1998,"Uncle Buck is a lovable character who, though irresponsible at times, loves his brother's children like his own. He winds up trying to deal with more than he bargained for when he must keep track of his teenage niece who tests the limits while her parents are not at home. It is funny and touching, something Candy does very well. This is a movie worth renting and one that teens and up can really enjoy.",Uncle Buck
84,Semisonic,Didn't catch my attention,4,18 April 2015,"I actually wanted to like this movie. I downloaded it because i thought that maybe it would have that Home Alone vibe. And at some point it seemed that maybe the writer/director John Hughes was trying for the same thing. Even the house of the Russell family looked as if they could live on the same street as McCallisters.Unfortunately, this film lacked the main ingredient that made Home Alone so successful. No, not the dumb robbers and the Saw-like traps inducing pain and agony. It failed to be either funny or gripping. The first fifteen minutes pass, and there's not a single good laughing moment. People on the screen are generally unhappy, pouring their problems right on the viewer's head. But to connect with people's problems you need a dramatic approach, that requires character buildup and a fair degree of seriousness. Instead, we have some slapstick-style comedy tricks like a pile of things falling onto a person who doesn't keep his closet tidy or people yelling on the street in the middle of the night and waking up all the neighbors.I admit that after 20 minutes of watching i turned off this movie. But, to be fair, i gave it enough time to raise at least some amount of interest in me, and it just failed. Maybe Uncle Buck has some moments of glory later on, but if a filmmaker hides everything of value under the overly long, lazy, heavy-hearted and plain boring opening, then it means that something's not right in the Hughes kingdom. A movie where the audience has to sit through all the bland stuff to be given something interesting at last is like a fly in in the ointment, only this time it's not a single fly but a swarm of them and the ointment itself is quite so-so.",Uncle Buck
85,the_oak,I like the unpredictability of Buck,7,8 April 2018,"Roger Ebert gave this movie 1,5 stars out of 4. I don't agree, and I think he just didn't understand the slightly misanthropic elements in the humor. Buck is clearly not normal, so why be surprised that he has these dark sides? This movie is watchable and in the end it has a positive message. The fact that Buck is such a hopeless person, maybe he just needed to find himself and also being allowed to be himself? His sister in law can't stand him, but she is frankly not very nice herself, and when she comes back home and her daughter throws herself into her arms and says she loves her, we feel with them all. Another reviewer said it like this: ""Buck saves his family and in the end saves himself."" I think that is pretty heavy stuff in what is supposed to be a comedy.",Uncle Buck
86,Chromium_5,Great stuff from Candy and Hughes,7,1 April 2005,"John Candy was an amazing comedian who didn't get a lot of chances to really shine. Most of his movies are forgettable and lame, but John Hughes recognized his talent and used it to make two hilarious movies (the latter, ""Planes, Trains And Automobiles,"" is an all-time classic in my opinion). ""Uncle Buck"" lets Candy have great fun with the role of a slobby bachelor who seems like the type of person to keep your kids away from, but who turns out to be an incredibly responsible and caring guy. He has some very funny moments, most notably the scenes with Tia's moronic boyfriend, Bug, and trying to act cool around the kids at a wild party. The supporting cast is good too, especially little Macaulay Culkin, who was always a hoot (I love the way he shouts ""WHO ARE YOU!?"" when he first sees Uncle Buck in the house). It's a fun movie, and definitely worth watching for John Candy at his best.",Uncle Buck

Just from watching his character in the movie made me want to be a part of his antics and absurd humor. The movie's message is great and the family is nicely cast. Plenty of memorable lines and scenes as well.However all I have to say is... John Candy is an absolute legend. His screen presence alone is powerful and the epitome of everything endearing. The way he told a joke or unleashed sarcasm was fantastic, and portrays Buck Russell to the highest degree. The movie itself is classic Hughes set in suburban Chicago. Jean Louise Kelly reels in a great performance as the angsty teen, and the dialog is both charming and witty. And who doesn't love ""the beast""? The car Buck drives is a memorable and just one of the many antics Buck has in his arsenal throughout this gem of a film.Even if the emotion gets a bit mushy for some, ""Uncle Buck"" is a classic, but not just any ole' classic... A John Hughes Classic, strongly driven with a hell of a performance by Candy.",Uncle Buck
89,kylehodgdon,Okay Kids Movie But It Could Be Better,6,30 December 2009,"I thought that ""Uncle Buck"" was an okay watch. It is not a film that I saw when I was young, so I really have no attachment to it that way. I feel as though there are better kids movies out there than this one.My girlfriend had me watch this because she claimed that it was very, very funny. However, I really did not find it all too humorous. Sure there are times where you might chuckle, but they are few and far between. The characters really do nothing for me. The older daughter plays the role of the antagonist who goes around in a bad mood all movie long for no good reason. The two younger kids are cute, but play very minor roles. The woman neighbor is very strange, not in an interesting way, but in a ""I really don't want you to be in this movie"" kind of way. As for Uncle Buck himself, he had his moments throughout the movie, but all in all I really thought he could have been more interesting.As for the story, I thought that too was okay, but could have been better. This might be something that kids might really like, but there are far superior kids movies out there.",Uncle Buck

There are some terrific scenes and moments in this film.  This movie has a nice pace and a sweet comfortable tone that make it enjoyable to watch.  It has several actors that you may recognize including MacCaulay Culkin, Laurie Metcalf, Gaby Hoffmann and Jay Underwood.  The one annoying fault of this movie is that the foul language is a bit too crude for my tastes. Little children cursing is not funny.  Get it on DVD and use a filter to remove the foul language in a few spots and this is a fun family film.  John Hughes, the director, displays his comic flair in Uncle Buck and Hughes went on to direct the megahit, Home Alone with MacCaulay Culkin.",Uncle Buck

This was his uber-role, the outwardly boorish man who is inwardly sensitive and avuncular.  Buck with a chainsaw is a sight you won't forget, and his Q&A scene with the young Macaulay Culkin is a killer too.  Candy was one of a kind.",Uncle Buck

Although Bob's brother is a bit of a home wrecker, Buck is the only option. At first Buck proves to be as carefree as billed showing to be no figure to look up to. After some time passes Buck's young niece and nephew grow on him breaking him from his normal routine, he actually becomes a fatherly figure. Even growing a sort of protective instinct with his teenage niece as she gets involved with a pig of a teenage heartthrob forcing Buck to step in. Who knew that in a few short days a man lacking any responsibility or backbone completely flip the script learning there is more to life then just floating by.Just another absolute classic from comedic legend John Candy, a man that left us way too soon. Candy's prowess as a comedian take hold in this film while he shows beautiful chemistry with the children. At certain points however the film touches on real issues and truly has a nice message with a certain level of tenderness that keeps viewers grounded.

You must get the right kids and ""B"" actors like Amy Madigan (helped she graduated from Marquette University with a degree in philosophy) as the hard driving girlfriend. When you fill the story with memorable characters (think Seinfeld, nobody did it better) the depth and satisfaction remains after the movie. These movies are lost today with ""animation"" CGI nonsense (thank you Toy Story) and so many take cultural issues that lose merit even after three years.

A child who spent his teen years in the eighties, I saw 'The Breakfast club' and 'Ferris Bueller's day off' during that era. However, Uncle Buck had passed me by. No more.John Candy was the perfect choice for the buffon uncle who is brought in at a moment's notice to care for his nephew and niece's. Slapstick humour and laughs abound. Inevitably, the fractious relationship he has with his teenage neice forms the back story for the movie and is suitably resolved by the coda.All in all, a great movie especially if you are (or have an interest in) of an 80's vintage.",Uncle Buck

John Candy shines as Uncle Buck. He brings the character alive and you can't help but wish you had a crazy guy like that as an uncle.Well, maybe a distant uncle, but still he's warm, lovable and helpless in so many ways. As one would expect, the story is simple, the scenes mostly predictable (except maybe the ax-murder scene?) and of course there's a happy ending.The little kids, Maisy and Miles, played by Gaby Hoffman and a slightly younger Macaulay Culkin, are simply adorable! The teenage daughter (Jean Louisa Kelly) perfectly portrays a teenage girl in the throws of that classic imbalance between childhood and adulthood.Anyway - no one dies. No one loses an eye or an arm. No houses burn down. There are no explosions, no fighter jet scenes, no wild car chases - just plain old silly fun.Go watch it. This is not a request! Uncle Buck says watch it!",Uncle Buck

It is a wonderful early performance from him, giving a glimpse of the character he would hone to such perfection in Home Alone, but this movie should always belong to Candy, who is funny and charming in every scene he appears in.There may be funnier performances from Candy, such as Planes, Trains and Automobiles, but none showcase his individual comic ability more than this.An essential addition to any video collection, as a fitting momento to one of Hollywood's must loveable and endearing funny men.",Uncle Buck

This film has many funny quotes. I also like how the film has a sensitive story line in it but still makes the a audience laugh. My favorite parts are when Uncle Buck makes the huge pancakes and Toast for Mile's Birthday and also when he dances with Marci the neighbor from across the street. He tries so hard to do the right thing for his brother's kids and you can see they actually really grow to love him. I think this film is underrated. It's a great film to watch at Christmas and if you have kids too. There aren't many well known actors in it but John Candy and Macaulay Culkin most people will know.,Uncle Buck

108,DomiMMHS,One of my favourite movies!,10,1 January 1999,"This is one of my favourite movies. It is only rather hard to say why. Only because it was one of the first good comedies I've seen? What's behind it?The movie is about a character named Buck, who is played by the late John Candy. You might think this says everything to be said. Not really. I hate most movies with John Candy in a supporting role, because these roles are mostly silly and superfluous. The worst example I have seen is his *role* in ""Brewster's millions""(starring Richard Pryor). Not so here, where he takes the lead once again. To my mind, Uncle Buck was the role of John Candy's life.This character is a man who has more faults and weaknesses than you could ever count, but it's clear that he is very warm-hearted and, *surprise!*, can be a good parent in a very inventive way. Of course this is no movie for real depth, neither is it a movie for masterful performances. This is why I was hesitating to give it 10 out of 10, but why not? It  d o e s  achieve well and it  r e a l l y  works.The teenager and both children all do a good job here and they are the perfect supply to John Candy. It was no-one minor to Roger Ebert who argued that the teenager, played by Jean Louisa Kelly, was too angry and too sharp to be sympathetic. I like reading Ebert's reviews and I wouldn't dare try to prove him wrong, but that doesn't mean I have to agree. Why should she not be too angry and too sharp? Why should she be perfect, why can't she be dark, mean and bad? And learn better in the end of the movie. And does this necessarily mean that we don't still like her character?It's kind of comforting to watch a more genuine Macaulay Culkin here, before he had become famous, and Gaby Hoffmann is also very nice to watch. I also like Laurie Metcalf here as neighbour Marci Dahlgreen-Frost, if only because this *role* seems to me like a grotesque exaggeration of her role in ""Roseanne"".",Uncle Buck
109,jamesnicholls-58600,Great comedy,8,7 June 2019,"Overall this film was a great comedy, whilst it certainly didn't make me laugh as much as the likes of Borat, National Lampoon's Vacation or Click, I got about 3 or 4 good laughs out of it whilst watching the film. The film was pretty consistent, there were a few dull scenes such as the scene at the beginning where Teia is conversing with her younger siblings but that was necessary for character development so I let that one off, I also felt his dance with the neighbour dragged on for slightly too long and a bit of the dance could've been sacrificed for more important dialogue between Buck and his girlfriend.The only genuinely dull characters in the film seemed to be the Buck's friend who was talking to Buck at the bowling alley about gambling and more significantly Buck's girlfriend. I just thought Buck's girlfriend lacked personality and really just felt like a typical average woman with barely any character development so she wasn't interesting to me and I felt all she contributed to the film was making viewers feel more sympathetic to Buck as his girlfriend dumping him wasn't his fault at all. The other characters though, except perhaps the parents were all pretty decent and Buck of course was the best character by far, he steals the show pretty much. Not often do child characters get a lot of backstory, personality or character development but I liked how the younger girl sibling was said to not take anything seriously and had a bad time at school, made her a lot more interesting and whilst Culkin's character lacked backstory and a lot of character development he did show a nice personality and made me chuckle a few times. Buck's the highlight character, he had pretty much all the qualities that make an interesting character, he's funny in a way that suits his character, not one dimensional, has a lot of backstory, can do action scenes when required as he isn't scared of having a fight and a tragic and somewhat interesting life and truly does have a huge soul. It's a shame Buck was only in one film as I think he could've been a truly iconic, well known character if some sequels were made.The scene where Buck is alone with the dog and having some beers was one of the best scenes and probably the most emotional one for me, the scene reveals viewers a some hard truths of the world we live in but it also made me connect to Buck significantly more and gave me more depth and backstory to the character too. Overall this film was pretty emotional not just in the funny way but also in a tragic and uplifting way as well throughout the film, the film is so diverse in the states of emotion it gives the viewer and I liked that aspect and I liked how it the film ended on an emotionally positive note because it gives the viewer more hope right after watching it instead of sadness like some films with dark endings do.The film had few action scenes and the few it did weren't very entertaining fights as most of the fights were done off screen and the only bit of physical action we see onscreen is Buck punching a clown twice so the action scenes could've been improved a lot. The plot wasn't that complex, probably slightly above average complexity for a film so it doesn't offer a massive amount to deeply think about but the comedy, emotion and the good amount of good characters is definitely enough for me to give this film an 8/10. I highly recommend this film to people who think they can connect to the Buck character and I think only people who struggle to laugh and don't appreciate characters interesting personalities shouldn't watch it.",Uncle Buck
110,csauer,Candy is candy,10,20 February 2006,"When we lost John Candy we lost a friend. I enjoyed all of his movies as I think I saw most of them. Uncle Buck probably his best. Tia (his niece) does'nt hate him because he's Unkle Buck, she hates him because he represents authority. She is young and rebellious as most fifteen year old teens are. Miles and Masie love him out of the get go because they see him for what he is, a big loving teddy-bear. When at the bowling ally when Buck chases Pal away the ice starts to melt as Tia starts to realize Buck is not out to get her but to protect her. Buck had to tell Tia a bit about the birds and the bees. Where was her father all her life? Anyway this movie has a lot of laughs a few tears trust and love. At the end in the scene when Tia's mother comes into the house and Tea and her embrace just about rips one's heart out. Happy ending? Why not? Don't rent it, buy it and be done with it.",Uncle Buck

I'll tell you.So, the last time we see the mother of the family (before the happy ending of the movie), 15 year old Tia is telling her how horrible Buck is. He left the kids alone, he drinks, and all that. The mother (I forget her name and don't feel like looking it up) talks to Buck and in the middle of trying not to cry, tells him that he is relieved his is there. Now obviously she isn't, but do they show her talking to the husband and telling him that they need to go home? No. They told Mac Culkin that the grandfather was doing better. But I guess not enough for them to leave and protect their family. Fine. THEN, when the parents finally do come home, Tia is standing there and gives her mother an uncharacteristic hug. Now if I was a mother (and I might never be), and my daughter gave me a hug like that after telling me such horrible things about Buck, I'd think ""holy sh!t, he raped her,"" or something equally disturbing. But no. And the mother isn't even concerned about the strange woman that Buck has in their house. Nor does she even seem to care that Buck is sleeping with both young children.A mother like that should be locked up.Oh, other than that I liked the movie.",Uncle Buck

I like the jokes where he teases the kids one by saying he has a friend in the F.B.I who can use science to find out if they don't brush there teeth or not the funny bit is their reaction. They had some great classic songs like Mr.sandman by Pat Ballard also it's very funny when the women thinks he banging his sister in law in the wash room. when he trying to open the washing machine and the women loses it when he says take this load. her name was Darcy i think.I really like how he torments and scares Tia i think it is. another great joke was tricking Tia into going bowling by saying and miming saving her hair off so she won't screw her boyfriend and get pregnant. even at the bowling ally a guy covered in scars hits on her and buck makes him poop himself by scaring him away. and the jokes get better and better its a great movie Watch it! my main problem with this movie is he smokes a lot not a good message to kids. also the sex jokes are just sticking for a movie where even 8 year olds make these jokes so......

Buck's bachelor lifestyle hasn't really prepared him for life in the 'burbs, but he learns to adjust quickly, and he and his young charges are all the better for it.  His conference with the assistant principal at his 6 year old niece's school is one of the funniest scenes in the movie.

It's got some amazing lines, and John Candy nails every scene, while managing to tug at our heart strings and make us nostalgic for the good old days. Yes, it is set in a vaguely Canadian world full of big winter hats, crappy American cars, and general politeness. I love comedy and I love Candy's sublime delivery of many memorable lines in this movie.

130,miss-freudstein,can't go wrong,9,10 October 2004,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**'Uncle Buck' is a comedy/drama movie starring John Candy as Buck Russell, Jean Louisa Kelly, Macaulay Culkin and Gaby Hoffmann. When Cindy's father has a heart attack, someone is needed to watch the kids.Buck is phoned as a last resort, (with the exception of un-contacted neighbour Marcie) and must arrive at their home as soon as possible. Cindy and Bob must go to stay with him in Indianapolis, while Buck (Bob's brother) stays with the children. Cindy doesn't trust Buck. She feels extremely uneasy and nervous about leaving the kids with him. He is a 40 year old, who is not married, has no children, gambles and hates to work. He is a light hearted character, and doesn't like to take things seriously. Things start off on the wrong foot. Miles and Maisy (Culkin and Hoffmann) don't remember him, and he doesn't even remember their names. Tia instantly clashes with him, as she does with her mother. Tia is a sarcastic, angry rebellious fifteen year old girl. She keeps her life to herself, but not her opinions. Buck warns her about the intentions of her boyfriend Bug (Jay Underwood), whom he can see straight through after meeting him.We can't help but feel sorry for Buck. He grows to love the kids, yet Tia gives him an incredibly hard time. He is hated by Cindy.(She even folded him off of her and Bob's wedding photo) Chanice(Buck's girlfriend) catches Buck with flirtatious Marcie, and gets the wrong idea of what is going on, thanks to Tia, who is trying to make things miserable for Buck.However, after Tia discovers Buck was right about Bug, we see a special relationship develop between uncle and niece. When Bob and Cindy return home, there is a heart-warming moment between mother and daughter. Uncle Buck's comedy comes fast and frequently. Buck has the greatest comedic role. My personal favourite Buck moments are when he talks to bug about the hatchet in the trunk, chat with Tia about shaving heads, and drill moments. The accompanying sound effects are so well suited here. They have a sci-fi effect, and make Buck seem rather scary to the character opposite, and funny to the viewers. Also note the way that Buck carries out household jobs, such as the washing, drying and ironing. One of the greatest lines in the movie is the 'tune-up' 'ritual killing' line (if you've seen the movie, you'll know!), beaten by the question and answers sequence between Miles and Buck. Brilliant! Miles also comes across as a comedic character. He also seems quite smart and mature for his age. This film is great to watch time and time again. It never loses its comedy value. If you have some time to spare, I suggest filling it with Uncle Buck. You won't be disappointed! My rating of Uncle Buck - 9/10.",Uncle Buck

This movie is for the entire family.John Candy is superb as Uncle Buck. He brings the character alive. This is his first movie I watched and I am already a fan. The character was very obnoxious and very likable at the same time and Candy has performed the role really well. I was sad when I looked him up and learnt he passed away at such a young age.

144,RoyDonkJazz,Home NOT Alone,10,6 December 2019,"Uncle Buck is basically Home ""not"" Alone and probably the apex of John Candy's career (not counting Trains, Planes & Automobiles). Similar to Midnight Run in that it has more heart than it should, and is funnier than it needs to be.When the parents of the Russell family learns that Cindy's father has suffered a heart attack they have to leave very suddenly for Indianapolis, and the only person they can think of to watch the children is their hopeless slob Uncle Buck.This is pure John Hughes and John Candy at their prime, and the comedy works wonders. Overall I'd say it's wonderfully zany, and it really fits perfectly in tone with Home Alone. John Candy had mastered that bumbling, half-sympathetic loveable oaf, and in true form, we are both annoyed, amused and feel kind of sorry for him as he tries his best to take care of children, which is way out of his area of expertise. The humor is a pitch perfect blend of low brow and bizarre, with some great comedic timing and classic scenes. For some reason the scene where Buck picks up a cat outside of the house, yells ""Who let the cat out?!"" and gets the reply ""We don't have a cat!"", proceeding to shoo it away, just got to me. It's a great example of that fact that good comedy does not have to rely on fancy gags, fart jokes, cussing, or even physical comedy, it's simply great comedic delivery of a very clueless character.Before it's over it gets a little more serious but it works for the character arcs, without getting ""sobby"", even if a little of the pacing deflates momentarily, on the whole it really wasn't too bad.This is not a laugh-a-minute type movie, but the overall wackiness of it took me back to a far better time for comedies.",Uncle Buck

I would hesitate letting my kids watch this all the way through, but at the same time about 40% of the jokes are obviously made for children.So... It is hard to pigeonhole this. If you are an adult that can stand some humor in this being very low brow and adolescent -plus- have a thing for John Hughes or John Candy-movies then this film probably will satisfy some centra in your brain.Decent film that suffers on some levels.

The parents' emergency is not explored, which doesn't matter, for its the screen presence of Candy which makes this film so memorable. Although Buck is seen as the oddity of the family, he implements his own morals on the kids which prove to be as rounded as their own, and quickly adapts to a parenting role despite barely knowing his nieces and nephew. The teenage daughter is also great in this picture - she creates an awkwardness to the comedy as she constantly tries to antagonise Buck to no success. I'm not one for US family comedies but this one stands out to me due to the central character's taste for trash, of which this undertone makes it more palatable, and the sentiment is kept to a minimum. A film of its era undoubtedly (Macaulay Culkin is in it), it's good to know that it still is screened perennially on TV over 20 years later.",Uncle Buck
150,theboytree,Just a beautiful film in every sense,10,13 September 2020,"This film has stayed with me since I first watched it in 1989 as a young teenager. I love John candy, not only as all of his film roles just make me smile, but it was the role he was born to play! I think I am preaching to the converted to anyone reading this review over the age of 40! You all know my sentiment, to any youthful millennial reader , I just hope you get it like I did. The laughs are cheap, but the narrative is real, we all have this belief that when the chips are down, you can rely on (Uncle Buck) family to step up! 10/10",Uncle Buck
151,jfbroughton,Simply the Best of the Best,10,17 April 2004,"Without a doubt my favorite film of all time. Since a child I have loved this film and I still watch it many years on with the same enjoyment. The essence of this film is the unbelievably likable John Candy who is utterly effortless and yet captures full attention when on screen. John Hughes, one of the most underrated directors of the last 50 years, is on form and keeps the saccharine sweet nature of the film well under control in a way few others could.Other than Candy the rest of the cast is amazing with many household names. As good as they are they are never more than a backdrop for Candy. I have no idea how achieves such a strong presence by doing so little, I suppose its like a sportsman at the top of their game - they make it look easy.If anyone hasn't seen it - go and buy it now, lie down on the sofa with some popcorn and a drink - relax and forget the outside world for a while.",Uncle Buck
152,bjkatcher,Does it bother anyone how the family treated Buck?,8,13 December 2017,"Seriously? They expect a man to uproot his life for weeks, quit his job, and raise three kids he barely knows, and yet somehow they view him as irresponsible. How about the parents who can walk away from their jobs for so long? Did they honestly BOTH need to be gone for so long?",Uncle Buck
153,ash-05971,AMAZING. Know why? As it has the best actor,10,11 January 2019,John Candy was the best meme and the best Movie i have seen because IT HAS JOHN CANDY! What would you expect but perfection from him.,Uncle Buck
154,bukketofish,Great performances in an otherwise mediocre movie,6,14 August 2019,"If I had seen this as a teenager when it came out, I'd probably think this was a classic, and for many John Candy fans, I'm sure it is. He delivers a terrific performance, as did his co-stars. But because I'm seeing it for the first time at 52 after having seen thousands of other movies in my life, my bar is set a little higher than when I was young. I expect a little more character development and plausibility, even in a simple comedy like this one. The teenage daughter is way beyond typically rebellious. She's resentful, hurtful, wicked - how did she get that way? What's her problem with U.Buck? What's her problem with her mother? What's the mother's problem with U.Buck, besides him being irresponsible? And you just know the teenager is going to do a full 180 by the end of the movie, but it happens way too easily.I'd like to see what bits ended up on the cutting room floor that may have filled in these and other gaps, because to me the movie simply seems incomplete. But at the end of the day it's just a trifle of a film, and I'm already taking it way too seriously. It's still John Candy doing what he did best, and you'll miss him as much as ever after seeing Uncle Buck.",Uncle Buck
155,sbeyer-1,Family favorite,9,11 October 2006,"Along with Ferris Beuller, Clifford, and few special others, this is one of our family's favorites. It features great quotable lines (""I'm Molly Russell's wart"") and strives to teach some great lessons. Features some interesting music, and McCauley Culkin is actually cute in this one--before the HomeAlone hits. Although the parents come off as the bad guys, and men in general take a hit or two, its fun to watch with the whole family or just over and over and over for the great story and redeeming values. It is just a movie, after all, but one that is enjoyable many times over. If you don't like it after a couple of viewings, then you're not a fun person, and should be forced to watch Clifford. You'll be stunned!",Uncle Buck
156,dmlaspaluto,Classic John Candy,8,15 July 2011,"Really, this is funny from start to finish, and pretty smart too. A great comedy, this is also a fine movie about growing up - for every character in the film. Obviously, the most important is Uncle Buck himself, a man- child long overdue for some responsibility. But his nieces, nephew, sister-in-law, and even ""Bug"" (""What is his last name? Spray?"") are in for some character development. Of course, Candy and his half-hang-dog, half- know-it-all, and half know-nothing (yes, that's too many halves) together carry the film, but the others hit their marks as well -- kids, teens, and adults as well. There are some classic moments - I think about Buck's friend down at the crime lab who can analyze a toothbrush to make sure the kids brushed their teeth every time my kids claim they've brushed their teeth when I know they didn't spend enough time in there. But mostly this is a comedy with an actual plot, and nicely done.",Uncle Buck

158,gdigio2,John Candy,10,25 December 2004,"While we all feel empathetic for the ""big guys"" that pass away before their time I think that sympathetic is more the feeling for John Candy. While I do not know what he did in his personal life, he did not die from a drug overdose. And while it is sad for those guys who passed away from drugs it is more sad that John Candy is remembered with them (Belushi, Farley). Remember, they killed themselves, John Candy didn't. While I think Belushi and Farley are great, there is no comparison to the loveability and talent of John Candy.Now, about the movie, Uncle Buck is my favorite John Candy movie. Others are great. Others not so great. But no matter what, it's hard to change the channel when a rerun of any of his movies, good or bad, is on TV. He is always able to pull a smile from me. A good example of this is that at 4am this morning I woke up, flipped thru the channels and chose to watch Uncle Buck. It's almost 6am and I decided to come to IMDb to talk about it.And like others, I hope that some of his classics are re-released on DVD with outtakes that were never seen before. Those re-releases should be dedicated to his memory rather than the last film he was in. I had never even heard of it until this morning. Whatever it is that they do with his movies to remember him as time goes on , I hope its big. Real big.gdigio2@aol.com",Uncle Buck
159,curtis_gayse69,Good Movie But Could Hvae Been A Lot Better .,7,23 March 2005,This was a very funny movie and John Candy did a good job in it. He was funny but if they had put Chris Farley in it and not John Candy this could have been a lot better as if you have seen Chris in Tommy Boy you would think so to. John was a funny guy but not Farley funny. Chris Farley was the best person for the job and should have been in this movie AND THAT'S IT . Now John had some funny saying in the movie and he is very funny the character always wants to have a good time and like to help people to (Chris would be a lot better has a fat guy who likes to have a good time) But I recommend this movie to all this was John Candy at his best I couldn't think of anyone(Only Chris Farley) else that could have filled Candy's role as much as he did.Go Out And See This Movie.....NOW !! Add Tommy Boy and all of Chris Farley Movies,Uncle Buck
