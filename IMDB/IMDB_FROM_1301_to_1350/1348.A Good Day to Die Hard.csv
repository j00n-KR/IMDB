0,TheLittleSongbird,A really not so good day to die hard,3,4 September 2013,"The best of the series is easily the first Die Hard, which is one of the all-time greats of the action genre too. Die Hard 2 and Die Hard with a Vengeance were also very good films, while the fourth film was okay but on the forgettable side too. A Good Day to Die Hard, even when watching with an open mind, was a huge disappointment and the only film of the series that I consider bad. It is not quite as awful as After Earth and Scary MoVie, but if there was an award for the most disappointing film of 2013 A Good Day to Die Hard would not only be a contender but also win the prize. Two or three things stop it from having no redeeming qualities at all, the best thing is easily the exciting car chase through Moscow(Russia was a really good choice of setting for the film). The locations are nice and the special effects are mostly good. The film is also quite well scored, with a good sense of atmosphere and mood and it's not too monotonous, overall it serves the film very well but a tad forgettable at times. The rest of A Good Day to Die Hard was an absolute mess. The photography is inconsistent, it's good and appropriately gritty in the scenes where there's any signs of a story but it's in the action sequences where it takes on a rather chaotic and rushed nature in a way that is not ideal for those suffering with epilepsy or sensitive eyes. John Moore's direction is lazy and pedestrian with very little degrees of subtlety, a lot of the time it lacks cohesion as well. Bruce Willis has never looked or sounded as tired as he does here, maybe John McClane was meant to be world-weary here but Willis has very little to work with apart from some tired one-liners.He is disadvantaged also by McClane being too much of an almost sidelined sidekick rather than the commanding yet vulnerable lead hero that makes him so iconic in the first place, it just wasn't John McClane and it was really a waste of Willis as well. Jai Courtney is annoying, saddled with a character that doesn't come across as likable in the least bit, and the whole father-son dynamic was very forced. The villain is pretty much a non-entity with an underdeveloped motivation and little if any sense of threat, the worst of the series without a shadow of a doubt. A Good Day to Die Hard suffers the most from being an example of a film with too much action and not enough dialogue or story. Even more of a problem is that neither of them are done particularly well at all. In the action, the only good action sequence is the car chase, the rest are drawn out and nowhere near slick enough with no momentum or excitement, the sense of peril is also very low for stunts as dangerous-looking as these with McClane and Jack often coming out unscathed. They're loud and wannabe-big but that's it, as unsubtle as Moore's direction. The dialogue is rambling and tired, the humour feels very out-of-place and the one-liners are too poorly timed to be properly witty. The story is confusing- even for someone who had no problem understanding films that have often been criticised for this like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy- and emotionally hollow, sagged down even more by too many double crosses to properly keep up with, bad pacing(the first half is rushed and the second half drags) and increasing implausibility. Often too it's too much of an excuse to string along action sequences together, seeing as the action is generally poorly done here that is a problem.All in all, a mess(the only Die Hard film that actually is so) and the worst of the series. 3/10 Bethany Cox",A Good Day to Die Hard
1,bkoganbing,Love these father and son outings,5,18 February 2013,"Bruce Willis makes his fifth appearance as NYPD cop John McClane and in A Good Day To Die Hard and in his previous films makes Dirty Harry Callahan look like a card carrying member of the ACLU. For the first time McClane is on foreign soil, in Moscow to be precise though the film was shot primarily in Budapest standing in for Moscow. He's there to help his son Jai Courtney free a Russian political prisoner played by Sebastian Koch.But Willis is walking into a game he knows nothing about. He doesn't know that Courtney is a CIA man and that Koch is playing a game all his own with the help of daughter Yuliya Snigir. It involves hijacking some weapons grade U-235 uranium from Chernobyl, a good place to store the stuff since few ever visit it now.A Good Day To Die Hard is one non-stop action film from the time some people free Koch from a Moscow courtroom until the climax at Chernobyl where father and son essentially take on the world. Car chases, explosions, impossible situations, what could an action fan ask for more?My idea for the next Die Hard film is to have Dirty Harry come out of retirement and serve as mentor to the McClanes. Not that Clint Eastwood in his 80s will be doing too much in the way of action, but they'll give him some good cryptic dialog while the McClanes carry the action load.Stranger films has Hollywood made.",A Good Day to Die Hard
2,Leofwine_draca,Pitiful attempt at bringing back the series,4,30 June 2013,"While many people slated DIE HARD 4.0, I enjoyed watching it the few times I've seen it since release; I felt like it was a moderately successful way to bring the Bruce Willis-starring franchise slap bang into the 21st century, although of course it wasn't as good as the original trilogy. Inevitably, A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD followed, but the bad news is that it makes the last instalment look like a masterpiece by comparison.This movie really is that bad, and it's all down to the people who made it. Much of the blame can be laid at the door of director John Moore, who makes even more of a mess with this than he did with MAX PAYNE; he can't even do basics like where to place his actors in their shots, and he manages to screw up every action scene in the movie (and believe me, there are a lot of them).Still, it's no surprise that the appalling script was written by one Skip Woods, who also handled the equally rubbishy A-TEAM movie. Woods is without a doubt the worst writer currently working in Hollywood and why people still employ him is anybody's guess.Willis realises he's making a turkey so he makes no effort whatsoever; he sleepwalks through this with a monotonous voice guaranteed to send most moviegoers to sleep. This isn't John McClane, not even the McClane of DIE HARD 4.0; instead it's just some tired old guy who clearly doesn't want to be there. As his son, Jai Courtney is given a one-dimensional character and displays none of the charm he brought to his role as Varro in SPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND.The film meanders from one pointless action scene to the next, and we never get a clear idea of who the bad guys are or what they want; Willis just kind of stumbles into their plans (whatever they are) and goes along with it. The violence is mind-numblingly routine, and despite the explosive special effects the film offers little in the way of entertainment, with an early car chase being the only half-decent part purely for its destructive visuals. The great Sebastian Koch is wasted en route, and the film ends with a CGI-fuelled whimper.I hope to God I never have to see it again.",A Good Day to Die Hard
3,SnoopyStyle,McClane is Jason Bourne in Russia,5,7 January 2014,"John McClane (Bruce Willis) goes to Moscow to help his estranged delinquent son Jack (Jai Courtney) who has been arrested. Then Jack becomes part of a jail break including Komarov, a businessman who may have important evidence against powerful Russian minister Chagarin. It turns out Jack is CIA trying to break Komarov out.At some point in this franchise, John McClane has turned into Jason Bourne. The political intrigue, and the big time spy stuff are just not really the original McClane. Hans Gruber faked being a terrorist ridiculing the FBI for all the silly political prisoner stuff. John McClane used to be just a simple street smart cop, not superman. The franchise has morphed into something else.This movie does start with a wild car chase. At least that's a lot of fun. But it's just doesn't feel like the first movie anymore.",A Good Day to Die Hard
4,Prismark10,Died and gone,4,1 September 2013,"In the mid to late 80s, Bruce Willis was known for the comedy drama, Moonlighting and tried to break into films with light comedy vehicles such as Blind Date.In 1988 he hit pay-dirt with Die Hard, a wise cracking action adventure film with a charismatic villain, smart script and a different type of hero personified by Willis. It was essentially a base under siege story told in a new way.Twenty Five years later and we reach Die Hard 5, but enough about Olympus has Fallen!A Good Day to Die Hard, adds Junior to the proceedings. Jai Courtney who was an effective villain in Jack Reacher but is reduced to being a block of wood here.The story moves to Russia, Junior is now a CIA agent who seems to have got himself entangled with a dissident Russian and it is a good job that dad is at hand.The script is pedestrian, the humour is lame, the action is seen it all before with some over the top scenes where our heroes walk away with just slight injuries.Although the story adds a twist or two here to keep with the Die Hard motif it is not enough. This is average and for a Die Hard film, average is not good enough.",A Good Day to Die Hard
5,nogodnomasters,TRY NOT TO MAKE A BIGGER MESS,6,6 August 2018,"Bruce Willis revives the role of NYC cop John McClane. He is missing his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney). A report shows he is in a Moscow prison. John takes off to Moscow, only to find out his son works for the CIA and is trying to extract Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch) a Russian billionaire with a dossier on a fellow countryman everyone wants.The extraction fails, and John offers his unwanted assistance as a gear jammer, destroying nearly every vehicle that dared the streets of Moscow. At one point the carnage becomes too much, with a drive off an overpass scene that still has me scratching my head only to be topped by later improbable scenes. The humor in the film was hit and miss, with the miss being a cheap shot at Newark. Father and son are forced to work together which leads to the formulaic ending after a few twists.This is not the best film of the franchise. At one point I started singing ""Cat's in the Cradle"" as I realized this is supposed to be a transition film as Bruce Willis passes the baton off to an unconvincing Jai Courtney. Lots of action, if that is what you crave.Parental Guide: f-bomb, no sex or nudity.",A Good Day to Die Hard
6,kosmasp,A good day for better or worse,6,17 August 2013,"A friend of mine said, he didn't think that the fourth Die Hard movie could be undercut. That they would be able to make one worse than that. Now he thinks the fourth one looks like a masterpiece when or after you watch this fifth entry. I do not agree, but I can see why some fans are upset about the direction the franchise has taken. But I still am sucker for John McClane. A great character even when he is on vacation and ruining everyones plans (even the plans of good guys).The movie is pretty predictable, though there is a twist I didn't see coming, maybe I was just enjoying the movie and not paying attention. But I tried to watch it with a free mind and I think I succeeded. While not nearly as good as the first Die Hards, this still can entertain in its own way, if you let it. The action scenes for one are really well made",A Good Day to Die Hard
7,classicsoncall,"""Need a hug?""",6,5 September 2015,"Gee, and I thought Indiana Jones took a lot of bumps on the way to the Crystal Skull! Holy smokes - forget about the action on screen, what did Bruce Willis feel like at the end of shooting each day while he was pushing sixty and doing all those actions scenes? Yeah I know, stunt men, but he still had to hang around the set and get his own licks in.I usually check a handful of reviews before writing my own, but this was the very first time I had to select the 'Loved it' drop down to find a positive for this flick. Honestly, at ten reviews per page I had to scan through ten pages of summary lines to get to number #103 before I found someone who remotely enjoyed this film.Well if not for the clunkers, how would we know how much to appreciate the original film of the series. Other than outrageously over the top action and totally impossible situations our heroes find themselves in, there's not much else to recommend here. It's almost as if John McClane's daughter Lucy was trying to advise director Moore - ""... just try not to make a bigger mess of things"".",A Good Day to Die Hard
8,jboothmillard,A Good Day to Die Hard,3,3 July 2013,"I was curious if there would be another Die Hard sequel to follow Die Hard 4.0, aka Live Free or Die Hard, and I heard the tag-line for this fifth film, ""Yippee-Ki-Yay, Mother Russia"", so it was obviously where the story would be set, and I was willing to give it a go, from director John Moore (Behind Enemy Lines, The Omen, Max Payne). Basically John McClane (Bruce Willis) is travelling to Moscow, Russia because he has heard that his son Jack (Jai Courtney) was arrested for killing someone, he has not spoken to him in years and is not aware that he works as a CIA operative. Jack is working to stop a heist of nuclear weapons, and to do this he has to be in court to help convict former billionaire and government whistle blower Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch), but an explosion disrupts this and they are forced to escape. John is surprised to learn that Jack is a spy, and despite being unwelcome by his son he is willing to help stop the devastation to the country, and interrogating Komarov may help them get to the corrupt Russian official behind the scheme. Of course it turns that is was Komarov that was the real villain trying to use the nuclear weapons, that were hidden in the abandoned site of Chernobyl, Ukraine, but in the end the villains are defeated, John and Jack work out their differences and return to New York together, and reunite with John's daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Also starring Rasha Bukvic as Alik, Cole Hauser as Collins, Yuliya Snigir as Irina, Amaury Nolasco as Murphy, Sergei Kolesnikov as Chagarin and Roman Luknár as Anton. Willis does not pack the same punch he did in the previous film, the man in the wrong place at the wrong time premise is not done well, and the story is very muddled, there were some alright explosions and chases, but not even the famous catchphrase could save this action thriller being a daft sequel. Adequate!",A Good Day to Die Hard
9,Tweekums,John McClane goes to Moscow in a not very 'Die Hard' fifth instalment,7,29 June 2017,"As this episode opens Yuri Komarov is about to go on trial in Moscow. It appears that he has upset the wrong people; most notable Viktor Chagarin, a corrupt official and former friend who wants an incriminating file that Yuri possesses. Around the same time American Jack McClane is arrested and agrees to testify against Komarov. Back in the United States his father, police officer John McClane, hears what has happened to his son so flies out to Moscow. Just as John gets to the court in Moscow a massive explosion rips the building apart. The attackers want Yuri but Jack has helped him away from the scene. He is briefly united with his father and it is clear that they do not have a good relationship. Jack and Yuri drive off in a van, followed by the villains in a heavily armoured vehicle and John in a small truck. After a spectacular chase John and Jack are reunited and we learn that Jack is now a CIA operative hoping to get Yuri and his file out of Russia. There are complications though and before the dust has settled there will be numerous twists and a spectacular confrontation in the remains of Chernobyl.This film has some good points and one real problem. That problem is that it doesn't feel like a 'Die Hard' film; I feel it would have been much better had the character been renamed and the film been released without being connected to the previous films. I guess that would be less profitable though. On the plus side that at least means it can be enjoyed by anybody who has never seen a Die Hard film. The story is decent enough and there are some pretty good twists. There is also a lot of spectacular action from start to finish. The action is ridiculously over the top but, if you can suspend your disbelief it is rather fun. The action includes numerous explosions, a car chase and even an attack from an Mi-24 Hind helicopter! The acting is decent enough but nothing special; this is a film you watch for the action not the acting. Overall I don't think this is as bad as many other reviewers do but it is certainly a bit disappointing for a 'Die Hard' film.",A Good Day to Die Hard
10,ma-cortes,Mediocre and predictable follow-up in which John McClain has to fight some Russian nasties attempting to carry out dirty business,5,27 July 2020,"This ¨A Good Day to Die Hard¨ 2013 by John Moore displays a fine cast with Willis , Jai Courtney , Sebastian Koch , Cole Hauser , Mary Elizabeth Winstead , Aumary Nolasco . In Moscow, Viktor Chagarin, a high-ranking, corrupt, and psychopath Russian official schemes to incriminate previous billionaire and government whistle-blower Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch) by attempting to turn the tables in an imminent rigged trial unless Komarov hands over a secret file believed to contain evidence incriminating Chagarin . Separately, Jack McClane (Jai Courney) , who has been arrested after an assassination attempt, negotiates for a shorter sentence by offering to testify against Komarov. Meanwhile, Jack's father, NYPD Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) , has learned his son is in trouble, and , taken to the airport by his daughter Lucy McClane (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) , flies to Russia to help him . Being orchestrated by Chagarin's henchman , Alik, a twisted caper , occuring at the courthouse and then Jack breaks free with Komarov. Seeing his son , John supports him against attackers , but their fighting is cut short as Alik and his men pursue them in a US Cougar MRAP across the streets of Moscow . John, Jack, and Komarov arrange to getway and confronting sadistic , smoothie and ruthless henchmen . Yippee Ki-Yay Mother Russia . Like father. Like son. Like hell!This following squeaked by on the same formula with John McClane saving the country from ominous and extremely dangerous contenders . At the beggining already happen noisy action when John arrives in Moscow and approaches the courthouse where Komarov is on trial , happening a bomb explosion, going on breathtaking car chases , destruction and chaos . McClane's gone , the famous Hollywood's action man in seeming vulnerable at the same time as being invincible . Thriller with frenetic action and unstoppable developing in fits and starts by the craftsman by John Moore . Gripping , moving action movie with the great Bruce Willis desperately trying to find the means avoid a world catastrophe , as well as save his son . This hi-tech , mindless, interesting and ingenious thriller film is packed with chills , suspense , tension and lots of interminable action . Again John McClane , officer of the NYPD and hero of the Nakatomi Hostage Crisis, attempts to avert a disaster , this time in Moscow , packing adrenalin-inducing action scenes staging the murderous mayhem and state-of-the-art violence . Once again he is in the wrong place at the wrong time , as John McClane and a his young son join forces to take down master terrorist and hoodlums in Russia , but the latter have only one little problem: John McClane (Bruce Willis).This inferior sequel offering slam-bang entertainment also contains loads of thrills , explosions , twists , turns , supercharged action , moving pacing and lots of fun . So-so follow-up that continues in a similar style , humor and action . From start to finish the action-packed is unstopped , overwhelming and spectacular . Nail-biting screenplay that dispenses absurd excitement as well as amusement . Acceptable and big-budgeted thriller full of intrigue and tense , this is a fast-paced, stylized action-suspense film . The tension of this picture keeps snowballing as the clock ticks ever close for a groundbreaking as well as impressive final . As always , Bruce Willis is very fine as hilarious , sarcastic and intrepid retired cop . Yet again humble detective McClane stumbles into a terrorist plot and he must save the day single-handedly . His kind of self-referential irony stopping just short of full-blown saves the movie . There Willis plays a stranged daddy who has not been in touch with his son Jai Courney for several years . Here Willis transformed by his former experiences into a more traditional action Superman , it is left to his son play the two-fisted and tough part . Both of whom giving entertainment and providing good moments and incidental pleasure of watching two disparate roles . Apart from that , there is little originality or wit on offer , just the familiar escalation of car pursuits , crashes , destruction , blowing up and big bangs . They are well accompanied by fine secondary characters . As casting is frankly well , such as : Mary Elizabeth Winstead ,Yulia Snigir, Radivoje Bukvic , Cole Hauser , Amaury Nolasco. Adequate and thrilling musical score accompanying the action by Marco Beltrani. Atmospheric though dark photography by Jonathan Sela ; most of scenes were shot in Russia . Nice camera work , in fact cameraman seems he were born with a camera in one hand and a rocker launcher in the other . This motion picture was lavishly produced, and being professionally directed by John Moore, but it results to be inferior than other entries . However , the filmmaker fails to bring out the necessary tension betweem the terrorist team and the brave John McClain , but more than compensates in timing , utter volume and speed.This¨Die Hard saga¨ is formed by the following ones : the original that was a masterpiece among blockbusters , ¨Die Hard¨ 1988 , by John MacTiernan with Willis , Alan Rickman , Alexander Godunov , Bonnie Bedelia as his wife . ¨Die Hard 2¨1990 by Renny Harlin with Willis , Bedelia , Franco Nero , William Sadler , John Amos . ¨Die Hard with a vengeance¨ 1995 by John MacTiernan with Willis , Samuel L.

11,BA_Harrison,A good day to give up on this franchise.,2,4 March 2017,"I rather stupidly surmised that it would be hard to make a Die Hard movie as disappointing as Live Free or Die Hard, or come up with a worse title, but there goes Hollywood, proving me wrong on both counts. The ridiculously titled A Good Day To Die Hard is easily the worst of the series, taking Bruce Willis's now indestructible cop John McClane and planting him in Moscow where he causes untold mayhem, somehow avoiding any trouble with the authorities as he tries to help his secret agent son Jack (Jai Courtney) defeat evil Russian criminals.As directed by John Moore, who somehow got this gig off the back of some decidedly mediocre movies, A Good Day ah, shoot, let's just call it Die Hard 5 from now onDie Hard 5 delivers everything that is bad about modern action movies, namely a weak plot, a forgettable villain, overblown action scenes that are shot and edited so as to render them impossible to follow, and colour grading intended to add grittiness but which only serves to make everything look incredibly drab. To add insult to injury, Bruce Willis is relegated to sidekick, playing second fiddle to young upstart Courtney, who possesses none of the charisma of his screen dad.Lowlights of Die Hard 5 include a loud, chaotic (i.e. impossible to fathom out what is happening) car chase through Moscow in which a normal cop would have died several times over (McClane just brushes himself down and continues his pursuit), a shootout in a high rise that ends with father and son leaping out of a window to fall several stories but emerge relatively unscathed, and the execrable ending that sees John McClane hanging from a helicopter that is spinning out of control.I'm probably going to regret writing this, but I honestly reckon that they can't make a worse Die Hard movie than this one. Or give it a sillier title.",A Good Day to Die Hard
12,tavm,A Good Day to Die Hard has some good moments,6,24 February 2013,"All right, basically all you need to know about this latest ""Die Hard"" movie is that once again, Bruce Willis plays cop John McClane and he's now in Russia to rescue his grown son who he thinks is in trouble. He's actually a CIA agent sent to take someone out of jail for some files. There's also a very alluring young woman named Irina played by Yuliya Snigir in this movie. Oh, and then there's a ridiculous amount of car crashes that had me just staring in astonishment at how they had the gall to wreck so many vehicles. Still, the story is pretty compelling if one doesn't think too much about it and the length is short enough so on that note, A Good Day to Die Hard is still a pretty entertaining movie.",A Good Day to Die Hard
13,Scarecrow-88,A Good Day to Die Hard,5,10 January 2014,"""I'm not smart. I'm on vacation.""Yeah, I have to admit that I wasn't expecting much out of ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" except what the advertisements promised: explosions, gunfire, a body count, and father/son bonding. Bruce Willis has been making these films for 25 years as cop, John McClane, and I just don't know how much longer he can do it with the action hero role remaining plausible. I enjoy him in these movies, don't get me wrong, but he's now pushing 60. When he lands after dropping several stories into wooden plankboard scaffolds, I have a hard time imaging old John wouldn't fracture bones immediately. Yet, he often, with a little aching and some groaning, picks himself back up, dusts himself off, and tries to find a gun so he can shoot some more scum. I think where this newest Die Hard movie fails is the lack of a really fun sidekick and a strong villain. This series is founded on both in certain instances. There never really is a good actor in the film for Bruce to play off like in past films. Sebastian Koch, late in the film, is supposed to shock us with his ""heel turn"" as the supposed ally of the CIA, with secrets involving a political power figure in Moscow, once a partner involved in Uranium weapons stuff (the Chernobyl disasteryep, that was their fault), but I don't think it will surprise anyone in the audienceKoch reeks of villainy no matter how he attempts to persuade us that he has reformed while in prison (thanks to the partner he supposedly plans to implicate when on trial). Basically John has learned where his estranged son is located, and upon finding him in Moscow, he's dragged into his agent son's (Jai Courtney) job at trying to relocate Koch's Yuri Kamerov while (it seems) gunmen (sent by Yuri's old associate) are after him, resulting in a lot of buildings going KABOOM! The whole film offers a few key action sequences but this time it is all business as usual, with Willis essentially picking up a paycheck and phoning it in. Let's face it: the fourth film exhausted all the remaining juices still worth squeezing from the series. Seeing Willis and Courtney leap through a CGI window shattering into pieces on impact after speedily and hastily gunning through a CGI building taking it hard by a high-tech chopper unloading CGI bullets didn't quite leave me gobsmacked this go-around. The highway SUV chase where John helps his boy out by interfering with gunmen trying to retrieve Kamarov is probably the showstopper, and it's early in the film. The warehouse in Chernobyl at the end where the Uranium is stored and Yuri's true self is revealed could have been a bit more satisfying if it didn't look like it was lifted from a video game on the Xbox. The helicopter propeller used to saw through a bad guy was a nice touch, but nothing new. I pine for the old days when stuntmen were putting it all on the line and their daredevilry was admired, appreciated, and respected for all its awesomeness. But it would take CGI these days to sell us a bill of goods regarding all that John is able to endure and escape during this action film where every hazardous bullet misses him. Stuntmen, granted, were depended upon to step in for the stars, but now the CGI is king and the action film is its peasant. There is plenty of father trying to reach out to his son, getting the obvious rejection, only to find common ground with him among all the gunfire, collateral damage, and dead bodies. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (returned as John's daughter) and Cole Hauser (as Courtney's CIA commander) are wasted. Yuliya Snigir is the somewhat hot chick the advertisements kept showing unzipping her motorcycle catwoman suit as Yuri's corrupt daughtershe's a very bad girl. John, as you would expect, gives us a Yippie-Kai-Yay towards the end. This movie simply is nothing special with a plot that doesn't reach out and grab you. Sadly, the film really isn't even equipped with the comedy gold the other films provided.",A Good Day to Die Hard
14,LeonLouisRicci,Worst Die-Hard is Still Worth a Watch,7,8 August 2013,"This is nothing more than a lot of explosions, gun play, bad Acting, terrible jokes, ridiculous Plot, and probably the most car-crashes in any Movie. Yippie-Ky-Yay. What did you expect from the fifth and the worst of the Die-Hard Franchise? Expecting anything else is foolish.It is Dumb, it is the most anemic of Stories, and it adds a Father-Son reunion that is never believable, or for that matter, interesting. It is downright loud and expensive. There is nothing but the lamest of Character interaction and when things do stop long enough for some Exposition, it is laid out in the most ""so what"" Screen writing that if you think, even the least bit, you are doomed to be disappointed.Forget the Radiation thing, forget any attempt at Realism, forget that there are Countries and Citizens outside the Worldview of this Movie, forget that anything exists except this Comic-Book World of two-dimensions, and well, just forget all you know, and enjoy this Cinematic Drug that is designed to do nothing more than make you forget that when its all over you've got to face that most mind-boggling and unrealistic of places...Reality.",A Good Day to Die Hard
15,CinemaSerf,More McLame than McClane...,6,11 November 2021,"This fifth outing for Bruce Willis in the role of ""McClane"" is maybe just one too many. Finding himself in Moscow he must rescue and work with his ostensibly errant son ""Jack"" (Jai Courtney). It doesn't take any of us long to clock that the younger man is actually working for the CIA, trying to stop some nuclear weapons falling into rogue hands. Willis' charisma has largely deserted him for this rather procedural special effects fest and as with every other role he played, the wooden Courtney is just eye candy is a tight T-shirt. It does feature plenty of shoot 'em ups and once the two figure out that they don't actually hate one another after all, they join forces to destroy just about every building or car they set eye on. It's quite well paced, there are loads of lively explosions - and a quite decent car chase, but for the most part this is just a cheap and cheerful hash of what's gone before that if I were a cynic, I would say had much more to do with marketing the last drops from the franchise than to produce a decent action thriller.",A Good Day to Die Hard
16,zardoz-13,"The Worst ""Die Hard"" Movie Ever!",5,15 February 2013,"Before I saw ""A Good Day to Die Hard,"" I remembered ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" as my least favorite film in the Bruce Willis franchise. Now, ""Max Payne"" director John Moore's ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" has acquired that dubious distinction. This fast-paced, but formulaic, 98-minute actioneer should have taken the straight to video route. Nobody would have missed it. I've seen better Bruce Willis epics go the straight to video route. Although it boasts some sensational, larger-than-life stunts, the fourth ""Die Hard"" sequel is a Spartan saga with little to distinguish from its straight to video competition. The film generates little charisma and lacks a strong villain like previous ""Die Hards."" Indeed, it appears that 20th Century Fox has inserted the Bruce Willis/John McClane hero into a raw-edged, generic thriller with a tense father and son relationship. Unlike the first two ""Die Hard"" movies, the action doesn't occur at Christmas, and McClane isn't confined to one setting as he was in the first two ""Die Hards."" ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is more like ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" and ""Live Free or Die Hard"" since the hero remains at large.""A Good Day to Die Hard"" takes place almost entirely in Moscow. The Russian villains are former political allies who want to kill each other. Chaganin (Sergey Kolesnikov of ""Cold Souls"") is a clean-shaven, high-ranking politician with influence galore. The other is a wealthy bearded dissident, Komarov (Sebastian Koch of ""Unknown""), who bides his time in jail playing chess. Ultimately, one of these villains wants what the villains in ""The Expendables 2"" wanted: weapons grade uranium. As Detective Lieutenant John McClane, Bruce Willis returns in fine form to thwart the evil villains. Sadly, scenarist Skip Woods doesn't give him any clever wisecracks. Consequently, for lack of anything better to utter, Bruce says, ""I'm on vacation,"" at intervals. Ironically, he isn't on vacation. He does utter his personal motto once when he pulls his biggest stunt. He performs feats of derring-do to assist his estranged son. Basically, Bruce is the whole show. The only other actor you may recognize is Cole Hauser. He plays the expendable CIA partner who gets caught in the cross-fire. Everybody else is largely unknown. Jai Courtney resembles Sam Worthington of ""Avatar"" fame, but he radiates little charm.Our indestructible hero, Detective John McClane, is shooting targets on the NYPD firing range when he learns that his son Junior (Jai Courtney of ""Jack Reacher"") has been imprisoned in Russia. What the elder McClane doesn't learn until later is John McClane, Jr., works as a spook for the Central Intelligence Agency. Naturally, McClane flies off for Moscow after an obligatory moment with his daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of ""Live Free or Die Hard""), with whom he remains on good terms. The last time we saw Lucy, she was struggling with the villains in ""Live Free or Die Hard."" Aside from Winstead reprising her role, there is little here to associate with the franchise. When our heroes get a quiet moment to reminisce, they mumble forgettable dialogue. They are better off blasting away at the opposition or dodging both bullets and explosions. McClane still has a thing or two that he can teach his son, but their relationship doesn't advance very far. They lack camaraderie, and Junior is one of those sons who could die and not be missed.Everybody is after the elusive Komarov who claims to have an incriminating file on the wicked Chaganin. You see, Chaganin is campaigning for the position of Defense Minister. Komarov had a deal with the CIA, specifically Agent John McClane, Jr., before everything went chaotic. Chaganin will do anything to dispose of Komarov, and he dispatches a gang of gunsels led by Alik (Rasha Bukvic of ""Taken"") who hates Americans. The younger McClane shoots his way into prison and then during a raid on the courthouse, Komarov and he get together. John confronts them, and Junior puts a pistol in his face. No, he isn't happy to see his father. Meantime, Alik and company are breathing down Junior's neck. A demolition-derby automotive chase ensues with some spectacularly orchestrated car crashes. Junior and Komarov are desperately struggling to elude Alik, while John tags along close behind trying to run interference when he has the chance. As it turns out, Komarov hasn't been entirely honest with Junior about the mysterious file he has on Chaganin. Eventually, we learn that Komarov has a daughter with her own pistol and an attitude. The Komarovs betray our heroes and grab a helicopter. They are bound for the sinister ruins of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant when Komarov has stashed the file.Sadly, the villains in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" aren't memorable. Nobody here is both as deadly and debonair as Alan Rickman was in the original ""Die Hard"" or Jeremy Irons in ""Die Hard with a Vengeance."" After father and son reconcile themselves somewhat, the best they can do is dodge more bullets and hope for the best. At one point, after surviving several close scrapes, McClane scrambles aboard the villains helicopter and commandeers a vehicle stashed inside the chopper. The villains are about to riddle yet another office building with machine gun fire where Junior is hiding. Our stalwart hero cranks up the vehicle inside and drives it out of the cargo bay. This action tilts the helicopter backwards at a precipitous angle so its machine guns miss their intended target. This destruction of the helicopter qualifies as the best of the fireball explosions in ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" ""Swordfish"" scenarist Skip Woods doesn't give us a lot to get attached to in this installment. The surprises aren't very surprising, and the filmmakers struggle to do anything that hasn't been done before, like blowing up the above-mentioned helicopter. No matter when you see it, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" has nothing good about it.",A Good Day to Die Hard
17,grantss,Dull and pointless,3,26 January 2014,"Dull and pointless (other than the producers' point of cashing in on the Die Hard franchise one more time).The first, third and fourth Die Hard movies were decent fun. Not exactly works of art or classics, but they had action scenes and irreverence that keep them going. Plus a semblance of a plot.Die Hard 2 was the odd one out, simply just churning out the same clichés from the first movie, and not doing anything new at all.This, the fifth movie is pretty much the same as #2 (except it's now set in Russia). Flimsiest plot, mindless action scenes. Pointless.As you would expect from an action movie, the acting is nothing to comment on.

No, we swear it is!) to reconnect with his son, Jack(Courtney, who I do hope to see in more and better... he's probably the best thing about this, giving both some drama and a hero we care about), who he hasn't seen for three years - this process is greatly impaired by both seeming like they're playing off a green-screen, not knowing what the other is doing(in spite of both being game - zero chemistry). Oh, and the fact that the younger of them(because, remember, Bruce is no longer young... he and the other 80's icons are contractually obligated to have jokes about their age in these, their attempts to take back the genre 20 years later) is in prison for murder. But mostly the former. And there are some forgettable villains doing something - and we have our generic, big, dumb(remember when this was about consistent tension? At least the set pieces aren't too repetitive, and they're spaced out fine... pacing's not bad) entry. This was always written to be part of the series, as the only of them. Contradictorily, it doesn't feel like it belongs, at all... this is not McClane, he's not our smart-ass, working class everyman hero, lacking faith in authority(why do you think they took it out of America?) and being the only person who can stop a situation(here, if he wasn't there, things would probably go well...). Any aspect that bears a similarity to those of the classic trilogy(yeah, the fourth wasn't... no), living or dead, whilst not purely coincidental, are clearly put in just to be able to attach the words Die and Hard to the title(no, it's not because someone converts to Klingon). Skip Woods did the same with Hit-man - he doesn't appreciate why these trademarks are popular. And yes, he butchered Swordfish and X-Men: Origins Wolverine, as well(not The A-Team, mind you), but there's less similarity between those and this. John Moore brings all of the vacuum of talent that he did to Max Payne, albeit the slow-motion is less grating. While the action can be well-choreographed(and unsurvivable... for good *and* bad guys alike), the poor cinematography(albeit it's not as bad hand-held as I expected... it did not give me a headache, and it's even the Paul Greengrass approach, of every shot done like that, even conversations) and terrible cutting(worst I've seen on a silver screen in living memory) keep you from following it, losing track of where people are in relation to each other(the worst case of this is the car chase, and that's easily the way to suck the excitement out of such a sequence), and the impeccably poor continuity. I'm not a stickler for that, however, here, it keeps breaking the illusion, being almost impossible to ignore on the half a dozen or more instances of it. It reeks of the editor not checking his own work, seeing if one clip works with the next. This lacks memorable characters(using quirk in place of development, or humor - and take a shot whenever our senior lead complains about ""vacation""(or whines how he should have been there as a father... you can't go this sentimental, and not so suddenly)), in fact, our villains are forgotten before they go off the screen. At 92 minutes sans credits, this does go by without being awful(unlike a Michael Bay flick, for example), if also without being remarkable in any positive way. There is a little strong language, bloody violence and brief gore in this, barely earning that R. I recommend this to those looking for something passable, particularly if they don't care or know if it's anything like the exploits in Nakatomi Plaza, Dulles and New York. 4/10",A Good Day to Die Hard

Somewhat underwhelming mash-up of all the other chapters of the DIE HARD series with an ever world- weary John McClane facing the odds against tyranny this time attempting to reunite with his estranged son (Courtney), a CIA agent in over his head in attempting to escort a Russian political prisoner to sanctuary involving weapons of mass destruction (and destruction in the lush svelte form of Snigir).

20,neil-476,Enjoyable but not great,7,15 February 2013,"John McClane, a policeman with a penchant for being in the wrong place at the wrong time and then killing lots of bad people, goes to Russia where his estranged son Jack is about to stand trial for crimes unknown. When the courtroom unexpectedly blows up, McClane finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time again.There is both good and bad in this fifth instalment in the Die Hard series. Setting the story in Russia is a good idea, and the story itself has some twists and turns as well as the dysfunctional family element (which is more or less a repeat of the relationship with daughter Lucy from Die Hard 4 - Mary Elizabeth Winstead cameos as Lucy again here, which pleased me). Some of the action sequences are very well realised (and the film is non-stop action), and there is nothing which rivals the jump-jet/overpass sequence from Die Hard 4 for over-stepping the improbability threshold.On the bad side, Jai Courtney, as estranged son Jack, is unsympathetic throughout most of the film (we never do find out what he's got his knickers in a twist over), there are times during the action sequences when it seems that the characters are blasting out endless automatic weapon fire just for the sake of it, there are times when who is doing what and why are not clear (I'm still not 100% clear on who blew up the courthouse and why), we sometimes lose dialogue beneath a barrage of sound, and Willis doesn't seem as committed as one might wish.I won't pretend I didn't enjoy it, because I did, enormously. However, that doesn't mean that I was blind to its flaws. I felt that it was better than 4, and perhaps even 3, but still has a long way to go to catch up with 1 and 2.",A Good Day to Die Hard
21,ferguson-6,Painful movie that dies hard,4,20 February 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. With only a few exceptions, comparing any sequel to its original is a bit unfair and usually somewhat disappointing. This is especially true with the Die Hard franchise. That initial entry in 1988 is often referred to as the top of the class in the action film genre. It combined stunning action sequences, breath-taking suspense, a world class villain, and a few characters to whom we could relate. Most notably, it introduced us to John McClane, a NYC cop making a trip to California in a last ditch effort to re-connect with his estranged wife and have Christmas with his kids. McClane, as played by Bruce Willis, was a likable guy with a touch of desperation and a terrific stream of wise-cracks. Oh yeah, he also managed to run barefoot through broken glass while outsmarting a team of high-powered terrorists looking to steal millions.Twenty-five years later, McClane (and Willis) is back for the fifth entry in the Die Hard franchise. Unfortunately, he is the only piece that bears any resemblance to the original brilliance. The action is only stunning in its level of absurdity and exaggeration. The first car chase seemingly destroys at least a third of the existing vehicles in Moscow. It does so with film editing that is likely to create nausea and migraines among viewers. Subsequent action scenes include numerous explosions and enough gunfire and violent falls to kill off McClane and his son (Jai Courtney) at least a dozen times. Chernobyl makes for an interesting connection to the past, but falls flat in the end. Speaking of falling, McClane and Junior somehow manage to avoid paralysis or even broken ribs despite numerous falls and jumps that are just plain laughable.The only ""breathtaking"" suspense offered was an obvious twist among characters we can't name with baggage we aren't privy to. The only other significant breath was my exaggerated sighs of frustration. As for the villain, I couldn't remember his name during the movie and we are never let in on the big secret file  only that it contains some bad stuff on important Russian big guys. This particular bad guy chomps on a carrot while performing a goofy little dance  all while threatening to kill McClane and his son. Guess what happens? You're right  McClane doesn't die.Relating to these characters is impossible. McClane has some lame parent-regrets that don't come across as sincere. His son is such a highly trained CIA operative that we aren't sure what to make of him. We know he botched his mission and apparently it was because he stopped to yell at his dad for the ill-timed visit. The Russian that Junior is supposedly rescuing is bland, though he has a lovely daughter  but even she is saddled with truly awful dialogue. The only fun character in the movie is the Russian cabbie played by Pasha Lychnikoff. He sings Sinatra with a smile, even if he actually never drives the cab thanks to the traffic.It's been a rough year for Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Statham and now Bruce Willis. Maybe the action genre has been muted due to the terrific action sequences of the recent Batman and James Bond movies  each of which offer interesting stories to go with endorphins rush action . The first Die Hard had a great story and fun dialogue. Now McClane spends much of the time telling people ""I'm on vacation"". When it's not funny the first time, each successive time is just exasperating. That's not acceptable writing and this isn't acceptable movie directing. Director John Moore is also responsible for The Omen (remake) and Max Payne, while writer Skip Woods gave us Swordfish and The A-Team. There have to be more talented filmmakers who deserve a shot.",A Good Day to Die Hard

To be fair, there were five ""Death Wish"" films with Charles Bronson, and five ""Dirty Harry"" films with Clint Eastwood, so why not five with star Bruce Willis? A great pity that this film is mostly bad, with an uninteresting and confusing plot about John McClane coming to the aid of his CIA agent son Jack(Jai Courtney) in Russia battling various underworld forces. Lots of action scenes that are all sound and fury signifying nothing are of no help, and it looks like a video game passing itself off as a feature film. Sorry John...",A Good Day to Die Hard
24,FlashCallahan,"I'm not smart, I'm on vacation......",6,16 June 2013,"The Extended Cut Review.....John McClane learns that his son Jack is in Russia and was arrested for killing someone. McClane arrives and proceeds to the Russian courthouse where typical stereotype Komarov and Jack going to be tried. When he arrives there's an explosion that levels the courthouse. Jack takes Komarov and they escape, McClane shows up and Jack is not happy to see him. McClane discovers that Jack is a spy and he was suppose to get Komarov because it seems he has evidence against a corrupt Russian official......In my opinion, Die Hard is the greatest film ever made, its the epitome of eighties action, and is a tent pole for most action movies. Now this, fifth in the series, takes everything about McClane you loved and cared about and throws it out of the window, several times.It's as if he has taken a back seat so his son can take over the action reins, and its a big mistake. What made Die Hard so good was that it took a basic premise, Cowboys and Indians, put it in a skyscraper, and piled on the tension.Here as in 4.0, McClane is indestructible, and you know he will rule the day and survive everything that is thrown at him, destroying the fundamental element of Die Hards success, McClane was an average Joe, vulnerable, so etching that action movies lacked back then, a realistic hero.As a standalone action movie, the set pieces are tolerable, and the bad guys are throw away with just another stupid journey to complete. The Chernobyl parts of the film are okay, even though The McClanes are immune to radiation, and the opening car chase is okay, but a little long, think the They Live of car chases.This version, has more head shots, more swearing and no Winstead, which I found frustrating, as I refused to see this at the cinema. Courtney is good, and I'm sure the chemistry could have been good between the leads, but Willis does look genuinely bored.....with the Character that paved his movie career in gold.Even the famous line is ruined by his poor delivery.All in all, its an adequate action movie, that Seagal could have been in, as a sequel to Di Hard, its tragic and a real dud.",A Good Day to Die Hard
25,phd_travel,Over the top but that's what you expect from a Die Hard movie,7,1 August 2013,First of all - Die Hard movies are over the top. So accept that and you'll enjoy it. There are some things I liked - the Russian setting and Moscow scenes - not often we get to see that much of Moscow in a Hollywood film. Also the plot twists are quite unexpected.There has been criticism about how unbelievable and logic defying the action sequences are. But I think that's the whole point of a Die Hard movie. Face it - isn't that what you want to watch in this franchise - Bruce Willis getting through the most impossible mayhem and destruction? I enjoyed the crazy destructive chase through Moscow and the over the top machine gun and helicopter battles.Jai Courtney who plays John McClane's CIA agent son looks like he could be the son of Bruce. The father son bonding was a bit trying at times though. Would have liked to see more of Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). The villains aren't too evil which is okay - liked the pretty Russian actress Yuliya Snigir.Some of the jokes kind of fell flat and it was hard to make out some of the dialog. It wasn't that clever or witty.Overall it's not perfect but for a grand scale action movie it delivers.,A Good Day to Die Hard
26,Wuchakk,"Big, dumb, fun action flick in Russia dies hard to entertain",7,17 June 2018,"RELEASED IN 2013 and directed by John Moore, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is the Third of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. In this one John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Moscow to aid his unruly son, Jack (Jai Courtney), only to discover that Jack is an undercover agent. Father & son team-up to stop a nuclear weapons heist. Sebastian Koch is on hand as a focal point in the heist.The Die Hard flicks fill the bill if you're in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean ""dumb"" in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond ""genuinely good people may be flawed and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil."" Thankfully, this installment throws in some entertaining father/son character development in between the wild action sequences. McClane's daughter also appears for good measure (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).The story isn't quite as engaging as ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (2007), but it was good enough and the action scenes are out of this world, including a long vehicle chase in Moscow in the opening act. Director Moore ups the ante with quick-editing for this one. Some parts are eye-rolling absurd, but everything's done with a quasi-realistic tone, which sorta helps the viewer go along with the ridiculousness rather than tune out.The Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's ""The Gauntlet"" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns."" Thankfully, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" pretty much evades that ditch by giving us entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing one-liners, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story. Speaking of the story, one of the highlights is the infamous Russian location of the final act. Another highlight is hottie raven-haired Yuliya Snigir.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 38 minutes and was shot in Budapest, Hungary, with the Chernobyl scenes done at Old Soviet Air Force Base, Kiskunlacháza, Hungary, along with establishing shots of Moscow.

Thorp is still given credit in the titles of the characters despite the fact that he died in 1999. But Bruce Willis lives on and in the current version he encounters his son (played by the very talented and hunky Jai Courtney) and the action is doubled.John Mclane (Bruce Willis, aging well) has been a New York City and a Los Angeles cop who somehow always has explosions in the air and on the ground in every undertaking. But now, the take-no-prisoners cop, for the first time, finds himself on foreign soil after traveling to Moscow to help his wayward son Jack (Jai Courtney) - unaware that Jack is really a highly- trained CIA operative out to stop a nuclear weapons heist. With the Russian underworld in pursuit, and battling a countdown to war, the two McClanes discover that their opposing methods make them unstoppable heroes.The cast tosses in bit parts by Sebastian Koch and Yuliya Snigir as the father daughter Russians with a secret, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter, Amaury Nolasco, Cole Hauser as the CIA good guys, Rasha Bukvic, Sergei Kolesnikov, Roman Luknár as the Russian bad guys, and particularly funny Pasha D. Lychnikoff as a singing Cabbie.As directed by John Moore with a minimal script by Skip Woods this is a very noisy, megalomaniacal destruction derby of cars absurd and annoying to the max!), fire explosion mess of a film, but then it IS a Die Hard genre piece and the interplay between Willis and Courtney make it fun to observe how close to the tree the apple falls!

28,mm-39,Not much of story for an action movie.,6,18 February 2013,"A Good Day to Die Hard does not have much of a story. In fact, the story is full of holes. How can one buy one conspiracy after another is just too much. The twists remind me of the old Leone Westerns made in the 1960s. The actions scenes are great, and resembles many of today's video games. Over the top monster car style car chases, and chopper attacks are re memorable to watch. The modern day weaponry makes the 80's action movies stunts look lame! The only ingredient missing was the super over the top action movie fight. A Good Day to die Hard is pure escapism. In my opinion I give the story a three and the action scenes an eight. Bruce's latest installment is a six out of ten. Worth watching just once.",A Good Day to Die Hard
29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: A Good Day to Die Hard,7,7 February 2013,"It's been more than two decades, and some things just can't change. Bruce Willis became an action icon when the first Die Hard film burst onto the screen in 1988, giving rise to his John McClane character who was always at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and a trouble magnet. Since then, we've followed his adventures out of the Nakatomi Plaza onto the Washington Dulles airport, before going back to New York City and saving his country in the two follow up films, with good old set action sequences balancing his character's wit and sarcasm, plus that unmistakable Yippie-Ki-Yay cheer.Director John Moore takes over the helm of this Die Hard film, and transports John McClane into an even bigger action adventure outside of his comfort zone of New York City/America, albeit with just a little bit of the fish out of water syndrome. Some would likely point to the fact of Americans poking their noses at other folks' domestic issues, creating a mess and wrecking mass havoc, involving none other than its spy agency and a clueless NYPD cop who's repeatedly telling us he's there on vacation. Yes John, for the umpteenth time, we know! I wonder what had gone into writer Skip Woods' mind when he found it necessary to have John McClane repeatedly try to make a one-liner joke out of his vacation woes, because they fell flat right from the start.So the trouble with the capital T comes courtesy in the form of a Russian political prisoner Komarov (Sebastian Koch), who has a file that the CIA wants, and wants badly enough to spend years on an operation involving John's estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney) to perform an extraction of sorts. But things are never as they seem, and with John's unexpected visit, and getting in the way, it provides father-son some hasty and necessary male-bonding opportunity amidst the mayhem either of them brought to the table. Making things worst is half of Moscow's thugs looking for Komarov, which provides plenty of opportunity for shoot em ups.The story's fairly simple despite some twists involved, but nothing you won't see coming. What this installment does is to perhaps set up further adventures with father-and-son, which in a way worked miles better than the Indiana Jones franchise which tried to so the same thing - introduce a descendant, and possibly having him carry on the series. With the Die HArd films, you know it's about the mayhem one, and now two, McClanes can inflict, from large scaled car chases involving a Unimog (brownie points here, since I've driven one for years), to pitch perfect shots blending CG and practical stunts especially those involving the McClanes' retreat to safer haven, done slow-motion style that's action poetry in motion.But what's more enjoyable in this guilt trip of a franchise that I've followed while growing up, is the little things that flies by unless you're paying close attention, such as little events happening in the background where John puts his street smarts to good use, and those cheeky instances that snuck in unexpectedly. Pay close attention when everything blows up on the screen, and you may call me juvenile, but I chuckle each time John McClane manages to flip the birdie while you're admiring the mass destruction he brings onto screen.Never had I observed a cheeky car produce placement rivalry since The Peacemaker starring George Clooney, and the Pierce Brosnan Bond series that was a tit-for-tat between Mercedes and BMW. It seemed like this rivalry got ignited again with Mercedes vehicles being shown how sturdy they are, while the beemers get blown to smithereens (as seen in the trailer) fairly easily. One can guess which movie will serve as retaliation for BMW.This may prove to be my favourite of the series other than the original, and indeed from his children being pawns in an unscrupulous reporter's ambition in the first Die Hard, it's shows how fast time flies when Jai Courtney plays his son Jack, while Mary Elizabeth Winstead returns in a small supporting role as his daughter Lucy. But alas there's an unfortunate thorn here in Singapore (and everywhere else stuck with the international print) for all John McClane's fans. You'll never hear our hero swear, nor complete his Yippee-Ki-Yays, because for the sake of a lower rating, he got unceremoniously muted. And that's utter disrespect both to the character, and the fans.",A Good Day to Die Hard
30,Mr-Fusion,"Listen, Fox: let's all just relax and stop beating this dead horse.",2,8 April 2014,"""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is the unfortunate end product of brand marketing by a number of people who couldn't care less about the property. They've deviated so far from the roots of this thing that what we're left with is a half-assed doppelgänger tasked with standing in for the real deal. If you change the title and the names of the characters, then this would be a terrible action movie about a burnout father crossing the sea to save his kid. But these aren't Die Hard characters, and it isn't that kind of movie. Where's Holly McClane in all of this? It's a family affair, and the mom's missing. You can't write in a throwaway line, something to allow us give the character a narrative pass? What's with the blue tint? Since when does John McClane play sidekick? Where's the formidable central villain? And why is Bruce Willis still being handed a bag of money to coast on his smirk and unlikable prick persona? The guy looks tired as all hell, and he doesn't give a toss about this. Above all, the reason for the very low rating is that it commits the worst offense a movie like this can: it's boring. If I don't care about these people, then why would I care that they're dropping through scaffolding, panes of glass, and getting beaten up?

31,siderite,The Worse Day for Die Hard,5,23 May 2013,"The first Die Hard was iconic because of three things: a witty hero, a delicious villain and insane damage plus body count. They managed to keep the stakes high for the next two films. The fourth was forgettable (meaning I don't really remember anything other than the implausibility of it). This one is plain bad. The only thing remaining from the winning recipe of the first films is the insane damage. This should have been named ""A Good Day to Blow Things Up"".Really, Bruce's one-liners are moronic, his son is uncharismatic, the villain is uninspired and the crazy Russian bitch completely ineffective. The beginning of the movie is the worst part, with scenes that don't add up and dialogue that seems to have been invented during post production. It picks up a little from there, only to crash at the end in a pathetic finale. The country clichés should also be pretty offensive to anybody in Russia, described like a wild place where there are no laws and corrupt military are running things using combat helicopters and armoured cars in Moscow.Bottom line: If you haven't seen Die Hard 1, watch it.

The original is one of the pinnacles of '80s action cinema, and solidified John McClane as one of the most memorable characters of the genre. Die Hard 2 was a cheeky repeat of the original, fun but lacking substance and originality, and as a result was always the weakest of the series for me - only passable compared to the third and fourth, each successfully breaking free of the 'man trapped in a confined location' premise and trying to do something fresh (the script for DH3 was based off the original screenplay for Lethal Weapon 4, and I thought the cop-buddy-esque dynamic of Willis and Jackson made up for any flaws in the movie; it also gained back a lot of the hard-boiled style of the original thanks to McTiernan returning. And while fans rip on the fourth one because of its PG-13 rating and over-the-top action, I think it's a solid film in its own right, surprisingly well-made and staged, and the action really isn't that much crazier than blowing up a plane with a Zippo or jumping off a building attached to a fire hose -- the stakes simply get raised every decade thanks to advances in technology).Anyway, that long-winded introduction aside, I will say this: ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" feels palpably like an attempt to bring the series back to its roots. The score by Marco Beltrami uses more of the classic Die Hard theme than the fourth film did; it's rated R (albeit a very light R); and even the advertising with Ode to Joy is a reference to the older film, something one of the ads for DH4 attempted in '07 but never really embraced. Unfortunately, everything else is less refreshing. This movie is way worse than DH4. Since John Moore was announced as a director early on, fans were rightfully skeptical; the man is, to be blunt, a complete hack. I enjoyed his work on Behind Enemy Lines, but everything since then has been dross, and he ruined the cinematic potential of Max Payne as a character-and-story-driven film noir and turned it into a dumb shoot-'em-up with a disenfranchised Marky Mark. Anyone holding out hope that he would redeem himself with this film is mistaken. Whether he can be blamed for the frenetic editing is arguable, but he can certainly be faulted for how overall sloppy and mediocre the movie is. The action is often incomprehensibly edited, and the CGI is way worse than anything in the fourth film (which at least managed to look fairly realistic during the over-the-top fighter jet climax). In this film, there's a big showdown at Chernobyl, and the computer effects make it look just like that: something produced by a computer. It is subpar by action film standards, and wholly mind-boggling to see in a Die Hard movie, especially one that otherwise attempts so consciously to revert to the grittier, basic approach of the original trilogy. Any fans who hated Olpyhant's villain in DH4? Well, get ready, because the baddie in this one is by far the worst of the series. He's a sort of clichéd, underwritten Eurovillain whose motivations are so boring: it involves nukes and WWIII, basically, with a financial twist that just apes the original movie. I wasn't particularly fond of Olyphant in the fourth film, but felt like that was kind of the point: he was supposed to be a weakling hiding behind technology, which was the true villain. Here, the guy doesn't really have an excuse. He's just not memorable, and in a Die Hard film, I feel like the strength of the villains make up a lot of the movie's overall quality. Rickman and Irons were in a whole other league.The other thing these movies always fall back on is a sort of buddy chemistry. In the original it was Al Powell, the sequel had the guy in the airport to a certain extent (though probably that had the most solo McClane action - perhaps another reason it was the weakest of the sequels), the third had Zeus and the fourth had a surprisingly enjoyable Justin Long.This one has the guy from Spartacus, Jai Courtney, playing Willis' son. Let's be blunt: he was OK on the show, which I've watched portions of, but utterly lacks charisma here. That may be the fault of Skip Woods' screenplay; I'm not sure, and I feel bad blaming Courtney since he isn't working with much, but this is the second film in a row where he's failed to impress me (the other being Jack Reacher, a far superior film to this).Overall? It pains me to say, this is the weakest of the Die Hard films by quite a long shot. For all the fan-hate the fourth film gets, at least it was trying something fresh for the series; this feels like way more of a cynical cash-grab, a wink-wink ""this is the crap you guys asked for"" approach. Maybe it was made based off the recent success of tongue-in-cheek retro '80s actioners like The Expendables; but in a new year that saw Stallone and Ahnuld bomb at the box office, I have to wonder whether this movie would make any money if it didn't have that brand name slapped on top of it. Remove the Die Hard label and some of the McClaneisms, and this could be another generic Bruce Willis action film. Yippee-ki-yay?",A Good Day to Die Hard

35,KineticSeoul,Michael Bay would be proud,5,22 February 2013,"I found this movie to be slightly more entertaining than ""Die Hard 2"" but when it comes to substance and how everything is put together including the action. It's the worst one in this franchise. This movie has a lot of carnage going for it, and some parts it's like the most chaotic action sequences in the ""Die Hard"" franchise but that just doesn't make a good action movie. In ""Die Hard 4"" it had a bit of a bonding moment with John McClane and his daughter. This time it's about John McClane and his son trying to take down bad guys. And the bonding element is one of the main focus of this movie. But it's just crap and predictable as it can get. The plot is basically going from point A to point B to point C to point D. Which can work but it's like the plot is just there. Like really just there to tie the action sequences together. And there are 3 main action sequences and it's cool with a lot of carnage but nothing really outside the box or amazing. There is literally a long chase scene in the beginning where they drive huge trucks and total close to a thousand vehicles while breaking down streets and buildings. But didn't leave much of a impact and is set up in a way where it becomes forgettable. John McClane is John McClane but he seemed to lack the momentum and flare he had in the previous movies although he wields the largest arsenals of weapons in this franchise so far. Although it can be do to the fact that McClane is getting old but it was kinda disappointing to see how he lacked certain factors that John McClane is known for. So yeah just keep in mind that this movie will be contrived of 3 somewhat cool and yet forgettable action sequences and that is pretty much it. With a script that is pretty much just crap and could have been written by anyone. Plus this is directed by the same guy that directed his previous action movie ""Max Payne""...Yeah.5/10",A Good Day to Die Hard
36,OllieSuave-007,Better than Live Free.,6,30 March 2015,"This is not one of the better Die Hard movies, but it's better than Live Free or Die Hard in my opinion. Here, John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Russia to help his son, Jack (Jai Courtney), who is a CIA operative working undercover to protect a Russian informant and stop a nuclear weapons heist.While the overall plot device is not something we haven't seen before and the movie is pretty predictable, the film does have high momentum, cool visual effects and the action scenes were quite exciting - not overdone like those in Live Free and Die Hard. Willis does his usual sarcastic and dark-humored portrayal of John McClane, which kept the Die Hard trademark alive.I would liked to have seen Willis use a little more of his humor in the movie and for the story to have more originality and plot twists. But, it is a satisfactory movie that kept me entertained during a plane ride.Grade C+",A Good Day to Die Hard
37,Hellmant,'DIE HARD' films are like pizza; even bad 'DIE HARD' is still good!,9,15 February 2013,"'A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Bruce Willis returns to his signature role for the fifth time and this time he's fighting terrorists in Russia! The baddest cop from New Jersey, John McClane, travels to Russia to help his son, who he thinks is in trouble with the law, only to find out that he's a CIA agent fighting terrorists there. Of course John gets caught up in the action. Probably the best explanation for why McClane is in ""the wrong place at the wrong time"" this time and now they have a character to pass down the series to when Willis retires from the role (although he says he wants to do one more film). I don't think the actor who plays his son, Jai Courtney (who was last seen as the bad guy in the Tom Cruise action film 'JACK REACHER'), has what it takes to take over the reins from Willis though. It's been said that film producers want to turn the franchise into something like a James Bond movie series; where McClane keeps getting into different adventures all the time. For that they'd need someone as cool as Wills though (to take over John McClane) and I don't think that's possible. Willis as John McClane is the ultimate 'Everyman action hero', he's the guy that every guy wishes he was, and no one can do it as good as he can. He shines in this film once again, although the series is getting a little tired.The film begins with Jack McClane (Jai Courtney) being arrested in Moscow for killing a man. His father John (Willis) hasn't heard from his son in years so when he learns that he's in trouble in Moscow he decides to take a trip there to help him out. He makes his way to the courthouse where Jack is being tried when terrorists set off several explosives. Jack flees the courthouse with a 'government whistleblower' named Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch), who the terrorists want, when he's confronted by his father. Jack doesn't have time to explain things to his father and threatens to shoot him before taking off with Komarov once again. The terrorists, led by Alik (Radivoje Bukvic), pursue him and John joins in the chase (which is one of the coolest chase scenes ever filmed!). John soon learns that Jack is a CIA agent in an undercover operation and finds himself caught up in the action once again.The movie does just what you expect a John McClane 'DIE HARD' action film to do, it delivers lots and lots of explosions and totally awesome action scenes (R rated action scenes once again). McClane has became less and less the 'Everyman action hero' that he was in the first film and more and more a superhero with each installment of the series. The action scenes keep getting bigger and better but the films keep losing the heart, wit and coolness that made the original film so classic. This film has great action scenes (including the amazing and over the top 'balls to the wall' car chase, that makes the film great just on it's own) and it has Bruce Willis. He's getting older and doesn't have quite as many clever and witty lines to say but he's still awesome. Comparing these films to the Bond films I'd say this is just as good as 'YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE' (which was the fifth Bond film). It's the worst film in the series but it's still a 'DIE HARD' film and 'DIE HARD' films are like pizza; even bad 'DIE HARD' is still good!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5qSQfmiLqM",A Good Day to Die Hard

Turns out, unbeknownst to the elder McClane, Junior (Jai Courtney), who's apparently more of a chip off the old block than dad ever imagined, is actually an undercover agent for the C.I.A., foiling terrorist plots seemingly on a daily basis.Papa McClane isn't there five minutes before he's turned the streets of Moscow into a veritable demolition derby - honestly, Godzilla didn't wreak this kind of havoc on Tokyo even on his worst day - and the movie itself into a smoldering ruin.In the screenplay by Skip Woods, nothing less than the fate of the free world hangs in the balance, while Junior works out his daddy issues amid a hail of bullets and a fusillade of explosions. The quips and wisecracks and ""you weren't there for me when I was growing up"" whining pall early on, and all we're left with in the final analysis is a bunch of scowling Russians and the wholesale destruction of everything animate and inanimate unfortunate enough to wind up in the McClanes' path.I can't imagine that Russia will be renewing either one of their visas anytime soon.",A Good Day to Die Hard
39,thesar-2,John Dies at the End...,2,16 February 2013,"oops, sorry, wrong movie.Actually, the appropriate title to the latest John McClane action film should've been Old Habits Die Hard.I'm not sure how a mere 97 minutes can feel like three hours, but A Good Day to Die Hard certainly accomplished that and very little else.Where should one begin with this mess? Besides making the previously weakest entry, Die Hard 2, look like a masterpiece, this film was so horribly shot, badly written and wasted a bunch of potentially great scenes of cars getting demolished with a cameraman who apparently had to pee – badly – the whole time.I wanted so much to give Bruce Willis credit as some of his lines were actually funny, especially when he's roundabout calling his son a wimp. But he looked so old and out of the game, he even went beyond the ""I'm Getting Too Old For This Sh|t"" played out routine.In the film, that reminded me of the terrible experience I had with Taken 2, the ""story,"" if you can call it one, John McClane wastes his vacation in a foreign land while missing hundreds of opportunities for him to complain about getting lost or not following the ways of Russia. He's there for his son who's about to be indicted for something bad – eh, it's just a really weak setup for John's son to break out a very bad man with information to indict another bad man.With zero disregard of human life and property that the character John McClane showcases in the previous four installments, John follows his son, Jack and people after Jack by means of potential murder on the highway. When all characters are together, they must get bad man's ""the file"" and out of Russia.(Notice how I care so little about these characters to even name them? You'll care even less with villains so plain, dull and forgettable. Hell, they're probably listed that way in the script: ""Bad Man #1 talks to Bad Man #2 on the cellular"")Much like how the extremely enjoyable Halloween: H20 was followed by the dismal Halloween: Resurrection, A Good Day to Die Hard literally spit on the fantastic previous installment: Live Free or Die Hard. And that's sad. You never know when a series will end, and they should've left well-enough alone with part 4.Please do NOT make another one of these films. I promise to forget this ever existed and will even imagine John McClane dying hard of natural causes or a great white attack immediately following Live Free or Die Hard so that this just looks like a bad dream of son, Jack.",A Good Day to Die Hard
40,Robert_duder,"So much to say, so little space...my most anticipated film of the year and how did it fare?",7,17 February 2013,"First of all, I will say that I truly do understand a lot of the flack the film is getting. It is far from perfect and certainly not my favourite Die Hard film. My expectations for these movie were through the roof. I live and breathe 80's action and love Bruce Willis to pieces so I waited anxiously for this latest instalment. I think I can pinpoint exactly where this film falls short of the earlier movies including Live Free or Die Hard which I thought was absolutely stunning and as good as the original in its own way. Some of the negatives (because everyone is talking about them), the sound in the film was often bad. The over exaggerated Russian accents and very loud background noise often made the dialogue almost impossible to hear. I missed several of Willis' McClane quips because of this. Secondly, some of those one liners felt very forced. While some reviewers will tell you that its because they let Willis improv the lines I completely disagree. I think the script tried to plan his improvisations which is why they feel especially forced at times. Thirdly, no clear villain. If there is one thing that Die Hard has always thrived at, it was the brilliant evil terrorist. Alan Rickman, Franco Nero/William Sadler, Jeremy Irons, Timothy Olyphant...and now we have...question mark. I mean yes there is a group of them and they have a leader but he is almost more of a henchmen and when the true villain is revealed its too late of him to be a true adversary. And finally new director to the franchise John Moore was simply the wrong, wrong, wrong choice. He follows in the footsteps of the masterful John McTiernan, Renny Harlin and Len Wiseman...all of whom have extensive action experience. Moore's films have gotten progressively worse and he has yet to have a huge hit really. He tries very, very hard...way too hard...to capture what Die Hard was. Instead of focusing on this instalment he is too busy trying to remind us what Die Hard used to be.Now I've got all the negative out, lets talking about all the good stuff. Bruce Willis comes back swinging and shows us once again what he does best. John McClane is a brilliant action hero no matter how invincible he may seem. He's the one action hero who does not walk out of battle unscathed. He's bloodied and bruised and shows that he's in pain. He easily carries the film and the character still holds that classic cop feel. The scene with him and his son escorting the Russian political prisoner to see his daughter and McClane warns his son that something doesn't feel right...it shows that instinct we've all come to know throughout the series. Jai Courtenay picks up the mantle of playing the legendary hero's son. The two of them have good chemistry, I don't think it was amazing and some of the dialogue between them felt awkward and stumbling but it was okay. He did a good job though and I have a feeling he'll be carrying his own action movie before we know it. Sebastian Koch would have made a great main villain I think. Something about him makes me think that but instead he plays the political prisoner being protected by Jack McClane. Still he does a good job and his character gets better and better throughout the film. Radivoje Bukvic is really good as the psychopathic lead Russian gangster. He is sadly underused but the scenes he does get are quite good. Yuliya Snigir is good as Koch's double crossing daughter. She never really stands out which is unfortunate and I would have rather had Bukvic last longer than she did in the film.The action in the film is perfect. Explosions everywhere, gunfights and helicopters and over the top, balls to the wall action that you would expect from Die Hard. Did it deliver? Heck yes! Did it deliver perfectly? Sadly no. Because of a few mis-steps its looking like this Die Hard might actually end the franchise and that makes me sad the most. It was entertaining, Willis was flawless once again as McClane and his infamous ""Yippee Kay-yay"" was delivered better than the last film. It still wasn't amazing but it was better. I put so much of the blame on this not being better than it was on John Moore. He just tried so hard to force the old Die Hard on us. Even the death of the main terrorist at the end was a carbon copy of Alan Rickman's death in Die Hard but with a bit of a gory twist which was fun and well done but it felt blatant and forced. I still think I enjoyed A Good Day To Die Hard more than Die Hard with A Vengeance. Anyone who loves the series must see this and I may even see it again without my expectations in my lap. It isn't anywhere near as bad as some make it sound, it still feels like Die Hard and that is what matters. 7.5/10",A Good Day to Die Hard
41,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Pretty desperate all round, hacking the classic original films to bits as it goes down",4,15 February 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRiots threaten to erupt in Russia over the imprisonment of Komarov (Sebastian Koch), a man whose incarceration appears to be a political gesture by the serving president. None of this would matter to John McClane (Bruce Willis, as if you didn't know) except his son Jack (Jai Courtney) is over there, jailed on suspicion of murder. Going over there to get to the bottom of things, he sees him sensationally sprung from his trial, along with Komarov (?!?), who's side he appears to be on. They find themselves on the trail of a hidden file that will apparently prove his innocence, but naturally, twists, turns and a whole lot of explosions ensue.Three is generally considered the lucky number in terms of film franchises, making the most of what is ultimately a work of business, while also not stretching the idea artistically beyond it's limits. For many years, the Die Hard series respected this notion, until more than ten years after the last one, it popped it's ugly head up again...After such a long period of time, the fourth film could have been seen as more of a re-booting than a fourth instalment, and maybe even a regeneration. And while generally more trashy and disposable than the first two DH films, it wasn't a bad film in itself, actually better than the third one. But now, twenty five years after the first, revolutionary film, we have part five. Willis has gotten older, and so, too, has the formula along with him. Which means, for all it's grandeur and spectacle, AGDTDH is still a boring and forgettable ride.One alarming aspect from the start is the 12A certificate, which just adds credence to the idea that it was just made to make as big an amount of money from as many movie goers as possible, alienating the hard core series fanatics who've come for the usual helping of unreserved action. That said, it could just be more a sign of the times, because if maybe the action has been toned down a little, the f word is certainly used more than once, giving the feeling of more liberal censors emerging. If the violence isn't as in your face as before, the action/stunts are even more so, with a none stop barrage of the stuff, that, while admirable, never really manages to be breath taking or exciting in any way. It's all just too relentless and in your face, never giving you time to take any of it in before trying to wow you even more. The plot just feels like an apathetic excuse to move things along and, while it does require your attention and contains one or two nice twists and turns, never feels any less hollow. Willis as McClane inevitably shows his age now, and while he tries to keep his wise cracking personality going, at times he does look a little bored by the whole experience. In the end, the same can be said for the audience. **",A Good Day to Die Hard

The action is there, but somehow it just doesn't seem as explosive as what's gone before. Plus there isn't a villain included who's a patch on either Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons.Some people even see it as a cynical exercise by the film-makers to introduce John McClane's son as a future lead for the franchise. If that was their intention, it may have backfired. People - believe it or not - actually want to see Bruce Willis.

Sure, the action is good as always, but the screenplay was muddled and the direction was rushed. While I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, I couldn't help but feel a little letdown when the credits rolled.John Moore's film brings us the return of the wise-cracking John McClane and this time he ventures out to Russia to find and rescue his son, who has been up to very bad business in Russia and now working together, they must avert a nuclear crisis.The acting is pretty good. We all know what to expect from Bruce Willis and we got his typical, sardonic personality as McClane. Jai Courtney did a rather good job as McClane's estranged son. Sebastian Koch was a nice baddie. However, I should mention that the villains are also weakest in the series. But then again, who can compare to Hans Gruber?Overall, I still found this film to be mildly enjoyable despite being the weakest of all five. It's a welcome return for the R-rating, since they botched up McClane's signature line in the last film.

I really hope this won't be the last one in the franchise.And by the way, i have to say, that is impossible to drive from Moskow to Chernobyl in couple of hours, it is around 1000 kilometers between them, but, i guess if you really wan't to save the world, such minor obstacles won't prevent you :).8/10",A Good Day to Die Hard
52,ironhorse_iv,"A bad day to be a Die Hard fan. It was awful, but watchable.",5,26 March 2014,"Honestly, these movies are not Die Hard, anymore!!! It's really not. It's just another stupid action film. Do you want to know why, the first movie was pretty good? It's because John McClane (Bruce Willis) wasn't a superhero who seemed invincible. He wasn't even a good cop in the first movie. He often made mistakes that would deeply haunt him in the rest of the original film; such is the example of him taking off his shoes, and walking through broken glass. Most of the time, the only reason why he survive was due to sheer luck. He seem like an vulnerable average Joe put into an extreme event and had to learn to survive. Another reason why the film work was because it play out in one area, so gave the film, a certain look. The first Die Hard took place in a plaza. The second one took place in an airport. The third was in New York, and the fourth one was everywhere in the US. So logically, Die Hard 5 was going to go international. A Good Day to Die Hard is way too open world. Being the fifth film of the Die Hard film series, it really took out the realism, from the original film and replace it with implausibility action sequences. Directed by John Moore, the main plot finds McClane travelling to Russia to find his estranged son, Jack (Jai Courtney), only to find himself in the crossfire of a terrorist plot to find weapon grade uranium by terrorist Viktor Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov). John McClane has even been stripped to being a side-kick or side character in his own movie, as Jai Courtney takes most the screen time. Jai Courtney is just a terrible lead. He comes across, better as a villain such in the case of 2012's Jack Reacher. The twist in the end, about who really wants the uranium wasn't pull off well. The movie lacks a really good bad guy. About the action scene. The car chase was pretty interesting, but absurd. Two major car crashes, and no signs of vulnerability. The heavy use of slow motion was just borderline bad toward the end was bad. The logic in the end doesn't make anything sense. Let's jump into a pool of radiation water!?! We'll be alright. Whatever, blockbuster logic. I don't even want to talk about the CGI action sequences. The film camera work is pretty bad. I don't like the use of shaky camera as things are so out of focus, blurry or rapid zoom ins. It's distracting. I don't like the choppy editing that director Moore allow in this film to have. Honestly, I really think it's time for Bruce Willis to hang up this character, unless they really do something to make the character, match the age. The film really waste the R-Rating. They don't fully take advantage of the R rating. They could had use more cleaver profanity or brutal kills to spice the movie up. Nothing in the film, seem R. It almost seems like they tried to make this PG-13 at first, but then changed it to R later because fans were complaining about the 4th movie's rating. There is very few clever one liners even if the director was trying to make the film dialogue, a bit comical. They could had play more with John McClane not used to Russia culture, but no, the movie doesn't bother teaching us, the audience, anything new about that culture besides the stereotype all Russians are terrorists. How is there, an American drone flying over the city of Moscow? Offend and alienate other countries like Russia indeed with bad stereotypes of Americans and of themselves. They don't even get the Geography right. Moscow, Russia, to Chernobyl, Ukraine, in what appears to be only a few hours. Without passports is impossible. In reality this would be about a 20 hour drive. Great movie, just great. This might sound strange, but I think the movie lost its audience, by not being set in the US. The reason why is unlike James Bond who is known for International espionage thriller and has a target audience that reach far and wide. John McClane isn't known for that. John McClane is a New York City cop who appeals to Average Joe Americans just doing their job. Die Hard is mostly known by a US audience. By setting the film in Russia, the producers lost their target audience. Another reason why the film fault is it's the same old action clichés. The 'Yippie ki kay' line was said at a horrible time, where a lot of gun fire was happening, and it was very hard to hear. I'm a bit tired of hearing it, anyways. It's a bit repetitive. There has to be a new one that John McClane can say and I'm not talking 'I'm on vacation'. That got tiresome quickly, and sounds like something that Danny Glover would say. The whole thing seem outdated. If anything was good, it was the music. The music score from Marco Beltrami was alright. It did well as incorporating Michael Kamen's original themes into this one. This film almost doesn't resembled anything about the original Die Hard films, but it does play homage to that films, if you take a closer look. Examples are in, how the death of the villains in the film are similar to others Die Hard films. Then there is the scene where John pulling shrapnel out of Jack while bonding with him is similar to how he bonded with another character in the first movie. The film runs at 97 minutes - the shortest in the series. Why the film was released at this length I don't want to know! I guess, they didn't had much of a plot between the action scenes. Don't waste 97 minutes of your life on this movie, unless you're really bored. Overall: mindless entertaining. No more than that.",A Good Day to Die Hard
53,nairtejas,Falling Short Of More Than Something To Die Hard.,6,17 May 2013,"The movie made me cry. Not because of the emotional baggage it carries, but because of the new path the Die Hard series is treading to. Well, the path looks dark & disastrous.Very poor writing, absurd dialogs & even shoddy timing of the humor placements makes it not at all eligible to be a Die Hard installment. The story is hackneyed, plot is short & croony, & characters are so lame with the villain being so non-vindictive, I despise the creators for putting the original makers into disgrace.While the action-packed stunts are enjoyable, the oodles of destruction, weapons, Uranium, Chernobyl & what-not made it look like the use of CGI was more than what Die Hard is actually known for. Music is better than any other part of the movie. I should appreciate Bruce & McClane for doing their bit, but since the foundation is rickety here, the structure collapses so hard, it should hesitate to show its (the makers) face up again. Plus, the relationship virtue is almost a good thing. Jai is below average.The good parts are average direction, mild predictable twists, & sharp/funny take on the Russian-Americans discrimination.BOTTOM LINE: Not the best installment, not doing faith to Die Hard series, watch it for McClane because you are following the franchise. Nothing else or new to offer, it has.MESSAGE: The father-son relationship is divine.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

54,The-Sarkologist,Bourne to Die Hard,1,25 April 2017,"I think I've finally worked out how that came up with the plots for these last couple of Die Hard movies – they just took a generic action flick and simply added John McClane. In fact, why they didn't have John's son as Jason Borne is beyond me, though I suspect that they could have easily turned this into another Bourne movie simply by changing the main characters around. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they were actually flirting with the idea, it is just that the plot, and the massive gunflights, and the fact that like the other movies it just becomes more and more unrealistic, didn't really fit with the idea.The plot is simple – John's son gets locked up in a Russian prison and John thinks that he has been caught up with some nefarious people, so he decides to travel to Russia to attempt to help him out (this is the first movie where John actually leaves the United States, even though the only time he was actually operating within his jurisdiction was in Die Hard III, and even then he was on suspension). It turns out that Jack has become involved with some nefarious people, it just turns out that these nefarious people happen to be the CIA, and not surprisingly he has stumbled into, and ruined, a rather important mission. So, in the style of our other movies, John teams up with Jack, and they go out of their way to set things right, which involves lots of explosions and machine gun fights.However, like number four, this just isn't Die Hard. As one article suggested, the appeal of Die Hard was that John McClane actually stood apart from the action heroes of the day – the Stalones, the Swartzeneggers, and even the Segals. Whereas the typical 80s action hero was some highly trained special forces operative, McClane was basically a cop, but a cop with a sense of duty. Also, he was a cop that happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and he doesn't succeed through any skill of his own, but a sheer determination to make sure that the bad guys don't get away.However, this isn't that Die Hard and this isn't that John McClane. Instead this comes across as something that probably should be starring either James Bond or Jason Bourne. Sure, this movie probably has a lot more action in it, and a lot less fancy devices, but in a sense John McClane did feel quite out of place. The other thing that stood out is that it is getting pretty obvious that McClane is getting old, and it appears that he is even starting to get grey hair. I remember speaking to friends about how you have good movies and fun movies, and they don't necessary end up being one and the same. Well, while I hate to admit it, I am going to have to say that this movie happens to be neither.",A Good Day to Die Hard
55,jacobjohntaylor1,The best Die hard movie,10,12 August 2015,I like all the Die hard movies. And I know it is hard to believe in any movie series that the fifth one is the best one. I know most of you are pretty share that part one most always be the the best. And part five most always be the awful. But this is a great movie. And with most movies series part five is almost always better then the first four. In spite of what most people would say. This has more action then any other Die hard movie. It is very fast past. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. All the Die hard movies are most sees. The Die hard movies are some of the best action movies ever made. I need more lines and I am running out of things to say.,A Good Day to Die Hard
56,Rodrigo_Amaro,Yippie-kay-ay...I'm on vacation!,6,26 May 2013,"25 years ago, action movies were redefined when a lone cop faced terrorists controlling a building in ""Die Hard"". Huge success, and it was followed by three more: in 1990, facing another terrorists on an airport; in 1995, while saving New York, echoing the first episode in style and one plot device and in 2007 saving the United States from a powerful hacker. We heard the rumors of a fifth part several times, but some of us were very skeptic, I mean, the sequel would be in Russia and that didn't look alright for some odd reason. To celebrate those 25 years we love the amazing John McClane, this huge hero which presented Bruce Willis to a mainstream cinema audience after years of success on TV, we have those movies and now...this movie. Ugh the feels... Why? Compared to the others, it's a epic failure that diminishes McClane/Willis greatness and seems focused in giving a new face to the franchise, McClane's estranged son, played by a hunky yet expressionless Jai Courtney. Their mission: to protect an important Russian criminal about to testify on court and also to solve some family matters once and for all.Light years from being part of the franchise, this is more like a sequel to ""The Cold Light of Day"" with some small changes. Deceiving? Totally. It doesn't look like ""Die Hard"", it looks like old version of McClane getting involved in nasty fights and long chases; the plot is so easy and so uncompromising that hurts. But this is less deceiving than what the viewers make this look like. It's not a bad film, has its moments and it's quite good. Purely entertaining. The intelligence, the amazement, the excitement, all the things that makes a great ""Die Hard"" movie is absent here, or so few that doesn't last in the memory. It's always fun to see Willis in action after all these years, see how McClane shifts through the decades and the way he acts while getting a piece of the action. In ""A Good Die to Hard"" he's quite light, exceeding in humor and still knowing how to chase bad guys, fight them and escape from the most incredible situations. Dealing with his son is a bummer but the partnership they form against the criminals is good - but nothing awesome like McClane and Zeus Carver. The most saddening fact about this is that we don't have a megalomaniac and terrifying villain as antagonists like Hans and Simon Gruber, or even Colonel Stewart and Thomas Gabriel, or that chick from the 4th film. The villains are also part of the reason why ""Die Hard"" is hallucinating and cool to watch, and here they're reduced to some hit men with machine guns and one plot twist (best part of this) that is somewhat predictable. But let's face it! Die Hard's can only be directed by John McTiernan (1st and 3rd films), as an R rated movie, two hours of pure adrenaline, some humor and lots of unimaginable action sequels that leaves us breathless and wanting for more. Renny Harlin was OK, but slowed down ""Die Hard 2"" in a way that sometimes it's unbearable to watch it; and Len Wiseman made such a softer ""Die Hard"" that many hate it (there's even a nickname for it, DHINO, I didn't know that until a few days ago) just like they're hating this one. Not his fault, blame it on Fox's for wanting more audience. And now John Moore makes his turn and...not good enough. We can all agree this is the expendable flick from the series, hands down. Damn shame Mr. McTiernan is in jail - if you don't know the story google it or just check his bio in this present site - otherwise he would be directing a great follow up from two of his greatest hits. He has the magic touch for conducting those.To quote the power quote from this episode ""I'm on vacation!"". It sure looks like Hollywood and the writers of this were, indeed, on vacation and decided that the automatic pilot should direct this thing. I know it's not their mission to bring something original or to redefine the action genre as we know it, that would be impossible. However, they should at least try to convince us that we are watching another part of one of the most amazing franchises of all time. Neither that they could make it happen. Watch it like an ordinary film and you'll get something out of this, a few minutes of some mindless entertainment. 6/10",A Good Day to Die Hard
57,Thanos_Alfie,John McClane will never die...,5,25 November 2018,"""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is another movie of the ""Die Hard"" film series in which John McClane travels to Russia to help out his son, Jack, on a mission. When he arrives there and gets involved in the whole situation discovers that his son is a CIA operative working undercover. After that, they both try not only to solve this case but also to survive against underworld forces.Since I have seen all the ""Die Hard"" movies before this one, it's inevitable not to compare it with the previous. So, I have to say that none of all the movies of ""Die Hard"" series can be compared with the first one. As a result, this movie didn't make the difference and wasn't even close to it. The direction which was made by John Moore was interesting in some points and boring in some others. In addition to this, it has to be mentioned that I rated this movie with five stars due to the fact that there were some plot twists which were interesting. I didn't like the interpretation of Jai Courtney who played as Jack McClane because I believe he could do better than that. Despite Jai Courtney's bad interpretation, Bruce Willis who played once more as John McClane was very good, funny and unpredictable as always.To sum up, I have to admit that I am a big fan of the first ""Die Hard"" movie and ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" isn't the best sequel for me. I expected more from this movie and I was disappointed by it. It's an average movie with which if you are a fan of the first movie you won't have a fun and you aren't going to enjoy it. I also believe that even if you aren't a fan of the ""Die Hard"" series and you are simply a fan of Action movies then I am sure that after you watch it you will have this feeling of disappointment since you expected more from it.",A Good Day to Die Hard
58,Dr_Coulardeau,Too rough and pointless,6,19 February 2015,"After the daughter endangered in the previous and fourth installment of Die Hard, now in the fifth installment we get the son, John McLane Jr., who is the partner of his own father as a CIA agent in Moscow. We had to fall, sooner or later, in the anti-Russian cold war atmosphere. I am afraid though Bourne and Taken do that type of action film a little bit better. Here it is too gross, too thick, too much deconstruction and not enough subtlety.The two McLanes find themselves on the same mission but from two different agencies, one CIA and the other NYPD, or is it FBI? They have to recuperate a political prisoner who is going to be tried in Moscow for some unclear reason. We all know Russia is a dictatorship. That type of cliché is slightly too schematic to be believable. But it is a lot worse than that. The two American agencies were completely fooled if not bamboozled. The political prisoner is a personal friend of the president of Russia, follow my eyes and read my lips. But he is using both the Americans and the Russian security services to have the president assassinated and to take over. His daughter is the main in-between triple agent and she succeeds perfectly well. The two McLanes are just following the trend and get completely ridiculed and nearly killed. But they manage to get to the secret abandoned nuclear facility, probably Chernobyl which is not in Russia but in Ukraine, but who cares about the place and name. From Moscow to that place anyway it takes about thirty seconds on the screen, in real time about a couple of hours. Distances are not exactly correct. There they find the dear father who is pretending to be very sick though he has killed with his daughter quite a few of the Russian secret agents. The supposed report hidden in this place does not exist and then the mission is reduced to killing the triple agents, destroying a helicopter, etc. They do this is in a jiffy and they survive all the mayhem with hardly a scratch. They get out of Russia with no problem whatsoever and they arrive in some American airport where the daughter McLane is waiting for them. We just wonder why they bothered to get involved in what was a purely Russian domestic political game. I guess American security agencies are no longer what they used to be.Let's hope there will not be a sequel to that. We have reached the third underground level under well devised action films. Let's say they were part of the anti-Russian campaign for the Olympic Games. Viva la new era Cold War! I am sure Ron L. Hubbard must be turning in his tomb in total clarity.

59,Floated2,Bottom of the franchise,3,7 August 2019,"The Die Hard films have become classic action films and have grown in size over the years. This latest and fifth film of the franchise is seemingly the worst. All the spark and magic of the original two is gone. Do not think as highly of this franchise as many fans but can tell the previous films had an entertainment value, and a good sense of comic relief.However this film (back with an R-rating) is quite dull, bland, generic and confusing at times. Also much complaint about this film is that John McClane (Bruce Willis) role isn't as big, and that his son Jack (Jai Courtney) is really the main focus.Having just finished watching this film, can't remember too much about the film or it's action sequences. All in all, A Good Day to Die Hard is ultimately forgettable.",A Good Day to Die Hard
60,johnnyboyz,"Falls well short of any kind of standard, in what is a series which once stood tall but now seems like all the others.",5,23 December 2016,"I am somewhat confused. It is widely accepted that the first of the now five ""Die Hard"" films is the best one – if not, the most renowned and looked upon as the most inspirational. Indeed, if you were told you could only see one of the rather now bloated franchise, it would most likely be John Mctiernan's 1988 effort which kicked the entire series off. Odd, then, that the last two entries seem to draw more from the third in the series than any other – 1995's ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"", what with its sense of the sprawling and of the madcap; of driving and of charging around with an accomplice to crack-wise as you aim to avoid yet another pile-up. Do not get me wrong, I have the time for ""Vengeance"", but this process of throwing action at the screen and hoping that doing nothing with a lot will compensate for your inability to do a lot with very little, is waning.Indeed, it is unfortunate that ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is as bad as it is – a throwaway film with nothing to really mark it out amongst any other action thriller; a terrifically grey film, cold and metallic and arid in character; a film lacking a villain and any sort of real tension. Then again, perhaps it is something else. Perhaps it is the removing of the film from its Christmas setting of the first two, or that Bruce Willis is a quarter of a century older now. Willis reprises the role of John McLane, a veteran NYPD police officer who is established as a decent shot in his taking down of numerous targets at the range – it seems you are expected to come to the film knowing the rest: the tempestuous relationship with his family; the never-say-die-attitude and the ability to handle himself in a crisis. Time has moved on – he was an analogue watch in a digital age in the fourth outing, powerless to stop his now adult daughter dating, and here now finds himself alone firing off rounds at the range under the watchful eye of a portrait of America's first black President.This entry eventually sees him fly to Moscow, in Russia, where during his visit to meet his son John jr (Jai Courtney), the Central Intelligence Agency breaks out of prison a political prisoner in the mould of an Alexei Navalny or a Mikhail Khodorkovsky named Komarov (Sebastian Koch). In the area at the time for an unrelated reason, and uncovering both that his son was involved and that some especially nasty people want Komarov back, the charge is set for some Die Hard shenanigans as a race against time and for one's life plays out across the Russian capital's road systems and high-rise buildings.Only, that is not what especially happens - in fact, far from it. The film is cold and detached; the opening hour might just as well be any standardised CIA/FSB/breakout espionage thriller, the difference here lying with the fact one of the most celebrated heroes in cinema (at least, according to those many AFI lists) just happens to be in amongst the thick of what is going on. McLane's son begins the film hating his father – are we sure this will still be the case, once they have had their adventure and Junior gets a taste of what his father has had to go through on all these occasions, by the end?It has often been the case that a franchise, when it is loose on ideas but high in box office potential, begins to mix father and son relations into sequels. We know this from Indiana Jones (3 and 4) and one or two of ""The Mummy"" sequels. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is so contrived that one can be forgiven for rolling eyes at it. Admittedly, some of the action sequences are somewhat impressive, with the standout being a long repelling down a tall building, but gone is the sense of danger; of the sense of threat or terror in facing down obstacles with the potential to do you harm.A later twist involving Komarov and the true reason why most of what's happened in the film has played out as it has done has us feel as if we have seen more than we actually have and has the plot feel more layered that it actually is. Meanwhile, director John Moore, he usually of remakes and video-game adaptations, would be better advised to resist invoking imagery of past entries if he wants his own version here to possess any stand-alone credibility. Anybody with any kind of real awareness about contemporary Hollywood cinema is going to seek out to watch ""A Good Day to Day Hard"" – purely from a completest perspective; the film is, essentially, 'critic-proof', but that does not stop it being just about the right side of terrible.",A Good Day to Die Hard

62,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Fith 'Die Hard' goes completely off-track,3,13 June 2013,"Bruce Willis has proved himself to be an ageless wonder. Although the roles he has chosen of late (""RED,"" Old Joe in ""Looper,"" ""The Expendables 2"" and playing the original G.I. Joe in ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"") suggest he's playing the ""aging action star"" card, his box-office draw has been consistent if not downright reliable.So why, exactly, does the fifth ""Die Hard"" movie make him share the screen with John McClane's until-this-point-non-existent son? Did 20th Century Fox think it needed to pass the torch to a younger, blossoming action star in Jai Courtney? The answer is essentially irrelevant, because ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" offers plenty of reason for this to be ""a good time to let this franchise diehard."" I was a fan of 2007's ""Live Free or Die Hard"" despite its obvious shortcomings, but ""Good Day"" neglects the very reasons the franchise has survived to this point. The only thing making it akin to its predecessors is McClane surviving absurd falls and copious gunfire, but as the franchise has shown us before, there's a fine line between exaggeration equaling entertainment and exaggeration undermining a film's credibility.That fine line is simply a matter of how good the rest of the movie is. That's ""Good Day's"" problem. Writer Skip Woods shoulders much of the blame. Honestly, anyone who had a writing credit on ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" should be blacklisted, but what can you do? The plot exists completely independent of the John McClane character, for one, meaning that it could've been a generic action film featuring just about anyone, given a different title, and not caused anyone to bat an eyelash. Admittedly, part of the character's shtick is that he's always in the wrong place at the wrong time, but the script has to practically shoehorn him into the film.John ends up in Russia where his estranged son, Jack (Courtney) has been arrested. He plans to testify against a man named Komarov (Sebastian Koch) for a shorter sentence. Komarov is a political prisoner believed to have valuable information with damning evidence of corruption against a politician named Chagarin. Truth is that Jack is C.I.A. and the U.S. has an interest in protecting Komarov. John, however, distracts his son with his presence and consequently blows Jack's operation. Together they must figure out Plan B.So John's just along for the ride this time and also to get some bonding in with the son he was never there for. The tension and humor that arise from their dynamic prove anywhere from frustrating and pointless to slightly amusing. Overall, it's extremely cliché.Great action scenes can heal all narrative wounds, at least for die-hard action fans of the literal and figurative variety, but for a franchise known for pushing the limits of creative stunts and flying shrapnel, ""Good Day"" offers very little to ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" at, just a lot of John and Jack jumping through glass and falling several stories. The film's grand finale has potential, but director John Moore ruins it with slow-motion (and CGI doesn't help).Moore (""Max Payne,"" ""Flight of the Phoenix"") makes a few shots looks really great and he's generally competent in this film, but the final action sequence involving a McClane helicopter escape leans hard on digital effects and given the film's other failures, proves totally anti-climactic. And yes, that bloodcurdling slow-motion All these criticisms seem irrelevant when you take the time to consider how this fifth ""Die Hard"" movie does nothing for the John McClane character. I think an ""old John McClane"" movie, a satisfying final chapter, could exist and reconcile aging and badassery, but this film was downright afraid of the subject. I've never been less excited to hear ""Yippee Kay-yay"" come out of Bruce Willis' mouth. He's just an accessory in this movie and it's almost upsetting. Sure, he proves to Jack that sometimes Daddy knows best, but the humanity of John McClane, the first action hero to get beaten and bloody and do it the hard way, he's nowhere to be found. In a franchise this long-running, that's not acceptable.~Steven C Thanks so much for reading. You can find more at moviemusereviews.com",A Good Day to Die Hard

Great jokes and terrific actor's chemistry made the original Die Hard (1989) so incredibly enjoyable to watch, again and again.By the way, if for some unknown reason you havent yet seen that all time action classic Die Hard (1989), you will be in for a real treat when you do see it!

64,Vartiainen,"Weakest of the Die Hard films, but still a somewhat decent action flick",5,16 May 2013,"Let's start this by summarizing my feelings exiting the movie theater: Meh.I mean, it's not a bad film, per se. It has Bruce Willis in it! And he's still good... kind of. The actor himself is fine, but what bothers me is the fact that the character of John McClane hasn't evolved at all between films four and five. When you look at it, the first film introduced the character, the second hinted at the dark spiral he was about to enter, the third showed him near the end of that descent, the fourth showed the aftermath and hinted at a chance of recovery. But in the fifth he's pretty much how he was in the fourth. No progress, no character development and the core character seems kind of tired and lackluster. Even the traditional Yippie-kye-yay is delivered almost as an afterthought.The rest of the characters aren't any better. Jai Courtney as Jack McClane is serviceable, but I much preferred Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy McClane in the fourth film. That character had surprises, twists and nuances. You never knew just what she was capable of in the end. With Jack McClane what you see is pretty much what you get. And don't let me get started about the villains. Completely forgettable with some clichéd twists and expectable turnarounds.Still, I don't regret seeing this film. Most of its problems stem from poor and unimaginative writing, but the acting performances were actually enjoyable to watch and the action, while nothing revolutionary, was a lot of fun. The Russian setting wasn't fully realized, I think, but there were some sweet locations that blew up satisfyingly and the urban maze was utilized convincingly. Plus the early car chase is one of the better ones in recent memory.And that leads me to my final thoughts. If you're a fan of John McClane and the Die Hard franchise in general, I would say that you're not going to regret seeing this film.

The mission starts to go unexpectedly, but John helps Jack finish the job doing what they do best. Winstead appears briefly as John's daughter, Lucy.

The rest has big shortcomings,6,15 May 2013,"The US-Russia axis should have been remained in the 1990ies movies at the latest, and a nuclear-related topic has been more a token of B-stars like Dudikoff, Seagal and Lundgren, with scripts lacking credibility and smoothness. In the movie in question, chases and explosions are catchy to follow (thanks to digital technology), but as their outcomes are so evidently improbable and without visible influence on those involved, all this starts to annoy very soon (luckily the movie is 1,5 hours only). The ending is also trivial and the fact that Bruce Willis's character is only a strong supporting actor, does not enhance the value of the movie - Jai Courtney as John ""Jack"" McClane, Jr. is not catchy, and the ""bad guys"" are not elaborated as well; no real confrontation takes place. Moreover, the Russian language heard is mostly with horrible accent, as Russian actors were partly used only. Instead of sweet champagne, we obtained salty mineral water...

68,freemantle_uk,An action film of any other name still wouldn't be sweet,4,1 January 2014,"The Die Hard is a series with a devoted fan base and seen as a staple of the action genre. It was the series that made Bruce Willis into a star and A Good Day to Die Hard was highly anticipated despite the dubious quality of the men behind the camera. A Good Day to Die Hard is easily the worst film in the series.In Russia a political prisoner, Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch) is able to go to trial as a part of a power play by a high-ranking Russian government minister Viktor Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov). At the same time Jack McClane (Jai Courtney) assassins a man in a Moscow nightclub, claiming to be hired by Komarov. John McClare (Bruce Willis) goes to Russia to get his disowned son out of prison. But when the courtroom is attacked John is called into action once again, but ends up disrupting a CIA operation and John, Jack and Yuri are left to fend for themselves in Moscow.On the IMDb trivia page it states that A Good Day to Die Hard was the only film in the series where the screenplay was originally designed as a Die Hard film: but it also the film that feels the least like a Die Hard film. The men behind this film are John Moore, a director whose credits are at best mediocre and writer Skip Woods, Fox's hack for hire and cursed the world with X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Hit-man. They lack of talent is on display giving us a half-baked spy-actioneer that just happens to have John McClare in it.A Good Day to Die Hard is a ugly looking film, having some of the worst cinematography I have seen in a mainstream action film. The film has a horrible grey murky look to it that is unappealing to the eye and made worst with shaky cam, zooms and hand-held approach that made it look like John Moore was trying to make the Bourne Supremacy and failing. This was particularly the case with the car chase in downtown Moscow.The spy and political story lines are pap that we have seen before. It is generic as we see a world of political corruption in Russia and leading to a secret sell of weapons grade uranium. It is not a Die Hard plot nor a logical evolution since John McClare is a New York police detective, not a soldier, a spy or a diplomat. He should be handling an American centric adventure.A Good Day to Die Hard also features the worst villain the series, a carrot munching terrorist who became a terrorist after failing as a tap dancer. Despite that silly backstory he is a very bland and unmemorable character: he is far the likes of The Joker and Raoul Silva.Bruce Willis is simply slumming it as John McClare: this is clearly a film where he was taking the money and run. He did not seem to care, he did not have the wit or the wisecracks that makes the character special. Courtney does look the character but he was a really bland, stiff actor who had no character and felt like a poor attempt to replace McClare Sr..One of the big selling points of A Good Day to Die Hard is that it had an R-rated. This film does supply some cool hard scores and a few f-bombs, but for the most part it was pretty standard stuff on screen and it could be easy enough to edit it to be a PG-13.A Good Day to Die Hard is at best a poor action film that would have gone unnoticed if it hadn't had the Die Hard label next to it. It is a film filled with holes, from the characters being able to drive to Chernobyl within a few hours and ignoring that the site is another country, that characters are walking around Chernobyl without radiation suits and John McClare keeps yelling he is on vacation, despite the fact he is in Russia to get his son out of prison.A Good Day to Die Hard is a film of relentless action scenes, thinking that is enough to replace a good story, characters and logic.",A Good Day to Die Hard
69,estebangonzalez10,To say this is the worst film of the franchise is an understatement,4,26 February 2013,"¨The things we do for our kids! Yippee Ki-Yay¨This is the fifth film in the Die Hard franchise which began way back in 1988 when Bruce Willis still had some hair. That movie helped Willis become an action star and raised the bar for all action movies since. It also received four Oscar nominations. None of the sequels have been able to match that same quality, but at least they had a decent storyline and were overall pretty decent films. A Good Day to Die Hard on the other hand not only does it not live up to the franchise expectations, it kills it once and for all thanks to a terrible script and some senseless action scenes. This film is all noise, but no content. It is the shortest and by far the worse film of the franchise making the 2007 sequel look like a masterpiece next to this one. A lot of things went wrong with this film; first of all it was directed by John Moore (Max Payne, The Omen) who in my opinion hasn't directed a good movie in his entire career. Second, the script written by Skip Woods is absolutely terrible with no story whatsoever or any character development. Woods didn't repeat the success he had with the A-Team film which I found to be pretty funny and entertaining. Third and perhaps the most fatal mistake they took John McClane out of the United States and took him to Russia which is too bad because in the original film New York was more like a character than a simple location. I am just so glad that Nicolas Winding Refn decided not to direct this terrible story. He's a smart man. So far the 2013 releases have been pretty weak and A Good Day to Die Hard wasn't the exception.For the first time we get to follow our hero, John McClane (Bruce Willis) to a foreign territory as he decides to travel to Russia on vacations in search of his troubled son, Jack (Jai Courtney) with whom he hasn't been in contact with in over three years. Jack happens to be on trial for murder, but what his father doesn't know is that he is working as an undercover agent for the CIA. Jack is on a mission to prevent a nuclear weapon heist and he is actually on trial to try to free Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch), a political prisoner who claims to have important incriminating evidence in a secret hidden file on a high ranked Russian official named Viktor Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov). Jack is trying to free Yuri before the corrupt officials get to Yuri and eliminate him in order to get his hands on the file and prevent a nuclear war. This is when John arrives in Russia and while he is getting to the courthouse to find his son he gets caught in the middle of a gigantic explosion that is being led by Chagarin and his men to try to intercept Yuri before he testifies. Jack manages to rescue Yuri and they escape from the courthouse, but are being followed. John catches up with them while they are being pursued and his son Jack is not too pleased to see him. His father seems to have interfered with his plan to rescue Yuri and the rest of the CIA officials have to cancel the extraction. Now they are forced to work together in order to get Yuri to safety and find the file before Chagarin and his men do.Like in all other Die Hard films we have plenty of helicopter explosions and a lot of action, but we lack a true story. There is very little dialog in this film and hardly any transition time from one action scene to another. That is why this film is so short, there is no room for character development and the producers don't want us to think too much about the plot. Everything feels so rushed and in my opinion John Moore has completely killed this franchise through this uninspired script that they decided to work with. The film is very disappointing, loud, and full of boring vehicle chases and explosions. Not even Bruce Willis has enough charisma this time to save the film. Unlike in his earlier films where his character, John McClane was a mere mortal who bled and got beat up, here they make him look like a superhero who can't be touched. There is no fun in his character being an immortal, because what we liked about him in the first place was his vulnerability and the courage he had to face danger despite getting hurt. His character lacks personality just like this film does which has been reduced to a bunch of noise and senseless twists. Skip this movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",A Good Day to Die Hard
70,pixrox1,A Good Day to Fry Lard,5,21 February 2013,"This movie makes just as much sense as my summary. The John McClane from the first 21 DIE HARD movies would not go three or five minutes--let alone years--without knowing his son was in the CIA! He would not let his son's family jewels be dragged from one side of the Chernobyl super-fund clean-up site to the other and back again without a second thought. He would not mastermind a wrong-way car chase against a juggernaut to wreak more havoc on a major world capital than a medium-sized tactical nuclear weapon would. He would know that you do not jump out of high-rise windows willy-nilly, since sooner or later you get cut. He would not rub elbows all day with the most dangerous terrorist in the world thinking the fellow was just some Joe Schmoe having a bad day. He would not leap off a 20-story building assuming there was going to be enough miscellaneous bric-a-brac to break his fall. He would be able to come up with a more memorable tag-line for his adventure than a lame ""I'm supposed to be on vacation"" (which isn't true in any sense; he's only bothered to half-learn one sentence of mispronounced Russian).

Easily the worst from the series and basically uninspired or maybe just inspired to make money on a series that has seen its day. Yes John McClane is back (although he too is uninspired) travelling to Russia to find his estranged son Jack only to discover that he's actually an undercover agent working to protect an informant and expose his wrongdoings in Chernobyl.The script is clichéd and honestly sort of irrelevant as this just becomes an action movie for the sake of action with lots of big car chases, explosive stunts, carnage and things blowing up. Honestly after a while even that aspect wasn't very interesting. Sure they try to balance the father/son dynamic within all the downed helicopters and bullet spray but, just no.I did enjoy Jai Courtney as John's son Jack -he does a decent enough job although it was strange to see Willis demoted to a sort of sidekick role, like he was in the way. I also got tired of their constant arguing or John yelling his sons name to come back as he's in the middle of a high speed chase or going about his spy business it was silly and boring.All in this just felt tired from beginning to end. 12/6/15",A Good Day to Die Hard

77,kluseba,Maybe the best comedy movie of the year,6,29 March 2013,"This film is by far the best comedy movie of the year so far. It includes completely ridiculous and exaggerated action scenes that can last for overlong ten minutes or more and involved hundreds of cars destroyed in a city centre by only a few guys. It includes stunning passages where one can find car keys out of nowhere with massive weapons hidden inside a car in front of a Chechen bar in the middle of Moscow. It includes parts where Moscow and Chernobyl seem to be in the same country and only a few hours situated from each other so you can easily go there by car. It's possible to enter a completely devastated nuclear plant without any protective suits. It happens that you stroll around this highly radioactive area without getting any harms. If accidents and explosions happen in this area, no visible consequences occur. Add dry one-liner dialogues to this, a twisted father-son relationship and other funny sequences such as an annoying singing taxi cab driver.Seriously, this must be the movie with some of the highest number of film errors and ridiculously embarrassing dialogues I have ever seen. That's why one simply can't take this film serious. You have to take this as an over the top action comedy flick that never fails to make you laugh out loud. If you simply want to have entertaining fun and change your mind, this film is for you. If you want to laugh about closed minded American stereotypes and get another example for the downfall of the Western world, this one is also for you. This one is to switch your brains off and head for a fun ride.If you are looking for some tension filled moments, a clever story line or something more than the usual stereotypes of evil old Russian terrorists as you have them in any classic American propaganda movie of the eighties, this movie is not for you. The entertainment and comedy factor is worth ten points. The story itself not more than one or two points which leads to a final result of six points out of ten. Go for this movie without associating it to the previous Die Hard movies to avoid deception and take this as some sort of action comedy movie with a script that could have been written by a bunch of ten year old boys.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Now yes, the film did have some clichés that went along with the plot, and some predictability, but I didn't really mind. The movie was still very entertaining, and I didn't think it was too gory or violent, meaning it would be suitable for a teenage audience.

79,3xHCCH,Fails to Reach the Standards of its Illustrious Predecessors,5,14 February 2013,"This turned out to be quite a disappointing Valentine's date movie for us today. My wife and I are fans of this great action movie franchise from its first to the last installments. However in my opinion, this one fails to make the standard set by its predecessors. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" brings Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) from New York City to the mean streets of Moscow. He went there to locate and bring home his supposedly delinquent son, John Jr. However, he was in for a big surprise as his son was actually in Moscow as a CIA agent involved in a complicated case about the Chernobyl and nuclear weapons. The estranged father and son reconnect with each other while battling the Russian bad guys.I know, that story summary sounded corny and it is. Like in previous Die Hard films, I was ready to accept the superhuman abilities of the McClanes in the action scenes. However the plot of this one was too weak and riddled with holes. The climax made me scratch my head and wonder how that could happen because of its illogical development. The action scenes were really out of this world in this one. In the first sequence alone, you cannot count the number of cars that were destroyed as the McClanes and the bad guys wildly rampage through Moscow's heavy traffic. The Mercedes-Benz logo is front and center in many of these car chase scenes. Talk about product placement! There is also one awesome explosive helicopter scene to cap it all off at the end.Bruce Willis even looks more grizzly than his 57 years, but to his credit, he is as effective an action star as before. He did look a little like he was phoning in the non-action scenes. His usually sharp wit was wanting here as he mouthed his repetitive lines about being on vacation and not getting any respect. The main problem here is the lack of any chemistry between Willis and the actor who played his son, Jai Courtney. This new actor did not have the charisma of Samuel L. Jackson in the third movie, and Justin Long in the fourth.Sure it was explosive and noisy as the other Die Hard films, but it shows that the story in which these explosions and noise happens still matters. The first Die Hard film all happened within the confines of a single building, yet the action in that one was all the more exciting and riveting than the huge action stunts in this one. This is just OK for me, even a tad on the boring side.",A Good Day to Die Hard

So McClane flies to Moscow and goes to the courthouse just as the son and Komarov are set to be tried. Suddenly cars in front of the courthouse explode, Jack takes Komarov and escape when they run into John, who wastes their precious time. Jack is CIA and Komarov was his mission. But due to the time wasted, a US drone can't complete its task and now Jack has to take the Russian to a safe house with the bad guys in hot pursuit in an armored vehicle, while John is after them too.All three make it to the safe house which is then attacked. The Americans want a drive from the Russian that has incriminating information on the politician. Next plan is to leave Russia, but the Komarov won't unless his daughter comes with him. They set to meet. She arrives and so do the bad guys. Turns out the gorgeous daughter is working with them. So dad and daughter and the bad guys leave.Now Jack and John get some weapons and go after them to Chernobyl and we get some more twists in the story and some more action.Despite what sounds like a good story, A Good Day to Die Hard, is a dismal movie. The story is indeed good, and so is the action. But the acting is awful. The dialogue is something that could have been written by an uninspired 12 year old.What this movie has going for it is the stunning Yuliya Snigir. The movie takes place in Russia and there are some good views of the city. There's lots of cool destruction, mostly of cars in streets. But what should be an exciting story isn't filmed in an exciting way at all. Willis, never a particularly good actor, gives a lousy performance. They could have done a buddy father/son movie, but instead give us a lot bickering and whining, which in spite of what Hollywood thinks, is never entertaining. So you've got poor writing, poor direction, and poor acting, which off course aren't usually key in an action flick, but Die Hard sequels deserve better.",A Good Day to Die Hard

As he and his son had not spoken in years and it provides no back story on how and why they were estranged.Both are forced to work together in Russia.

As they also are forced to bond as both have their differences but share their love of adventure and capturing the bad guy.Jai Courtney an Australian who plays the second main character of the son is handsome but did not have time to develop. As it would be something to pass the Die Hard franchise to the son if the producers and 20th Century Fox will do so in the near future.Cole Hauser was only given three minutes of screen time as Courtney's CIA partner.

82,Spondonman,Avoid this Void,6,15 June 2013,"I wasn't disappointed: I expected a rotten film and it was – about as exciting and attractive as spent uranium. The opener is a non-stop cartoon car chase with occasional Russian and English grunting from awful people with our ancient hero John McClane threatened at gunpoint by his lovable son. It seems Bruce Willis is forever jetlagged nowadays.After the mayhem has paused the story(!) takes over; basically John's in Russia for something else but gets accidentally sucked into his CIA son's mission in looking after an enigmatic Russian defector with a charming daughter. The endless incomprehensible grunting and growling by all of the goodies and baddies, the jerky camera technique, and the clueless plotting did not help this old guy; maybe analogue swearing and pre-cartoon gratuitous violence was more my bag after all. This film promised nothing and delivered. I read it cost about USD 100 million to produce this nonsense - if it kept people in jobs well alright, but I still think it's sneaky to entrap millions of people who feel they must see this just because they've seen the previous 4 Die Hard's. Otoh it's slick and little kids'll love it, especially the gore.It didn't cost me any money to see it and I got nothing in return.

84,davidmvining,Boring,3,2 June 2020,"I'm not one to demand that films in a franchise adhere to the conventions and formula of those that preceded it, so the fifth entry in the Die Hard franchise doing stuff like going to Russia and essentially becoming a spy action thriller don't bother me. What bothers me is that the trip to Russia is thinly drawn and ends up making little to no sense and the spy action thriller stuff isn't exactly good.There's an exchange in Live Free or Die Hard where John McClane and Matthew Farrell are driving to West Virginia where McClane describes why he's going through such a big effort to help: ""I do this because there is nobody else to do it right now. Believe me if there was somebody else to do it, I would let them do it. There's not, so I'm doing it."" As a contrast, here's what John's son Jack describes John as in A Good Day to Die Hard: ""F***ing killing bad guys, that's your thing."" In one movie, the franchise decided that John McClane wasn't an everyman who just happens to get into over his head situations, he's just someone who kills bad guys. He's a generic action hero. He could be literally any other action hero since there's nothing distinctive about him anymore.One of the ironies of A Good Day to Die Hard is that John McClane is probably the best part of the film (despite Bruce Willis's bored performance) and that the movie would have probably been improved by having less John McClane. The source of that irony is the fact that this isn't John's movie, it's his son's. Jack McClane is a secret agent in Russia out to protect a Russian in jail and on a hit list in order to find a file that has incriminating information on a prominent Russian politician. And, John just walks into the rescue attempt, screwing everything up and then tagging along for the rest of the adventure.And the rest of that adventure is a bad Bourne knockoff. It feels like an attempt to extend the Die Hard series by introducing a new male action lead in the form of Jai Courtney as Jack, but the extension is literally just a bad Bourne knockoff. Shaky-cam car chases, European setting, even the Russian politician angle is all ripped straight from The Bourne Supremacy in particular. What makes it all worse is that this is another film in the franchise (after Die Hard 2) that's so purely driven by plot needs that the several reversals of minor characters that turn the plot all fall flat because we spend literally no time getting to know the doctor Jack is rescuing or his daughter. So, when someone betrays someone else, it's met with more confusion than shock. When it happens again, there's little more than a shrug and a sigh and a hope that the movie is almost over.The action ranges from competent to incomprehensible without any consistent aesthetic. The early handheld filmed car chases end up giving way to elaborate slow motion shots with heavy special effects. The plot resolution feels dead. The interactions between father and son feel thin. Ironically, this was the only film in the franchise explicitly written as a Die Hard movie with John McClane at its center, and it's also the one that feels like it shouldn't be a Die Hard movie at all (tying the wannabe Airport that is Die Hard 2).I didn't hate this movie. I mostly found it boring and unengaging. It was simply too inept to get all worked up about.",A Good Day to Die Hard
85,p-stepien,Harder They Come...,3,26 May 2013,"Nearing retirement age John McClane (the eternal Bruce Willis) would like nothing more than to take a break and catch up with his estranged children. When his only son Jack (Jai Courtney) gets apprehended during an attempted assassination of Russian politician Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov), John decides to pry his nose into another bloody mess, this time in Moscow. Meanwhile Jack promises to testify against a political prisoner Komarov (Sebastian Koch), incarcerated for selling weapon grades plutonium, apparently in cooperation with the fast rising Chagarin. During a court attack Jack escapes with Komarov, only to bump into his bumbling father. Due to John's untimely entrance what was to be an undercover operation by special ops Jack, descends into utter mayhem...Impossible to overlook are the obvious script flaws, which have covert spy operations function as bombastic, broad-daylight rescue attempts, militarised groups of men roaming freely with army helicopters and armoured vehicles on the streets of supposedly lawless Moscow or grand schemes so complex that they are doomed to fail (the best plans are always the simplest ones). Logical loopholes or drastic scrip-writing ignorance (such as part of the action taking place in Chernobyl, as if the ill-famed power plant was still part of Russia - no border crossing or even mention of such an occurrence) are similarly abundant. Nonetheless ""Die Hard"" follow-ups have never taken a strong liking to the simplistic initial small-scale gritty approach, each step of McClane's journey increasing in scope and significance.Here the series explores the slightly absurd premise of McClane basically saving Russia and the world from illegal dissemination of atomic weapons, escalating McClane into international James Bond level significance, a far cry away from his street creds. Unfortunately with much detriment to the character and the overall coherence of the action packed backdrop of previous outings.The biggest issue however remains with Bruce Willis and John McClane himself, here coming across as so disinterested and tired by the ongoing pandemonium, that the only lines ringing true are the incessant one-liners about being on holiday. Seemingly bored, almost forced to do the script ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is by far Bruce Willis's least charismatic performances to date, managing to achieve the unimaginable - changing John McClane into a drab, dreary shell of his former charming brash self. The overall laziness behind the making of this movie never is more evident than when McClane is afforded absolutely no good lines to somehow at least give boost to his famed sarcastic side. With too much attention diverted instead towards the tiresome and forgettable Jai Courtney even one-liners, dialogues or bickering hit an all-time Willis low. Jet-lagged, tired or simply not impressed Bruce Willis passed on truly playing in this movie, ergo viewers best pass on viewing it. The three generous stars gifted towards this tail-spinning disaster is due to sentiment alone.",A Good Day to Die Hard
86,Rob_Taylor,A Good Day to Watch a Different Movie,5,7 July 2013,"I wasn't much enamoured of the last Die Hard movie, which stunk like a dead eel on the foreshore and wasn't much more appealing, but this one was just beyond words. I only watched it all the way to the end to see just how dumb it could get and, trust me, it gets dumber than a dumb-thing from Dumbville, which is very dumb indeed.My first gripe, spotted in the early scenes and repeated throughout, is the woeful editing. It's rare I complain about this aspect of movie making, but here, it's just awful. In the first scene, McClane gets out of a taxi that is stuck in traffic and walks across a road. From one angle, the taxis clearly in the outside lane, in the next, its in the middle lane. Not just that, but the entire road is completely different! It is blatantly obvious. Did they really need to do this shot in two locations? Later, after rolling his truck badly, the truck lands back on its wheels. Cut to next shot of MCClane clambering out of a vehicle that is on its side! I mean, come on. If its this obvious at the first viewing, then it should have been fixed.There's another later involving a helicopter seen from a window. The 'copter is clearly on a flat roof. Cut to the scene with the bad guy opening a door in a wall and walking out to the chopper a few feet away. Where the hell was the wall and door in the first scene? There's also one where McClane stops on one bridge, but drives off another.If these editing gaffs were all that was wrong with the movie, it wouldn't be so bad. But there's worse. My perennial favourite, bad physics.Now I don't expect it to be too realistic in films like this. But it would be nice if they had someone explain to them some basic principles.For instance, there's a line of dialogue about radiation ""pooling"" in a particular area. Just radiation. Not radioactive water, or air. Just radiation. Don't worry though, because this slightly annoying technical balls-up is nowhere near the one that follows soon after, where they clean away the radiation by pumping some kind of flammable gas into the room.I mean, Wow! It's that easy to get rid of radiation? What were they thinking at Fukushima all this time? A little while later we discover that tail rotors on Hind helicopters are almost indestructible and will cut through stone and metal happily like a circular saw without being damaged. Even when a handy body is thrown into it, it doesn't flinch. Just keeps on spinnin' Beyond the above, the movie has some very poor dialogue and terrible caricature-isation going on. The first time he meets his son, McClane comes off as a moron. It's clear his son is doing something important, yet Mac talks to him as if he were a five-year old? Of course, this is all done so that the pair can ""reconcile"" as the movie goes on.Jesus Christ! Does every movie have to have a dysfunctional family scene in it? Do screenwriters have a check book of things they must include in order to get a script approved? Dysfunctional family that reconciles by the end.....check! Ridiculous scenery-chewing villain..... check! Car chase....check! The list goes on and on.We're not done yet, though. That car chase? I estimate McClane probably killed or seriously injured at least a dozen people during it. Although not the driver of the pipe carrying truck since we are clearly shown it doesn't have a driver due to the lousy editing.This is just one long, irritating piece of garbage that doesn't deserve to wear the franchise name.SUMMARY: The most atrocious editing I have ever seen. Terrible physics. Poor dialogue. This movie doesn't just require you to suspend belief. It asks you to hang, draw and quarter it.PS: Seriously, this movie makes Olympus Has Fallen look like a friggin' masterpiece! Give it a miss if you loved the originals. This is in the same sad league as Indy Jones and the Crystal Skull. A movie too far.PPS: Someone needs to tell Bruce Willis to stop doing that closed-mouth grin in interviews. It makes him look like a cross between a simpleton and Touche Turtle. Stop it!",A Good Day to Die Hard
87,The_Film_Cricket,Forgets why we keep coming back to the adventures of John McClane.,2,17 February 2013,"""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a movie concocted by filmmakers who have completely forgotten all the reasons that we keep coming back to the adventures of John McClane since the original ""Die Hard"" 25 years ago. It is the same reason that we keep coming back to James Bond: he stands out in a field packed with identical action heroes. McClane has an appealing, not to mention, distinctive personality. He is a blue collar veteran cop with family problems, who prefers Roy Rogers to Rambo and has a talent for wise-acre catchphrases. Like Indiana Jones, he is strong but has an upfront vulnerability. He's so cool, he even has a theme: Beethoven's 5th. He is just a guy, a relatable guy that you wouldn't mind having a beer with.The trouble with ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is that it erases all those distinctive pleasures. Willis is so here that we never feel that we're watching that guy who jumped off the roof of the Nakatomi building tied to a fire hose. It is possible that after his countless look-a-like/sound-a-like action pictures over the years that Bruce Willis has forgotten that the shock of the original ""Die Hard"" is that it felt like an 80s action movie that just happened to star that guy from ""Moonlighting. This movie, the fifth in the series, is so banal that any actor to stand in the lead. It also could have taken place anywhere. The story takes John to Russia, but we never feel like we're there. Other than the accents, it could be New York, or Italy, or Spain, or Johannesburg. You get no sense of the social climate of Moscow or the Ukraine, unlike the Bond pictures which went to Russia before and after communism and you could feel the tension in the air.The story doesn't matter, either. It involves John travelling to Russia because his son Jack (Jai Courtney) has been arrested in connection with an assassination and is about to testify in a separate case in exchange for a shorter sentence. That trial involves a government whistleblower Yuri Komarov (Sabastian Koch) who refuses to turn over a secret file that has incriminating evidence involving a corrupt Russian official, Viktor Chagarin who will kill him in order to keep the file that could put WMD's in the hands of some very bad people. No sooner does John arrive in Moscow then the courthouse is bombed, Chagarin's men kidnap Komarov and we come to understand what Bruce Willis is talking about in the trailer when he calls someone ""The 007 of Plainfield, New Jersey"". Hint: He's not talking about himself.What follows is more or less redundant. John and son Jack (who is secretly a C.I.A. agent) join forces to retrieve Komarov even though Jack resents his father for never being around when he was a kid. Another running joke in this series is that John is always trying to get back into the good graces of a family member who hates him. Remember the first one? His wife was mad at him. In ""Live Free or Die Hard"" it was his daughter. Now it's his son, who is so at odds with his father that he insists on calling him by his first name. They never really work things out. Plus, you'd think that after all he's been through for the family over the years, they might cut him a break. What's a dad to do? The rest of the movie is one long chase as father and son try to keep Chagarin's men from getting their grubby hands on that secret file. That includes an exhaustive car chase in the streets of Moscow; a shoot out in a safehouse; and another at a facility at Chernobyl. The movie is wall-to-wall stunts, which we accept, but this series has been known for overblown, ridiculous stuntwork that never-the-less has always been inventive and a lot of fun. Not here. We get car chases, helicopter crashes done without style or flare or creativity. You can run next door in the theater and see the same stuff in ""Parker"" or ""The Last Stand"" or ""Bullet to the Head. Bruce Willis says that he is onboard for one more ""Die Hard"" picture. Let's hope so. Let's hope that he insists that the script for that film reminds us of the reasons that we fell in love with this series in the first place.** (of four)",A Good Day to Die Hard
88,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,90 minutes of Hell,1,30 March 2013,"I snuck in to see this film. I did not pay, as I was certain it was going to suck like hell and treat its audience with nothing but contempt, and, to quote the real John McClane, from Die Hard 2: ""I hate it when I'm right."" Here, as in the equally abysmal fourth part, John McClane no longer bears any resemblance to the original character created by Roderick Thorp in his original novel, or the film character created by Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza, in the original Die Hard. Here, we have a bald, grumpy old man, who does very little, except complain.A brief opening scene with an Obama lookalike leads nowhere and could have been edited out completely, and its absence wouldn't even be noticed. Ditto Winstead's character's obligatory cameo in the next scene. Ditto, again, the Moscow taxi driver's scene. Then from out of nowhere, bombs go off, explosions and gunfire begin, McClane joins in a lengthy car chase to save his obligatorily estranged son, but we don't know who is chasing who, or why, or where they're trying to get to.We later learn his obligatory estranged son is really an undercover CIA agent on assignment. His assignment was never fully explained, or perhaps it was just unintelligible, due to terrible cinematography and editing. The quick-cut editing was so jarring, and the shaky cam was so dizzying, I had to close my eyes, or look away from the screen at times. The extreme colour tinting (red in some scenes, green in others, yellow at the climax) coupled with the high contrast made this look like an Asylum release. There are really only four lengthy sequences in this film (20 minutes long car chase, 10 minutes in a safehouse, 10 or 15 minutes in some sort of ballroom, and 30 minutes in Chernobyl) along with a couple of short scenes connecting one to the other, and that is the extent of the film. As McClane's obligatorily estranged relative, Jai Courtney is so unlikeable and angry that it is impossible to care what happens to him, and HE is the main character in this film, not John McClane. This is a Jai Courtney movie, not a Bruce Willis movie. McClane has absolutely no one-liners, nor is there even a fight scene with him. In fact, there were no fight scene at all in this entire movie, just endless car crashes and shooting. (Bruce Willis publicly mentioned that there was talk of bringing the character of his son into the fourth film, but Willis didn't want to do it because he thought it would be too distracting, but he changed his mind and did this mess of a movie, probably without even reading a screenplay, if there even was a screenplay, considering this film is attributed to the fictitious ""Skip Woods"")The exchange, ""Do you need a hug?"", ""We're not a hugging family"", ""Damn straight!"" was awful, as McClane understandably hugged his wife tightly, when reunited with her at the end of parts one and two. I doubt the people who made this had even watched the original trilogy.Short run-time makes it possible to get more showings in cinemas per day; and the film's 90 minutes long runtime could have been 8 - 10 minutes shorter without the slow motion scenes and closing credits, and a further 15 minutes shorter without the car chase. But I didn't even make it to the end, when they started talking about, ""We're driving to Chernobyl, in *Ukrainia*"", I walked out. It was the first time in my life that I walked out of a movie, but I just didn't care any longer. This movie is an insult to the fans, it's an insult to the original Die Hard, it even manages to be an insult to Die Hard 4 (which I also thought was an insult to the fans, and an insult to the original Die Hard)But this is probably all just a set up for Die Hard 6, which Bruce Willis will doubtlessly say is ""Better than the first!"" and ""Die Hard 6 is the first *real* sequel to Die Hard, which was really the only good one!"" which is exactly what Willis said about parts three, and four. He'll probably claim that Die Hard 6 will be ""An apology to the fans for a bad fifth movie."" Bruce Willis needs to just go bald and go away already, and considering the fact this film is currently sitting at a 9% rating on rotten tomatoes shows people have (I hope) earnt their lesson from the previous film, and are over Die Hard sequels.Die Hard remains a trilogy, it ended With A Vengeance.",A Good Day to Die Hard
89,brando647,The Worst Movie in the DIE HARD Franchise (For Now...),4,9 August 2013,"After learning that there would be a fifth installment to the series, I revisited LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD late last year for a quick refresher on the modern adventures of John McClane. As I remember, I determined that it made for a fun enough action movie but it just didn't feel like an actual DIE HARD movie. Well, 20th Century Fox must have discovered my complaintsand hate my gutsbecause the fifth movie in the series, A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD, is officially unrecognizable as a McClane film with the exception of star Bruce Willis. What happened? Seriously? How could the series have fallen this far? I'm sure it's been said a hundred times before, but the series should've ended after the third film. Instead, the studios just continue to see dollar signs (although this one failed to earn its budget in box office receipts domestically soyou knowfingers crossed) and have hastily thrown together a new adventure with John McClane in hopes that people won't notice how lame it is as long as they allow him the F-bomb in his catchphrase. For those who were lucky enough to skip this one, a little introduction: McClane's estranged son, Jack, has been arrested for murder in Russia and is about to stand trial alongside a political prisoner who has been targeted for extraction from the country by the CIA. John travels to Russia just in time to mess up all of Jack's convoluted CIA plans and now the two must work together as a team to keep the target alive. Also it's the new millennium so, of course, nuclear weapons!Oh man, where do I start? There's just so much about this movie that doesn't work. Let's start with the obvious: this just isn't a DIE HARD movie. Just because you throw Bruce Willis in an action movie as NYPD police does not earn the title of DIE HARD. The McClane from the first three films had a sense of humor. Yeah, he found himself caught up in these major events but he always did it with a wink and a joke. Now he just grumbles angrily as he moves from action set piece to action set piece. He's miserable! It's blatantly obvious that Willis does not want to be here. He has a few one-liners in the movie but they feel forced into the dark, gloomy atmosphere of the movie. Oh yeah, that's right. The entire movie is dark. Not the contentthe actual cinematography. It's all doom and gloom (which makes the use of the Rolling Stones track over the end credits that much more fitting); it's depressing! DIE HARD isn't supposed to be depressing! In this movie, John McClane continues developing the super powers he discovered in LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD. You know, the ones where he can't be hurt and feels no pain. Remember the scene where he walked barefoot on broken glass in the first movie and it made you cringe at what he was going through? He doesn't care about any of that pain stuff now. Slows him down too much. Bad dudes show up now and he grabs the biggest gun he can find, stands tall in the middle of the room, and lets loose.A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD is a blatant attempt at establishing a new McClane for when Willis grows tired (or too old) to continue the cash cow franchise. We are introduced to Jack McClane, played with minimal range by Jai Courtney. Courtney infuses Jack with all of two emotions: anger and bemusement. Oh, and punching. Is punching an emotion? The moment the series is passed on to McClane's son is the moment I lose what little interest I have left. The villain in the movie iswell, I can't really mention much about him without spoiling the ""plot"" but I will say he doesn't live up to the previous DIE HARD baddies, and his henchmen are downright forgettable. The villain's ultimate plans make no real sense either. He wants to steal a cache of weapons-grade uranium but I swear he goes about doing it in the most indirect, complicated means possible. The same can be said for Jack's plans to escape with Komarov (Sebastian Koch), the Russian political prisoner with dirt on an evil aspiring Russian defense minister. Jack gets himself arrested so he can get close to Komarov, but what was his plan after that? He only actually escaped with him because of the attempt on Komarov's life, but what if that hadn't happened? What was his plan? Rot in Russian prison with him until they were both put to death? So the story is lame, the characters are lame, the cinematography is lame, and Willis doesn't seem to care about any of it. Does anything work in this movie? Well, sure. I guess the action is all right for what it is. There's a pretty cool car chase near the beginning with an armored truck plowing through traffic. And McClane has a lot of fun with helicopters this time around. Willis does have a few good throwaway lines, and his catchphrase is present in all its glory this time around. Is it enough to save the movie? Nope!In short, this is easily the worst DIE HARD movie in the series.",A Good Day to Die Hard
90,bob-rutzel-1,Die Hard Series Needs to R.I.P.,5,5 June 2013,"New York Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) goes to Russia to see his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney) who is in jail, but who is also a CIA operative. Both later team up to prevent a nuclear weapons heist. See, the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. It can no longer be said that the Die Hard sequels keep getting better and better. This sequel proves that statement. This can be broken down into 3-segments: (1) in the beginning, an almost 40-minute car chase in Russia (well they said it was in Russia) that behaved more like Demolition Derby; (2) helicopter firing on a hotel room where our heroes are and (3) a helicopter firing on the good guys in Chernobyl (that's in Russia too). That's about it. That's the movie. See?The almost 40-minute chase in the beginning was fantastic and if CGI was not used and actual stunt men did the work, well, much was awesome and almost unbelievable. Kudos. But, the operative words here are ""almost 40-minutes."" Way too long. The two helicopter segments later on were also good, but what we have here is an all-action movie. Too much action and when that happens I tend to go into La La Land. Sub-titles are used in the beginning when everyone spoke Russian, but one needed the Hubble Telescope to see them as the words were super small. And, to compound that, the words didn't stay on the screen long enough so one could read them to the end. Bummer. (I never did take that speed-reading course.) And, get this: later on everyone spoke English. Go figure. In previous Die Hard movies we knew who the bad guy was and we wanted to see him ""get his."" In here Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch) was the bad guy, but we were ambivalent about him. He did nothing to make us dislike him. One more thing: In previous Die Hards John McClane gave us some memorable quips. Didn't happen in here with this weak script. Also, there was no Yippie Kae Yay Not that we needed that in this all action movie. What was good, really good? The music and the editing for the car chases in the beginning. Kudos.It is my understanding that Chernobyl is still a hot place loaded with radiation, but in here we see there is a safe zone (a WHAT?) and the protective suits come off of the bad guys. John McClane and son do not ever bother to put the suits on in the first place. Give me a break. if all you want to see is action, action, action, then this is for you. Maybe this should have been a video game. As for me I say the Die Hard Series needs to Rest in Peace. I am out. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

91,moviexclusive,"Bruce Willis does what he does best, but this is quite simply one of the worst days of the 'Die Hard' series",5,6 February 2013,"Our hearts go out to Bruce Willis. Truly. Six years after successfully restarting the most important character of his entire movie-making career, Willis has to watch it all crash and burn to the ground with this loud, dumb and plain boring fifth chapter, the erroneously-titled 'A Good Day to Live Hard'. Indeed, while its immediate predecessor 'Live Free or Die Hard' banked on a winning formula of old-school heroics with new-age sensibilities, this sequel is firmly stuck in the past – and the worse thing about it is that it would only be passable by the standards of an 80s action movie.Truth be told, Willis isn't at all the reason why this fails to be a good day for the 'Die Hard' franchise. At the age of 57, the man can still run, carry a mean weapon and kick ass – not to mention his trademark squint and unflappable wisecracking attitude. To put it simply, Willis is still very much the John McClane we've loved in the 80s and 90s and even in the very last movie before this one. But much as Willis tries, he is severely let down by a toxic combination of weak scripting and even weaker directing – the former of which by Skip Woods and the latter by John Moore.Little in either Woods' or Moore's filmography suggests that they are capable of rising above mediocrity, and this exercise in blandness is proof of that foolish consistency. Let's start with Woods' script, which clearly thinks it can be a 'Mission Impossible' by way of 'Die Hard' – so instead of putting the New York City detective in his home turf, or for that matter, his home country, decides to transport him all the way to the Moscow to wreak havoc. The excuse? To reconnect with his long lost son, Jack, who has apparently turned bad and is now imprisoned in Russia.Nowhere in the rest of the story does Woods manage to convince us that the change in location is worth the while. Even though we are now well into the 21st century, Woods still seems stuck in the last, so not only are the good guys and bad guys drawn along the lines of Americans and Russians respectively (cue the stereotypes about both nationalities), the plot has something to do with as archaic an institution as Chernobyl. Oh yes, we're back to foiling some nasty Russian's nefarious plan of using the uranium from the site to build weapons of mass destruction.To make matters worse, Moore is too daft to realise that the very premise in itself strains credibility. How else can you explain why following scene after scene of destruction around the Russian capital, there is no sign of any law and order agency? Are we supposed to believe that the police are too busy or nonchalant to care about some highway chase that decimates pretty much every one of the city's infrastructure it comes across? Or that no authority responds to some helicopter firing round after round after round into a high-rise building? We like that our action movies are escapist, but not when they ignore every shred of common sense simply for expediency.The fact that we pay attention to these details is in itself telling, for despite a frenetic pace that goes from scene after scene of action, the movie remains a bore. Shots are fired, things get blown up and people get killed from time to time, but at the end of the day, all that action is staged so unimaginatively that it fails to even interest – let alone excite – you. The pacing within each sequence is too monotonous, the sound seems perpetually cranked on loud, and the weaponry – plus an over-used helicopter – just gets tiresome too quickly. As if to compensate for the lack of any genuine thrills, the climax goes over- the-top, but like the rest of the movie, grows so incredulous – especially in slo-mo – that it is just laughable.Ironically, what passes as John McClane's wise cracks is anything but humorous. Most of McClane's lines are in the context of his father-son relationship with Jack (Jai Courtney), but are hardly witty or engaging. They are also frustratingly repetitive, consisting of John lamenting how Jack nary shows him any respect as a father, or John lamenting how he had expected no more than a vacation in Moscow, or some inane topic like whether they will grow a third hand after stepping into Chernobyl without any protective suit. If John's lines are horrid, the rest of the characters can be no better – and what really takes the cake is when John's nemesis Alik (Rasha Bukvic) talks about how he used to be a pretty good tap dancer whom no one appreciated.Even more lamentable is how this instalment, if played right, could have been an exciting new page for the 'Die Hard' series, with John passing the baton to his CIA operative of a son Jack. Yet this fifth chapter is easily the worst 'Die Hard' entry and quite possibly might sound the death knell for the franchise. If John McClane had a penchant for landing in the wrong place at the wrong time, then 'A Good Day to Die Hard' is Bruce Willis' unfortunate mistake of being in the wrong movie with the wrong people.",A Good Day to Die Hard
92,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"A slap in the face for series fans, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is one of the most tragically disappointing sequels of recent memory...",1,6 November 2013,"What happened?No, seriously. What happened?This is not the ""Die Hard"" I grew up with. This is not the ""Die Hard"" I worshiped as a film-goer and a fan of action. This is not the ""Die Hard"" I so eagerly anticipated since the series was relaunched with the fourth film.To be honest... This simply isn't ""Die Hard.""This is a creatively bankrupt, nauseatingly made, painfully cliché piece of simple fluff. It is almost reprehensible in how little effort was put into the ""craftsmanship"", ""writing"" and ""acting.""It really does pain me to say this, but this film truly does deserve the 1-out-of-10 score I am branding it with. I was born the year the original film was released, and I grew up watching the series, and this film has left me literally crestfallen as a fan.John Moore (who helmed the atrocious ""Max Payne"" adaptation which spat in the face of the excellent source material) directs this fifth entry in the ""Die Hard"" series, with Bruce Willis reprising his iconic role as John McClane. Well, actually, he's not playing John McClane... He's playing an obnoxious caricature of McClane, but more on that later.The film centers on John McClane, whose forced to travel to Russia to claim his son Jack (Jai Courtney). Jack, as it turns out, was arrested over in good-old Mother Russia. However, in a sloppy and abrupt chase sequence, the two generations of McClanes are pulled into a ruthless battle against an evil, generic Russian villain.Blah, blah, blah. The story doesn't matter, quite frankly, because the film is such an incoherent mess.To be fair, there is one good thing about the film- Marco Beltrami's magnificent score, which is very much in the ""Die Hard"" spirit. And similar to Beltrami's score for the prior film, this score incorporates some of the musical themes from the original ""Die Hard"", which is a nice throwback to the earlier films. It's a great score, but sadly, that's where the quality ends.The acting is just foul. Jai Courtney is doing his best to play a sort- of pseudo younger Bruce Willis, but he falls flat quickly and is never able to stumble back up to his feet. Sebastian Koch is overly generic as the villain and is given nothing to work with. And Willis just doesn't care, from the looks of it. He barely puts any effort into the role, making McClane seem flat and uninspired for the first time in the series. And the fact that you can repeatedly hear dialog clips of Willis from the prior films over-dubbed in the action sequences tells us that he cared so little about this film, he didn't even bother to come in for ADR/audio work after shooting.The direction is absolutely terrible. Moore seems stuck in shooting his scenes in one of two fashions- overly shaky ""gritty"" camera-work, where the footage is constantly vibrating, shaking and moving to the point you can't see what is happening. And ""Bullet Time""-esque slow-motion, where everything is slowed down in a poor attempt to emulate films like ""The Matrix."" It doesn't work for ""Die Hard."" And to make matters worse, his visual direction and guidance affects everything- from the sets and costumes to the effects, everything feels sub-par, overly derivative, poorly handled and without reason. It is without a doubt one of the worst directing jobs I've seen in a major Hollywood blockbuster. This is compounded and made worse by the editing. Oh lord, the editing. It's like the film was cut by feeding the raw footage into an industrial-sized blender set to ""liquify""... nothing feels organic and nothing flows because there are so many needless edits and cuts, leaving us with shots that often only last for a split second.The script by Skip Woods is almost equally as nauseating, giving us cliché after cliché, while somehow also feeling simultaneously over- written and under-written all at once. Some scenes are terribly phoned- in with the subtlety of a brick to the head, whereas other scenes feel confusing and needlessly complex. And the script (combined with Moore's direction) has completely violated and destroyed any trace of Willis' legendary John McClane character. As I mentioned above, he felt like a caricature. And in fact, even that is putting it lightly. Willis comes off more as a blatant parody of himself in this film. His humorous quips from prior films have been replaced with broad and mean-spirited jokes, his penchant for managing to survive harrowing ordeals is exacerbated by making him survive repeated and increasingly over-the-top injuries that would have left him dead 4 times over within the first half-hour (the film repeatedly out-does the insane ""Jet"" sequence from the prior film in terms of unbelievablility), and his general demeanor is just plain silly. Even at its worst, the series has never made McClane such a blatant laughing stock as he was in this film, for all of the wrong reasons. He felt like a poorly-written video-game character who had been made invulnerable by cheat-codes.Then there's the action. The one possible saving grace to the film. And it fails to deliver in the slightest. Some people site the first major chase sequence as a highlight, but in all honesty, I found it terrible. It suffers from that ""liquify""-type editing I mentioned above, as well as Moore's over-use of the shaky-cam style of camera-work. And it made the sequence feel artificial and boring as a result.I actually became angry watching this film, because it was so clear that everything was fundamentally mishandled and tragically misjudged. It is a colossal misstep in the series that has left me weary and almost dreading the announced sixth film.This gets a well-deserved 1 out of 10. It looks like John McClane may finally be dead after this colossal failure, at least in terms of quality and characterization.",A Good Day to Die Hard

I'll admit, I gave it a 7 due to a couple of shots in the climactic sequence that echoed the original, so I'm probably part of the problem myself (easily pleased) but the conception of this truly did seem paper thin. If you're very lenient (like me) then it MIGHT just be worth watching for the villain's conspiracy and megalomaniacal scheme that's uncovered in the last 20 minutes - but don't watch it if you're expecting some mileage out of the father/son angle... That is literally half-heartedly run through by dialogue based entirely on hoary old clichés. The problem with this laziness is that developments feel borrowed and 'plugged in' from other films, and don't have the McClane attitude about them (much like the 4th film, also)",A Good Day to Die Hard
95,rivertam26,Dead on Arrival,4,14 February 2013,"I don't know how John Moore is allowed to still make movies. I mean Behind Enemy Lines was dumb fun but Flight of the Phoenix, The Omen remake and Max Payne were all pretty dreadful. It's really a shame because a lot of well deserved faith was restored to the franchise and a new audience with the amazing last entry which was without a doubt the best of the series. Yes it was big and a little dumb with a chaotic action spread and clever humor. It also boasted an appreciated charismatic turn from Willis reprising the role. So what happened Fox? you just hand over the reins to John Moore? really. Well he's managed to undo everything the previous entries have done. Replacing every bit of charisma or interest with bland, action movie clichés and a sordid confusing almost non existent plot line. The movie is really bad to say the least. But I'd be lying if I didn't say that there wasn't a lot of unintentionally funny stuff here and Jai Courtney although ill paired with Willis as father and son because they have actual negative chemistry is pretty smoking. The action set pieces feel forced and the movie doesn't really have any type of real engagement or suspense which makes all the proceedings so bland and ineffective. Sadly the ending is the worst part with a corny family reunion that could possibly promise a much better sequel but sadly after the disaster that is this I'm not sure I'll be signing up because this is DOA. 2/5",A Good Day to Die Hard
96,Screen_Blitz,Worst Die Hard of the series,4,9 May 2015,"Bruce Willis is back as John McClane in this fifth installment, only it's not as thrilling this time around. Die Hard has been one of the most entertaining action series since it's debut in 1988. This one, however, completely abandons almost element that made the previous four great. The plot is weak, the characters are unmemorable, and compared the first four films, this one is pretty mediocre.John McClane sets out to Moscow, Russia in search of his estranged son, Jack McClane. The two then team up against a Russian terrorist, Komarov who is in possession of stolen nuclear weapons. The plot, however, isn't very clear because of how poorly developed it is. You never learn much about Komarov's true intentions, or the character himself. The characters have no personalities whatsoever. The film moves so fast and skims over the character construction as well as the plot development. In addition, the film is rather short. The four previous Die Hard films each ran for over two hours, while this only runs a little more than an hour and a half. It makes it look like the director was in a rush to get this finished.The only thing truly redeeming about this film is the action scenes, and the most of them aren't that exciting.While A Good Day to Die Hard wasn't an overblown disaster, it certainly wasn't as ambitious as the first four. It would nice if a sixth Die Hard was made, just to end the series on a goo note.",A Good Day to Die Hard
97,Troy_Campbell,"Has obvious faults, but still a solid action flick.",6,22 March 2013,"With a positively epic trailer which hinted at a mind-numbingly fun tone, this fifth Die Hard instalment is a semi-success without ever filling its potential as a supreme popcorn flick. After the flashy credit sequence sets up the barebones terrorist plot, the film wastes no time in racing towards its first major set piece; a freakishly entertaining segment that boasts one of the most thunderous and crash-happy car chases you're likely to see this year, or any other year for the matter. It's a fantastic opening half hour, but it's ultimately a curse on proceedings. Aside from a couple of choice slow-motion moments, nothing else comes remotely close to matching the ferocity, coolness or downright enjoyability of the first act and the movie suffers for it. Old Brucey tries his hardest to dispel thoughts that he's best yippie-ki-yaying is behind him, and he largely pulls it off, whilst Aussie up-and-comer Jai Courtney - here playing McClane's estranged CIA-agent son - has a natural action-hero charisma but understandably struggles to give his cardboard cutout character any real depth. Despite obvious downfalls in the script department and diminishing returns in the action sequences, AGDTDH is a solid turn-your-brain-off big screen outing.",A Good Day to Die Hard
98,Pumpkin_Man,Die Hard in Russia!!!,6,15 February 2013,"I love the Die Hard franchise. I liked this one, but this is one of the weakest in the series, along with Die Hard 2. The movie was too short and felt rushed. Bruce Willis's John McClane character didn't seem like the main star this time. It felt more like Jack's story, but John was just there to help him out, and to try to make this feel like a Die Hard movie. His classic infamous 'Yipee Ki-Yay' scene wasn't done too well. There were some funny one-liners and decent action scenes.Jack McClane is a CIA agent in an undercover operation in Russia. When John hears that he's in trouble, he travels to Russia to help him out. Jack's mission is to protect a political prisoner named Yuri Komarov from Alik and his henchmen. The McClanes must stop them from stealing billions of dollars worth of weapons-grade uranium in Chernobyl. This isn't a horrible movie. I'll be adding it to my Die Hard collection, but it feels very different and unlike the originals. If you're a fan, you might like A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD!!!",A Good Day to Die Hard
99,ketgup83,"If you are love action movies to the core, you might want to watch it once !! Disappointing",6,2 June 2013,"Sometimes some of the Hollywood movie series just never end and it is unnecessary to drag along. Die Hard 5 is a classic example. It had some cool action scenes , typical Willis witty one-liners but the direction and screenplay makes it less impacting.John McClane travels to Russia to settle with his son Jack who is a CIA preventing a nuclear weapons heist. Father and son must team up together to fight the evil force in order to bring peace and justice.From the director of Behind the Enemy Lines , John Moore clearly misses the mark here. The style and theme of Die Hard is absent and apart from blowing up of cars and buildings , there is not much to be seen here. Screenplay is monotonous with nothing new to offer. Editing is fine. Cinematography is outstanding along with art direction. Dialogues re below the mark. Action scenes are good but not spectacular if you compare the previous version of Die Hard 4.0. Willis is not in form. he could have done and does a passable role. Jai Courtney is just about OK.Overall , a bad attempt to make fifth part which was now where close to previous version. If you are love action movies to the core, you might want to watch it once. Average - 2.5/5",A Good Day to Die Hard
100,TheUnknown837-1,I liked the music more than anything else....,5,3 June 2013,"Not since the dismal ""AVPR: Aliens vs. Predator – Requiem"" back in 2007 has a movie's cinematography frustrated and angered me as much as the nonstop barrage of heavy shadows, scribble-like silhouettes, and runny blue tints to be found in ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" This is one of those movies where every scene, even those in broad daylight, appears to be dark and dreary, as though somebody had placed a fine strip of blue plastic wrap over the camera lenses. Now, granted, dark cinematography is rather commonplace in movies such as this—because it helps guise the faults and lapses in both special effects and stunt work—but the results here are absurdly amateurish. As I sat watching this movie for what seemed like a really long time (but in fact was a brisk 98 minutes), I couldn't help but wonder if the director of photography, Jonathan Sela, had never heard of three-point lighting or color correction.Very frequently, characters disappear or blend in with their shadow-drenched surroundings; and, when night falls upon them, the brightest thing on the screen is the sweat gleaming to Bruce Willis's forehead. When it comes to evening-set sequences, Sela seems to have a fetish with backlighting and silhouettes and no concern at all with brightening up the part of the actors and sets that are nearest to us. Nothing, not even a uranium-enhanced grenade or a rising sun, can brighten this film's imagery.I can safely theorize that the director of this film, John Moore, has a place in action-filmmaking. I really enjoyed his tactic of, for his opening, having us hear the sounds of a riot without seeing anything—the one time, I think, where we were intended not to see anything. As demonstrated in an early car chase scene (the one where we can adequately see what is happening), he demonstrates a wicked instinct for staging his camera and not relying on claustrophobic close- ups to the point where it becomes nauseating. When a car flips and tumbles around on the Moscow highways (and it happens numerous times in this particular scene), Moore's cameras toggle back and forth, showing us the event from multiple angles—maybe a little too much, as though Moore set up so many cameras for fearing of one missing the action, and then feeling obliged to show everybody's results—and it is quite exciting.However, the fun stops right there. One of the key definitions to a strong action movie is the ability to absorb the audience in the narrative...even if the said narrative makes little to no sense. I probably don't need to mention this, but ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is merely the latest in a long series of movies and, two sequels before, the movie ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" used a plot that also made little sense. But the screenplay wisely paced itself at a quick yet satisfying rhythm so the audience didn't have too much time to think about plausibility and just enjoy the spectacle and the mind games. For this fifth adventure, in which poor Bruce Willis once again winds up throwing himself around bullet-strewn architecture, the logic flies around with little redeeming entertainment value. Had the storytellers swamped me under their own terms, I wouldn't have minded if the hero and his high-strung CIA agent of a son could throw themselves through a high-rise window, knowing there was a pulpit for them to land on, knowing that the board they broke through would lead to a tunnel that would take them safely to ground level.As much as I disliked ""A Good Day to Die Hard,"" I cannot pass it off as meritless. For one thing, Willis still possesses a screen-commanding presence and style, even if his character has diminished into a soulless, impersonal fighting machine. As his son, Jai Courtney also displays a certain level of on-screen confidence. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also in the picture, though only for the prologue and epilogue, and once again, did not fail to charm me. I've already talked about director Moore's prospects for future, better projects. And finally, I really do wish to grant credit to the composer for the music score. Veteran maestro Marco Beltrami's instruments and conduction do elevate some of the movie's lackluster scenes. So, at moments, I didn't mind so much that I couldn't see anything on the screen, for the music made for an excellent listening experience. He also plays it smart by only reusing a few moments of Michael Kamen's repeating score from the original 1988 film.One footnote: those expecting to hear the Ode to Joy come into play again, prepare for yet another thunderously disappointing aspect.I'd intended to see ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" on its debut last Valentine's Day. That night, however, a blizzard swept over and froze the engine of my car to a sputtering stop. I wound up holding off on seeing the picture, and now, in hindsight, I'm rather glad I did. Seeing a big disappointment on the big screen, having invested a fair few dollars into it, would have only made matters worse. As much as I would love to proclaim affection for this picture, I must glumly report that ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" has finally spun into the realms where I thought the Die Hard series would never go: immense boredom.",A Good Day to Die Hard
101,MrGKB,A sad way to kill a brand....,4,8 July 2013,"...not that the ""Die Hard"" franchise could ever really boast all *that* much integrity, but this fifth entry into the series is easily the weakest of the lot despite a glut of action, explosions, gunfire, and numerous goons dispatched accordingly. I'm glad to see it pretty much tanked domestically, a rare exhibition of movie-going discernment, but it looks like the international crowd lapped it up all the same, and now we're going to have to endure a sixth film. Please, please let it be the last.Other wags here have cogently identified this entry's failings: a hero reduced in many respects to second fiddle and given the indestructibility of a cartoon; a shopworn, unexciting plot; ho-hum villains who don't hold a candle to those who have come before. Yawn. Even worse, though, we're introduced to a McClane offspring who's been out of the picture (so to speak) for a quarter-century and expected to believe that John, Sr. hasn't had a clue where he's been or what he's been up to. Jai ""Jack Reacher"" Courtney isn't terrible in the role, but doesn't look a thing like his dad and just doesn't sport the same gravitas that's made Bruce Willis a perennial fan favorite.The less said, the better.

Just as in all other installments of, 'Die Hard', things blow up, there is plenty of gunfire and action, and more stuff blows up – what else do you really need? Oh I know people will ask, 'Was there a story?' I would agree in most casesbut this is, 'Die Hard'. And I have to say to those naysayers, 'Who cares?!' It is a, 'Die Hard', movie and pffft, I don't need a story. Okay – okay maybe there is a little something going on. Let me see if I can set things up for you. Mr. Willis plays some kind of police officer who has many, many guns – and is angry – and enjoys doing away with naughty bad guys (I actually believe that Bruce Willis missed an Oscar Nomination by only a couple of votes – I sense it was very close.) For whatever story there might have been, I think the gist begins with some good angry city cop gets angrier at about three million – no make that a billion – no better make that a trillion bad guys (and one bad girlof course) and kills them all. I knew it – I just knew it – I just spoiled the whole movie for everyone. I am so sorry. If it were anyone else playing John McClane, I may have to give this movie one star – BUT – this is Bruce Willisand of course I am a drone.

103,adamscastlevania2,Die hard just died hard,1,15 September 2014,"(5%) As a fan of the series this was a HUGE disappointment. Yet another movie ""effort"" from screenwriter Skip Woods, a writer of such low regard that many suspect that he doesn't even exist. To back that theory up this movie should be filed under exhibit A as no employable screen-writer would ever pen such a dire script as this, never mind it then actually being picked by a big budget movie producer, the world simply doesn't work like that. It has to be one of the most poorly written big budget movies I have seen since the Star wars prequels. As for the the movies ""performances""? Bruce looks bored (I'm not surprised, who wouldn't be with that script?), his on-screen son is one of the blandest ""characters"" in film history and all the villains are so drab I cannot remember what any of them look like. The direction during any sort of action will make your eyes bleed with no sense of speed, location or indeed what is actually going on. And like Transformers 2 the whole thing is nothing more than a prime example of the worst big budget Hollywood can and will dare produce, with its attitude that an audience will be entertained by a poorly filmed big truck smashing into lots cars without anything at all to back it up in terms of substance. This film is hardly worth watching for free as the power to run your TV/DVD/blueray is money down the drain, which is where the script should have gone from the very beginning.",A Good Day to Die Hard
104,ivo-cobra8,This movie is not a Die Hard movie so where is McClane?,1,14 February 2018,"A Good Day to destroy the franchise! This review will contain spoilers. I love the first four Die Hard movies. I love Die Hard to death, this movie killed the franchise. John Moore please get out of the film business forever because you blow it!! Bruce Wills is bored out of his mind. We see Bruce Wills in this movie but not John McClane we know!!! He is not the main character. He is not the main hero but his son is! Why would I care about his son dammit? Die Hard was about one man army fighting against a team of terrorists. While in this movie he is unlikable sidekick!!! The movie is horrible digitally CGI filmed. The movie is about Russia again. I understand Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rocky IV Stallone films dialed with the Russians been bad guys and they worked that was different it was the 80's but this movie fails to be A Die Hard movie! This movie is painful to watch, it hurt my eyes. John McClane is a sidekick not a main action hero that he is, he is a laughing stuck! I was laughing my ass at Bruce Willis! Die Hard 2 and Live Free or Die Hard are bashed from fans and critics but you know what they were not that bad at all. I love all 4 films to death all 4 films are great action films. This movie is awful painful to watch and it fails to be a good movie. R rating sucks too in here. No sidekicks anymore! Bruce Wills grove your hair. The movie does not deserve to focus on his children why would I care about his children?! Die Hard With A Vengeance did not need it another 2 sequels!! Live Free or Die Hard was still a good movie in my opinion, but it was not need it. This movie fucking sucks! It is a disaster! Where is McClane in here?! Where are his jokes?! Where is action in this?!This movie sucks! The worst one in the franchise. From here it well all down hill. Not my favorite in the franchise I don't have it in my collection and I will never have it. This movie doesn't exist. You think how bad Live Free Or Die Hard is? watch this film it will hurt you! Watch the CGI glass falling on McClane and on his stupid son Jai Courtney all fake! They don't bleed they are both animated stupid brainless morons in here. Score 1/10 avoid this film like a plague. Bruce Willis retire and grow your hair already!

105,natashabowiepinky,Knock Knock!!,6,14 March 2014,"The question in this film shouldn't be whether John McClane can reconcile with his son, or if he can stop the nasty Russian from escaping with millions worth of explosives. The real poser would be: Is he a good or a bad guy? Just look at his activities... he stops a crucial prosecution witness from being bought to justice, he causes a multi vehicle pile-up on a motorway in an aimless pursuit, (and don't tell me some lives weren't lost over the course of his little rampage) he punches random strangers out in the street to steal their cars, he takes many guns that don't belong to him by breaking into someone's boot and he probably causes thousands of pounds worth of property damage by doing everything in an unnecessarily excessive way.When he stepped off that plane at the end, I wasn't thinking about the tearful reunion with his daughter... I was confused as to how he was in such good shape considering all the high octane stuff he's been up to (especially as an over 50), and also baffled as to why he hadn't been arrested for literally destroying half of Russia. If the Ruskies can put four young women behind bars for years for doing a silly little protest dance near a church, then how would they handle a New York policeman WAY out of his jurisdiction blowing up things willie-nillie, and probably causing a few innocent casualties along the way? Apparently, they give him a free ride home. Maybe that Putin isn't such a bad guy after all. Ukraine, you have nothing to fear...Now time to put some meat on these bones. McClane is his usual unflappable self: dishing up one liners as if they were never out of fashion, always able to spot danger a split second before it arrives and sharing some bonding time with his errant boy, who isn't quite the bad kid his father envisaged him to be. These scenes can get pretty corny... emotional resonance is not one of the Die Hard series strong points. Not to worry though... we're never too far away from another massive explosion, or a graphic shooting, or a lorry dragging a helicopter down... yep, as I said... excessive. Just a tad.It's probably the weakest of all the DH's so far, the plot was obviously an afterthought to all the chaos and it shows in the running time too... just 85 minutes. Fortunately there's enough compensation in the form of eye candy to keep the target audience happy, apart from any watching prosecutors who'll be totaling up the cost of McClanes stunts and be incredibly frustrated they can't charge him with anything. In the real world, my best guess: 40 million dollars and 50 years hard labour. 6/10",A Good Day to Die Hard

107,joebloggscity,Keep expectations low and you'll enjoy this throwback action movie,7,1 January 2014,"This film is an unashamed cash in, so as long as you bear this in mind you won't be miffed.Anyhow, it's bish bosh bish bosh, bang wallop..... John McLean is back and it's action and adventure with our lead man wise cracking and kicking butt, but this time he is the wrong father now with his son in the wrong place at the wrong time.As it's Die Hard, this time the family strife is with his said son and we're on the fast ride again, but this time the action is in Russia with jail breakers, terrorists and nukes! Unlike the previous film (Die Hard 4.0) this film has decided to not be a diet light version of the original films and has retraced its tough and humorous roots. As long as you leave your brain at the door you'll find this film to be a fun ride. None of the sequels have matched the original and this wasn't trying, but instead was an entertaining throwback to old action movies.The action is non stop from the beginning, there's the thankfully brief father son confessions stuff, and then there is the good looking kick ass lady. All the cliché boxes are ticked. Throw in simple actors, crazy lines and a short length film, and you know what you're getting. If you want more, then there's the Marvel movies. This is for cashing in on nostalgia and these guys ain't got Iron Man's toys.Entertaining and enjoyable enough for a throwaway film that just keeps its head above water.

108,bryank-04844,"Despite its unintelligent story plot and predictability, 'A Good Day to Die Hard' made me excited for the 6th film.",6,2 September 2015,"We're back for another installment of the action packed 'Die Hard' series, the fifth chapter in the series that has spanned twenty-five years. We've followed John McClane to the top of a skyscraper, 50,000 feet in the air on a jumbo jet, a cat and mouse chase around a metropolitan area, and even cyber terrorism. Prior to the screening, I even thought ""Haven't we already said all we need to say with this John McClane character?"" Needless to say, ten minutes into the film, I found myself grinning ear to ear and holding on to both armrests ready for a highly entertaining thrill ride. 'A Good Day to Die Hard' might lack in story structure, but completely makes it all up with its intense action sequences and two solid performances by Bruce Willis and Jai Courtney.Director John Moore took a different approach to the franchise and gave it a heavy dose of the Michael Bay treatment. Now, I'll be the first to say that I am no fan of Bay, but say what you will about the guy, he can film an action sequence and blow things up like no other. The only movie I enjoyed from Moore was his first film, 'Behind Enemy Lines', which starred Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman. His later films such as 'Max Payne' and the remake of 'The Omen' proved to be poor choices for him. This 5th 'Die Hard' is wittier and more adventurous, much like 'Behind Enemy Lines' was, which made this installment much more fun. Moore went with the approach that he wouldn't mess about with character development or story lines, but rather start with the action bright and early and never let up. And from the 4th film of the franchise being as horrible as it was, I think we needed something like this to make us fall in love with this character all over again.And let me put your minds at ease, this film is rated 'R', unlike the last one, which was made for pre-teens and rated PG-13. Here you will get some great kill-shots, a few dozen gallons of blood, and that famous line of his yelled loud and clear. So, a few years have passed and McClane hasn't seen his son (Jai Courtney) in many years, and he thinks he is mixed up with the wrong people when a fellow police detective informs him that his son is mixed up in some very nasty business in Russia. As fast as you can say ""Yippee Kay Yay"", McClane is on a plane to Russia to re-connect with his son and take him home.Meanwhile, his son Jack looks to be in cahoots with some very bad criminals in which he is caught and on trial in Russia. As you can imagine, one explosion leads to another and Jack escapes and takes his partner in crime with him to getaway from the people who are trying to kill them. This leads to a car chase sequence that might be in my top five car chases in cinema history. I haven't had this much fun with a car chase since 'Bad Boys 2'. Low and behold, during the car chase, Papa McClane shows up and saves the day, but not without destroying 80% of Russian in the process. McClane sees that his son has been working for the CIA as a spy for a number of years and the criminal he has in tow has some key evidence that would unleash some horrific material on some very powerful people in Russia.From here, we move through several shoot-outs, more explosions, till we end up in actual Chernobyl, where there is some serious stuff going down and a few of our characters have a few twists of their own. And our climactic fight scene seems very familiar for fans of the past films, which made me giddy, as it made me think I was back in 1988 again.I really enjoyed the banter between father and son here. It never seemed forced or silly. It seemed sincere and at times was very funny, as some of the dialogue in the past has been with these films. The comedic timing was perfect. The hand-to-hand combat packed a punch and proved that Willis still has what it takes to fight man to man as well as take any sized gun and use it with ease. Never at one point did I think he was too old of this sh*t. Courtney proved to be a badass here as well, as he was in 'Spartacus' and 'Jack Reacher'. Him and Willis had great chemistry together. And of course the action sequences were top notch. It's as if Moore went to Michael Bay training school and graduated 1st in his class, minus the super quick cuts, which made the viewing experience much better and the action more intense.Despite its unintelligent story plot and predictability, 'A Good Day to Die Hard' made me excited for the 6th film, which subsequently is already in the planning stages. Willis has proved he is still up for a good fight with plenty more bad guys to kill. Packed with some good references to the previous films as well as some funny moments and high-octane thrills, I can't wait to watch this again and have fun with it.",A Good Day to Die Hard

110,jdkraus,"People may hate it, but it is still entertaining",6,8 March 2013,"John McClane is my favorite action hero. He fights dirty, delivers clever one-liners, and maintains the element of an overall likable guy that runs into situations that he even wonders how he got into. McClane has killed 65 people over 4 films, and has sustained more injuries than Tony Stark's Iron Man suit. The man should have died dozens of times ago, but he's that ""----ing energizer bunny."" In his 5th installment of the Die Hard series, McClane heads to Russia to see his son (Jai Courtney), who has been arrested for murder. Little does McClane know that he is about to walk into a battle, in which he has to protect himself, his son, who is really an undercover CIA operative, and find out the truth as to why he has run into yet another bad day. What was successful for the first four Die Hards was the development of the characters, the villains and their witty schemes. While the plot gives us an interesting idea and a smart twist towards the end, the story is relatively flat and rushed. This may be in part to the 98-minute film length, but it is really the screenwriter's fault. Sure, there is plenty of action, CGI, slow motion, shootings, explosions, etc, but the villains are not strong enough to be despicable nor even be understandable in their motives. Even the interaction between McClane and his son is incredibly weak. At least the writer had some decency to throw in the occasional humorous lines that gives the good guys their charm. While critics may call this a bad movie, it does not necessarily mean that it is not entertaining. Director John Moore gives the viewer some popcorn loving action sequences that are very well shot, specifically a car chase sequence in which it appears that every other car in Moscow is either wrecked or obliterated. It is worth noting that this is the first Die Hard to be filmed almost entirely hand-held and it gives an impression of a cool action flick. It is never bad to see Bruce Willis on the screening kicking ass either. I cannot say that this is the best Die Hard, but it is not a complete loss either.

Remember when we took that trip to Chernobyl and shot those Russkies? We make a great team! This is paraphrasing the father and son schmaltz that cripples the fifth Die Hard movie, an entry so poor that after twenty-five years it puts a once thrilling series on life-support. It's impossible to comprehend how this happened. Die Hard 4.0 was the highest grossing entry featuring Bruce Willis' New York detective John McClane. It was smart, physical, and even politically self-aware. The terrorist threat was from within: one of the US government's own men gone rogue. But someone must have felt it took too many jabs at the Bush administration and FEMA because A Good Day is by contrast embarrassingly archaic in its geocentric worldviews, and pro-American values. The series has always edged closer towards the right. Willis has previously endorsed the Republican Party and was quoted recently defending America's Second Amendment: ""If you take one out or change one law, then why wouldn't they take all your rights away from you?""Similarly, film critic Paul Byrnes compared the series to the John Wayne movies of old, with a modern cowboy in McClane out to defend the wealth of the American homeland. But I don't believe the series has strayed into jingoism before as overtly as it does here. This is the first movie set outside the US and John and his grownup son Jack (Australian Jai Courtney) face off against the Russians, including a father and his own child. Guess who comes out on top and learns they love spending time together killing Reds?The bonding through murder is outright offensive. John and Jack comfortably mow down hordes of evil Russians but afterwards talk about why Jack doesn't call him dad anymore. Some of this cringing banter isn't meant to be funny so there's no irony or logic in how these characters behave. Why the filmmakers also felt the Cold War tensions had any contemporary relevancy we will never know. Ironically, it takes a villain to announce: ""Reagan is dead"". It's the most authentic line in the movie. Director John Moore's last film four years ago was the dire Max Payne. He's made a hash of this movie too, treating it every bit like a video game. The film runs thirty minutes shorter than the other films and it's by far the thinnest in the series. The action sequences, overcut and edited, have been stretched to excruciating lengths, as though the filmmakers thought we couldn't handle a moment of plotting. There is no narrative structure to speak of, or any backstory, only lazy exposition to create tenuous links between each setpiece and stunt.The action itself is laughable. Remember the iconic scene where McClane picked broken glass out of his feet? He's more like a ragdoll or a comic book character now. He seems immune to glass, capable of jumping through windows unharmed. He's also fireproof, surviving an exploding room, with flames edging so close they could singe the top of his head, and shock absorbent, walking away from two violent car crashes. Where is the tension if the main characters are immune to everything thrown at them? The miniscule plot runs accordingly: Russian prisoner Yuri (Sebastian Koch) is incriminated by corrupt politician Viktor Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov) and is set to be tried in Moscow. Meanwhile, McClane's son Jack, who has been in the CIA for three years, is also arrested for an attempted assassination. John learns that his son is in trouble and travels to Russia to find him. An explosion is triggered around the courthouse and Jack helps Yuri escape. Meeting up with John, they hurry to find a file that could lead to Viktor's downfall. The opening of the film feels the steadiest but is still extremely incoherent. How exactly did Jack join the CIA and who was he trying to assassinate? Once John finds his son the wheels come off badly. There's no humanity or feeling provided by either Willis or newcomer Courtney. They're treated like tokens, trapped in a video game that is posturing as a movie. The longer this goes on the worse it gets.",A Good Day to Die Hard
113,MattyGibbs,Terrible and very dull action movie,3,21 February 2015,"Die Hard is a franchise that really does live up to it's name. The first two were good but since then it's gone rapidly downhill. This the 5th film in the series and is where it hits the bottom of the barrel. Against my better judgement I decided to watch this but unfortunately it was even worse than I'd feared. It features a dreadfully dull plot, rotten acting, appalling dialogue, monotonous action scenes in fact everything you could wish to see in an inane action film is right here. Quite why an already incredibly rich Bruce Willis would want to soil his reputation with this boring mess of a film is anybody's guess. The only good thing about this movie is that it is relatively short at just over an hour and half and for that I was truly thankful. Dreadful in every way possible. Avoid.",A Good Day to Die Hard

The film finds Bruce Willis's John McClane in Russia trying to reconnect with his estranged, CIA agent son, Jack, all the while the two of them are fighting Russian bad guys and saving the day. That's essentially the entire movie, but it works. While there are no memorable villains, set pieces, or gags, it's still a whole lot of fun, and Jai Courtney is believable as McClane's son. Could a spin-off franchise be far behind?Overall, if you're looking for action and mayhem, all with a good sense of humor to go along with it, A Good Day to Die Hard will delight.I give A Good Day to Die Hard an 8 out of 10!",A Good Day to Die Hard
115,Maniac-9,This is a strictly paint by the numbers edition of Die Hard,3,26 April 2013,"As far as Die Hard movies go this is by far the weakest of all the installments. Live Free or Die Hard while it didn't really feel like a Die Hard movie that much as the original 3, still was a fairly decent movie. But Die Hard 5 aka A Good Day to Die Hard it seems like Bruce Willis is just doing it to cash a pay check. And in the last movie when they introduced the Lucy McClane character they actually made it some decent amount of character development in her small amount of screen time. In this movie Jai Courtney does a down right terrible job as being the heir to the McClane kick butt business. It definitely doesn't help matters that this movie is only 1 hour and 40 minutes long while all previous installments were at least 2 full hours long. And the bad guys were as 2 dimensional of characters as you could get. In the previous movies you always had great bad guys to give McClane trouble, in this movie you have a cartoon character who easily gets dispatched before the guy who you thought was a good guy ends up as the real bad guy. This is like the producers said to themselves, ""What's the least amount of effort can we put into making a Die Hard movie and it still earning a profit?"". Well I think we found our answer to that question.",A Good Day to Die Hard
116,dfa120374,McClane's Up To His Neck....Again,5,14 January 2015,"John McClane finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time yet again, and this time he's in Moscow where he's travelled to try and help his troubled son, Jack, but inadvertently ends up getting drawn into a world of espionage & terrorists.For me there are two types of action films...ones where the plot is thin and the movie relies more heavily on great action to carry it along, and ones that do have a great story to go along with the great action. A Good Day To Die Hard falls into the former category because story-wise it's thinner than Posh Spice on the Atkins Diet Plan, and even for an action movie is pretty unbelievable.The main part that was unrealistic for me was the way McClane just jumps right into helping his son as if he's been working the mission in the film himself. That's not really the only unrealistic part, but I don't want to ruin it.There are the usual McClane one-liners throughout the movie that we have become accustomed to also, but even these are pretty lame this time round.The action in the movie is great even if a lot of it is CGI. I know that CGI/green/blue screens were obviously used in the other movies as well, but for those ones (mainly the first three) they didn't seem to be heavily relied upon and the action and stunts all seemed more genuine so to speak. This time the use of CGI just makes some of the action scenes less believable even for an action movie (like the McClane's falling story's through glass roofs & floors and being able to walk away after landing).Now, my review may seem overly critical whilst still giving the movie 5 stars. I gave it 5 purely because of the action as a lot of it really is fantastically done regardless of it being CGI. Other than that, this is a very average action flick.Lastly, I've seen that yet another film in the series has been announced so it looks like the world's unluckiest cop is about to have another wayward adventure.Yippeekiyay.",A Good Day to Die Hard
117,cinematic_aficionado,Sequels that are hard to die...,5,14 February 2013,"25 years ago it was a tower in Los Angeles, today it was the whole of Moscow.In the absence of a plot/structure/storyline the film moves along amongst some basic dialogue involving a reconnection between a father and a son and what the dialogue does not provide us, we are provided by a series of action scenes that tread between the impossible and the offensive.The first 'Die Hard' was superb, so what is the point of this? No viewing value, little supply of entertainment with that being swallowed by exaggerated action scenes and the character we once loved, John McLane, is simply a puppet; no charm or substance in him.As it happened recently with releases from Stallone and Schwarzenegger, even Tom Cruise, action actors can only do one kind of movies: action. As long as they work out to look youthful and not act their age, pulling masses of audiences from early teens to early twenties the studios will continue to make them and who gives a damn about substance?",A Good Day to Die Hard
118,billygoat1071,Jumbo Blockbuster,4,15 February 2013,"A Good Day To Die Hard basically tries to be the largest part of the series. It takes place in Russia with large vehicles, bigger guns, and bigger explosion. It could have been a simple fun throwback for John McClane to play around, but put aside these action sequences, we get an uninteresting plot and a set of forgettable characters. It's pretty unusual for a Die Hard film. It mostly forgets the magic of the series and instead turning this into a typical modern blockbuster where things are only interested in being loud and nothing else. It's still enjoyable to see Bruce Willis shooting and beating up bad guys with his charisma. In the end, it's just another blockbuster using an iconic action hero with a quite large scale.The plot is palpably unappealing, though it doesn't matter as long as it's as fun as the previous installments. Unfortunately, it isn't. The whole film may be surrounded by largely destructive action scenes, but when it tells the story it suffers a problematic and inert premise and stuck with a troubled relationship between John and Jack. The film is also a victim of a classic action sequel cliché like Indiana Jones, The Mummy, Star Trek, Tron etc. that reveals the unspoken son of the action hero. The problem of this element is the lack of likeness between the personalities of the two. Jack is only labeled as John McClane's son.The characters are surprisingly bland. Die Hard characters, especially the villains, usually share some charisma with John McClane but here they are just a bunch of idiots causing a lot of damage because they had to so it can be interesting, but they end up being annoying instead. Extremely annoying, the villains can be much worse than the villains in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. Though MI4 is a well crafted entertainment and has a well told story to cover up those flaws. John McClane here seems to reduce his humanity and mostly treats himself as a joke. Bruce Willis still got it but the script turned him into an insane and generic action hero. Jai Courtney is fine but he could have shared some of the young McClane's personalities so he we may feel that he is really his son.The action scenes are exciting at least. McClane wrecking the entire street and smashing and crashing several cars and trucks. It's an undeniably large over the top crazy sequence. Then there are more shooting, destroying, crashing, CGI, and explosions. It's best when it stays that way, pleasuring the audience with a lot of decent action set pieces no matter how absurd it gets. Another great thing is it's short so we may not linger to this terribly told storyline unless it spends more of the time developing the plot and the characters, but it's too late for that.A Good Day To Die Hard is a gigantic mediocre mess. It probably only exists to set up a new generation for a younger action hero to take over the franchise. But after all of those attempts of giving these icons a son for a replacement's sake, I don't think it will ever work. These kids are nothing like their fathers and doesn't show anything interesting about themselves. They are only awesome because their daddies were awesome, but you'll suddenly realize they are just lackluster action hero cookie-cutters. Sadly, even the hero himself is becoming a generic nut that makes you want to let the old man finally live in a retirement home. The action may be big, decent, and fun but there is nothing else in the end. Die Hard is now a victim of these disposable sequels. It may be huge in scale but it is also huge in disappointments.",A Good Day to Die Hard
119,Rickting,The most disappointing film of the year,2,5 January 2014,"I am a massive fan of the Die Hard movies and I consider them to the best action franchise of all time. In the 5th instalment, John McClane goes abroad to Russia to help his son and ends up fighting loads of Russian bad guys who are trying to do...something to do with nuclear stuff. The most puzzling thing about Die hard 5 is why no earth was it handed to a terrible director and a writer who has never written a well received movie? Why? Easily the most heartbreakingly disappointing movie of 2013, this is a disgrace to the franchise. Bruce Willis is still fun as the main character and the movie will provide action thrills to the least demanding moviegoers. The positives stop there. This is a mind numbingly tedious, noisy, visually ugly and mindless mish mash of action clichés, explosions, father and son bonding, tap dancing, helicopters and noise with about as much soul as a Resident Evil zombie which represents everything that can go wrong with an action film.Aside from Willis, the acting is awful with Jai Courtney giving an incredibly lacklustre performance as John's son and the villains having no menace at all. The script is painful, and only has 2 good lines in the whole thing. Does the writer think John McClane yelling ""I'm on vacation"" repeatedly when he's not even on vacation is funny? As for the director, he seems to think random zooming, fast editing and boring slow-mo make an action film exciting. I've had the misfortune to see this twice, and it got even worse on a second viewing. Easily the most disappointing film of the year and the second worst, this shows maybe Die Hard movies should just stop getting made. No excitement, no plot, no emotion, no intelligence of any kind. I hate this movie.2/10",A Good Day to Die Hard
120,TheSquiss,"Very noisy, requiring little thought and yet another Die Hard too far!",3,6 March 2013,"If you've seen the previous four Die Hard films, you'll know exactly what to expect. If you haven't, there's little point in sitting through A Good Day to Die Hard aka Die Hard 5 aka Another Die Hard Too Far.It's more convoluted than even Live Free or Die Hard, there's less cohesion, plot or logic than any of them and it's brasher and louder than all of them put together. If you like your action flicks VERY NOISY and requiring little thought (as opposed to the very-noisy-and-requiring-no-thought option offered by Dredd) then this might be for you. But why bother when there are far more enjoyable, intelligible action films out there? Bruce Willis is McClane. Same as he ever was. Only this time he's in Russia to patch things up with his son, Jack (Jai Courtney), having parted on bad terms and not spoken in yonks. Jack turns out to be working for the CIA and there's the small matter of a world-threatening nuclear weapons heist. All fairly standard Die Hard fare but with an unwelcome dollop of cheesy family relations thrown in.Quick tip: If you want to rebuild your relationship with your kids, go on a very loud killing spree and destroy as much of your chosen city as possible. Apparently it works a treat.Ho hum.There's not really a lot of 'acting' on display to comment on. Everybody on screen shouts with enough conviction to make themselves heard and, sometimes, understood.Oh, and there's a girl in it.Director John Moore, on this evidence still deaf from shooting Max Payne, glances occasionally at the script but focuses almost entirely on the action, much of which makes no sense and is just a variation of what went before. However, he fills the first quarter of A Good Day to Die Hard with the mother of all car chases that, in the real world, would have generated an insurance bill of millions and sent all involved to prison for several lifetimes. But sometimes you can have too much of a good thing and Moore steers us away from the world of thrills into tediumville.All that and nary a yippee ki-yay motherf***** in sight!",A Good Day to Die Hard
121,richieandsam,"The worst one in the series, but still entertaining.",6,5 June 2013,"A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARDIt was good, but not as good as the others in the series.I am a Die Hard fan and love the first 3 movies so much. Die Hard 4.0 was also very good, but just didn't feel the same to me as the others... and this one is pretty much the same.The film is full of action which is great. It would not be a Die Hard movie without the explosions and the gun fights. And there are plenty of them.The story is OK... some of it was very predictable, but there were a couple of twists I didn't see coming.The casting was not bad either. Bruce Willis returns as John McClane. He does an alright job, but I felt that some of the scenes he struggled with. He just shouldn't play a caring person in these films. The thing I love about John is he has a temper... in this he has a bit of a temper, but not the same as before. I also felt that the scene in the movie where he tells his son he loves him was very uncomfortable. I know it was meant to be an awkward moment, but both actors really didn't look like they were finding it easy... but then maybe that was meant to be like that. The 2 characters do have a very complicated relationship. Johns son was played by Jai Courtney. Jai did a good job mostly. I didn't like his character much through the first half of the movie... but he grows on you towards the end. Jai played the part well.The explosions were pretty good most of the time. There were a few over the top crashes etc... but we also had that in DH4.0.There were some comedy moments in it... mostly from Bruce and his dialogue. He keeps saying he is on vacation whilst shooting a gun which I think gets over said... but on the bright side, he does say ""Yippie- kai-yay mother f*****""... he had to say it really though, didn't he? :)I will give this film 6 out of 10.It was good, but I was hoping for more. I just hope that Bruce hangs up the vest now. We have had enough Die Hard.

122,Al_The_Strange,"""We're not a hugging family.""",6,26 February 2013,"In the beginning, John McClaine was just an average guy, an off-duty cop caught up in a crazy situation that just got worse and worse. And that's pretty much the story of his life, but each new movie in the Die Hard series tried so hard to one-up their respective predecessors. It was originally just McClaine stuck in a single building, taking out bad guys one by one. Then they took it to the airport. Then they took it to an entire city. Then they endangered an entire nation. So naturally, the only thing left is the world itself.This fifth film in the series takes John McClaine to Russia, to deal with his son. Then everything hits the fan, and action ensues. When the action hits, it's incredibly loud and hard-hitting. In the first act, there's a car chase that's just loaded with cars flipping, flying, smashing, and crashing all over the place; the mass carnage is incredible. Plenty of shootouts and fights follow that. It ultimately leads to a final showdown at the end, featuring some of the most beautiful (and gratuitous) slow-motion explosions and window-breaking stunts ever filmed in an action movie.However, the action is also quite rough, thanks to frequent use of a bouncy camera work and choppy editing. As great as the car chase is, I couldn't help but to feel a little lost, since the film seemed to string endless crashes and explosions together without showing the actual geography or progression of the chase.Similarly, I was also a little lost with the plot, at least in the beginning. The story has some twists that makes things clearer toward the end, but it's still a very incredulous story with massive plot holes that suck up all the logic. The best that can be said is that the film tries so hard to bring John McClaine back into the spotlight, and develop some chemistry with his son, which not only makes for some of the film's more amusing moments, but also sets things up for a potential ""next generation"" of Die Hard. You know, the same kind of stuff they tried to do with Indiana Jones 4. I was also pleased to see some definite nods to the original Die Hard film; you'll know them when you see them.As mentioned above, the film looks really rough with the camera-work and editing, and it can be nerve-wracking. I couldn't shake the feeling that this film is basically more of the same as most other action films of today, thanks to this erratic style. Acting is fine and dandy: Bruce Willis started off pretty dry, but eventually tapped into that playful John McClaine energy as he went along, and turned out to be a fun watch. Everybody else fulfills their roles fine enough. Writing has a few bright spots. This production has fine and dandy sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is alright; expect to hear the same kind of tune as the first film.Best recommended for die-hard Die Hard fans, and action junkies.3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Marginal | Film: Marginal)",A Good Day to Die Hard

This time, it has the feel of a James Bond movie, but done à la John McClane.In this piece, they explored the relationship between John and his son, and I was surprised by the result. It's not as one-liner riddled as I thought, and it has some nice depth.Bruce Willis is still true to his character and plays it with the same flair. Jai Courtney give a good performance even if it's a simplistic cookie cutter sample of a basic action hero easily fooled for his goodness.What I don't understand is that in the version I saw, they cut out the biker chick stripping... Drat. Other than that, it's the blow up the bad guys kind of flick with a few nice twist. If the story had just been a little bit less linear, I would have given a better rating.The biggest problem, is that even disregarding the impossibility of the action scenes, there's a few of scientific flaws you have to overlook to appreciate the film. It was annoying during the last third of the story, but I got over it.Expect some good action entertainment, a bunch of quips, and you'll be satisfied.",A Good Day to Die Hard

126,lagudafuad,McClane is not so cool in Russia,4,3 March 2013,"A Good Day to Die Hard must have been to the producers an idea that was going to be great, as anyone will think: what is better than McClane our lone hero going after bad guys? Well the producers thought, ""Two McClane's going after bad guys"". The sad part is that the movie plot is so lame, stupid and out of place. The two didn't look like heroes going through hell and doing the impossible (McClane style) to kill the bad guys, it ended up looking like two Looney Toons characters surviving impossible incidents, like falling off a skyscraper and surviving truck crashes and chases not to mention gas explosions, that I was wondering what the director must have been thinking.John Moore the director and Skip Woods the screenplay writer put our favorite hero in an unfamiliar environment ""Russia"", where he is but a stranger. Bruce Willis reprises the lead role of John McClane, who goes to Russia on an idea to help his estranged son, Jack (Jai Courtney) out of prison. On getting to Russia McClane discovers that there is more to his soon being in prison than he was led to believe, and soon he is caught in the crossfire of a terrorist plot.So he went all Yippee kai yay, Looney Toons style in Russia.The cinematography is below average the whole action and directing scenes are too far-fetched to even pass as a A-Movie production and place you the viewer in an uncomfortable position as you are forced to take it all in as you are eager to hear McClane say, ""Yippee kai yay, motherfu@#er"".The movie did have a twist that I have to say I didn't expect, but that was not enough to save the film. This movie is shortest of all the Die Hard movies and if like me you remember our lone cowboy like hero running around barefooted and single handedly bringing down the formidable Hans Gruber and his crew in the first movie. Or him doing the impossible to land planes in the Second, or taking on Simon Gruber the bomb expert terrorist with Jackson in the Third and facing the McClane's second toughest villain in Timothy Olyphant in the Fourth; then you will hate this weakling cowardly bad guy in this movie and probably the movie itself.After Expendables 2 (2012) our old heroes decided to make a comeback, Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Last Stand (2013) (rated 6/10 on this site) and Sylvester Stallone in Bullet to the Head (2013) (rated 4/10 on this site) and many like me looked forward to seeing this films, so now that I have, only Schwarzenegger's movie is worth applauding.This last Die Hard addition is poor and it is nothing compared to the others, and only John McClane fans can survive watching it.www.lagsreviews.com",A Good Day to Die Hard

128,Cinemaniac1984,A great franchise dies hard with this uninspiring and disappointing sequel.,4,6 February 2015,"What on earth have they done to the Die Hard franchise with A Good Day to Die Hard?! There are so many things wrong here. The intelligent stories and cracking thrilling action of the previous movies have been reduced to purely nonsensical popcorn action that largely ignores the plot. Bruce Willis' iconic role as the wisecracking and tenacious John McClane has been reduced to a cantankerous old (super)man who surely must consider retirement. The villains are nothing more than cardboard cutout characters who would not look out of place in a video game. And John McClane's sidekick in this movie which is his son Jack McClane is more of a lead action hero that could give 24's Jack Bauer a run for his money and John McClane was reduced to second fiddle. The trademarked Die Hard humour that everybody knows and loves is barely sighted and any attempt at humour is not even the slightest bit funny. Even when the original trailers were released I had a bad feeling that A Good Day to Die Hard was going to be average at best which showed bad signs for the franchise.NYPD Police Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) heads over to Moscow, Russia when he receives news that his son Jack McClane (Jai Courtney) is arrested in Russia after a failed assassination attempt. When John McClane reaches the court house, at the same time, several henchmen sent by Viktor Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov) detonate bombs outside the courthouse as a diversion in an attempt to kill Jack McClane and another prisoner Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch). What ensues is a large action sequence in which father and son finally meet in unceremonious circumstances and a nonsensical large scale car case through the streets of Moscow occurs, along with John McClane's new catch phrase exasperatingly yelling, ""I'm on vacation!"" Afterwards, we learn that Jack McClane is really a CIA Agent tasked to bring down Victor Chagarin, and father and son must put their differences aside to take Chagarin down and battle the Russian underworld.First and foremost, A Good Day to Die Hard does not feel like a Die Hard movie. It wouldn't even be a story fitting for 24. It felt like more of an action movie that just added John McClane and the Die Hard name to make it a Die Hard movie. Seriously, this is a major kick in the teeth for the Die Hard franchise.As mentioned before, it felt that John McClane was reduced to a sidekick role and Jai Courtney's character Jack McClane was the main character. What on earth happened to John McClane?! He's meant to be the iconic all-American hero that everyone likes to see kick butt on screen. He looked very out of place plus it seemed that he was just been dragged everywhere. I couldn't fault Australian actor Jai Courtney as Jack McClane. His character would have been a lot better in a stand alone action movie. If this was going to be a passing of the torch between father and son, that idea definitely died hard along with any hopes for a further sequel.The rest of the cast I didn't really care for much and the villains do not hold a candle to any of the great villains from the previous Die Hard movies such as Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber, Alexander Godunov as Karl, William Sadler's Colonel Stuart, John Amos' Major Grant, Franco Nero's General Ramon Esperanza, Jeremy Irons' Simon, and Timothy Olyphant's Thomas Gabriel. Here in A Good to Day to Die Hard, there were at least three different villains which keep you wondering who is that main bad guy. For crying out loud, one job, pick a main villain and stick to it. That is one of the many reason why A Good Day to Die Hard fails miserably here.Director John Moore (Behind Enemy Lines, Max Payne) and screenwriter Skip Woods (The A-Team, Swordfish) should give themselves a well deserved uppercut for butchering the Die Hard franchise with this below average excuse of a movie. The direction and story is lazy and very sloppy. All of the action sequences seemed to be ridiculously overblown and well out of place for this movie. It seemed like they were just thrown into the story to make it look grand. That well and truly failed here. With every single previous Die Hard movie, the action fits very neatly with the story. One positive with A Good Day to Die Hard, nothing was watered down compared to Die Hard 4.0 and the famous catchphrase ""Yippi-kai-yai motherf....."" is uncut as it bloody well should be.A Good Day to Die Hard is mercifully short with a running time of 97 minutes, the shortest of all the Die Hard movies which all ran with an average running time of 2 hours.A Good Day to Die Hard was certainly the worst of the Die Hard series. It is highly doubtful that there will be a sixth Die Hard movie despite various rumours. The spirit of a great franchise died hard with the uninspiring and disappointing sequel. The whole movie went against everything the Die Hard movies are famous for and this uninspired sequel does not end the legacy with a bang. Sadly, now is a good time for the Die Hard franchise to call it a day. 4/10.",A Good Day to Die Hard

130,pfgpowell-1,"Solely one for boys who love big bangs, but even they are being short-changed",4,20 January 2020,"I have to confess that I didn't make it to the end of A Good Day To Die Hard. This is solely one for boys (and some girls) who like toys, big bangs, dislike dialogue and were happiest in primary school. Of its kind - genus mindless blockbuster - it might seem exemplary, even here it cheats. The first set-piece car chase goes on for far, far too long and must be filed under 'padding out the film'.The usual ultra-fast cutting from scene to scene ensures you don't have a clue as to what is going on during the chase, and even the most simple-minded will have wondered 'they couldn't have done that, surely not?', but they did and do, time and time again, destroying most of the traffic on the Budapest ring-road (Budapest standing in for Moscow which wisely decided to have nothing to do with this rubbish). I also found myself, rather bored with all the chasing, wondering just how many cars were smashed up and marvelling at the budgets this kind of film gets.But I persevered and only gave up after the scene in which Jai Courtney, the CIA agent outwitting the Russians at every turn (now there's a marvellous fictional twist) conveniently goes off somewhere to do whatever, allowing his dad Bruce Willis to confess to the nominal third character (Sebastian Koch) that he had been a bad dad, always working when he should have been at home with his wife and family.Equally conveniently son returns just in time to overhear, unseen by dad, what dad says. Thus a second dimension is added to the film: sentimental garbage, and all the little boys watching can persuade themselves that it is all right to be in touch with your emotions.Then I gave up: I had no idea what was going on and who the baddies were. Introducing Courtney as the second lead had a practical reason, too. It meant Bruce Willis, who must by now be be getting on a bit and feeling the strain, has to do none of the macho gymnastics and performs throughout either standing still or at a slow walk.Oh, and this is the kind of film where Willis can, from nowhere, suddenly have to hand when he needs one a high-velocity, ultra-powerful, machine rifle (forgive me, lads, if I don't know the jargon) and can hijack a van or SUV with no hassle at all. Yes, it's that complex.Oddly enough I am giving this a 4 rather than anything lower because the male toddlers for whom this is intended will most certainly love the flash, bang and wallop, but no higher because even they are being sold more than just a tad short.",A Good Day to Die Hard

132,p-jonsson,What idiot wrote this script?,4,7 July 2013,"My god what a disappointment! The original movie had a script worth  watching and some good action and special effects. This one, well this  was a typical Hollywood script written by someone who either was  incredibly stupid or just too arrogant to care. It is a script that I  would expect from a SyFy channel production.  There was absolutely nothing that made sense in this script. The actual  plot about Chernobyl that was ludicrous to say the least. I'm sure the  special effects guys had a great day doing the car chase at the  beginning but it was just exaggerated and silly to watch. Obviously  there are no cops or anything in Moscow since they could drive around  smashing cars forever without anyone seeming to care. They walk into  Chernobyl and sprays some magic fluid onto the highly radioactive place  and voilà, the radioactivity is gone and they can take of their  protective suits. What a load of bull! They steal a car and drive to  Chernobyl (which is around 1000 kilometres away and the roads in Russia  are NOT western highway standard) and they still manage to get there in  time to catch the bad guys who are in choppers. Not to mention the fact  that they actually get near the place without being stopped. I can go  on with this but it is only more and more depressing.  Oh, my favourite (sarcasm), Switzerland have obviously invaded France  since Grenoble is now in Switzerland. Funny that I, who lives a couple  of hours drive from Grenoble, have not heard about this. That is just  so typical American script writer who have never set foot  outside of Hollywood. Maybe it was supposed to be funny but I honestly  do not think so and in any case, it was not funny.  The only reason this movie gets is because the special effects are  indeed impressive if you can push yourself to look past the  ludicrousness of them and it is Bruce Willis after all. It is a shame  that they obviously handed the franchise over to some idiot(s) that  obviously where utterly incompetent at what they were doing.",A Good Day to Die Hard
133,johnnymacbest,"I kept an open mind, but so much was left to be desired.",5,14 February 2013,"In the early '80s and '90s, the ""Die Hard"" series of films were all about entertainment. Sure it's not a thought-provoking piece of art, but it's art done with class, integrity and art; these films were made at a time when action films were..actually..action films. They had no quick-style MTV editing that tries to pass itself off as ""action"", they were done with pure and honest craftsmanship with stunt men willing to put it all out for all to see. And for that aspect alone, they did a commendable job.So now I look at A Good Day to Die Hard, with all the trappings that action films are known for and ostentatious hijinks that scream Michael Bay-esque action that reeks of his earlier films to date.Bruce Willis plays McClane to a hilt, but that's all there is. No heartwarming moments, no instances of morality, no deep insights into why he kills his enemies, John McClane is just that. John McClane. A bravado of words and action that homages the earlier films.The movie at times tries to be gritty and funny at the same time, but with such an inane screenplay and unfunny jokes, it becomes quite apparent that this film was simply not meant to continue the series. To try to adapt an relic of the '80s and '90s into a modern context with current technology, doesn't work anymore. The only exception to this is Rambo, where he was fighting against a brutal regime in Southeast Asia. It worked because the setting was raw in it's brutal intensity; plus Rambo is a timeless hero and much more plausible. John McClane is just a beefed-up Jack Bauer without the hero's legendary outbursts of anger when something goes wrong or impedes him from saving the day. Not once is there a chance for the viewer to root for McClane. He remains lifeless and stiff; the very opposite of his portrayal in the earlier films.In an attempt to distance itself from its PG-13 predecessor, the film makers decided to make this film rated R. Yet it hardly saved the film from it's mediocre direction. I suspect this was due to the large backlash from audiences of Live Free or Die Hard, a film that was only a Die Hard film in name only, not a ""true"" Die Hard film, which is evident in the director's inability to handle the material.I tried to keep an open mind, after the execrable LFODH, but after this, I hope Bruce and co. just hang up the wife beater for the final time. No more. John McClane is a hero of the past and should be left there for all time's sake.",A Good Day to Die Hard
134,Magow-Intermean,A Good Day To Die Hard Review,7,30 March 2019,"John McClane (Willis) goes to Moscow when his son is arrested for murder, only to discover that Jack (Courtney) is a CIA agent on an undercover mission. The McClanes go on the run in Russia, pursued by ruthless enemies.The odds against Anything 5 being outstanding are fairly steep, and while he's overcome worse in the past, John McClane doesn't beat them. A Good Day To Die Hard also suffers from being the second footnote to a cycle which the first three Die Hards satisfactorily wrapped up into a trilogy.Director John Moore, whose CV is littered with remakes (The Omen) and game adaptations (Max Payne), has a slight edge on Die Hard 4.0's Len Wiseman, and CGI augmentation of the explosions and stunts is less clunky this time round, but a trip outside the US does the franchise few favours.Post-Cold War jokes like ""It's not 1986 any more"" fall flat while the McClanes embody US foreign policy by going abroad to ""kill all the scumbags"", though it turns out they don't know who the real scumbags are. It's not as if Russia were underexposed in action movies - the chases through a wintery, traffic-clogged Moscow have a Pierce Brosnan Bond feel and the helicopter-bothered climax makes less effective use of a recreation of the city of Chernobyl than the minimally-budgeted Chernobyl Diaries did.Besides the flagging enthusiasm of star Bruce Willis as he suffers the same for the fifth time, this is handicapped by a misunderstanding of what made the first three work. The traditional Die Hard supporting characters of imperiled family member and action sidekick are combined to partner up McClane with his secret agent son, and Jai Courtney (the hitman from Jack Reacher) dutifully matches Willis in grumbly demeanour, while plot twists and shoot-outs are punctuated with whiny father-son bonding it's impossible to care about.The key relationship in Die Hard (reprised in 3 and bungled in 4) was between lo-tech McClane and a witty, ingenious, well-resourced nemesis - but the baddies here are rote scowling Russians with little screen presence, with a few key moments of violence noticeably trimmed to secure a 12A certificate.A few reasonable action sequences are mired in family soap, making this A Good Day To Call It Quits.",A Good Day to Die Hard
135,kgprophet,"Taints the Franchise like ""Alien Vs. Predator""",4,8 September 2013,"This is clearly not an earnest attempt to keep the tent pole status of the beloved Die Hard mantra. It would have been a grudgingly acceptable sequel if it were not for the grossly under-cooked script. I remember with satisfaction after DH2 the preference to shelve another sequel until a proper script came along. If they had not wisely taken that route, then Die Hard 3 would have been the wretched ""Speed"" sequel where a cruise ship was taken over by terrorists. Or some other incarnation that would have been proved to be half-baked and ultimately dull and unworthy of the designation ""Die Hard"" instead of just another indistinguishable Bruce Willis action vehicle.This film resembles the ""Alien vs. Predator"" franchise spin off. James Cameron wiped his hands of the idea because he said it would cheapen the whole franchise. Which is exactly what happened. Budgets and inspiration were low, so box office returns disappointed. Then the vicious circle begins where each subsequent sequel justifies a smaller budget for a dwindling audience until it becomes a mockery of what it once was.I recently viewed an episode of the excellent ""Ben Stiller Show"" where it imagined a Die Hard 12. Already we are wondering how long the same premise can be perpetuated. (How can the same thing happen to one guy 5 times?). Sorely missing this time is the wit that helped make you smile along the way as the action scenes were carried out. In this script, wit is mistaken for just plain silly lines being uttered in reaction to a jab made by one side or the other.Then there is the co-lead in this film Jai Courtney. Good looking and competent acting, but again stifled by poor dialogue. The son aspect I suppose is inevitable (see Indy 4), but there is no great chemistry or playing off each other's character like Samuel Jackson in DH3. The biggest problem on reflection is that there were always moments in the Diehards 1 - 3 where there was palpable terror. DH1 where McClane gives Gruber the gun when he thinks Gruber is a hostage. DH2 where when the first plane explodes. DH3 when the subway car crashes at the station. Here it is a convoluted way-over-the-top action orgy, that there is no sense of peril. Actually the staging of the action scenes are done competently, but the same cannot be said of the dialogue scenes.",A Good Day to Die Hard
136,dvc5159,What on earth have they done to John McClane?!,3,14 February 2013,"I am heartbroken.It's a sad day to say this, but it has to be said: ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a dud. The fifth instalment in the beloved ""Die Hard"" saga ends up as the worst of the series so far; it falters thanks to a weak characterization, even weaker screen writing, lack of worthy villains, absurd action sequences and incoherent direction. You can bet this movie will be mentioned in the same sentence with ""Rocky V"", ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"", ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"", ""Die Another Day"" and ""Batman & Robin"". Not even the R-rating and the return of the famous ""Yippie ki yay"" line in full can save this one.As much as I love action movies, I like mine with a side of plot and character, of which this film fails at. John McClane, one of my favorite film characters of all time, is given a horrendous treatment no beloved character should ever be given: relegated to a sidekick. This is HIS movie, not his son's! From the start he is inexplicably thrust into Russia with no back story of how the previous films over the years have shaped his character now - a key trait that was visible in the previous four films. He is reduced to a wise-cracking action supercop, and even his wisecracks are weak. However, Bruce Willis, bless him, is still McClane without a doubt, as he dishes out the bad guys with weathered-out cynicism in his eyes. He still has it in him, and in no way it is his fault that this movie turned out to be near-crap.Rather, writer Skip Woods and director John Moore are to blame. Woods clearly missed the whole point of McClane's essence and likability - he is a vulnerable human - an everyday Joe who only stops the bad guys when ""there's no one else that can do it"". He is a reluctant hero in the first four films, he can get seriously wounded, as he is up against worthy adversaries that are cool, calculative and almost one step ahead of him. Here, McClane, in the opening car chase, and immediately causes mass vehicular damage just to stop thugs from attacking his son, shows no signs of vulnerability (after TWO major car crashes), and has no qualms about killing the bad guys wherever they pop up here. His son Jack (Jai Courtney), filling in for McClane's sidekick, has certain charisma and shows a few glimpses of character development in McClane but it is cut short by the merciless and absurd action sequences.A good action movie has to have a good villain. ""Die Hard 5"" has none. It has three primary villains, all of them forgettable. Nothing with the likes of even Thomas Gabriel or Colonel Stuart (the Gruber Brothers must be smirking right now in hell). They're not intelligent, not menacing, not memorable. They're just dumb, die, and that's it. What was their evil plot? What dastardly deeds do they have? Weapons dealing. Oh the humanity!The film runs at 97 minutes - the shortest in the series. Why the film was released at this length I don't want to know. Nobody complained about the 2 hour running time for each of the previous four movies. Imagine what a better movie this could've been with those cut scenes added back in.John Moore directs with the subtlety of a car crash. He smash cuts every scene, puts heavy use of slow motion in the excruciatingly absurd climax, and relies heavily on CGI for most of the action sequences. But like all Die Hard movies, there has to be at least one sensational action sequence, and that is at the film's beginning. The only thing I really enjoyed (in a guilty pleasure sort of way) about the whole movie was a massive, destructive stunt-filled car chase throughout the streets of Moscow. It was an intense and exciting scene. Pity the rest of the movie can't hold up to this sensational chase scene alone, especially the end which essentially turns McClane into The Terminator. If you think the F-35 scene in ""Die Hard 4"" was absurd, hoo boy, wait until you get a load of this one.At the very least, there's some competent cinematography from Jonathan Sela and a good, riveting music score from Marco Beltrami, who really knows his stuff when it comes to action, as well as incorporating Michael Kamen's themes into this one. If anything, the music is better than the movie.There is a 6th (and according to Bruce, final) movie in the works. Here's a no brainer - bring back John McTiernan or Renny Harlin (hell, even Len Wiseman for all I care), and hire a good screenwriter who really delivers the old school action goods. I strongly believe Bruce and McClane can deliver the goods still and ride off into the sunset, instead of falling off his horse here. They just need a better story, better direction, and a more than worthy villain with a respected British actor in the role. The franchise doesn't deserve to die with this. It's too good for that.Shame on you, John Moore and Skip Woods.",A Good Day to Die Hard
137,TheHonestCritic,"Any day is a good day to skip this ""movie""!",2,12 December 2020,"""A Good Day to Die Hard"" (2013), well, that's 97 minutes of my life I will never get back. At 97 minutes, this is the shortest film in the ""Die Hard"" franchise, and thank God for that! This ""movie"" has a dumb convoluted story, overall terrible acting, generic special effects, dull sets/locations, and a clichéd soundtrack to try and hold this diarrhea stain together. The basic storyline is, John McClane heads to Russia to try and get his son Jack out of prison. Gee, I wonder where I saw that before? *Cough ""Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol"" (2011) cough*. Seriously, breaking someone out of a Russian prison is in that movie. There's ripping off a story, then there's just pure laziness. The script for ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is the epitome of both, a lazy ripoff. We haven't even got started with the real plot, or some resemblance thereof! The storyline is that John McClane gets caught in the crossfire of a global terrorist threat, (yep, we're once again dealing with terrorists). Can't the screenwriters come up with something other than terrorists for this film series?! I mean, my God, how did this writer get a job in the movie industry? The rest of the story goes, or rather limps down the same clichéd layout as you'd most likely expect. John McClane gets beat up over and over again, and at the very last second, he uses a weapon or tool to kill the villains. The only true saving grace of this ""film"" is that they went back to R rated again. If only it was worth it! Granted, this ""movie"" does have mostly non-stop action, only without the excitement. It's almost like a Michael Bay film with a slightly less amount of explosions! As for the acting, it's just hit and miss once again. The only one who's trying is Bruce Willis. He did the best he could, despite the poorly written script. All the rest of the actors and actresses are standard to just plain horrible! The special effects are mostly well-done, but, there are a few flaws. Those flaws are glaring and are impossible to go without being noticed. The editing in the chase scenes is awful! Film Making 101: when you notice the edits, that's a problem. Editing should not be noticed when you watch a movie or TV show. As for the sets/locations, I was interested to see a movie like this take place in Russia. It's a cool place for a film setting! However, that was a wasted opportunity. The film makers somehow made Russia look dull and boring! How is that possible? Finally, we have the crap on top of the sundae, the soundtrack. In some respects, it's fine and does it's job. But for the most part, it's just predictable and sounds like it's looped in some areas. Talk about lazy editing! ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is, by far, the worst film in the entire ""Die Hard"" franchise. It's so bad, that I actually almost considered it for my top 10 worst movies of all-time list! But, it didn't anger me enough for that list. It's what I expected, after three mediocre films, nothing could possibly save this franchise. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go on IMDB. Ignore the 1 star rating, my true rating is 0 stars. Bottom line, if you're looking to watch decent action films, stay away from the ""Die Hard"" films. With the exception of ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" (1995), this series has absolutely nothing to offer. I'll tell you one thing about this ""movie"", that 97 minutes felt like an eternity! Now that I've finally wrapped up this overall very disappointing and underwhelming film franchise, I have only one thing left to say: ""Yippee-ki-yay!""",A Good Day to Die Hard

The action is all multi-cam quick cuts and the whole thing is a cynical money grab. Almost every line out of Bruce Willis's mouth is ""I'm on vacation"" and from the looks of how bored and miserable he is here, it indeed does look like the producers picked him up from an actual vacation and forced him to work. The script involving McClane's son (he has a son apparently) in an operation in Russia is a flimsy set up to get our miserable hero overseas to cause extreme destruction and behave as jingoistic and obnoxious as possible.

143,WalkdenEntertainment,It's A Good Day To Give Up,5,14 January 2020,"Welcome to the 5th instalment to a series which began back in 1988.This time Police Officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) receives word about his son, Jack, who is in trouble in Russia. John goes to Russia only to find his son Jack (Jai Courtney) is in fact an undercover CIA agent. Both are now on the run and being hunted by a new group of villains, meaning this father and son duo must now get along and work together to survive the day or they will ""Die Hard"".Having been a huge fan of the previous four Die Hard films I remember being rather excited to see this 5th instalment. I felt as a plot it was a nice touch to introduce John McClane's son after the positive introduction of his daughter in the 4th film. However the chemistry between the two includes nothing but arguing and silly talk. During an early scene in the film his son even points a gun at John McClane's
M head, threatening to shoot him. At no point in this film did I find the relationship between the leading male characters believable.John McClane also feels like more of a secondary character this time around and is no longer the leading man. Along with that, the character of John McClane has dramatically changed. He has no compassion nor expresses any real emotion. At one point he punches an innocent man and steals his car during a car chase sequence (what the?!?). To top it off, throughout this film the character yells out ""I'm on vacation"" at least four times.... why? I honestly don't know. I thought he was Russia to save his son, right? Apparently not lol.Like the story, the action had potential. But honestly, for a Die Hard film there isn't much action compared to previous films before this. The action we do get is ruined by the well known shaky camera techniques as well as super quick edits, making the fun moments basically painful to watch because it's impossible to follow what's actually going on.Overall, this is an extremely dissatisfying Die Hard film. There is so much to dislike but my biggest issue with this instalment was that the leading character John McClane has changed so much compared to the previous Die Hard films. The chemistry between the leads is also painful to watch. As for the plot, it's messy, forgettable and weak.

144,trublu215,Really great action sequences...but where's the story?,3,14 June 2013,"A Good Day To Hard is a really great montage of action sequences without any coherent plot line to it. The film suffers from this especially because of the beloved franchise it is unsuccessfully trying to follow. However, I'm trying to grade it as a stand alone film because if the film were not a die hard film then it would not be nearly as disappointing. The film does feature impressive action sequences which turn out to be the highlight of the film instead of a decent story to go along with it. John Moore is the one to blame here, the Skipp Woods penned script does have some very good potential but the film moves too quick especially for a Die Hard film. Overall, the franchise is showing its age with this film but the action sequences are what keeps it above float.",A Good Day to Die Hard
145,doorsscorpywag,Entertainment for Imbiciles,1,23 May 2013,"I loved Die Hard. It's one of the greatest action movies ever. I like Bruce Willis. He is a damn good actor.This film is one of the stupidest movies ever made. John Maclaine wanders into Russia to somehow see his idiot son who is a very bad CIA agent who has been arrested for murder. But of course it's simply a CIA plan to rescue some bloke who has a file on another bloke who America does not like and wants to be brought to book by exposing his nefarious activities in Chernobyl involving weapons grade Uranium.Cue lots of explosions as the other bloke tries to snatch the first bloke by blowing up the courtroom. But then he has never seen a Bruce Willis film.Then we get a really boring and supremely stupid car chase where practically every car in Moscow gets destroyed with only one cop even seeming to notice, before getting shot. Big John even impossibly manages to duck out of the way of an RPG with the truck he is driving. Rescuing his son and the first bloke and discovering it's a CIA rescue. Which goes badly after the CIA handler is shot in the safe house they go to.Then the action moves to a hotel which sees the Bulletproof Two on the verge of being killed but due to the killers dislike of Americans they escape and manage to get out of a hotel being systemically destroyed by a Russian Assault Helicopter which fires very slowly and inaccurately as John and Son hide behind some bullet proof wood panels.The action then moves 400 miles to Chernobyl where two bloodstained Americans driving a stolen car with a boot full of guns have somehow managed to get to at the same time as some heavily armed soldiers who came in helicopters. How the Ukranian border guards missed these two is never explained. Yes Americans Chernobyl is NOT in Russia but in Ukraine, a different country, so surely they would have had to pass a checkpoint and been asked why they had so many guns and were covered in blood.At first entering Chernobyl with protective suits the rescued guy who is now the baddie leads his team to an underground chamber full of Uranium. Then someone looks at a digital Geiger counter which goes from off the scale to safe and suddenly announces it's OK and everybody is down to T Shirts. John and Jnr don't even bother with the suits. Chernobyl is one of the most dangerously radioactive places on Earth yet Maclaine and son have crossed the border and driven there without incident and a crew of mercenaries in helicopters have landed and begin to steal the Uranium. And nobody in Ukraine seems remotely concerned.But never fear after some more shooting and even more ridiculous escapes our Bullet Proof and now Radiation Proof heroes save the day and at the same time even manage to re-bond. God Bless America for saving the world again.I am sure Bruce got paid well for this utter tripe but maybe if he had accepted a little less they might have been able to afford a script writer instead of giving a pen to a monkey and leaving it alone with a few bananas and a notebook and after a couple of hours returning to see the result. The result was 'A Good Day to Die Hard' written by Chuckles the Chimp. Godawful does not even get close to how bad this garbage was.",A Good Day to Die Hard
146,Maleplatypus,An expensive cheap movie,2,11 July 2013,"I must agree with some of the reviewers that this movie is authentically stupid. Nobody needed that and I still went through watching. God will judge me for that. Two American family boys (bullet proof, radiation proof and so on), papa and beloved son, exterminate about a hundred Russians and about a thousand cars in Moscow and destroy everything they touch, and nobody cares. Ain't that something? Well, that's about it in this movie. Body repair shop owners in Moscow never had so much work before and the crew of this sorry excuse for a movie brought them Christmas, although Russians themselves are well known for their ""driving skills"". Lots of action, no substance. Americans always win (except when not, but still...), Russians always lose and there is no our Rade erbedija as a Russian general! Catastrophic omission. As was my chance NOT to watch this. And I blew it. But, I'm not American and I loose. Do not watch this, please. Do not give them justification for making this (very expensive) cheap piece of propaganda action trash. Rent anything else. Anything.",A Good Day to Die Hard
147,martinrobertson300482,"I wanted to ""Die hard!""",1,18 February 2013,"I can no longer stick up for this franchise. I have truthfully liked all off the other ""Diehard"" movies. But like most over milked series, there is a time where enough is enough, and that time with ""Diehard"" is now! (Or rather, a film ago!) John McClanes Terrorist attack number 5 was already pushing it, but when the trailers showed him ""tagging along"" on an adventure following his son, I think the movie was already doomed before I'd even seen it. Still, I gave it the benefit off the doubt, expecting at least an average action flick. I left the cinema probably the most speechless I've ever been over how bad a once cool franchise has become.For starters. Who the hell wants too see a movie following the son off the main character. This movie is actually his gig. Bruce Willis just shows up and joins in. I didn't get what I wanted from a ""Diehard"" movie. This is more off a James Bond movie (Said son works for the CIA or something). I'm all for doing something a bit different with the series. I thought the fourth movie did that well by having the terrorists more technical. But turning it into a spy flick, following a brand new character, set in a different country? What? OK, so I went into the cinema knowing that's the route the film was going to take. But nothing could off prepared me for just how bad the jokes are in the movie, how over the top (yes, even by ""Diehard's"" standards) it is, or how shamelessly it constantly throws in references too the earlier flicks. Reminding me that I'd actually rather be watching one off them. It seemed pretty damn short too. Short, fast paced films always feel like less effort has been put into them, but maybe that's just me.Outside off having some hot chick in it, and the most destructive car chase ever (which only happens in the movie so that they can say they broke some record or something) I cant actually think off any reason why you should watch this. On top off everything else, it'll destroy your memories off a once great series. Beyond disappointed!",A Good Day to Die Hard
148,illbebackreviews,A Good Day For This Franchise to Die Hard,2,13 February 2013,"Now, I'm a fan of the first three movies. I love them really a lot, especially the original but I also love the 3rd installment, mainly due to the chemistry between Jackson and Willis. That was phenomenal. I could not connect with much in the 4th movie as it was a lot of CGI and made John McClane a superhero who seemed invincible. I wasn't setting my standards high for this one at all as I knew what it could turn out to be, but BOY...This movie really is awful This movie is based around John McClane who travels to Russia to deal with his son's issues. There, a whole lot of crap begins to happen. This movie attempts to have such a complex plot for a Die Hard whereas the other four were so simple that even the dumbest person could tell what was happening. Its like this director, the guy who made the god awful Max Payne thought that the plot had to be complex for an action film like Die Hard As a regular movie, this movie may NOT be that bad but as a Die Hard movie, it is god awful. I couldn't bear to watch the pain that I went through in this film, why? Because, almost nothing in this movie resembled anything about Die Hard. There was no tone, no tension and as a result, it felt nothing like Die Hard. NOTHING! The characters really are all awful, with the exception of John McClane who still has a bit of relatability to him. Bruce Willis does a fantastic job in the movie but every other member of the cast really didn't appeal to me. The villain was weak, John's son was uninteresting and a lame addition to the franchise, as if he were there to sell action figures. The story was no fun and the action was all messy This movie does absolutely nothing to resemble the Die Hard films and as such, one of the most anticipated movies of 2013 has fallen down a drain with overuse of CGI, lame characters and plot, uninteresting villain with no real intention and another excuse to make more money out of it.A Good day to Die Hard is a movie that makes you think that this day is a good day for you to die hard. Do not watch it, pointless action movie that does not resemble Die Hard.",A Good Day to Die Hard
149,ghost_dog86,And Bruce Willis collects another paycheck.,3,19 February 2013,"In the final installment of the elderly male action hero trilogy of early 2013 ( The Last Stand, Bullet to the Head, and now this) Bruce Willis' ""A Good Day to Die Hard"", undoubtedly the most anticipated of the three, is also sadly the weakest of the lot. And, while ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is not as bad as the ""Big Momma's House"" father/son sequel from a few years ago, this movie has none of the character development, heart or downright likability of the original ""Die Hard"". But then again, neither did the last four.The Plot: In this installment John McClane (Bruce Willis) in search of his grown and estranged son, Jack, goes to Russia and fights Russians. That's it! And in turn, since the audience is literally dumped into this far too weak storyline with all of 5 seconds of actual setup, the hope that anyone will have any stake in any of these characters as the film progresses down its action movie checklist, is all but obliterated before the first gun is fired.But worse than the plot or all around story construction, is the fact that the main character in this ""Die Hard"" movie isn't even John McClane! It's his son, played by Jai Courtney, who actually gives a better performance than Willis himself. But that isn't saying much, since for much of ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" Willis seems to be phoning his performance in. That said, Willis is relegated to playing a sort of comic relief side character, which is not at all his forte. So, while he does deliver some watered down one liners such as ""I was on vacation"" and ""I was on vacation"", at times the McClane character is written in such a way that fans of these film may wonder if Skip Woods, the writer here, is even familiar with the original source material.Final Thought: It's not as if ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" was offensively bad in any way (much like many critics would have you believe) it's just that stripped away of a few impressive explosive sequences, the characters along with their dialogue are lazily manufactured at best, and the storyline is pretty flat and otherwise boring. Basically, the only reason anyone should see this movie, is if you are a die-hard fan of the ""Die Hard"" franchise. Only then do you deserve to be disappointed like this.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland Follow me on Twitter @moviesmarkus",A Good Day to Die Hard
150,gregeichelberger,A good day to rent the original 'Die Hard',2,15 February 2013,"As far as the fifth installment of a movie franchise, perhaps only the unfilmed Tim Burton ""Batman"" concept could be as pointless and plot less as the newest release from 20th Century-Fox, ""A Good Day To Die Hard,"" which gives new and vivid meaning to the old term, ""Going to well once too often."" At least Burton's movie was never made, which is much better than this latest travesty.What set the first ""Die Hard"" adventure apart back in 1987 was that NYPD cop John McClane (Bruce Willis, from the TV series ""Moonlighting"" and long before he became wildly overexposed) was the wisecracking everyman who happened to be in the wrong place at the right time with a sense of humor, a love for his wife and plenty of righteous indignation.Able to fight off terrorists and a great villain (Alan Rickman),but still vulnerable to pain and injury, he triumphed over the odds and was deservedly cheered for doing so. The decent second act saw him stop a paramilitary group, but by the time ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" rolled around, we were pretty tired of the series already.Part four, while better than the third, reached ludicrous heights with McClane stopping a computer threat to throw the world into chaos. Now, finally, our hero goes international to aid the CIA in thwarting a Russian civil war and attempting to prevent the theft of billions of dollars of hidden uranium.Oh, what's the use of wasting my time and your's explaining even the shallowest of plots in this version which while only 90 minutes long laps itself in the basest stupidity imaginable? In fairness, I would have added that the picture's saving grace was its mercifully short running time, but when I found myself nodding off several times, even that positive was negated.Directed by John Moore (""Behind Enemy Lines,"" ""Max Payne"" - better to have had Dinty Moore at the helm), ""Good Day"" throws us right in the middle of Moscow where McClane's son, John, Jr. (Jai Courtney, who made no impact whatsoever in ""Jack Reacher"") is a held prisoner.Of course, he manages to escape and then an auto chase breaks out - which last a full 15 minutes and is filmed in blurry Confuse-O-Vision before bitter son and bewildered pop join forces to save imprisoned dissident Komarov (Sebastian Koch, a Sadam Hussein stand-in). Later, we learn that the kid works for the CIA, but the current Russian defense minister is after Komarov with heavily-armed goons in tow.Throw in a subplot about Komarov's daughter (who may or may not be what she seems), a secret file, nuclear fallout and a side trip to Chernobyl and not only does this version become the predictable fodder that plagued parts three and four, but it bogs itself down in complete apathy in which no character is likable or memorable or has any chemistry with any other character.With bones thrown to past installments (the ""Yippy-Ki-Yay"" line is forced down our throats) and scenes taken from other action movies like ""The Expendables,"" ""16 Blocks"" and ""True Lies,"" among others, this experience is so devoid of entertainment the producers should pay the audience for watching it. As a requiem mass or memorial service, this should suffice to end and bury the series on as low a note as possible.And while Willis, who survived better, more sinister and threatening bad guys in the first two films, tries his best to be wry and witty, he sleepwalks through this production and the patter's emptiness is palatable. I don't even want to get started on how bad Courtney is here, while the other characters are completely one-dimensional to the point of absurdity.A good day at the theater? I think not. A good day to rent the original ""Die Hard""? Absolutely.",A Good Day to Die Hard
151,nesfilmreviews,Easily the worst chapter in the franchise.,2,28 May 2013,"Making a good action movie is challenging because it requires continuity between the storyline with the action scenes--appearing balanced, maximizing the level of excitement while providing some credibility to the plot. Despite using the formula that has worked so well time and time again, the end result is truly disappointing-- easily the worst installment: loud, mindless, and an utterly uninspiring. The fifth chapter in this on-going franchise is dead on arrival. Bruce Willis returns to his iconic role, (and mind you, he will again), and this time around, McClane is in the wrong place at the wrong time--again--after traveling to Moscow to help his estranged son Jack. Bruce has no idea that Jack is really a highly trained CIA operative, whose mission is to stop a nuclear weapons heist. With the Russian underworld in pursuit, and battling a countdown to war, the two McLane's discover that their opposing methods make them the ultimate two-person army.Willis is not the reason this fails so miserably. A weak script written by Skip Woods containing numerous problems, and poor directing and direction by John Moore (""Max Payne"" (2008), ""The Omen"" (2006)). Woods' limited filmography contains nothing surpassing mediocrity, and this display is further proof of just that. To compound the on-going script issues, the very premise in itself doesn't hold a shred of credibility. There are continuous sequences of explosions, carnage, and utter destruction surrounding the Russian capital, and yet there is never any sign of any law enforcement or government involvement what so ever. It's an action film for sheer entertainment purposes--I get it--and people like explosions, but come on. The chemistry between the characters and story line lacks development due to the limited time to actually speak, and when they do you wish they weren't. What really takes the cake is when John's nemesis Alik (Rasha Bukvic), talks about how he used to be a pretty good tap dancer whom no one appreciated. Ironically, what passes as John McClane's wise cracks is anything but humorous. Most of McLane's lines are in the context of his father-son relationship with Jack (Jai Courtney), but are hardly witty or engaging. They are also frustratingly repetitive, consisting of John lamenting how Jack rarely shows him any respect as a father, or John lamenting how he had expected no more than a vacation in Moscow.Despite the frenetic pacing in a compact 97 minutes-the abundance of action is staged so unimaginatively that it fails to even interest, let alone excite you. A missed opportunity to possibly lead the franchise into a new direction: John passing the baton to his son, a CIA operative is never considered. Ultimately, just another big budget action movie dumped into middle of February that will score big in the box office, and as a result ""A Good Day To Die Hard"" will have another tomorrow.",A Good Day to Die Hard
152,virindra,What...?,6,19 February 2013,"I am not a huge fan of the die hard movies, but I can enjoy a good action movie with a good plot. This one isn't worth to be called a die hard movie. First of all, I knew this McClane character had a daughter, but since when did he have a son? This ""I am not calling you dad but I call you John"" and during the movie they bond together and the son calls his father dad, was not very original. As I recall Willis had that kind of relationship with his actress daughter in Armageddon.The action was good. Not great, not awesome, but good. There was no complex story like Die hard with a vengeance had or the movie after that one. The movie had a slow start and was not all the time very realistic.

It doesn't feel like a die hard film at all. It's all just over the top and a script that feels as if everyone said ""That'll do"" Bruce Willis is a great actor and the character John deserved a better final than this. Its sad that they've cancelled the planned sequel as they have really let the franchise down. This has all the usual effects and action you'd expect from a die hard film but lacks in every other way. His son is a CIA agent and dad comes to save the day.. The end..

All-action, no character, no heart, no soul and incomprehensible dialogue to boot. We really struggled to understand many of the actors' lines. Someone needs to take the writers and directors (and Mr Willis) to a screening of the original and tell them to make notes. The original Die Hard was so good because the action was leavened by character and some clever dialogue, but this one is just relentless action with little understanding of the people involved - sadly this is the way so many action movies are going these days.

Bruce Willis seemed bored with the movie, and the director clearly enjoyed filming him from angles that highlight his wonky nose. 
Don't ask me about the ""plot"": it was a mess I could not untangle, in fact all the characters seemed confused. 
There were a few explosive, exciting cg moments with the usual high-intensity shooting, fighting, things blowing up, flames, foul language, shouting, running, more guns, more obscenities, more bangs, more booms.

He has managed to take all his demons from his past and use them into making himself a celebrated, although conflicted, legend on the force. This time around he is sent to Russia on the advice of his daughter to find and bring home his son who is in trouble and facing imprisonment there. Unknown to him, his son is actually undercover for the CIA and on a mission to extract a very important witness, who has a file that can incriminate a lot of bad Russians. When John and son meet in a middle of a terrorist attack in Moscow, the fun ensues. What is fun about the later films in the Die Hard series are the situations that John runs into. They are like second nature now and he seems to handle them like we would grocery shopping. What I liked about this film is the film-makers match the serious/comedy quotient that was so good in Die Hard 2.

I was afraid of something this when Live Free or Die Hard (Die Hard 4) arrived. That movie exceeded expectations and was quite good. In A Good Day to Die Hard, there are absolutely zero redeeming factors. This was a cash grab through the whole way. Bruce Willis and the rest of the actors were phoning it in. The father-son issues were contrived, the barely there dialogues were woefully groan-worthy, the action is over the top (but not awesome) and they finally did what none of the other Die Hard movies had ever done. They took a great three dimensional character like John Mclane and turned him into a caricature of his old self. They turned him into what everyone who hasn't seen Die Hard view him as.

The movie stays true to the Die Hard form, action the entire movie or twists of knowledge for fill ins. This is a good movie to watch alone. Too much action for socializing.

160,helmutty,Good action-packed entertainment,8,11 February 2013,"The fifth movie in the popular Die Hard franchise. John McClane is back for more thrills and action and this time, it is in Moscow. John Moore directs this action-packed thrilling but generic action movie. In John Moore's filmography, there is nothing that shows him being able to take on a big-budget action movie. However, he did a decent job in ratcheting up mayhem and action in this.The story: It is fairly simple and straight-forward as John McClane goes to Moscow in search for his son, Jack, who is accused as a criminal. However, things is not what they seem to be. It is not long before we see things blown up and a cool car chase which involves Jack, John and the bad guys. From there, the action never stops. There are gun fights and more explosions and an explosive finale in Chernobyl. Sadly, the car chase is the best action scene in the movie and it would be hard to top that. True to that, the other action scenes may be explosive but they are not as thrilling and fun as the car chase. The action is well- executed but the things to look out for is John Moore's slo-mo action. Acting wise is okay. Bruce Willis looks older but he is still as energetic as before. Music is good but generic.Overall: It is worth a watch if you like action-packed movies without much plot. Die Hard fans may be disappointed if they want to see John in full action because in this, it seems that he has taken back seat to allow his son to shine in action.

The wisecracks and humor that are such a large part of the franchise are missing, and those that are there are weak or played out.It's a bad day for a movie series, when it relies too much on nostalgia for the previous movies. I understand including references to the previous movies, such as cracks about Cowboys, or roof top fire hoses, but to add them in willy-nilly to prove that the director/writer has seen the previous movies is cheap and tawdry.There are a few other things that raised my hackles in regards to this movie... Like the use of the shaky cam. The really sad thing is that it wasn't just used in action scenes to force a sense of chaos, but a few times in scenes where they are just walking around.As for the story... It's passable for the most part, but it really relies too much on John McClain trying to be a good father but realizing he failed for most of his son's life. In other words his son hates him. I won't go into too much detail about the various plot twists and turns, but there are a few and they are rather predictable.One line from the movie sums up the feelings for this movie, ""It's always about the money.""",A Good Day to Die Hard
163,kunalkhandwala,Not a good day at all,5,1 March 2013,"A handful of action movie stars define the entire genre. The almost invincible Terminator, Arnold, does not believe in a kick and punch when his stature fires like a tank. Stallone, being Rocky or Rambo can start or end a world war with his aggression. Then there's Bruce Willis, who is more of an average Joe, with a family, a job and the occasional abruptness of a world saving task. He definitely needs a gun and with one, he usually carries a smirk on his face even in the most tense of situations. But he gets the job done, in the nick of time and lives with the hope to do it all again. Somehow, his wish is granted for the 5th time as John McClane but it isn't such a good day to die hard.Each of the major action heroes had a franchise that defined their career. 'Terminator', 'Rocky', 'Rambo' and 'Universal Soldier' defined the character once and then got down straight to business. The Die Hard series has been a different ride. While 'Live free of Die Hard' was a more technological doom for McClane to tackle, it surprised everyone with the pace of its action packed plot. Director John Moore's career has little to brag about and he continues the debacle with McClane's latest adventure in Moscow. While John tries to seek out his son Jack (Jai Courtney), who is caught in a web crafted by a political fallout, he is surprised to see him working as a CIA agent struggling to keep the Russian dissident, Komarov (Sebastian Koch) from falling into the hands of his pursuers led by Sergei Kolesnikov. Their initial chase through Moscow's streets and an explosive showdown in one of its skyscrapers then leads them to Chernobyl, where a hidden stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium is revealed, causing a change of villains and more explosions in the dark. That unfortunately, is all that one can remember about Moore's attempt at making an action movie and piggy-backing on the success of a thrilling franchise only to disengage its fans.The father-son relationship is so estranged that Bruce Willis looks like he is parenting a teenage boy who has been playing garage band too loud. Willis also has to struggle to compensate the lack of acting ability in Jai Courtney who is Sam Worthington like minus any talent. The other main drawback is the lack of a single, powerful villain. There is clearly the lack of a nemesis who is a step ahead of our hero and without that catching up game, thrill is a hard element to find. Then, there is a staggering flaw that ignores the one element that makes Die Hard films fun to watch – the world threatening evil plan that McClane needs to prevent from execution. It is no wonder that Bruce Willis looks like he's having a day at Legoland when you expect him at Six Flags. The superfluous and incredulous action outweighs each of the characters' ability and the situation's gravity. In the end, one wonders what got McClane involved in the Russian outing at Chernobyl and what got Bruce Willis involved in a film by John Moore. 5.003 on a scale of 1-10.",A Good Day to Die Hard
164,Fields201,Good is all I can say,7,15 February 2013,"I was so looking forward to this movie ever since I heard the press release that it was being made. I liked some of the action scenes and I am a huge Bruce Willis fan.... and that's about it.Where to begin? Well, for starters, the story is rather bland. For a Die Hard film, I would rather see the terrorists planning some kind of heist. It makes the story a little bit more interesting. Instead, they are after some file that we don't even know what it is until the third act (apparently its on the bad guy of the film). It reminded me of Home Alone 3 when the bad guys were looking for a computer chip in a toy car. Not only that, but it just looks like they were making it up as they were going along. The villains were also forgettable. These are the worst villains in the franchise. At least in the previous Die Hard films, they were somewhat dangerous. Hans Gruber was terrifying and made his mark when he shot Tokagi, and that bad guy from the second one crashed planes full of innocent people, and Simon seemingly planted a bomb in a school, and the villain in the fourth film pretty much took control of the world! So what made these villains stand out? Ummmm.... well.... they beat the crap of the McClanes. That's all I can really say. I guess having nukes is bad. Really, they just sucked.Now this one pains me the worst: John McClane. I know he's this wisecracking hero but he comes off as annoying. For the first half of the movie he just sounded like a spoiled child. He also was the blame why the whole mess happened in the first place. Stopping his son from getting away from the terrorists and then whining the whole way through didn't help much either. To top it off, he really just felt like he was more in the background. I know they wanted to have this father/son story akin to Indiana Jones but like Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, it just cheapens out lead character who we've been following for four films now.I really hope they make a Die Hard 6 and give John McClane the film that he deserves. Knowing Hollywood, John will probably be at home barking orders while his kids go out and does all the work. Seriously, I hope the sixth Die Hard is the bow out of the franchise that we need, otherwise I would feel pretty bad for John McClane.The actions scenes weren't bad, though.",A Good Day to Die Hard
165,achyutaghosh,Fall from greatness,6,24 February 2013,"""When is it not about the money""- well into the climax of A Good Day to Die Hard, John McClane poses a metaphorical question to his son Jack. Sequels are always about money, but never did I feel so about the Die Hard franchise till this fifth round of yippee-ki-yay. Plentiful action and old school heroics were only a part, the earlier four movies were funny, witty, and inventive. This one is an antithesis of the past movies- explosions, shaky camera, slow-mo and full of all action movie plot clichés, a mash-up of albeit good but never ending special effects and sad one-liners. The Die Hard movies have progressively got bigger. The first one was in a hotel, the second in an airport, the third in New York, the fourth in pretty much all of America, so this one has to go international. Here is the plot- Jack bumbles a CIA deep cover mission in Russia, John goes to rescue him. Talk about police and secret services workload sharing. Slam-bam slam- bam, Moscow laid to waste including a superb chase sequence, reminiscent of Pierce Brosnan's tank run in GoldenEye. John and Jack find out they are the only ones left to finish the mission. Slam-bam slam-bam with smashed glass roofs, a somewhat face saving fight in a ballroom and helicopter gunships. Destination Chernobyl. Slam- bam slam bam including spooky, irradiated and crumbling buildings, U-235 and more helicopter gunships. McClane happy family reunion- and the end. The problem is not only Bruce Willis- he is nearing 60 but still going strong with his acting- last year's Looper and Moonrise Kingdom is testament to that. He can still look good with a big gun, carries his trademark arsenal of smirks and quips, and kick ass. But the script has essentially poisoned all the values of John McClane, the reluctant action hero who cannot manage his job or his family but out to save the world from a worthy villain, to a nondescript action flick. For someone like Willis who has devoted personal attention and 6 years for just another actioner, it is sad. Also sad is the casting- if they are planning to replace Bruce with his son in future installments, they better think twice. Even Shia LeBouf has a better chance as Indiana Jones than Jai Courtney who is a hunk all right, but has less expressions than a toilet seat, takes his acting classes from a Terminator and generally looks miserable throughout. And the lesser said about the villains the better- i know Hans Gruber was a once in a lifetime character, is it wrong to ask for someone like Thomas Gabriel from Live Free or Die Hard? Director John Moore thought that just by channeling in some Russian flavor will bring in the aficionados. Well Mr. Moore, the Cold War is long over, and Russian nukes are stale stakes.To sum up, A Good Day to Die Hard is a serviceable action flick, but not really worthy of the franchise. It veers drastically away from what has been its unique selling points to being generic, with the leads committing the most outlandish of stunts and emerging scratch-less, throwing in wisecracks along the way. It might be technically great, but its lost its special mix of humor and realism- John McClane has died long and hard, so it seems. Hope the rest of the summer entertainment is better.",A Good Day to Die Hard
166,bayardhiler,Why Bruce? Why????.....,1,28 August 2013,"I've been asking myself this question over and over in my head ever since I laid on eyes on this train wreck. Why on earth would Bruce Willis-THE BRUCE WILLIS-agree to star in a film that lays waste to one his most iconic roles? Its a question that may never be answered but I suspect that Bruce is so tired of playing the role at this point that only the money concerns him now. In this entry, McClane finds out that his son is in a Russian prison because of his work with the CIA which involves something to with trying to keep a corrupt Russian official from coming to power. So, in an attempt to save him, John travels to Moscow and from there, things go down hill fast! One of the biggest problems with the film is that it just doesn't feel like a ""Die Hard"" movie. The writer, Skip Woods-a man who's only written something like five prior screen plays, including the ""excellent"" ""A-Team""- tries to turn John into some sort of Jason Bourne/James Bond type. Any fan of the series knows that's not what McClane was about. Another issue is the absence of a focused plot, something that made the previous films what they were. For much of the time, we're not sure why the American government is so invested in this Russian mess in the first place.The movie also fails on one other critical aspect: upping the ante from movie to movie. In the first movie, John has to save a party of hostages in a LA skyscraper, in the second, an airport and planes full of people circling over head. Then in the third film, McClane has to save a whole city from a vengeful mad man and finally, in the fourth one, the whole country from a hacker. But this one? Trying to stop a corrupt Russian bureaucrat from coming to power? Hello, doesn't Skip know that's what Russia's government is made up of to begin with? Then there's the other forgettable villains, including one who chomps on carrots and seems to laugh at everything as if the actor thinks that alone will make him menacing. Hell, even Timothy Olyphant's Thomas Gabriel was more memorable on screen than that. Perhaps the only good thing that I can say about the movie concerns the car chases which I have to admit, were kind of cool, except for the fact that McClane and son seem to come away miraculously unscathed again and again, which, was not at all the case with the previous films. To sum it all up, if you are even half the fan of ""Die Hard"" that I am, stay far away from this one. P.S. I almost forgot, Shame on you John Moore, Shame on you Skip Woods, and Shame on you BRUCE!!!!!!",A Good Day to Die Hard
167,krycek19,"Annoying pain in the ass, pointless boring movie",1,15 February 2013,"Thats the best way to describe this crap. Jai Courteny has got to be the most annoying actor ever. There is no chemistry between him and Bruce.Die Hard fans will hate this movie. There is no script. Bruce seems out of place here despite its suppose to be Die Hard. But it doesn't feel like Die Hard. Even the action sequences are boring and doesn't add anything to the story. So it seems like the action is there just to satisfy the audiences craving for action. Like the stupid car- chase where McClane totals 100 cars because he must talk to his brain-dead son. The bad-guys are cardboard characters and cliché. I was so happy when this movie got an R rating but without a descent script forget it. Even the fourth movie that got a PG 13 rating was ten times better than this. At least it felt like Die Hard, with good acting, a good script and nice action.The director John Moore said that people have expectations to a Die Hard movie. That it isn't just any other action movie. Well John you certainly treated Die Hard like any other action movie. I've seen Van Damme movies that are better than this.The funny thing is that Sam Mendes said the same thing about 007 but he still managed to kill the franchise with the awful Skyfall, just like John Moore did with A Good Day To Die Hard.",A Good Day to Die Hard
168,BrickNash,All bang and no brilliance. Terrible end to a great series!,2,15 June 2013,"The Die Hard series has been extremely fortunate. Not only is it a staple slice of 80's action legend along with Arnie and Sly films of the time but they have had the luck of all being extremely high quality films. Even the dubiously anticipated 4th instalment from 2007 was a rip roaring adventure which put John McClane firmly and stylishly in the cyber domain of the 21st century and had a great fun while it was at it.It's such a shame than the same cannot be said for the 5th instalment of the series. To put it mildly this film is a mess and really should mark the end of the McClane adventures.The film has absolutely no depth whatsoever. There are ooodles of well done stunts and explosions but even back in the hey-day of 80's action films this was never enough, no matter how the stereotype paints it, there was always something driving the action along.A Good Day To Die Hard has virtually zero back story other than a few shots at the start of the film hazily describing some prisoner scenario. After that we are lunged into a 10 minute+ car chase which there is really no need for and characters that you just don't give a damn about so all the excitement is torn from the action like a bad tooth.The script is atrocious, basically a sparce combination of one liners and drab, drab dialogue squeezed roughly in between the booms and bangs.The director (unless under major pressure from the studio) appears to be a wannabe Michael Bay type but with less fixation on breasts and tanks and more on explosions and....more explosions. All the effort and money seem to have gone on two things, Willis and the stunts which leaves very little effort made in the actual acting scenes. The editing in particular is terrible with Willis suddenly lying on the ground or in mid run without any kind of indication why. Some of the shots are extremely wanky and stylised which is fine but there's nothing in the story to back it up.To add to this dirge of badness the sickening moments where the USA is portrayed as the country everyone in the world loves is just too much to take. Watch and cringe as a Russian taxi driver let's Willis have a free ride for simply being American and letting him sing and American song. I have nothing against the US as do many people, but this kind of self complimentary rubbish by Hollywood is the main reason people have hate.The only saving grace about this film is the well staged and balls out action sequences, but with nothing there to back it up or fill in the bits in the middle it all comes crumbling down like a house without mortar.Willis can be forgiven because of the sheer volume of great films he's given us over the years and as an amateur film maker myself I know that sometimes no-one knows how well a film is going to be until after it's all pieced together, but a bad film is still a bad film and this is without a doubt a very bad film!",A Good Day to Die Hard
169,CMTiago,"Good action movie, but not worthy of being a ""Die Hard"" entry",6,7 March 2014,"Having watched, up until this point, Die Hard With A Vengeance and Live Free Or Die Hard, I know how great these films can be and I really owe it to myself to check out the first two. But back to this latest chapter, we see John McClane travel to Russia to assist his estranged son Jack McClane, only to find out that he is a spy working undercover for the CIA. From then on they will team up to take out the bad guys and save the day. This might seem a little simple, but it really comes down to this. Heroes bond and the villains aren't really that interesting. This is what comes out of this under developed movie. The fact that it is tagged as a Die Hard movie really doesn't help. It doesn't have the appeal that others had and therefore is a little disappointing when compared to its predecessors. The action, though, is top notch and I felt that Willis and Courtney's interactions were fun to watch. Other than that this is a good action movie that lacks any real punch. The story is flat and there's nothing really to appreciate from the script. With all its puns and kick ass action, AGDTDH ends up being a good way to spend an afternoon, but not deserving of being called a Die Hard picture. At least we still get to ear McClane's trademark sentence, which left me a bit happy in the end.Rating 6/10",A Good Day to Die Hard
170,NanoFrog,Fail. No story. No plot. Just explosions that make no sense.,1,18 May 2013,"Don't worry about reviews with plot spoilers here, there is no plot at all in this film. While I have generally enjoyed most of the John McLain series, this film is just an exhibition of pointless and impossible pyrotechnics and so-called special effects with no recognizable content at all. It looks like an expensive film to make, but there was no money or talent left over for an actual story here. Willis is clearly way to old to be doing films like this. usually you can count on Willis for some wise cracks, but the dialogue here, what there is of it, is as empty as the pointless effects. The one good thing about this film is how clearly it demonstrates how Hollywood has lost its way and seems to have no clear idea how to make an actually good film. An irritating waste of time, talent and money. That the film actually closes with the ancient, old and tired Rolling Stones singing something to electric with no recognizable lyrics says it all.

172,nemesis-88,Die Hard Already!,1,8 April 2013,"What a waste of time watching this ""movie"". It really is what people called ""movies"" 100 years ago - stupid, primitive and without even the slightest plot.To me, the quality of the movie is always in how fast I notice goofs. A misplaced object, a different length of the lit cigarette, an anachronistic poster on the wall. With Die Hard 1 it took me TEN YEARS to think that even a cop can't carry a gun onboard a plane like John McLaine does in the opening scene. And why would he need a gun anyway? In Die Hard 2, airplanes crash because they can't get directions from the control tower. Only last year it hit me - why the heck didn't they just use their radios to talk to each other or other airports? So good those movies were, nobody even noticed those! With Die Hard 5, all I see is goofs. And they are EVERYwhere. Plot holes, continuity, anachronisms (no, really, the Cold war is over, zinch, kaput, nill, OVER - catch up already), geography (Chernobyl is ANOTHER COUNTRY, you idiots, and you can't drive there on a Maybach full of arms).Even the ""quality of the villains"" have dropped all the way to the sewer. In Die Hard 1 we had the now late but still the best Russian ballet dancer Alexander Godunov. Die Hard 2 gave us the not so exciting John Amos and William Sadler but they were such a wonderful backdrop for the 70's supermegamacho Franco Nero! Die Hard 3 - the deep, handsome, sophisticated, magnificent (I can go one with epithets for hours) Jeremy Irons. In Die Hard 4 we had the COMPUTER as a villain. And for people of my generation computers associate not with acne infested teens, but with cool guys with cool brains. And now... In the Die Hard Already we have Sergey Kolesnikov!? For the past 6 years he's been teaching babushkas how to prune potatoes in his gardening show! He left the best Russian drama theater to pursue this ""magnificent"" career. I see him every Saturday on TV walking around in wellingtons holding a pair of pruning scissors. His audience protested against Napoleon invasion, for Pete's sake. VILLAIN MY ASS!The plot? Die Hard 1 - stealing 100 million dollars (was a lot in 1988!). Die Hard 2 - corrupt mercenaries trying to set free a cruel dictator. Die Hard 3 - stealing the whole US National Reserve! Cool! Die Hard 4 - stealing the US money. All of it. Cooler yet! Die Hard 5... HUH? A rushed opening tells us John McLaine is going to Moscow to free his son who somehow landed in a Russian jail. His wife seems to be unmoved by the fact or maybe is too busy with her suburban yoga class. His daughter acts WAY too nonchalant about the whole thing. I live in Russia, but even I would be worried if my brother would be in a Moscow jail with my crazy dad going out to get him out.Script and directing? Non-existent. The movie is full of clichés. They start with John opening the door to get out of the car only to be stopped by the inevitable ""And Dad?"", and ends with a tiny business jet landing (at Langley?) with two ""heros"" on board who then walk away into the sunset. Mister Director, it would take SEVEN refueling stops for that thing to go from Moscow to America. CIA use Gulfstream-550's for which nobody cared to give the money to such a mediocre director. The worst cliché though is the whole ""CIA stuff"". McLaine, Sr. tells the villain that his son can break the law because he works for the CIA and immediately his son demonstrates it by head-butting the villain in the face. WHY?The whole movie looks like little boys ""pretend war"" game. After mom told them they only have 10 more minutes to play, that is. ""You're like the bad guy and you like stand here and then I go there and like shoot you from that corner and you like fall and then we're like in a bunker, OK? Cmon!"". Same with this ""motion picture"". Asbolutely no plot, no climax, no decent ending. NOTHING.Characters? I'm sorry but these John McLaines have gone WAY too far with their ""goal justifies the means"" attitude. The young McLaine beating up an old and apparently weak senior man (who, mind you, spent 5 years in jail for resisting the oppressing regime!), looks ugly and revolting. American heroes fearlessly attack... Russian pensioners? The unnecessary aggression and cruelty goes so far that you actually start to pity the ""bad guys"" who appear to be MUCH more decent, noble and WAY cleverer than those two bullies. So when the ""dancing Serb"" says ""You know what people hate about Americans? Everything!"", you just nod in agreement.As someone here has already said, John McLaine's character has changed as well. He used to be a NICE if a bit grumpy guy. He regretted taking life, he hurt when he fell, he could barely shift a heavy rain-grid on that runway, remember? He even cried when he was desperate. He was HUMAN. This John McLaine kills innocent people and just shouts ""Sorry, ma'am"". He drops off hundreds of meters/feet and gets up like he just had a shower. He can hang out of truck hanging out of a helicopter spinning out of control, then fly throw a glass wall, only to get up and tell a stupid joke. Shall we call him John Wayne now?Should you go see it? Well... If your most beloved Gramma, who gave you her kidney to save your life, sends you the tickets to Die Hard 5 and tells you she will die heartbroken if you don't go; if your teenage daughter says she'll run away with Stivie Tyler if you don't go, JUST DON'T GO!",A Good Day to Die Hard
173,rjsf96,An Awful Day to Die Hard,2,2 June 2014,"Die Hard was once a reputable franchise that saw Bruce Willis as all-star action hero John McClane in 1988, which was one of the greatest (if not the greatest) action flick of the 80s. Alan Rickman proved an astonishing villain that tested McClane to the max, as he progressed through the Nakatomi Plaza to the higher levels. The sequels although enjoyable still could not match the original for its sheer fun, mental action scenes and (somewhat surprisingly) good dialogue. I found them all to be worthwhile, even if Die Hard 2 has the weakest villain of the four, Die Hard with a Vengeance applies the buddy cop genre to the franchise, and Die Hard 4.0 which is the one that shows it has balls to pull out those kind of action scenes out of the hat (yes, I really had a lot of fun with this movie!).Now, John Moore gets to besmirch his grubby fingers with the latest instalment of the franchise. You have to wonder why the hell Fox hired him. Just a quick look at his filmography proves he is not the man for the job. Maybe Fox thought Len Wiseman did a good job on the previous film so decided to give Moore a chance, or maybe they just didn't care about the franchise anymore and the impact it would have on it. After seeing the film for the first and last time I might add, I am willingly to bet the latter.The film starts with Jack, McClane's son, shooting some random guy in a club. Who is this guy and what is the relevance of him to the plot? Oh, apparently the screenwriter Skip Woods (of X-Men Origins fame) didn't know either, so just had it happen so that the plot could advance – in the lamest way possible. The first four films plot could be summed up in just one sentence yet they all possessed intelligence. But this one? About one paragraph, yes that is how long it would take for me to explain it, the complexities of it are needless and just add confusion to the dull story to begin with. For all it's worth, the plot pretends to be clever and fails, it ends up coming off as dumb and for a Die Hard film that is just plain wrong.Surely at this point you must be thinking, I am way too harsh and should take this film with a pinch of salt after all it is a Die Hard film and there must be one redeeming quality that I can think of. Wait, no there isn't, we don't even get an interesting villain – something that the series has always been known for and has become as much of a staple as the character himself. Forget about the menacing one liner, this film has a tap dancing, carrot eating idiot, it still gets worse. The real villain is much worse. I'm not sure how they managed it but they did.Furthermore, we do not care about John McClane – the character is a superhero invincible to bullets, yet in the original he was always worn out and getting beaten up! Does this happen here? You can bet your bucks it doesn't! He climbs out of a truck that is flipped countless times and starts jogging; you know something? I was puzzled too.There are dialogue scenes that don't make sense. The villain says it's not 1986. Why mention the date of the Cold War? Why not mention the date of the original Die Hard? But I can answer that question they would not want to, the audience might remember it and walk out of the theatre – I know I would have! All in all this is not so much a 25th Birthday Present for the original Die Hard as an F you to the fans of the original trilogy and not so bad fourth instalment. McClane states ""he is on vacation"" and apparently so was the Director. At one point in the film a villain says ""I've had enough of this sh*t"". I could not agree with him more. If there is a sixth entry in development the series needs an overhaul, not a polishing of a turd.",A Good Day to Die Hard
174,BigWhiskers,A bad day to waste 9 bucks,2,22 February 2013,"The first 2 die hards were good. I skipped the 3rd as I'd heard it was lousy and yrs later after watching it on cable I agreed. i also skipped the 4th one too which again was lousy after I saw it on cable. I decided to throw caution to the wind hoping they would return to the tongue in cheek Bruce Willis formula that worked so well in the first two but nope no such luck. There is no charisma , he is just a much more cynical older version of himself. And then the plot hole of having a grown son who was non existent up until this 5th go around. The dialog between the two is mostly the son calling his Dad by his first name and treating him like crap whereas Willis's character just basically stands around looking for something to say. It's never fully explained why the hate and where was this son in the other movies? We also have a plot twist with guess the true villain which is not really that much of a stretch since it's hinted at rather obviously who is playing games with who here. The villains demise is another typical bells and whistles cliché of making his death gruesome as if to have the audience gasp.The movie is more concerned with stunts and special effects than decent acting or directing. Filling up the screen ala Mission Impossible style may seem slick to some but it does not equal good. Busy is still boring. They needed to stick a fork in this franchise after number 2.

176,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD (2013),3,9 February 2013,"When I first watched the teaser and its subsequent full trailer of A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD (that's DIE HARD 5 in case you lost count), I must say the marketing people has done a pretty good job selling the movie. Being a fan of DIE HARD movies myself, I almost convinced that I'm in for an ultimate fun after the mediocre effort of DIE HARD 4.0 six years ago (even though the fourth installment went on becoming the highest-grossing DIE HARD movie of all-time). But upon finally watching the whole movie, I was surprised to find out what a disappointment it turns out to be! Running at 97 minutes, A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD is no doubt the shortest DIE HARD movie ever made (the previous four movies run at about 130 minutes each). But the decision to compress such a compact length turns out to be a huge mistake after all. In the past, all four DIE HARD movies (yes, even the mediocre fourth installment) invest their times to tell and expand the storyline considerably. However, what we get instead is Skip Woods' shockingly thin, amateurish and yet uninspired screenplay until I suspect he must have simply scribbled a few words on a paper napkin and calls it a day. Even he manages to twist his story halfway (one of the iconic elements in a DIE HARD movie), the so-called element of surprise feels enormously lackluster.Then there's director John Moore (he replaced Noam Murro, who was originally attached for the movie but bailed out to do 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE instead). Whoever thought it's a brilliant idea to hire this Hollywood hack seriously needs to get a few slaps in the face. For the record, John Moore's filmography is hardly impressive (remember, he's the one who ruined the remake of THE OMEN and the big screen, video game adaptation of MAX PAYNE) and it's really sad to see him ruin such a popular franchise like DIE HARD here. Among his biggest mistake is his decision to shoot the picture as much hand-held as he can. According to an interview, he explained: ""McClane is in a strange world, with little or no initial control over his environment. He's unable to anticipate things as he normally might. He's caught off guard, and we want the camera to mimic that surprise and confusion."" As a result, his frenetic direction proves to be too chaotic to qualify this as a true DIE HARD movie. The action sequences, including the would-be memorable car chase scene in the highway traffic is so chaotically staged and difficult to enjoy the moments (especially with all the desaturated colors and the overuse of blue filters). Another mistake he has made is the way he approaches the movie as noisy as possible with everything cranked up to the eleven (including Marco Beltrami's equally overly-amplified music score). It's like watching a DIE HARD movie on steroids. If anything, only two action scenes are considered worthwhile: the climactic finale involving the helicopter and a dangling truck as well as the slow-motion crashing scene (which is heavily advertised in various promotional trailers).As John McClane, Bruce Willis seems to be looking very tired this time around. He doesn't really shows as much enthusiasm as he used to be in the previous four movies. Most of his trademark wisecracks are either too forceful (even for his iconic ""Yippee-kai-yay, motherf**ker"" catchphrase) or too repetitive (I mean, how many times he has to repeat the words, ""I'm on vacation!"" and ""Jesus Christ"" throughout the movie?). For Jai Courtney, he may have the physicality to play an action role but he lacks the charisma to make his Jack McClane character worthwhile. As for the villains, the less said the better because they are simply forgettable and even plain embarrassing (especially the one involving Alik's confession to the captured John and Jack about how he used to be an excellent tap dancer).It's hard to imagine that A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD could end up this bad that makes a mediocre effort of DIE HARD 4.0 looks like an action-movie classic. Easily the weakest entry yet, I can only hope that the upcoming the yet-to-be-titled DIE HARD 6 (in which Bruce Willis himself claimed to be his last before he retired his iconic character for good) can be improved considerably... with a different and more qualified director who understands what makes a DIE HARD movie such a successful franchise at the first place.",A Good Day to Die Hard

179,Katz5,The Best Thing is the Tagline,4,2 August 2021,"""Yipee Ki Yay, Mother Russia."" Great tagline to a truly silly movie. The best thing that can be said about it is that it's not as bad as Live Free or Die Hard, the sequel where the franchise went off the rails and yearned to be a 007 movie. John McClane even has a 007 joke in this movie that may have been a reference to the previous stinker.In what is likely (and sadly...) to be the final Die Hard movie, McClane travels to Russia to find his son - once reunited (and it doesn't feel so good...), the two are immediately caught up in a video game-like spectacle involving a Russian political prisoner who is in jail for reasons never really made clear - even by the end of the movie. But it involves Chernobyl. Of course it does.The CGI is over the top, but it didn't bother me as much as Live Free... I went into this movie with very low expectations. But given that the director made a fairly good remake of The Omen in 2006, a side of me thought perhaps the critics and audiences could have been too harsh (alas, this Die Hard entry made the least amount of money of the five films). The critics and audiences were right. This film does not redeem the franchise after Live Free...Willis is a sport for the movie - he does his best, but looks mostly bemused (posing for all of that green screen) or bored. The actor who plays his son is OK but there isn't much chemistry between the two of them. The best we can say is, thanks Bruce/John for the great times (at least in the first three movies). We'll forgive you for the last 2 movies.",A Good Day to Die Hard
180,s_campanale,Die Hard goes to Hollywood Russia for a series that should have ended by now but keeps on going anyway,7,15 February 2013,"""Die Hard"" was the 1988 action movie starring the guy from ""Moonlighting"" which surprised everyone by becoming a box office smash and subsequently a cult classic and pop culture icon. A decent sequel followed which moved things to an Airport, but then the countless imitators started to appear and the DH formula was destroyed by concept inflation as movie makers rushed to find which enclosed situation a lone skilled hero at the wrong place at the wrong time could work his way out of next. By the time ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" turned up in 1995 the series itself left the established formula and made a new one with the hero and sidekick running around town fighting various teams of mercenaries as a convoluted plot slowly pieced together and heroes and boss villain finally met to square off. 12 years passed before that wave of dead series resurrections brought Die Hard back to life with another episode starring a poignantly old and bitter John McClane paired with a younger sidekick and his grown up daughter in a variation on the ""DHWAV"" formula. Everyone expected that to be the last one, but with another wave of grey action movies comes yet another Die Hard, and by now, what is there left to say? What is there left to do? Repeat yourself of course, but with the added exoticism of a new country and new environment.""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is basically ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" set in Russia, or rather the Hollywood version of Russia, that primitive brutal uncivilized backward place where everyone is suspect, everyone is corrupt, everyone lives in squalor, tattooed mobsters and slutty Slavic whores are found in every corner and the police are as ineffective as they are dirty. Having reunited McClane with his estranged daughter under constant fire in LFODH, the next logical step is to do the same with his estranged son, who handily enough is also a covert CIA agent working undercover in Russia. McClane goes to get him out of jail, even though he constantly maintains he is on vacation (?) and winds up joining John Jr. sort out a convoluted plot involving two warring corrupt Russian politicians (are there any other kind in Hollywood Russia?) a team of mercenaries led by a man who turned to violence because he didn't have enough money to study dance, a pretty Russian doll like girl who quickly proves she's a deadly toy, and those perennial Macguffins ""The incriminating secret file"" and ""The deadly ex- Soviet plutonium being smuggled to make bombs"", the favourites of any lazy and unimaginative screenwriter. Both the latter involve Chernobyl, whose horrific and on-going human tragedy seems to have been hijacked by makers of Hollywood pulp (Transformers DOTM, Chernobyl Diaries) in a way that would be unthinkable for any other disaster of its kind.The action is mostly good, starting with a 15 minute chase through Moscow involving vans, armoured cars and indestructible Mercedes vehicles that wreaks havoc and visibly kills and maims countless innocent Russians who are however never acknowledged because, well they're Russians and so don't really count! (Rather like the poor Turks in ""Taken 2"") The first half of the movie in general, seems to be imitating the ""Bourne"" series with its shaky cam, frantic editing and tense shifts between control rooms and action on the ground. ( I suppose since everyone nowadays is either copying ""Bourne"" or ""Batman"" it is not surprising).The Moscow chase in particular resembles a photocopy of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" sequence, even using the same black Mercedes G class. There are various shootouts in fancy looking European architecture, the old ""Hind Helicopter shoots up high rise building"" routine (using a real life Hind instead of crappy CGI, which is nice to see) and a final battle in Chernobyl itself, which is instantly de-irradiated by some sort of magic spray, and we get some more shoot outs, fist fights, and a battle involving an even bigger Mi-26 transport helicopter. The father-son relationship is pure cliché, but then McClane's tragedy always was that he was good at violence but no good at human relationships. Some attempt at drama is made by comparing it with the relationship between Komarov and his estranged daughter Irina, but it doesn't go very far. Acting wise, Willis isn't even trying anymore these days, Jay Courtney (very good in ""Jack Reacher"") shouts, shoots and gets frustrated a lot, Sebastian Koch (Kormarov) injects his character with some pathos and the weight of the past most of the time, and Yulia Snigir does well as his ""doll"" daughter Irina even though her screen time and character development are minimal. Serbian Radivoje Bukvic tries hard as the rather TOO young Mercenary leader Alik, but again he is just there to have someone to fight until he is dispensed with anti- climactically. Rather like the previous movie, the villains are secondary at best, it is McClane himself in the spotlight now just like Batman or Bond, so we will never see another Hans or Sebastian Gruber, or even a Col. Stuart. Having strayed so far from its roots, it is nice to hear Marco Beltrami's score deliberately imitate the distinct sounds of the late, great Michael Kamen, even building the score around themes from the original two movies, which reminds us we are actually watching a ""Die Hard"" film (and we alas need constant reminding of that!)It is a fun, hectic, sometimes difficult to follow movie which makes for a nice night at the cinema, but is very far removed from its illustrious predecessors. The ending suggests a final reuniting of McClane and his 2 offspring, so I suppose the next one will probably go right back to the beginning and rescue Holly McClane and reunite them again, then stop, because there really is nowhere left to go for ""Die Hard"" now.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Remember FOX started churning out those awfully named sequels with inferior quality but still promising some good action set piece moments? I thought I had seen the last of em with Live Free or Die Hard. But NO! They had to make another movie which made the previous movie looked good and they did it!Live Free or Die Hard had some substance to it, an intimidating villain and a better written plot. A Good Day To Die Hard has none of em; its a no-brainer. An abysmal plot serves for some brilliant action sequences. It almost seemed like the story was written around and after the action scenes were choreographed. All you have to do is smirk at McClane's mediocrely funny one-liners and enjoy the fireworks that follows. Then againwhere was John McClane? The charm that the original trilogy had was due to the tough cop character with an attitude, but this is just a 57 year old guy pretending to be a badass running around Russia in search of his son, mind youa son who was never even mentioned once in the previous movie. And if you thought you'd see some 'Pursuit of Happiness' moments here, you are wrong. Jai Courtney (whom I remember as the cherub faced gladiator from Spartacus and of course the recent Jack Reacher) and Bruce Willis had zero chemistry and had absolutely no father-son bonding moments were to be found here. But of course a Die Hard movie is not about all that, its about actionyou do get a truckload of that but there also needs to be a reason for things to blow up which unfortunately wasn't there.It is so badly written that the only time McClane says 'Yippee ki-yay, motherf***r!' failed to invoke any kinda reactions. The so called plot would have been sufficient for a great game but the it never seems to take off for a movie like this. Even the plot-twist towards the end, although very unexpected, felt half baked. Frankly I enjoyed Live Free or Die Hard despite its flaws and Good Day to Die Hard makes it look twice as good. FOX should have thought twice before handing over a beloved franchise like this to the director of Max Payne and the writer of X-Men Origins Wolverine.John McClane is now more of an icon than an action hero so it kinda justifies the implausible stunts he ends up doing. I would have compared him to Jason Statham from Transporter 2 but a more juster comparison would be Superman. This guy is unstoppable and despite being an old granpa he still has the some prowess he'd showed at Nakatomi Plaza. So its sorta entertaining during all those stunts.

There is an explosion that bursts the wall of the court just behind the benches where they were seated but none are even injured. Then appears McClane Sr. (Bruce Willis) in a crazy pursuit through the streets of Moscow causing chaos and death with no respect for innocent bystanders. And the cherry on top of the cake is that they go to Chernobyl exactly to the nuclear center as if the radiation was a minor concern, without protective suits whatsoever, but the villains carry a spray that neutralizes said radiation.

186,RoboRabbit89,An underwhelming entry in the franchise.,5,12 October 2017,"Bruce Willis is back in""A Good Day To Die Hard.""This may contain spoilers. I'm just going to get right into it, this film is in't very good, I mean I don't hate it, I still like it,I own the DVD but the film is lackluster. For a fifth film in the series they didn't try to make a compelling story, they just focused on the action only.Bruce Willis sort of did this one for the money, he knew they didn't have a good story, but I guess he felt the movie could still work. Story wise no, Action wise yes.The action scenes are good but average at best. I am glad they did this one with an R rating but even with that, that's the only thing that moves the film along there really is no story just action, and a plot device to get john McClane to do battle with terrorists in Russia.Another thing that bothers me with this film is that it's too confusing. What I mean by this, is that who is the villain or more importantly who are the villains and why do they need weapons grad uranium, I know the plot summary on the DVD says a nuclear heist, but why? And the story really just doesn't make any sense, when you really think about it.John McClane goes to Russia to find his estranged son jack, as father and son do battle with terrorists, they must stop them and their nuclear weapons heist.Another thing about this movie is that it's forgettable. It's kind of hard to recall anything if any. I'm series, I can't really remember anything of importance for this review!But having said that, I do still like it, I did see it in theaters with a friend in February 2013, he and I liked it. But he did agree it was forgettable.Overall I give it a 5/10. It's fun, as in a mindless action movie sort of way, but it's underwhelming, forgettable and lackluster. I will say I enjoyed it, and it was one of Director John Moore's better films since that blunder of a movie Max Payne.Hopefully, Die Hard 6 will return the struggling franchise to it's former glory.",A Good Day to Die Hard

How many times do we have to listen to Bruce Willis and his only...son...refer to Jesus and God in every scene ? This kinda reminded me the Haunting in Connecticut sequel with that Heidi Heidi screaming mother.Back to the film...well there's no actual film but a bunch of stuff being blown up and thrown at the Willis's. There's no story, no actual connection to the rest of the Die Hards, the scenario is written probably by a catholic priest, everybody keeps saying Jesus Jesus and God all the time. Lots of gunfire and some more explosions are the main theme here. No Bruce Willis jokes and that whole family thing is really crap I would hate to see someone else picking up the leading role.How many sequels do they have to carry on with this multimillion production ? I would rather see a different kind of theme like serial killers and maybe some darker sides. This is getting very boring. Just get rid of his son, keep the daughter, bring back his wife and shoot a good action thriller. Make the leading character go after a real bad guy. I really do not care to watch high quality explosions anymore. Not if there's nothing else to watch in between.Last but not least, the movie is OK, it's entertaining and fun. It's not a classic but it has to be a point where Bruce Willis and Die Hard can turn a corner and present something different next time.Thanx Mr. Willis for a fun movie.",A Good Day to Die Hard

A Good Day To Die Hard is simply one word: fun. Extended, hilariously over the top action set pieces are the real draw here, along with McClane and co. killin' bad guys everywhere.

It lacked any sense of color and didn't stand out from the previous four. The same car chases, the same gunfights, it was almost tedious to watch. If you never saw a die hard movie and this is your first one and your looking for a good action films in general then you'll love it, but for me personally as a somewhat die hard fan, this just didn't fit me. With every new movie to come out you expect something bigger, something better, something people haven't seen before, stretch your budget and go crazy, but like i said, same old soup. I mean i dont hate it its just the same thing gets old, especially when you watch these movies back to back. The cast was good as well as the acting, as always. The action and gunfight weren't like terrible i mean there were some cool moments and i gotta admit it, the chase scene in like the first 20 minutes lasted like 15 minutes and had a lot of stunts and cars flying through the air and stuff.

190,jaguiar313,"Weak entry but, blows stuff up real good and often.",6,15 February 2013,"A Good Day To Die Hard has a lot of problems. The story is convoluted, the villains are weak and when the action stops there isn't enough strong drama to keep us interested but, thankfully, the action rarely stops and it is quite amusingly over the top. This entry has John McClane (Bruce Willis) traveling to Moscow to try to see his estranged son, Jack (Jai Courtney) who has been arrested for murder. But, what McClane doesn't know is that Jack is a CIA agent and involved in a mission to bust a Russian millionaire (Sebastian Koch), with ties to terrorism, out of jail to get the 411 on his partner... who also has his own plans to bust him out of jail. It's no secret that McClane gets in the middle of things and once again becomes the fly in the ointment of all this Russian cloak and dagger. The result is the destruction of half of Moscow and what's left of Chernobyl to boot. The story is as much of a mess as it sounds but, I still had a blast watching the father and son duo wreck the former Soviet Union to stop the bad guys. The action scenes are ridiculously over the top and it's still fun to watch Willis kick butt, even though his one liners are getting tired and he gives you the impression that so is he of all this nonsense. How many times CAN one man get into so much trouble unintentionally? At least it's part of James Bond's job. It's the stuff between the action that has us looking at our watches as the dialog is weak and I can't understand how a guy who is such a kick-ass hero can be hated so much by his kids. If my dad whacked terrorists on a regular basis and constantly blew stuff up, I'd probably think he was pretty cool. The villains never seem threatening enough to make us believe they stand a chance against the McClane family but, I still enjoyed seeing them try and get their asses handed to them by Willis and Courtney, who could have a future as an action star. If there is a Die Hard 6, I hope they give daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a catsuit and a gun to join in the fun. Why not? Go in with moderate expectations and turn off the brain and enjoy the fireworks because, that's basically what this movie has to offer and on that level it can be a fun matinée if you just don't look for another classic like the original installment.",A Good Day to Die Hard
191,Marc_Action,Good Day to JUST Die,2,16 June 2013,"It's time to put this franchise out of its misery. Bruce Willis is too old and Jai Courtney is just too boring. Plus John Moore's directing of a good portion of the action sequences just are way too implausible.Most of the film is too hard to stomach, and not because of the excessive violence and destruction. We have to hear endless dry dialogue from Willis and Courtney about how horrible a son or father the other was whenever these two are in a scene together. It gets tiresome after about 10 minutes, right out annoying after 20 minutes, and painful beyond that... Yet it continues for entirely too long. And let's be real, Willis just doesn't have the same energy to be in another action film. We know he can act but he drags through the movie with no real drive, almost as if he's just going through the motions until the check clears. He's overly annoying for most of the film.This movie really could have done without the duo; we got that in the last two Die Hard films. Maybe Courtney (and the film overall) might have been more engaging had he took over the lead role on his own, not that the plot is all that original.",A Good Day to Die Hard
192,pootc,A Good day to Cry Hard,4,23 February 2013,"You know what I hate about Die Hard 5? Everything! Okay not everything but after the mixed bag which was Die Hard 4.0 we get yet another downbeat delivery from Bruce Willis who seems to have forgotten what made his character so likable in the first place.A Good Day to Die Hard is not a good movie by any stretch and feels even more sterile and removed from realism than Die Hard 4.0 - but at least Die Hard 4.0 had a decent premise. A Good day to Die Hard lacks anything original. It's not intelligent and it's not that much fun because there because it all felt so contrived. McClane has no reason to be in Russia. Yes his wayward son is in trouble but what was the plan here? He's a New York cop with no authority completely out of his juristriction, he has no connections, even a mention of a plan would have helped to aid his reason for being there but we didn't get anything and while its cute on paper him being in a foreign country he needs a reason to be amongst it and he didn't have one, nor did the writers which was glaringly obvious.As for the film it was a blur, lots of action but nothing memorable. The opening car chase would have been a bit more fun if it wasn't so hard to watch because of the '24' style shaky cam. McClane of course doesn't get a scratch after rolling his vehicle and smashing into cars while dodging a rocket launcher attack and apparently Moscow don't have a Police force because there's not one in sight while downtown is being completely destroyed. Ridiculous. The movie felt so rushed and with no gravity to the plot it's a race from set piece to set piece followed by explosion after explosion and slow motion shots which we've all seen before with some mildly amusing banter between its two leads. That's it.This is meant to be Die Hard and McLane is supposed to be an everyman, an underdog, somebody who takes a beating who the audience gets behind. A 'fly in the ointment, a pain in the ass' but instead and just like Die Hard 4.0 we get superman, cold with no vulnerability and most notably no blood. What ever happened to vulnerable McClane who bled and hurt? Multiple car crashes, jumping out of a thirty story windows through scaffolding, getting smashed in the face with the end of a gun, dodging bullets, RPG's, explosions and getting pummeled with glass McClane walks out of everything with not even a limp or scratch but with a stupid smirk and is never in any real danger. Willis's performance is lazy, he mumbles and is a far cry from the McClane in Die Hard with a Vengeance which was the last time most people saw McClane on screen.Sure there are glimpses of the man that used to be but it's all very mild and not enough to warrant anything real engaging which is a shame. Jai Courtney's banter with Willis was alright like the 'pirate gun' part made me laugh. He did well with what he had which wasn't terribly much. We don't really ever get any real insight into what went wrong between them, only a throwaway line that McClane wasn't there and worked too much. Again we've seen it all before, the sidekick scenario's been done to death. It worked with Samuel L Jackson in Vengeance but now I'd rather see McClane alone.It's hard to pinpoint the positives here but here goes if you want to put your brain to sleep sure A Good Day to Die Hard all mildly entertaining affair, gunfire and explosions usually are because some people like fire, in fact some people love it but if you get over that there's nothing impressive here to recall - no good kills or McClane quips, everything falls flat including the villains and the famous line and the ending scene which was again very underwhelming again. Holly? Even a late plot twist couldn't help this mediocre movie and how it was rated 'R' is really questionable because beside the occasional F-bomb there's nothing even mildly offensive or bloodthirsty here to recall. No icepicks in the eye, no blood squibs or knee-caps while falling face first into glass, nothing Die Hard that rivals the original or even tries.It really seems that John McTiernan is the keeper of the flame in this franchise because he's the only one with a grasp on the material and character of McClane. Granted it's the 5th entry in the franchise. We made it this far but there's not a whole lot to like here and unless something magical happens and they take this franchise back a notch to where it began the eventual 6th and final entry is going to be more of the same which isn't the way I wanted to see this once beloved character go out. I guess we'll always have the trilogy.5 for nostalgia and that's being generous.",A Good Day to Die Hard
193,RichardKleiner,"A Major disappointment (yes, with capital ""m"")",4,3 March 2013,"Rarely has a movie soured my day so much as this terrible sequel to a franchise that, while not entirely flawless with all its installments, has still delivered some pretty solid entertainment and fantastic action.Needless to say that ""Die Hard"" is the best action movie ever made, and while the sequels are not as universally loved, all of them featured some continuation to Bruce Willis' character of John McClane in a witty script and some pretty damn cool and innovating action scenes.All of that is gone out the window (which may or may not relate to a scene from the movie) with this new installment in the Die Hard franchise, with the not-too-clever title of ""A Good Day to Die Hard"".Skip Woods relays screenwriters Steven E. de Souza, Jonathan Hensleigh and Mark Bomback's (among others) tasks of feeding John McClane smart one liners and coming up with clever and deceptive terrorist plots. And boy did he drop the ball.The script is, for lack of a better word, idiotic. Any semblance of McClane's previous heroics (at Nakatomi Tower, Dulles Airport, New York and the entire USA) is largely ignored, and the only link or mention of anything previously seen in the franchise is Lucy's brief and pointless appearance (though welcome, since it's Mary Elizabeth Winstead). The characters speak dialogues that highlight the obvious, and not just that, they actually repeat information that was said BY THE SAME CHARACTERS. And Skip Woods has done something that should be considered a crime against cinema: He has written John McClane as a completely unlikable character. Gone are his witty one-liners, replaced with cliché lines such as as ""guess who?"" and others that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger feel embarrassed. Gone is his down to earth, pragmatism and his heroic, though believable and survivable, feats. And gone is his actual usefulness within the plot. The acting itself is generic, at best. Bruce Willis acts shamefully on auto-pilot, and doesn't do that much justice to his character. But how can he, when he is so badly written, that it's beyond saving?The story is intergalactically stupid. Exposition arrives late; a lot of guns, devices and elements are featured and mentioned, but rarely, if ever, used; the bad guys are more incompetent and disposable than the ones in Rambo movies; the third act twist drops like an anvil without making any actual sense; and, in the end, the story itself matters so little, you give up halfway through it. That, and you also forget any actual semblance of a challenge.One might justify all of this by saying: ""hey, you're not going to watch it for the plot. You just want to see the action scenes"". That is an insult to a franchise that has been built around tense and challenging plots, great characters and competent scripts.But, even still, for those who don't give a care about the plot, or for those that it has failed to interest them (which is most likely), they might find solace in the action.Enter director John Moore, and witness the total demise of the film. His rushed, dirty and incompetent direction fails incredibly, with poorly shot frames, unnervingly shaky camera and editing and, overall, not a single care for making the action coherent or awe-inspiring. Say what you want about ""Live Free or Die Hard"", at least the action looked gorgeous, particularly that non-sensical but still awesome shot of a police car crashing into a helicopter. Here, the chases, gunshots and punches look so flat and boring, that there's truly no standout action sequence. Yes, people. John Moore has managed to make the image of a truck hanging chained to a helicopter, pulling it down, look complete and utterly boring. Moore tries to add some call backs to the original Die Hard, with a shot of the main villain falling to his death and John McClane crashing into a wall of glass, but the damage has already been done, and no homage can save this mindless spectacle, most especially the endless slow-motion shot of the McClanes jumping away from the exploding helicopter.This schlock is what you find in mindless action blockbusters that gourmet critics love to ravage to pieces. The thing was, the original ""Die Hard"" was completely the opposite of that type of movie. It was smart, tight and interesting, the villains were an actual threat, the hero was vulnerable and believable, the characters had heart, the action was never over the top, the explosions were not the trump card of the film, and it was on Christmas. The sequels, while lacking on some of these element, didn't lack on all of them.Positive aspects include the stupidly amusing goon that liked to dance, whatever his name was. No, don't get me wrong, he's garbage. But at least he had the better (though still crappy) lines, and was somewhat interesting to watch. Also, a fun and active score by Marco Beltrami, filling the shoes of late Michael Kamen overachieves to a bad film.I sincerely wanted to like this film, as I love the previous four of the franchise and was able to forgive the flaws it would have if it was fun, exciting and awe-inspiring. It wasn't.If you're among those who thought ""Live Free or Die Hard"" was bad, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is its more obnoxious little brother.

Not that anything of that really matters. Anyway, McClane Junior isn't so happy about his father appearing there. He takes John's gun and all money.

All evil guys are in special protection suits to be safe from radiation. Not that they needed them. Because they had the stuff to negate the radiation all along. They could have just used it, but wait for it to happen till the radiation gets so high that even the suits won't help. Apparently. It's all blurry, really. And that's not due to the radiation.We have that ""plot twist"" where Komarov's daughter pretends to betray her father just to reveal that she was working with him all along and in reality betrayed Chagarin. Which could be a surprise if it wasn't so obvious. But the one thing that's really annoyingly senseless is the fact that literally everyone was working for Chagarin and ever since the plot twist they all suddenly work for Komarov. I mean, they flew him and his daughter there. What for, if they were working for them anyway? Just to have the one and only loyal servant of Chagarin executed during the ""twist""? Sure thing...Also makes you wonder who the heck even attacked the court in the first place and why. With his connections and almost everyone secretly working for him, Komarov could have gotten out of there any time. But for the sake of the film length they had to fill it with some desperate attempt to create a plot, I guess. Introduce the ""powerful"" Chagarin to attack the court in order to get a file from Komarov (which didn't even exist) only to render Chagarin utterly helpless and meaningless later.It's the first movie from the Die Hard series that felt rather disappointing. I'd give it 5 stars to be at least ""average"" in my book, but that wouldn't be fair. Even with Bruce Wills and all it just has too many flaws. It can't even build up any tension or suspense. So it's a 4/10 from me: Below Average. Casual action movie fans ""can"" watch it, but don't expect too much.",A Good Day to Die Hard
195,rahuljonathan-nair,Not what i expected!,6,2 August 2013,"With over-the-top action, crazy car chases and loud blasting action sets, John Moore's 'A Good Day To Die Hard' delivers the goods in explosions and destructions. Unfortunately, this franchise, the fifth in the series, deals with secret agent-cum-father-son bonding over gun shots and blasts, which seems more like a twist than a justifiable entry into the 'Die Hard' series. Nevertheless, fighting bad guys under impossible odds is the basic outline, and a good one at that! 'A Good Day To Die Hard', as in previous 'Die Hard' franchises – 'Die Hard', 'Die Hard 2', 'Die Harder', 'Die hard With A Vengeance', 'Live Free Or Die Hard"" -- delivers enough where it counts to make up for its shortcomings. It is a grandiloquent action flick and nothing more. If you are a ""die hard"" fan of action flicks, then this one is a must-watch.",A Good Day to Die Hard
196,med77_99,"Good action, but not a Die Hard movie",7,31 May 2013,"Well, every single guy out there would find something good about the Die Hard films, i mean they are the ultimate action films out there, and im not any different, as i am a big fan of the franchise. So one would understand my excitement as i started watching this film, unfortunately, as many have already said on here, this one feels rushed and feels like it is missing something, lacks the spark of a Die Hard movie.The movie is not the worst film ever made, in fact it had some good action scenes, and Willis was excellent as usual, but it just did not feel like a Die Hard film. For starters, i hated how they treated John Mcclain's character here, he was reduced to like a 2ndry character rather than being the main hero, another problem was the lack of chemistry between Willis and Jain Courtney who plays his son, it just did not feel real and i could not feel a real connection between them, and others have mentioned, Jack Mcclain appears like a spoiled brat and i just hated the character.the other problem was the absence of a well defined and a tough villain that makes for a real challenge to Mcclain. the whole plot lacked the essence of a Die Hard movie, which usually involves an under siege situation, we had a building, an Air port, a City and a whole country under siege in the 4 previous films, here it seemed like a Spy action thriller similar to the Bourne films.dialog was also below the standards of the franchise.it still manages to entertain to some level, as i said it is not the worst movie out there, but it is the least of the Die Hard films, definitely the worst in the series, that does not feel like a Die Hard film which would make any Die Hard fan angry. i hope they make a better one and go back to the same formula of the first 4 films when they do the next one !!",A Good Day to Die Hard
197,BJBatimdb,A Good Day to Cry Hard,1,15 February 2013,"It's over folks. This is the death of the Die Hard franchise. Please.Die Hard has been a guilty pleasure for nearly 20 years, but there's no pleasure in this latest offering. Loud, unbearably stupid, cartoonishly unbelievable, this movie has the emotional impact of an episode of Thunderbirds, but without the clever plot.In a nutshell (which is big enough for this plot, with room to spare) Bruce Willis as John McClean tracks down his errant son to Moscow in the usual Hollywood bid to 'reconnect'. There he finds him working as a CIA operative trying to smuggle a vague dissident out of the country. Bruce joins in - as you do. They would have got away, too, if it wasn't for that pesky dissident getting out of the safety of the car and virtually thumbing his nose at the bad guys to make them chase him. There follows a car chase that's so long and stupid that I considered going to get an ice cream. I could have had a three course meal and they'd still have been there, demolition derbying through rush hour. During this chase, a transit van roars through dense traffic jams like a knife through butter, while the armoured car chasing it is forced to bulldoze its way through walls and over cars to keep up, and an RPG rocket is launched at Bruce with the velocity of someone throwing a tennis ball for a dog, giving him plenty of time to steer around it. Then after many more bullets are dodged - even really fast ones from an Apache helicopter - the pair are captured by a bad guy and about to be executed. Having just slaughtered about two hundred people in half an hour of mindless violence, in this scene the bad guy suddenly slows down and takes time to eat a carrot and emote about a career he might have had in tap dancing, just long enough so that Bruce and Bruce Jr can break free and overwhelm half a dozen heavily armed men with only their distracting giggling and a small knife.As usual in Die Hard, Bruce remains remains virtually unmarked and limp-free throughout, although his regulation white singlet does get grubbier every time he's blown up/shot at/beaten/thrown off a building/falls through a window. So that, at least, is realistic.Everything else is not. Stupid action, stupid dialogue, stupid baddies, stupid plot twists and stupid science. Did you know that radiation that's been 'pooling in here (Chernobyl) for years' can be easily eradicated by a quick squirt of weapons grade Domestos and an iPad? Nor me. Lucky for Bruce, though, as he rushes into the defunct nuclear plant with only his stubble for protection. Oh, and did I tell you? All this happens in one day - from Bruce's arrival in Moscow, through the mayhem and explosions and the nuclear waste and the drive to Chernobyl, which is apparently in a suburb of Moscow. Oh, and that the drive is made in a car they steal that just happens to have a small arsenal in the boot? Lucky again.None of it matters, because - surprise surprise - Bruce Jr forgives Bruce for years of neglect and calls him Dad for the first time, and they fly home as heroes in a sunset glow. The fact that they leave Moscow smoking behind them, littered with corpses of innocent bystanders and disappointed film-fans is neither here nor there. There's a running 'joke' where Bruce keeps yelling 'I'm on vacation!' One can only hope it's a long one.",A Good Day to Die Hard

200,eched,He's in two car crashes and hit by a car all within the first 30 min,5,16 February 2013,"And, he has nothing to show for any of this. Ya, all these Die Hard films are over the top, but when John can be in two car crashes and be hit dead on by a car and has not been hurt a bit, it's like the guy is in Doom's God mode.But, that's a really small issue over all. There are two main problems here. Number one, very bad camera work, making a few of the action scenes VERY hard to fallow. The car chase scene at the start for example, I think you would have to see it twice to get it.The second issue is there is a mystery element. For most of the film you're not really sure what's going on. In fact the head villain does not reveal himself until the ending of the film. The cons of this is two fold, number one, it feels like there is no main bad guy until the ending of the film where he shows up, and two, since you don't know what's going on until well past the midway point, all the action scenes feel senseless and just there. Oh, we have to run from the bad guys because they are chasing us. Why are they chasing us? Ummmmm, I think it has something to do with some file, not sure. Oh, okay.So, there's really no context for a lot of the stuff that happens. As a result, the action might be big and in your face, but it sure does feel bland.There's a few stunning slow mow shots near the end and the ending itself when the bad guy shows himself is pretty good, but by then chances are the blandness of the film has put you to sleep.Rent it if you're interested.",A Good Day to Die Hard
201,RyanEberhart,"Not One of the Best, But Still Good",9,11 August 2013,"This is not one of my favorite Die Hard movies, but I do maintain that it is better than the second movie. In this movie John McClane tries to repair his relationship with his son, Jack. Jack is played by Jai Courtney. John travels to Moscow because Jack has been arrested for murder. Unbeknownst to John, Jack is a CIA agent on a mission in Moscow.John mistakenly interferes in Jack's mission and causes a lot of problems. The twists in this movie are pretty good. The animosity between John and Jack is also a pretty good facet of the script. The fact that this Die Hard movie has gone international is also a pretty good aspect of the script.The pace of this movie is the same as the other four. Slow for the first ten to fifteen minutes... fast for the rest of the movie.The action scenes are much more elaborate. The chase scene is pretty awesome. The killing of the two main bad guys are more elaborate.I give this 9 stars out of 10. It's the action that gives this movie a boost in stars.",A Good Day to Die Hard

They really should have just stopped with Vengeance. The story (or lack thereof) is dull, formulaic and done to death, you can see the so-called ""plot-twist"" coming a mile away. The action is beyond ridiculous even for a Die Hard movie. Willis is a mere shadow of his former self; the wisecracks are tired, flat and watered-down, his lines are delivered without the same sarcastic energy, buzz and wit as 18 years ago (Die Hard with a Vengeance). Oh, and Jai Courtney has to be the worst actor ever, he's as wooden as a redwood forest - the aggression his character has for Willis' character is completely over the top, he seems to know only two expressions: angry and angrier - every line he spits out is pure aggression, even when it's not required in the scene.

204,DaRick89,An aggressively mediocre blight upon the Die Hard franchise,4,11 November 2018,"As an action film, A Good Day to Die Hard is aggressively mediocre, containing lots of noise and spectacle but little in the way of engagement or heart. As a Die Hard movie, it is incontestably a blight upon the franchise's respectable name.Why? Well, although there's plenty of action punctuated throughout the film, said action scenes are surprisingly dull despite all of the carnage being wrought upon the screen. Indeed, I often found myself looking out the window during these scenes. It may be that the abuse of CGI, especially in the finale, requires the viewer to suspend too much disbelief. Perhaps the various close-ups of actors and vehicles during the action scenes make it more difficult to understand what is happening. Maybe the indiscriminate damage and destruction overwhelm the viewer's senses and accordingly repels them rather than attracting them to the film. Compare this film to the original Die Hard - there was a great deal of tension punctuated by moments of memorable action. Basically, great action films use action, noise and carnage judiciously rather than trying to overwhelm the viewer with them.Additionally, in the original Die Hard Bruce Willis suffered serious, but believable, injury. In this film, Willis' character goes through tribulations that would have killed most people several times over and yet emerges comparatively unscathed, further undermining the film's credibility.Unfortunately, said credibility is further undermined by the film's decision to reference and therefore remind the viewer of this film's inferiority compared to older and better Die Hard films. This is seen by the manner of the villain's death, the use of a helicopter during the film's finale and even the shooting of nearby glass to inflict pain.If the action in an action film is mediocre then the plot is rarely better and regrettably the same is true here. In truth, the plot does have some twists that are theoretically intriguing (such as the revelation of the film's true villain) but they're executed in such a way as to elicit dull surprise rather than genuine astonishment. Beyond that, the plot is not much more than a typical action rescue film and there are a number of plot holes. For example, the villain's motivations are never made entirely clear and so it is hard to feel anything towards them. Additionally, why are an American drone and a military helicopter allowed to remain unmolested in Moscow airspace? How did Willis and Jai Courtney get from Moscow to Pripyat so quickly?As for the dialogue, a few Willis wisecracks brought a smile to my face but beyond that there's little to note. The new Willis catchphrase ""I'm on vacation!"" doesn't exactly have the impact of ""Yippee ki yay mother******!"". Plus my version doesn't have subtitles for the Russian dialogue so you have no idea what they're saying to one another. The sheer noise and carnage further obscures the dialogue.The acting is dragged down to the film's mediocre level. Willis' intermittent wisecracks elevate him above the rest but he still seems like a tired, grey shadow of his usual bustling self. Courtney has plenty of physical presence but little personality, being saddled with a one-dimensional 'tough guy' character that, beyond one vaguely touching scene towards the end, has little chemistry with Willis. As for the villains - who cares? Yuliya Snigir looks nice, I guess, but beyond that they're all interchangeable.Ultimately, this film might not inspire hatred but it just isn't recommendable to anyone. Action film lovers will find the film surprisingly dull despite its excess, Die Hard fans will simply long for the older, better films, while regular movie-goers will wonder why they are even watching.2/5 stars",A Good Day to Die Hard

One of the best scenes of the trilogy is when he's in the tower picking glass out of his feet, afraid of what's gonna happen next. This made him a more human hero then what we're used to. In this, John doesn't get one scratch on him. John McLane is not Rambo people. The twist is the worst of the series, had the worst villain, turns out it's an evil scientist and his daughter who may or may not be in love with him, hard to tell. I love the fact that when they're in a nuclear fallout zone, they don't have any protective gear on whatsoever, ""John McLane can survive radiation poisoning."" Number 4 is also pretty bad, starting the trend of making him seem more invincible, having a pretty lousy villain, who acts like a child.

There was not really a lot of positives as this didn't even really feel like a Die Hard movie. The whole direction of the movie and the way it relied on so much green screen really pulls you out as practical effects was a big part of the original movies.

207,aminjacoub,A good day for die of crap,2,15 May 2013,"I am a fan of the first two DH movies. Second one is my all time favorite. Third, I did not like much, but it was OK. However I think DH slightly falls down with fourth installment which I did not like, but still had hopes to watch better next one. But now we have something that movie makers could be ashamed of to call it Die Hard movie. Bruce Willis as John McLane is not the same old McLane at all. At least that's what I felt. All he presented here is Bruce Willis as a brand with well known tag line everybody already know and which made him an movie icon. The story which is very predictable and looks like low budget action flick, is build up with technically high-end scenes in vast amount. The action in the movie mostly seems ridiculous and stupid, and have only purpose here: Demonstration. To be honest, it is a spectacular look of the latest technical art, yet dull and synthetic without heart at all. In my opinion it is great for demonstration is amusement park, but not as a part of DH concept destroying element. This was obvious from the start. The chasing on the streets of Moscow were nothing more but thousands of crashes, explosions, cars destroying mayhem, and so stupid that reveals the complete movie itself as a high tech garbage. It might be great as a reference material to test home cinema systems, but not to sacrifice name of one of the best movie franchise in movie history.",A Good Day to Die Hard
208,janus-20,"""it's not 1986 anymore !""",7,16 February 2013,"Thus spake Alik, the latest in a long (and usually misguided) line of heinous cads to lock horns with Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) in the Die Hard film franchise.This carrot crunching, hoofer, furthers his impromptu history lesson, whilst holding our heroes at gun point, by adding,""Reagan is dead !"" The dastardly mercenary is opining to John McClane's archaic methods of law enforcement. After that as we get back on track and everything started to splinter and shatter again, i had some time to think.There is a delicious irony here, which was also sniffed at, but not as successfully integrated into the narrative as it could have been, in Die Hard 4.0 as well.Justin Long asks McClane, in that last installment, ""why are you still THAT GUY"" ? (i'm paraphrasing), to which McClane retorts that no one else is offering to fill his shoes (or lack thereof, geddit ?).The irony, to me, being that every ranting review of this film i've cast an eye over this week, is asking the same question from the opposite side of the screen, ""why are they still doing this"" ?Maybe for opposite reasons, to the audience, they feel that the better tropes of the series have been allowed to slide, villains, viscera and a good plot. From McClane's point of view, that the people in charge of the world he inhabits refuse to meet the constant threat of scumbags and dirtballs it faces, with the more direct methods he favours.Yet, there's the question, why still bother, well based on this entry it could be seen to be puzzling (although i would challenge you to offer me any franchise where the fourth sequel is even approaching the quality of the original movie).The Die Hard films have been with us twenty five years now and the zeitgeist our friend Alik is referring to has shifted, i think in anyone's view, to the wholly different mindset of today and ""action films"" have changed right along with it.People will still turn out for this franchise, it would seem from recent box office, but its two feet are planted in different worlds. The makers struggling with past content and modern form.I feel these issues, as i said, that have been mentioned in passing, could, in the right hands, be the saviour of the series (if a sixth episode is at hand) and what an ironic rescue it would be.To address these issues, of past versus present, that McClane's ability to ""Die Hard"" is not just physical (which is far more what the last two films have interpreted it as), but it is also his whole personal ideology. The first two films tested McClane's principal's and metal, against not only a physical threat, but against redundant bureaucracy. Since then, (particularly in the two recent movies) his only impediments have been physical. Don't struggle with McClane's persona being out of step with the modern world, embrace it, remind the audience (and the villains) why we still need ""that guy"" in the wrong place at ANY time !With regards to the present, A Good Day To Die Hard, is loud (whew is it loud), bombastic and fairly brief. There is enjoyment to be had from it, its not as terrible as runaway emotions would have you believe, but its not brilliant either. When U.S. Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson referred to ""bang for your buck"" he was talking about this movie (i think).",A Good Day to Die Hard
209,FallsDownz,The End of Die Hard Franchise ?,3,23 February 2013,"I don't know why they choose John Moore to be director of A Good Day To Die Hard because this movie is huge as you can see it's 25 years since the first one. When i saw the movie , i'm just so angry at it because i just can't see the things that it should have be in Die Hard movies. The first things and this is may be the most unforgivable things in the movie is about Die Hard there's not a single scene in this movie that i can just say "" Wow that's die hard "" not a single. All the action scene are just mindless shooting and explode everything around them. This is Die Hard movie if there's no Die Hard scene with it then why it's even call a Die Hard movie if you know what i'm saying. The second things is the story is just so repetitive i mean this kind of story we've already seen it like thousand times. The third things is the characters , some characters are just so pointless and not even an interesting characters. Speak of new characters lets talk about "" Jack "" he's a son of McClane he's suppose to makes the movie better you know more potential in the action scene something , but no all he do is ruined the entire movie and honestly he's not even a interesting character for me. I think the big fan of Die Hard are just going to be so painful and angry at this one like some of my friends. The movie is not that bad if you think this is not a Die Hard movie or if you remove the name Die Hard out of its title. But as you know it's a Die Hard movie and it just completely garbage.

When there isn't action, the dialogue is very cheesy and the plot is more suited to some Denzel Washington or Mel Gibson 90's thriller than this action frenzy. Bruce Willis, who in all of the other films actually goes through some emotional stress, feels sidelined to a by-stander in this film as Jai Courtney uses up double the amount of bullets his gun holds. There isn't really anything wrong about Courtney but people go to see a Die Hard film for Willis who is so much more likable than the young Aussie actor. Sebastian Koch, who plays the main villain, isn't necessarily bad but you never feel his presence on screen and the character he plays doesn't actually seem that bad or a horrible person. Although the film ends up using one too many double-crosses, if you sit back and don't think about how ludicrous it is that two men can blow up pretty much the whole of Moscow, you will be entertained.",A Good Day to Die Hard

214,SylvesterFox007,"This Ain't Shakespeare, Pal",8,17 February 2013,"Bruce Willis cracks wise. Cars crash. Bullets fly. Things explode spectacularly. If this is what you're expecting from ""A Good Day to Die Hard"", you won't be disappointed.It should go without saying that the Die Hard movies aren't exactly Shakespeare. While the first in the series revolutionized the action genre, the title has become a brand name that fans trust, and audiences have a fair idea what to expect with each new entry. Most Bruce Willis movies are carried by the star's charisma and likability, and unlucky NYPD detective John McClane is his quintessential role. While the first two movies were based on separate novels, the third was a finished script tweaked to include the McClane character, and the fourth was a dramatization of an article on cyberterrorism, Skip Woods' script may be the first written intentionally around the hero of the franchise. Not only does it have some nice nods to the previous films, but it hits all the major bullet points of the formula. As always, McClane finds himself in the most dangerous situations when he's off duty (""I'm supposed to be on vacation!"" he growls several times when he's held at gunpoint). He gets out of desperate situations by improvising dangerous feats that would make James Bond think twice. Only to begin chastising himself, out loud for the audience's benefit, after he's already taken the plunge and realized what a stupid idea it was.Unfortunately, the movie lacks a strong villain for McClane to play cat and mouse with. Previous movies had Alan Rickman, Jeremy Irons, and Timothy Olyphant chewing the scenery in that capacity. This time, evil is mainly personified by the forgettable Radivoje Bukvic, but, like William Sadler in ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"", he's not as important as the series of plot twists and turns slowly revealing a greater evil at play. Only brief moments of exposition break up the set pieces here, starting with a lengthy car chase, one of the best I've seen in a long time, during which everything you'd want to have happen in a chase scene does. The action moves from the Moscow highway to Chernobyl, packed with exciting pyrotechnics and stunts that look like they'd be fun in real life if it weren't for the fact that they'd maim anyone who hadn't already thwarted major terrorist plots four times before.This time, McClane learns his estranged son, John ""Jack"" McClane Jr., is about to stand trial in Moscow. Wanting to reconcile before Jack's thrown in prison, John Sr. makes it to the courtroom right as his son escapes, along with another prisoner awaiting trial (Sebastian Koch). Mary Elizabeth Winstead returns as John's daughter Lucy. While she doesn't get to see any of the action this time around, she's still great in the role and it's nice to see some continuity with the previous movie from six years ago. Jai Courtney, for his part, does a good job playing McClane's son, sharing his dad's short temper and penchant for yelling at himself when he makes a mistake. But the real stand out is Yuliya Snigir as Irina, the beautiful daughter of Jack's fellow escapee. Big eyed, pouty lipped, and leather clad, Yuliya Snigir is seriously gorgeous and commands more screen presence than any of the other newcomers to the series.My only real complaint is that the movie ends too quickly. After the story's best plot twist, when the movie seems to be picking up real momentum, the movie reaches its finale at around the length the other Die Hard movies were just gearing up for their third act. The ""Yippee- Ki-Yay"" catchphrase is thrown in there, and it feels a little too obligatory.To recap, Bruce Willis does what Bruce Willis does best, the stunts and explosions are thrilling and come non-stop, the script includes some truly surprising twists, and Yuliya Snigir's mouthful of a name is about to become a household one. While ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is far from the best in the series, it sure beats most of the alternatives playing in theaters this February.",A Good Day to Die Hard
215,atlihafsteinsson,Repelling mess,2,1 May 2013,"When my dad and I left the theater after the screening of this ham-fisted sequel, he struck up a conversation with me about the absurd helicopter scene (those who have seen the movie know which one I mean). The entire drive home, he told me how helicopters would never, ever be able to do that. For him to get so worked up over a film device says something about what a disengaging failure of a film this is.A Good Day to Die Hard is nothing like the other films. There are no worthwhile villains, for starters. They feel like complete jokes next to the Grüber brothers, with no menace or personality. Even worse, the movie thinks that a plot twist as to who the REAL villain is can make up for it. It does not, and feels very tacked-on.There is no emotional investment with anything. Remember how McClaine was desperate to save his wife, as well as the people around her? Remember how, while he was drawn into it against his will, he was desperate to stop the bad guys in Die Hard 3? No such imaginative set-up here, the scenario basically being a big weapons deal. Yawn.Worse still, McClane is relegated to the sidekick of his son, Jack. Jack McClane is a completely unlikeable character and you just wish his father John would step up and stop saying things like ""I'm just here on vacation"", over and over. Suspension of disbelief is on the ""oh please"" level all the time (is there no police in Moscow?).So basically, A Good Day to Die Hard is not a good day for Die Hard.",A Good Day to Die Hard
216,loulou1992,Studio will not listen or learn....,4,18 July 2014,"Die Hard has been around over 20 years and sham eon the people involved in the making of this.....Especially Bruce Willis.It didn't have the Die Hard feel like the first 3 did, the 4th was slightly off but you knew it was a DH. But this just feels like another Bruce Willis action-ER thriller, a good one but not enough to make it god enough to be part of the series. First of all why choose a director that's not handled anything to this scale before, if you was gonna do it right then you'd get guys from the 80's and 90's that are known for the magic they created in their action films, guys that should heart and soul for the formula. And Bruce Willis should of checked out John Moore's previous crap and said NO WAY... But then I guess he doesn't care for John Mclane anymore and just taking a big easy paycheck, If that is the case Brucey don't do a 6th one unless your bringing back a worthy director . If you love Die Hare you will/Might enjoy it or you wont full stop. If you don't Give a sh** then you will enjoy it buts its not what it should be. 7/10",A Good Day to Die Hard
217,febru3012,Just below a FAST & FURIOUS for action but very good action.....,7,7 July 2013,"I rated this picture a 7 because you have to suspend more than the accustomed ""Hollywood Disbelief"" factor when watching this movie to not spoil the balance of the movie. Here are two examples what I mean by suspending the disbelief factor 1) the usual assault machine guns with an endless supply of ammo and 2) John and his son Jack diving through a window and falling 10 floors through glass and wooden platforms getting up and diving into a construction chute and falling another 10 floors. This really does stretch reality and takes way from the movie. The action scenes are great and no one really goes to these action movies for the script or dialogue. This movie is what it is and delivers a good portion of violence and action. If that's your bag A Good Day To Die Hard is definitely for you. As an aside, I really don't get people that go to these movies and are expecting what? Shakespeare? If Shakespeare is what you want GO TO Shakespeare.",A Good Day to Die Hard
218,krazysoon,A good day to skip this movie,3,16 May 2013,"I was looking forward to seeing this as soon as I seen the movie previews. It made it seem as if the movie was going to be action packed from start to finish. As you may know the movie involves Bruce Willis traveling to Russia to see his son who was arrested for a crime and facing charges. The plot was very weak and I didn't know what was going on until the last half hour of the movie. The acting is horrendous. Jai Courtney should just give up acting if he approaches all his roles as he did in this. Lack of emotion and no real chemistry between him and Willis. A few one liners were funny. Bruce Willis character was not the same person he was in the previous die hard films. He was too soft and the intensity wasn't there. It's as if the director advised everyone to not show emotional during filming. A few of the action scenes were OK but nothing memorable. Many reviews found the film to be boring and though it is a bit dry for the most, I wasn't too bored because I didn't have high expectations for the film. I also wouldn't claim it to be the worst movie ever but the worst in the Die Hard franchise. Surprisingly the film actually grossed over 300 million worldwide but a majority of that came from overseas.it only grossed about 60 million in America. I would recommend that when you decide to watch this make sure you know what to expect before you watch it and please lower your expectations.Supposedly a Die Hard 6 is in the works and is going to take place in Tokyo.",A Good Day to Die Hard
219,jan_kalina,"""You got a plan?""",6,30 March 2013,"That is John McClane's question to his son. ""Not really. I kinda thought we would just wing it, you know. Running in, guns blazing! Make it up as we go,"" says John Mcclane Jr. (who is for reasons unknown called Jack for most of the movie.) That's also probably what the makers of this film were thinking while shooting this latest addition to the beloved Die Hard franchise. The film feels like it doesn't have much of a script, it doesn't have any of the usual one-liners that were one of the reasons that we grew fond of the character of John McClane. Oh, there actually is one. Willis repeats "" I'm on vacation"" throughout the film. It is funny the first time he says it, but you get tired of it when he says the line for the fifth time. Another big problem is that this film lacks a villain. All the previous Die Hard films stood on the confrontation between McClane and the main villain. They communicated with walkie-talkies and didn't even meet 'till the finale. But there was this tension and fear from both sides that there is this possibility that one could bring down the other. I can't go on and call that tap dancing, carrot chewing clown a villain. But I don't want to be all negative. If this film wouldn't have Die Hard in name, it would have been actually good action flick. You get enough explosions and smashed cars, everything you were promised in the trailers. You also get an helicopter smashing through a building, which is one of the things I love the most in action films: destroying helicopters. As an action flick to waste some time with it is OK. It just lacks in the story and characters department. Bruce Willis doesn't act at all in this film. It's like he goes on autopilot. Plus he doesn't play John McClane, the ordinary man from the streets, who winds up being at the wrong place at the wrong time and has to use his wit and skills to outsmart the bad guys. No, he plays John McClane, the superhero, who never gets hurt and his only objective is to kill all the scumbags. In all the previous films he wasn't looking for trouble, but trouble found him. Here he is looking for trouble.The Die Hard franchise should have been left alone after the brilliant fourth installment Live Free or Die Hard. I guess you can rent this film when you have got nothing better to do on a rainy afternoon and want to kill some time with a simple action movie.",A Good Day to Die Hard
220,cultjones,A Good Day To Give Die Hard a Miss,5,28 July 2013,"John McClane travels to Russia to be by his son's side who is involved in a murder but in typical McClane style, chaos ensues and he's in the middle of it. Bruce Willis has survived the test of time to become Hollywood royalty in that he can do any movie and his appeal probably won't dwindle even if it bombs. As he continues the Die Hard franchise which propelled him to stardom after his stint in the comedy drama, Moonlighting, the anticipation was palpitating. However, the latest instalment misses the mark and does so by a long shot! Willis is more of a stereotypical 'John Wayne' type of obnoxious American tourist who barks unassumingly 'I'm on a vacation' between regular intervals of gun fire and explosions. Some of the scenes are baffling such as when in one scene Willis is hand cuffed, his son has a knife and cuts his own cuffs off and somehow, Willis escapes his and attacks his assailant! There isn't any chemistry worth mentioning between McClane and his son played by Jai Courtney and while Sebastian Koch shines, you're more interested in eye-candy, Yuliya Snigir.The plot is ambitious but not gripping in the slightest in spite of some great stunts. Moore's direction and McClane's character does the glowing franchise a great disservice. Perhaps every franchise has one? I mean Rocky had Rocky V! With Die Hardest (6) expected in 2015 let's hope Willis can eclipse the blunder that is, A Good Day to Die Hard.",A Good Day to Die Hard

I liked the villains (Die Hard villains always tend to be a treat and a tad higher on the cool-villain-meter than most movies pretending to be Die Hard movies). Some of the cinematography and choice of angles for certain action scenes were inspiring. It has it's positives that are outweighed by the fact that John McClane will never ever be John McClane ever again, not while he is teaming up with every different kind of side-kick imaginable and skipping around the globe like a superpower-less superhero.Bring back the whole ""octopus stuck in a glass jar full of terrorists"" structure the first one delivered with finesse and end the Die Hard franchise with some dignity.Some ideas: DIE HARDEST; DIE HARDER AND HARDER, AND HARDER; DIE HARD or GO HOME; DIED HARD; DIED HARD, WITH A GUN IN HIS POCKETor, go the Sylvester Stallone route and to put a fresh face on the franchise, simply call it:McCLANE",A Good Day to Die Hard
222,simondclinch-1,A good day to watch something else,5,9 June 2014,"I have to agree with the rating on this one. I think the moral here is: treat the audience like fools and they will think you the fool.The keystone of the plot is the silliest. If you were a stranger to Washington DC or London and you had vague information that your son was in a particular one of these locations being held by the authorities, you could hardly expect to bump into them at random while travelling to the courthouse. Let's take London for example. A taxi from Heathrow to the Old Bailey would approach the Old Bailey from the West. The most likely remand location however, would be Wandsworth prison to the South. So that's a 90 degree difference in approach which is exactly average in fact, given that there is always an acute angle between two random direct paths to the same point. I imagine Moscow or any other city would be no different. The same rules apply.Of course, I didn't calculate all this while watching - the silliness was plain enough right there and undermines the rest of the plot such as it is.Asking myself what would be a better plot, what about some real terrorists?

Cons, there can only be cons because what was good about this was so minuscule that I will never mention. Anyone who has ever seen the previous actual Die Hard films know that this is a huge embarrassing step down from the over-the-top script with the crazy action that makes you want to scream out loud because the main character actually had something you liked even loved. This movie had nothing to love, give or admire, it's a pathetic attempt at a sequel to the franchise. It was so terrible I don't even honestly consider it as being part of the Die Hard franchise because it didn't live up to the expectations or name. The only thing clever about this was the title.

The movie would have been acceptable if Bruce Willis would have not been casting in it, but then they would have had to change the title. Seriously, this garbage makes him look senile and old (true fact) by having lame dialog lines and not to add very poor character development.I only wish they would have at least killed him at the end so he would try to die like a hero, but ""nooo"" they had to make him look like Chuck Norris (or a very bad imitation). For crying out loud, they can't even shoot straight in this movie but bullets still hit their target.The plot sucks because in the attempt to make a twist in the story they just made it look so confusing that it just got so boring making me hope that there would be at least one piece of the movie that would make it interesting. Imagine my disappointment when I reached the end of the movie thinking ""I don't get this movie, it just defies any law of purpose"".Maybe this type of movies were huge back in the 80-90's but seriously this is to outdated and Bruce just ain't up for this anymore (he should take a permanent vacation from acting, in my opinion).I grade this movie with 2 stars in respect to the previous movies, but still considering this movie, I would not recommend it nor watch it again.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Too many tropes and too many stereotypes are mixed together to make the movie more than predictable and borderline cheesy. Although the plot itself would be not too bad it suffers from an undefined /underdeveloped villain and it could never bring the point across that the stakes are just as high as in all the previous installments. Although the chemistry between Willis and Courtney (who could basically play Michael Rosenbaum's younger twin) is pretty good, the setups for their character scenes aren't.

For instance, the lack of his funny rants that are in the other movies.Some of the action was artistic. The car chase was not too long, but what made it feel long was that it lacked a lot of suspense.I believe that this movie was simply rushed and thrown together. Plus, its a good 15-20 minutes shorter than the other movies.The thing I liked most about the movie was the development of the father son conflict. Which, I think that jack and john should have got into a physical fight when John started messing up Jack's operation.Overall, this Die Hard installment is one that shouldn't be taken seriously, but isn't so bad that it deserves anything lower than a 5/10 rating.",A Good Day to Die Hard

247,Jipper2,Just Stop Already.,4,1 August 2013,"I'm a die hard, Die Hard fan but the last two incarnations, had no idea as to what a Die Hard movie should be. The last two movies were made under the thought that it's the action that made Die Hard. That couldn't be further from the truth. What made Die Hard was the normal man, surviving the odds. Which included a lot of action. In the last two Die Hard's John McClain has become near Superman instead of a common man who defies the odds. The only thing I'll give this movie is that is was better than Live Free Die Hard but that isn't saying much at all. Stop being unbelievably unrealistic and get back to the humanity of the original movies. Stop trying to pair Bruce Willis up with a young male lead. He doesn't need it and it doesn't work. After Die Hard with a Vengeance you can just stop watching. That's where the Die Hard's died for me.4/10 not even an average movie.

248,HandHStudios,A Bad Day to Die Hard,5,19 February 2013,"First of all, let me say I am a huge Die Hard fan. I really expected this movie to be good, and thought the trailer was decent enough. So i went and saw it. Big mistake.This movie is a not a Die Hard movie. It has no Die Hard qualities to it. The other movies had small, compact spaces; one or two locations (the 3rd one is an exception);cat-and-mouse games;evil villains who added suspense and character to the story; of this movie had none of those things.For example, it took place in so many locations. We move from a house to a ballroom to Chernobyl (which McClane and his son get to pretty fast considering they're driving from Moscow to Ukraine). Also, this movie had very little storyline. We go from John Jr. hating his father to loving him in a matter of minutes. And also, why couldn't John call for CIA backup once they were out of harm's way? It doesn't make sense. Plus, a plethora of Bruce Willis/John McClane one liners did not save this movie's script from crashing and burning. ""Let's go kill some motherf***ers."" Really? Couldn't come up with anything better? On a brighter note, the action was there, but pervasive and shoot-em-up. John Moore, being a typical 21st century quick, fast shot director, decides to have fast frames to the point where we don't even know what's happening. I also liked the plot twist at the climax, and how they brought back some clichés from the first movie **SPOILER** (With the main villain falling from a helicopter, similar to hands Gruber falling from the building) **END SPOILER** and others. But overall, this was a generic action movie that didn't have a well-developed story line or characters. It used action movie clichés and fast shots to show the violence and chases, something not very liked. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was constructed first and then the Die Hard name lent itself to it.HandHStudios Rating: 5/10",A Good Day to Die Hard

250,TheFilmFreak1,A Bad Day for the Die Hard Franchise,4,27 June 2017,"A Good Day to Die Hard, the latest in the multi-million dollar series, is a deceptive film. It's opening five or so minutes, which see multiple plot threads being set up with Nolanesque aplomb, seduce you into letting your guard down which is when the film's putrid awfulness strikes. But what is this awfulness? Well, it's not the meagre script, nor is it Bruce Willis' disinterested performance, nor is it the absence of any remotely interesting or intimidating villains, nor is it the fact that this film turns Willis into a bloody sidekick – because obviously the producers thought that what the public wanted to see from in the next Die Hard film is John McClane being made to look a useless twit by his punk kid – no, it's simply the cinematography. Oh, the cinematography. I swear, if you had given the camera to a drunken geriatric with Parkinson's, you would have gotten a better image. Shaky-cam, zoom- ins and shutter-speed are just some examples of the visual savagery Moore employs in this magnum crapus of his. Even the stupid ending can't overshadow the horribly rough look of this film, though by God it tries. I won't spoil it for you, but suffice to say, it makes the Fighter Jet antics of Die Hard 4 look positively Dogme 95 in comparison. Yet that's to be expected when you get the guy who wrote X-Men Origins: Wolverine to do your screenplay. However, if you can get over the aesthetic and intellectual deficits, this film DOES have a lot of explosions.",A Good Day to Die Hard

252,mjscarface,"A joyless, empty-headed mess - best avoided",4,8 March 2014,"'A Good Day to Die Hard' has the dubious honour of not only having the worst title in a series full of dodgy subtitles, but of being the worst film in general. The best thing you could say about it is that it makes you forgive any flaws found in the previous four films.The original 'Die Hard' is, for my money, the best action film ever made. It's a perfect marriage of performance, action and script. 'AGDTDH' on the other hand is more like a quickie in a darkened room with an overpriced hooker.After some vague plot points in the opening sequence, we are reintroduced to Detective John McClane. His son Jack has got into some trouble in Russia and faces a long stretch in prison. So John flies to Moscow, his plan apparently consisting of wandering the streets until he bumps into his son. Anyway, it turns out that Jack is a CIA operative whose mission to rescue a political prisoner is cocked up by the arrival of his wisecracking dad.A huge problem with this film is that the plot is so convoluted and poorly laid out that for about half the film, the audience have no clue as to what is going on. The biggest action sequence, the initial and lengthy car chase which reunites father and son, has no stakes and no regard for decent editing. It's just a big, dumb and uninteresting effects reel, much like the rest of film. Every 'Die Hard' up to this point has succeeded in delivering the action. The jet-surfing antics in 'Die Hard 4.0' may have been ludicrous, but it was memorable and exciting. This, on the other hand, can't even stage a decent gunfight and the helicopter finale is just a longer version of an earlier set-piece.The worst thing about 'AGDTDH', though, is the script. It's awful - from the story itself, to the dull villains and inane dialogue. The banter between John and son just consists of the same three or so lines: ""I'm your Dad!"", ""Shut up John!"", ""Damn you John!"" Oh and let's not forget that comedy zinger that gets used a dozen times where McClane shouts ""I'm on vacation!"" Only, he's not on vacation because he's specifically travelled to Russia to find his son. It just goes to show that having Bruce Willis simply show up with a bunch of f-bombs is not the same as making a legitimate Die Hard film. There is zero tension, no imagination or wit and you know a film is going to be bad it can't even do opening titles right (location headings in one corner, actors names in another).There is much more I could bring up such as stupid Chernobyl aspect whereby radiation is not an issue and a nuclear stockpile is left sitting there for anyone to collect. Or the way that McClane's character has gone from sympathetic everyman to unlikely superhero to the typical ugly American, knocking out innocent civilians for speaking THEIR OWN LANGUAGE.Why four stars then? I guess I'm a sucker for seeing vehicular destruction on screen and the finale to that particular sequence did provide that. Also, this film gets a star purely for the cabbie who serenades McClane early on in the film.In short, it's not just the worst in the series but a pretty poor action film in general and not recommended.",A Good Day to Die Hard
253,dumaal,lame,1,28 May 2013,"Apart from visual effects which were alright, the movie was unimaginably weak. Cartoons have way better dialogs than those in this movie. It offends viewer's intelligence with everything: They spray a radioactive room and suddenly there is no radiation and everybody gets undressed and start fighting. Had been more appropriate if John McLane farted to clear the danger. Father - son dialogs were perfect for monkeys with no IQ, and the two were the smartest guys in the whole movie. Two Americans came to make order in Russia... considering how dumb they were I am sure Russians had no need to get upset by the plot since the laugh was really this time on the US. When the bad guy suddenly started spoken bad, it was so obvious that there was a need for him to get killed, and there was no reason yet. ...and a special mention to Cernobil - Grenoble scene which, really is not something worth putting in a movie. Well, terrible, considering the franchise.",A Good Day to Die Hard
254,MoviesWithX,"More like ""... Die Easy"". Don't know if anyone used that yet, but I'm doing it anyway.",4,13 July 2021,"No. Just no. This is like the ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" of the franchise right here. But I still like that movie more. Because that movie still is at least closer to what makes an Indy film, in spite of its absurdity. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a far cry from the Die Hard franchise. I know some didn't like ""Live Free or Die Hard"" but that one feels like it's a part of the original trilogy compared to this. They got one of the worst directors to direct a movie in a franchise that is known for being competently directed. Enter John Moore. He's directed such critical darlings such as ""Behind Enemy Lines"" (OK, I actually like this one but it's not great. I admit that.), ""Max Payne"", ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (2004), ""The Omen"" (2006), and ""I. T."". I've only seen the first two films listed, as well as the film we're talking about now. And so what they went back to the R-rating? This is a movie that proves that the MPAA rating of a movie doesn't imply quality. Some folks go ""PG-13? That's for suckas."" Well, the R rating meant jack here. It's just a little bloody at times, and some bad words. And speaking of jack, ""Jack"" as in ""Jack McClane"" is in this one as a spy or something. He's portrayed by Jai Courtney and I didn't really care for his work here. Moreso, I just don't care for the character of Jack. I got tired of his moaning about John not being a good father. Even if there is some bad blood between them for solid reasons, we just know John as a extremely likeable hero. So maybe it's natural to be annoyed with anybody giving John a hard time, because Lucy was sort of cold to him in the fourth film. You feel like you only have to care about this guy because he's John's son, and even with that in mind it was still a tough sell for me. Even worse are the villains. They are a joke. An unfunny joke, but a joke nonetheless. Angelica Pickles from ""Rugrats"" would make a better villain here. And of course, when talking about the films in this series, you got to talk about the action and the filmmaking. Awful camera work and editing. And the set pieces are unremarkable as well. Certain shots look OK to me, but very few. There's also the matter of the way that John's signature catchphrase is used. In my other reviews talking about the other films, I haven't mentioned the catchphrase. I am here because it's used in such a dumb, lazy way. He may as well have not even said it. The most that I can give this movie is that I don't think it's boring, and it's in keeping with the other films by having something going on most of the time. Not making some political statement here so please just don't with me, but I don't think Russia is that great of a setting for a Die Hard movie. Not because it's nowhere in the US, but it didn't make an interesting setting for me. I don't know, maybe that's just based on my disappointment in this. Bruce Willis seems like he's in ""straight-to-DVD"" mode with his performance as McClane, his most iconic character. I get he's older, but is John still in there? If not, the effort is wasted. I do not like this movie but I'm grateful to it for only one thing and that is the fact that it killed the ""prequel-sequel"" that was in development. It sounded worse than this.",A Good Day to Die Hard
255,siebertws13,"The ""Die Hard"" Franchise Finally Dies.",3,30 March 2013,"(Very minor and/or mild spoilers, but I don't want to tempt the IMDb godz).If you consider it merely as the latest short, fast, generic action spectacle, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is, I suppose, acceptable. It's got a series of huge and elaborate action sequences, each one bigger than the last, and it's over before you know it. But if you see it as the last nail in the franchise coffin, we won't blame you either.In his career's signature role, Bruce Willis remains game for the fifth film, but the script is painfully weak and the rapid-fire direction shaky and chaotic. The father-estranged son byplay -- John McClane, Jr. is a spy! -- has its moments but is mostly groan- inducingly hackneyed; Justin Long was a far more clever and better partner in the last one than muscular Jai Courtney here. The movie has lots of shooting but very little fighting, and all the guns get repetitive quickly. It takes place in Russia but was shot in Budapest and despite all the explosions, looks cheap; the CGI stuff is obvious, laughably so in spots, and the film barely breaks the 90 minute mark -- an half hour shorter than any previous entry. Weak villain(s), too.But there's some decent real-life stunt work, and if you like this genre and are merely looking to shut your mind down for 1-1/2 hours to see ridiculous adventures with spectacular car chases and long shootouts and an admittedly thrilling climax with a guy hanging out the back of a helicopter as it spins trying to throw him off, before succeeding and sending him smashing through the side of a building of glass...well, then, you'll probably get your money's worth. Or you could watch the trailer. And if you like watching one of the last true movie stars still giving it his all, getting dirtier and bloodier and beaten up but persevering, it's got that.But if you've loved this series for its ability to keep reinventing itself with new and interesting supporting characters, strong formidable antagonists played by skilled smart actors, and an epic big-Hollywood sweep that feels like an event, A Good Day to Die Hard is a crushing disappointment. It feels like a rush job looking for one final big international payday before its star gets too old. Or, GOD FORBID, hands it off to his ""son.""",A Good Day to Die Hard
256,jukangliwayway,it's a good day to end this franchise,4,26 July 2013,"Really, it's A GOOD DAY TO WRECK CARS. That's the only thing I enjoyed in this movie. I know that in a typical Hollywood action movie, an intricate plot seems to be the director's last priority. Just put in a lot of action scenes, a lot of gunplay, a lot of explosions, and who cares about the plot right? I for one can easily forgive a plot less action flick as long as it delivers on other aspects. But really, Yippe Ki-Yay Mother Russia?? Really?? A sign of a lazy plot is when it involves the CIA and stereotyped Russia. That's just so archaic. They weave this Chernobyl mastermind plot, yes it may sound exciting, but then they just leave it as it is. With no real villain, no real terrorist threat, no real conflict, and no surprise twists. The characters are severely underdeveloped, and if this is the first time you'll watch a Die Hard movie, you might not wanna watch the others because John McClane here is just so blah. His one-liners are basically hit or miss, and his stupid ""I'm on a vacation!!!"" line uttered ad nauseum almost made me wanna stop the movie just to go online to rate AGDTDH 1 Star on Rotten Tomatoes. Jai Courtney as Jack McClane has the right build to be the next Bruce Willis, but his character is just so unlikeable, and the father-son conflict felt forced. The action scenes distracted me from the blandness of the script, but I'm not saying it's something to be impressed about. They messed up a lot of cars and a big ass helicopter that's all i can say. There's nothing more to say about this film because as soon as that credits rolled up, I have forgotten most of it.The Verdict: Forgettable plot, weak script, underdeveloped characters. A prime example of a mediocre movie carrying a big title. Bruce Willis felt like a side kick here and it seems like it's a set-up for Jai Courtney to take over. I think it's A GOOD DAY TO END THIS FRANCHISE. But since they're still making Die Hard 6 - maybe they can use this movie as reference on what NOT to do when making sequels. John Moore should take a sabbatical and reassess his life's ambitions.",A Good Day to Die Hard
257,theneilrules,Unbelievable,3,11 June 2013,"Well, what happened here? Let me tell you - ""The character of John McClane died with this movie"". I really don't know what prompted Bruce Willis to sign a movie with such a stupid script. 2013 saw the comeback of some famous action stars of the 90's. Schwarzenegger in The Last Stand, Stallone in Bullet to the Head and Van Damme in 6 Bullets. All these movies are not great as their 90's counterpart but these are decent movies at least. Willis along with some director John Moore just ruined everything in this sequel of one of the greatest action movies I ever witnessed. Moreover, where are the cops? In the torrid 98 minutes, McClane and his son incite havoc on the streets and buildings of Moscow but not a single police officer shows up. Did they all fled to stop an invasion or what? This is one of the worst action movies I've seen in recent times.

259,Installation_At_Orsk,A Bad Film To Sit Through,4,23 February 2013,"This is the first Die Hard movie that was originally written *as* a Die Hard movie (DH1 and 2 were unrelated novels, DH3 was a script called Simon Says and DH4 was developed from, of all things, an article in Wired magazine)... yet ironically, it's the least Die Hard-like of the entire series.The things that made Die Hard distinctive - McClane's wisecracks and vulnerability, the way he gets under the skin of the villain, his exploitation of space to gain an advantage - are all gone here. McClane is reduced to being Mr Generic Action Hero, leaping into every battle or off every tall building without the slightest fear of getting hurt and barking ""I'm on vacation!"" (which he isn't; he went to Russia to see his son be put on trial for murder! Not exactly a holiday) whenever the script calls for a one-liner. Change a few character names, and it could have been Salt 2 or xXx 3 or Mission: Impossible 5 or 24: The Movie.That's not to say that those films would necessarily have been bad - but they would given the same writer/director combination. The script is nonsensical (there's a big twist that director John Moore admitted in an interview was made up during filming, rendering a major character's storyline pointless while not even making sense; and what on earth was Jack's original plan to get Komarov out of the courtroom?), while Moore's list of directorial tricks is exactly two items long: SHAKE THE CAMERA and SMASH SOMETHING. His action sequences don't build, but start at full intensity and continue without change or relief or remorse for numbing, camera-jolting minutes before abruptly and arbitrarily ending.Even the cinematography is unpleasant; it's an ugly film. Early on, a TV news ticker tells us that it's 24 degrees C in Moscow, but it looks a cold and sickly blue-grey... until at random moments everything turns dazzling orange as if the sun just exploded.Bruce Willis seems bored by the whole affair, rarely rising above a monotone and displaying only a fraction of the charm and wit he did in the previous films, even DH4.0 - his now-infamous appearance on the BBC's The One Show, where he seemed half-asleep and totally uninterested in anything the presenters said, pretty much sums up his performance. The actor playing his son is just as one-note but in a different way - jaw-clenching anger - and none of the other characters even register.That last is perhaps the film's biggest failing, and the reason it seems so un-Die Hard-like; there's no memorable villain. One of the main bad guys never interacts with McClane, and the other is revealed (in the aforementioned ridiculous twist) too late in the day to have any impact. Hans Gruber, come back, all is forgiven! (Hell, come back Colonel Stuart, or even Thomas Gabriel!)",A Good Day to Die Hard
260,colinjbooth,Terrible,1,30 January 2019,"Easily one of the worst movies ever made, and certainly an indication of how Bruce Willis couldn't give a toss these days.Confusing direction, awful writing, lazy acting, stupidity at every turn.How's about that for p**ping all over the legacy of one of the finest action franchises in history.",A Good Day to Die Hard
261,majoreasy,Action without thought to plot,3,10 February 2013,"Not a bad film in terms of action but with plot holes from beginning to end, one just couldn't feel connected to the characters. Seem all the director was interested in was throwing more action in, in lieu of a story. So much so that the McClanes are depicted as super soldiers who cannot be stopped. This is not Die Hard, it is Universal Soldiers. This movie has more plot-holes than Swiss cheese.That the minister would reveal his plan of blackmailing Komarov, right in front of all the prison guards, showed him to be such a poor politician/tactician that he should not have made it so high up in any hierarchy. An American shoots a Russian 'kingpin' (no real mention of who the guy in the club is) and didn't get 'special' treatment in a Russian jail is far-fetched; surely someone would rough him up some just for fun? The court house gets bombed and everybody dies or evacuates, yet the two main characters (prisoners, no less) suffer not a scratch, and walk out without any policemen looking for them. To have an SUV/MPV beat an armoured vehicle on the streets on brute strength and built quality is totally ludicrous, even if the SUV is made by Mercedes Benz. As dumb as a newly-arrived American in Russia, even John McClane should know better to hide from people who will open fire at policemen. Yet there he was, having just escaped alive from a car crash, without any weapons, decides to call out to the automatic-weapon wielding, freely-firing mobsters, along the lines of: hey, here I am, shoot me if you dare! Are Americans bullet-proof when overseas, like Superman when on earth? Snipers (understandably, with them wanting him alive) shoots Komarov in the arm, but got a perfect head shot on the CIA operative. Now, when Jack and Komarov being the people they are after, Jack not getting shot at seemed illogical. Being a CIA safe house and not an army amoury, having a Rambo-styled machine gun just sitting on a table top at John's convenience is laughable. Makes 007 look silly to have to use cool gadgets and wit instead of simply reaching for more fire power. Alas, that's for MI6's to improve upon, perhaps. With an army of 'special forces' like personnel storming a CIA safe house, the planner did not even consider putting a few men on the ground is unforgivable. Yet there they were, our heroes jogged to safety on the streets, and even able to take a break to take care of the wound. I thought they were going to get coffee and cake, well, I was hankering for some at that point. Yes, forget for a second how John got his hands free from being bound, two men muscling out a team of men with automatic weapons makes entertaining watching. The director, sadly, decided to put in a bullet proof bar counter for our heroes to hide behind. Does the movie production team understand the awful power these weapons actually have? Obviously not since they decided to add enough time for father and son to have some family bonding time as the bad guys are shooting at them.If machine guns are not powerful enough to hurt our heroes, maybe a helicopter gun ship might? Nope, clearly not. These guns that can penetrate tanks merely tickled our heroes as they run through the flying bullets and shrapnel, jump through the window, and as luck will have it, lands on a platform merely feet below...they still had to scramble many floors to ground. Meanwhile, more gun fired at them, yet our heroes land with minor scratches only; Hey, I had more cuts, bruises and blood flowing, from a rock climbing incident, and that was just me against the rocks, from less than 15 feet high and with me using all safety equipment available. Jack had a piece of metal stuck in his belly, a wound that would kill or at least render most people incapacitated in real life, simply gets daddy to pull it out and after that was as good as new. We really should send father and son teams into battle, always. By this point, I kinda lost interest with the plot and contemplated the whole American mission to the middle east...why send an army when two guys will do? Two people taking out an army of armed thugs is not impossible with a well planned manouevre but to find enough weapons for a mini war (hand grenades even? What are these Russians on?) in the back of a stolen car, disregarding radioactivity and going with their gut seem to their best play here. Really? I suddenly found my movie snack more absorbing. The rest of the unlikely plot lost my attention, though to be fair, the plot lost me a while back. I was watching to see what other crap they wanted me to swallow, and by this point, I didn't even care about that any more.Shallow plot, characters that we don't really care about and mindless action for the sake of action make this movie not worth watching. If you have a couple of hours to kill and want to watch a Bruce Willis action movie...pop in a Die Hard 1 (the original) DVD instead. Even if you have watched that many times over, it will still be more entertaining than this one. You have been warned...lose almost 2 hours of your life at your own risk.

Even a military style Helo firing at them seems to miss !I mean it's beyond suspending disbelief.. suddenly they've run out of story lines so decided we will just blow up everything , kill lots of innocent people , and stage it in Russia w a sexy woman in charge.

Nope, not by a long shot",2,17 March 2014,"Although a bit skeptical upon watching the fourth Die Hard film, Live Free Or Die Hard, mainly because I felt they wouldn't be able to bring a fresh story to this franchise and also because of the 12 year gap between that film and the third, Die Hard With A Vengeance, I actually quite liked the fourth entry. That aside, because of my miscalculated skepticism for the previous film, I didn't have much of one for this (supposed) fifth entry. I had faith that they, the film makers, would bring another new fresh story to this franchise and that Bruce Willis would once again continue to be awesome in his most famous role as John McClane. Well, I was wrong. The story line was horrible, the acting was horrible and most disappointing, and I mostly blame the writing and directing, Bruce Willis was defiantly off his game in this and not acting as the character film fans and audiences around the world have known and loved since his first appearance on film screens in 1988. The only good thing about this film was that the action scenes were top notch and great to see, but without a good story the rest of it just felt like a last minute thrown together mess. In fact, I will just ignore this film when ever I think of the Die Hard franchise. Defiantly the worst film of 2013 as far as I'm concerned.",A Good Day to Die Hard
265,chewbaccawakka,Should of been better,7,27 February 2013,"It does not feel like a proper Die hard film but not the total disappointment that I expected from the other comments about the film.The idea of having John McClane in Russia looking for his son is a pretty good idea and it could of been done well but unfortunately they took the story to a route that made it less of a Die Hard film.The action and characters was good but it was never clear about who was the main villain like you see in the previous Die Hard films, nothing memorable about them either. (No one can really be as memorable as Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons from the 1st and 3rd films). Bruce Willis was as good as ever, he had a few lines that made him more like John McClane than Die Hard 4.0 but this film didn't really help with its surprisingly short time for a Die Hard film (98 minutes) and it's crappy ""everything explodes for no reason"" style that has suffered in today's action movies since the start of Michael Bay's career. Jai Courtney was alright as his son, the chemistry was okay and he never gets annoying after a while like Justin Long was at times in Die Hard 4.0.If you love the Die Hard films, you will be disappointed. Without watching it as a Die Hard sequel and just watching it as another Bruce Willis action film, it's not that bad.On the plus side (if it means anything), the whole of ""Yippie Ki-Yay mother f****r"" is in there.",A Good Day to Die Hard
266,TiagoRicardo,Yippie Kay Su**s,2,28 December 2013,"I had the lowest expectations before seeing this film. I thought it was going to be bad and perhaps one of the worst movies of the year. After seining it, I managed to be disappointed even with my little expectations. There were huge action sequences like a 20-minute car chasing right in the middle of Moscow with really dumb moments like a freaking tank smashing everything right in the middle of the city. There was also the worst father-son relationship I have ever seen in my entire life (even worst than the Tom Cruise/Dakota Fanning relationship in Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds""). The film also features a ""brilliantly executed"" scene where McClane leaves the cab and suddenly two other drivers leave their own cars right in the middle of the road (I honestly believe that this was just to solve the traffic issue). Despite all this bad things, I learned a valuable lesson with ""A Good Day to Die Hard"": HOW TO GET A FREE RIDE IN A CAB! So listen, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is dumb, but I mean really dumb. I understand that franchises like ""Die Hard"" are great to the cinema industry (in terms of profit obviously) but this has to stop once and for all.

267,madelinehind,rubbish from start to finish,1,3 April 2013,"The fourth pointless sequel to the superb Eighties thriller Die Hard hits a new low. Die Hard ( I suppose this film must be reference to as the original or Die hard One nowadays) was a brilliantly made action movie with an amazing performance by Alan Rickman. It didn't require or invite sequels. The sequel in the airport (DH2) was rubbish , the third one was an improvement on the second, the fourth was OK but not needed and the fifth is just a shameless cash grab.Nothing in Die Hard 5 works. The plot is non existent and idiotically thought out, the acting is appalling ( Willis sleepwalks through his role and Jai Courtenay- who I liked in Jack Reacher- is out of his depth here. he is not capable of carrying a franchise).John Moore directs- a phrase guaranteed to send a shudder through every film buff. Moore is as crappy here as his reputation would suggest. With a Die hard film Moore could have turned his career around but he merely proves once again that he has no talent.The action scenes use Greengrass style shakycam- unless they hired Michael J Fox as DOP- which means even they are unwatchable.

268,complications123,"Has ""Die Hard"" Died for Good?",4,8 June 2013,"When the fourth entry of Die Hard hit the world with a PG-13 rating and something about cyber-terrorism, I rolled my eyes. However, the plot was clever enough and the action scenes were so spectacular that I find myself liking it quite a bit. So when it seemed the franchise would return to it's R-rated roots, I was even more excited. The fifth Die Hard falls completely flat, and is a poor follow up.From the beginning the plot is plain confusing. Maybe if I watched it a couple more times it would make sense, but in a fast paced environment like an action movie, the story should be smooth enough that it only takes a single viewing to know what is happening and why it's happening. I'm still not sure exactly what happened other than the vague threat of nuclear war. The little twists and turns that the movie took were ineffective because it was difficult to grasp what was happening before the twists and what role the characters involved in these twists played.Willis and Courtney had zero chemistry and what was meant to be comedic and touching banter between the two became stale and annoying within 20 minutes. There is so little dialog other than the aforementioned drivel that I found myself unable to hold interest in the familiar ""bad day"" situation which follows McClane throughout the series. In the previous film, there was a nice contrast between the street-savvy yet technologically impaired demeanor of McClane and the relevant situation skills and non-confrontational nature of Matthew. Through decent writing, it was funny at times and created a balance that really connected the characters. In ""Good Day..."" I found McClane to have much less of a genuine spark with his own son.The brisk running time fills most of it's time with moderate action sequences instead of bothering to develop anyone, even going so far as to reduce Willis to little more than a robot, stripping him of any charisma or brutish cleverness with a dash of luck that has defined him thus far. The action scenes are alright, but it isn't enough to keep me coming back to the film. I won't say I didn't like them, but the gun fights and explosions are handled in rather mundane ways without the expected ingenuity from past Die Hards.When and if another Die Hard is made, it will almost surely have to be better than this one or I doubt the studio will even bother to slap a Die Hard label on it. No fun, no originality, and some seriously weak writing easily bump this film down to the bottom of the franchise.",A Good Day to Die Hard

270,Hbarker-32233,Give this francise a rest.,3,21 December 2016,"When I was 13 years old, sneaking into R-rated movies back in the summer of 1988, Die Hard felt downright revolutionary. Clint Eastwood had just hung up his guns in the fifth and final Dirty Harry flick (The Dead Pool, released the very same week that July), thus passing the proverbial torch for sardonic, wise-cracking, blue-collar cops to Bruce Willis. It's tough to imagine now, but at the time the idea of Willis as an action hero seemed absurd. He was the comedian from TV's Moonlighting, a couple of lousy Blake Edwards movies and those ubiquitous wine cooler commercials. I remember people laughing at the poster: ""David Addison with a gun?"" Of course, that incongruity is a big part of what made Die Hard so special. Unlike the Teflon quipsters played by Eastwood, Sly Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Willis' John McClane was just a regular guy stuck in a situation way above his pay grade. There are plenty of reasons why Die Hard endures as a masterpiece of action filmmaking: the Swiss-watch precision of the plotting, Alan Rickman's incomparable villain, director John McTiernan's exquisite wide-screen compositions. It's become a Burns family tradition to watch it every Christmas Eve.But what makes Die Hard resonate is that McClane is so relatable. He's not a superhero, just a working-class stiff from Jersey trying to patch up his marriage, and then all these damn German terrorists show up and crash the office party. He's trapped, alone and, quite believably, frightened. For all the larger-than-life stunts, there's still a human-scaled guy in there picking glass out of his bloody feet and trying not to cry when he realizes that he blew it with his wife.The sequels are mostly junk, even though I'll confess a soft spot for the third film just because I enjoy Willis bouncing his drunken clown routine off of Samuel L. Jackson. But it's a rule of action franchise escalation that everything has to get bigger and more preposterous with each installment (this is why the Dirty Harry movies shrewdly evolved into flat-out comedies). So long gone are the original Die Hard's brilliantly claustrophobic setting and the hero's then-unprecedented vulnerability.In A Good Day to Die Hard (which someone described as the eighth worst Die Hard movie, even though it's the fifth in the series), McClane has more superpowers than all of the Avengers put together. He's an arrogant, swaggering bulletproof tool barging into situations with guns blazing, never breaking a sweat.The film begins with an incomprehensible mishmash of plotting that lands McClane's estranged son, Jack (Aussie Jai Courtney, demonstrating Sam Worthington–levels of blandness), in a Moscow jail alongside some sort of political prisoner (The Lives of Others' Sebastian Koch) who must have a file everybody needs because a lot of non-descript villains keep saying into the camera lens, ""We need that file."" That's when John McClane comes yippie-kay-yaying his way into Mother Russia, conveniently stumbling into a grotesquely prolonged jailbreak sequence that turns into an incoherently edited car chase taking up most of the picture's 97 minutes. Somehow McClane is able to drive a truck on top of other cars in a traffic jam without killing hundreds of people, and the inconsequential stakes are established when he answers his cell phone mid-melee.As it turns out, young Jack forgot to tell his father that he's a CIA agent, and the elder McClane's bullheadedness just blew a three-year undercover operation. I'm a little fuzzy on the details here because the screenplay doesn't provide many, but the rest of the movie consists of barely audible father-and-son bickering while ducking gunfire. Pretty much every scene ends with them being shot at from a helicopter, and the McClane boys are able to get out of any situation by jumping from precipitous heights in slow motion. There's nothing to hang onto here, and director John Moore can't even orient us within a physical space, let alone modulate the tone. It's a monotonous cacophony from start to finish.Even sadder is that Willis seems to have forgotten how to play McClane. The actor's been on a roll lately with great turns in Looper and Moonrise Kingdom, but here he just squints and insults people, looking vaguely disinterested in the mayhem all around. He's pushy and bullies his kid, who strikes me as having some pretty good reasons for disliking his dad. When did John McClane become such a d***? The most telling moment in A Good Day to Die Hard arrives about halfway through, when our two heroes realize they can just pack it in and go home if they feel like it. I wished they would, just so I could leave, too.",A Good Day to Die Hard

This 5th installment of the storied franchise is nothing but disappointing drivel. The original ""Die Hard"" is the crown jewel in this series of films and should be the blueprint for all movies that follow. Instead, the moviegoer is insulted by this testosterone driven and embarrassing offering from Irish director John Moore.

273,Tin Tin-3,A Good Day... to call it a day,1,23 February 2013,"A perfect example of the law of diminishing returns, this, the fifth instalment of the Die Hard franchise is, by some distance, the poorest. I understand there's another (the last? please?) DH in the pipeline and my personal feelings about this are now those of total indifference. Put it this way, I won't be paying to see it unless I read stellar reviews and someone like (as another poster mentioned) John McTiernan or Renny Harlin at the helm.It's hard to know where to begin with just how bad this film is. Jai Courtney (as John McLane's son) certainly looks the part, but has all the charisma of a parking meter. This I feel is a major point as the defining characteristic of the franchise has been the chemistry that has (until now) bound the series. Gruber/McLane in DH1, McLane/numerous others in DH2, McLane/Zeus in DH3, McLane/Long's character (can't remember his name, was losing interest by this point) in DH4, etc.Here we have McLane 'bumping into' his son (in a city of 12 million people?) with the latter responding by pointing a gun in his dad (sorry, John's) face. Edgy? Exciting? Scene setting? No, just dull and ridiculous.The 98 minute run time appears to be 95+ minutes of bad CGI, car chases, firefights, explosions, etc. This does not an action movie make. This makes 'Commando' look like 'Citizen Kane' by comparison.At time up I asked for, and got, my money back. It was clear I was not the first person to have asked.For the love of God, please, no more.

277,darth-tobe,Enough already!,2,9 June 2016,"There are so many things in this film that didn't make sense to me. Characters switching sides. An overly convoluted plot that an intelligent villain would have resolved much more quickly. Russian police not caring that someone, a foreign police officer no less, is shooting up parts of their country. Characters getting killed - or in the case of the main characters - not getting killed a hundred times over despite huge odds. A new member of the MacLane family that has never been mentioned before, yet mystically exists and, like the rest of the family, hates John. I'm sure there is more.The film does do well at demonstrating a few points, however: Action movie clichés, like the toughness of the hero, have officially gone from unrealistic to ridiculous. In the original Die Hard the character John MacLane kicked ass but was also very vulnerable (I still cringe at the scene with the broken glass). He was made out to be an Average Joe cop who rose to the occasion and that made him relatable. In this movie John MacLane is essentially Willis's character from Unbreakable - that or Deadpool. It's also getting less and less believable that Bruce Willis is not too old for this s**t. It is definitely time to bury the Die Hard franchise. 4.0 was pushing it, now it's officially been milked dry. Finally: flashy, over-the-top action scenes and silly national clichés do not make a movie. Die Hard or not - this was uninspiring crap.",A Good Day to Die Hard

I still don't know what was happening - his son was on a CIA mission to do what? Some Russian guy wanted his vault back was about all I got from it. Mind Rapes aren't a problem for me, some of my favourite films include Donnie Darko, The Butterfly Effect etc, so it's not through lack of trying.... well OK, maybe it was, because I couldn't really care less about trying to understand what was going on.All of the scenes are very tight, there were a few scenic shots but a large proportion - particularly in the second half - where.... closed in. They seemed to make everything dark so they didn't have to bother rendering the backgrounds to the scenes.And its ridiculousness, oh my god.

286,jai84@yahoo.com,Die Hard 5 : Dead Already.,5,26 February 2013,"Hollywood can be a funny place. It is filled with two kinds of people – 1) The true artists that care about their craft and passionately make movies 2) The cash grab producers who want to milk every successful franchise with sequels and reboots. Sadly, the new installment of 20th century fox's Die Hard series ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a product of the second category of people exercising their might and money power to rob the series of any hint of creativity and ultimately fool the franchise fans to queue up at the ticket window . I will stick my neck out and say it – This is not Die Hard in any way !! Heck, it is not even a good movie by any standards of film making. I am a huge Die Hard fan like millions of others who like a healthy dose testosterone in their action movies. The first 3 Die Hard movies had the charm of being a little old school with a hero who is rough around edges and finds himself trapped in extraordinary circumstances. We believed in John McClane in those installments because the sense of danger was omnipresent and John was not infallible. He was vulnerable and human. The fifth Die hard throws all these elements out of the window and succeeds in converting John McClane in a CGI supported superhero who can never get hurt. This abandonment of realism is so tragic for the franchise that I found few people walking out in the first 30 mins once the opening action scene was done. John Moore is the biggest mistake of the producers because after ruining promising projects like Max Payne and The Omen. What do I say about the plot, there is none. Even if someone held a gun to my head and asked me to detail the plot of Die Hard 5. I would ask them to shoot me because there is no way I could tell them what the story was. John McClane goes to Russia to find his son where he gets involved in some terrorist plot that lacks any motive or direction and then the movie switches between a hostage rescue and father son sob story. The ""R "" rating seems like a scam employed this time because of the critical feedback received during the release of Die Hard 4 in 2007. The hard "" R"" rating does nothing to elevate the proceedings and adds little value to the carnage on screen.The only saving grace are two or three action set pieces that are loud, well choreographed and edited. However, these scenes do not give a sense of a Die hard style action which so many other films have been able to ape successfully. It is a pity that Bruce Willis is reduced to playing a parody of his best known character and that Fox seems to have a contempt for one of it's most successful franchise by hiring people like John Moore and Skip Woods who have nothing but flops to show on their resume.

289,eviltimes,Worst ever.,1,8 June 2013,"A useless turd of a film. What? They can't even make a Die Hard movie anymore? My wife said that they tried too hard, but I say they didn't try at all. Nice special effects, with Russian helicopters that haven't been seen in Hollywood pictures before (the Mi-26 is the largest production helicopter in the world and they use it as a 120 passenger airliner in certain areas of Russia and the Old Soviet Union). But some splosions and a thousand squibs do not make an interesting motion picture. An absolutely lame attempt to generate some chemistry between John McClane Senior and Junior fails on a truly epic level, as does the entire plot of the film. For once I would argue that this film needed to be longer to develop something rational - the ""heist"" storyline is as ill defined as virtually any relationship in this mess. I can't even rate this garbage. Once again, an imaginary negative non existent number.",A Good Day to Die Hard
290,inc-10,Not even funny,1,25 February 2013,"There's loads of downright idiotic errors in logic and geography in American movies, but they still pass more or less usually. Not on this one. My initial reaction was that target audience for this movie must be really, really dumb. After movie continued, I came to conclusion that world cannot really be populated by *that* stupid people, so it was simply written, directed and approved by men who have just received a lobotomy. I think I am right about this one.Movie starts with embarrassing scene with a taxi driver. I don't know if it was supposed to be an ode to international friendship or try to emulate youthful taxi driver from first of the series, but it sure looked and sounded bad. Dozen minutes later, you see a UAV Drone flying over Moscow. This instant is clear that you're watching science fiction. Even if you could travel back in time, to 1940's with much less advanced radars and anti- air systems, an American drone wouldn't simply be able fly over Moscow. Much less in 2000's while Moscow is over 700km from nearest NATO member border. Then, in a capital of police state country that normally has policemen in every street corner and random ID checks are casual thing, next to the courthouse (!) a firefight occurs with no police to be seen, while perpetrators organize family reunions and take long time just wandering around the street, with no one to stop them. Okay...The movie is jumping between shaky camera action sequences and father- issue drama constantly, while both feel out of place. Especially latter, since violin music and dumb stares feel artificial and forced.I could go on, but I don't want to drag this review out. From the retarded mind of the writer we will also ""learn"" that:* 3000 rounds per minute twin anti-tank machine gun works as 30 rounds per minute if you're shooting at protagonist of the movie.* Ukraine and Russia have no border, much like the States, so you could easily drive from one to another with a stolen car and trunk full of Canadian guns (stolen from Chechen bandits, go figure).* You can also fly around in both countries in a military helicopter or shoot up buildings in downtown Moscow, with no army to interfere.* Car can scale 1000 km from Moscow to Pripyat in more or less same time as a military helicopter.* Dozens of years of radiation can be easily dispersed with what looks like a leaf blower. Even from metal.* Rain water doesn't get radiated. You can happily swim in it.* Russian helicopters have magical power to grow back a tail rotor should you destroy one while crashing into building.This movie doesn't have factual errors. It *is* a factual error.John Mclane we knew was humorous, non-aggressive unless provoked, had street smarts and good intuition. In ""Good day"", it is thrown in only a pinch, to say ""we had it too"", but it is not the real content of the story in any way. It is quite noticeable here and there.If you loved previous films, or at least first three, avoid this garbage. Keep the memory happy.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Yes, I found 4 to be really over the top, regardless, it was entirely enjoyable. This one was just complete and utter garbage.I'm not asking for anything that deserves major awards, but shouldn't an action movie at least be fun? The plot makes absolutely no sense at all, it's full of holes and is just not interesting. The chemistry between the actors is not bad, it's terrible! The villains are like out of a very bad old cartoon, bordering on pointlessly stupid. McLane keeps saying that he is on vacation, when supposedly he's not.

297,jaredmartin-464-711711,A Good Day to Watch something Else,1,15 August 2013,"I'm a Die Hard fan, and this movie was complete, and utter crap. Director John Moore, and writer Skip Woods shouldn't be allowed near any film, let alone Die Hard, a beloved franchise. There's nothing in this movie thats worth writing a full review, so instead I'll just rant, so beware SPOILERS.....as if this movie isn't spoiled enough.I was a fan of the last Die Hard, especially the unrated cut which restored some of what the theatrical version left out, to achieve the PG 13 rating. Live free or Die Hard had some over the top stuff, but the characters, and story, were interesting enough to make it a worthy addition to the series. The movie was interesting, had a decent antagonist, and Justin Long's character was a perfect side kick for John McClaine, because he didn't over shadow what John McClaine is, the hero. Long's character was computer savvy but not strong, and the pair worked well together, as they both brought things to the table. An old John McClaine shouldn't have been fun to watch, but oddly it was, and for me that movie wrapped up perfectly, and I even enjoyed it more than the 3rd surprisingly. Now why did I say all that...because the 5th movie does none of this, and feels more like a spoof than an actual sequel.For crying out loud John McClaine isn't even John McClaine in this one. Instead we just have Bruce Willis phoning it in, and his obnoxious ass clown of a son, that can't act. The apple falls so far from the the tree it's sad. Perhaps this is the biggest problem with this crap fest, there is no character whatsoever. No real villain to speak of, no interesting or memorable action, no pacing, no real humor, not one thing that could pass as Die Hard. Even the yippi ki ya mother#$%&@# line was just randomly thrown in, not even used in a clever way. Just one poorly done throwback to Hans Gruber's death in the first Die Hard, which in this movie was laughable, probably the only part I laughed at, and just shows the lack of creativity of those involved. Bad directing, and Bad writing will destroy a movie anytime. This should have been titled A Good Day to Kill a Franchise. There's at least a Die Hard quadrilogy and really isn't that enough...yes for me it is.",A Good Day to Die Hard

I initially thought not, but after seeing this movie I felt like I'd seen enough. The Die Hard series and its wisecracking protagonist John McClane have been around since the late eighties, but since then the series has been losing its appeal at the same rate as Willis has been losing his hair. As if to prove this to us, we were given this movie- a clunky, predictable mess with dull characters, less-than-stellar scripting and surplus CGI. The whole film just feels like a waste of time and money- Willis has moved on now and it feels like nothing more than an attempt at tapping into people's nostalgia. Also present are Jai Courtney, who gives an unmemorable performance as McClane's son Jack, and Sebastian Koch as the mediocre 'surprise' villain Yuri Komarov. All in all, I think it's a good day for this film series to die hard itself. A generous 3/10.",A Good Day to Die Hard

I really wanted to see that movie but couldn't because I couldn't read the subtitles that were the translated German-to-English.It was a horrible error that I would have thought Quentin Tarantino wouldn't have made.So my advice to film producers is: if you've got subtitles in the original film, double-check the DVD version to make sure that the translations are readable on a 19"" television from eight feet away.Otherwise, put all the dialog in English in the English subtitles on the DVD.My advice: don't try to watch this film on DVD unless you want to find your TV screen punctured with a soda bottle from your frustration.",A Good Day to Die Hard
302,Chrismeister,How the mighty have fallen,3,23 February 2013,"I am a massive Die Hard fan, I love all of the films even 4 which most don't, I love where John McClain is in that film and all the changes in society he has to adapt to, like 4 all of the other Die Hard films had a clear story and reason for John McClane to be back in action but A Good Day To Die Hard didn't, it felt lacking in a true plot or substance. The first problem with this film is Bruce Willis himself because that's just it, he is acting like Bruce Willis and not John McClane, somewhere this character has been lost in mythology behind itself, he has become more like a superhero rather that the likable cop from NY we all know and love, the opening car chase is evidence to this. Another problem with this film is the son and McClane's relationship with him, as much as Jai Courtney try's his best his character simply comes off as annoying and unlikeable as he never stops complaining about how his dad was never their for him which only leads the audience wanting him to shut up rather than feel sorry for him. Overall A Good Day To Die Hard was very underwhelming and disappointing with the lack of John McClane being himself, the uninteresting son and the lack of a clear villain doing up against McClane. All this film will leave you with is simply wishing they just left it at 4. I can only hope Die Hard 6, which they are making anyway, will redeem itself back to the old days of Die Hard.

303,murlimohanrao,big disappointment,2,24 May 2013,"I remember the first die hard movie came out when I was in college. John Maclane was an idol for action fans like us, because he epitomized dedication, intelligence and a dare devilry attitude. In all his movies post that, this attitude was clearly on display, even when he appeared to be in a vulnerable position. But, A Good Day To Die Hard is very different in that respect ... as a viewer, I just could not empathize with the character. He destroys things without reason, has scant regard for public property, displays the typical American aggression by doing what he thinks in a foreign country. These are not the qualities John Maclane was loved for. I therefore term it as a big big disappointment.Now with respect to the plot, less said the better. John Maclane's son is an undercover agent tasked with the activity of getting out a Russian rebel man. However, lots of things happen and both father and son, go about bang bang in St Petersburg till they kill the villain. No story whatsoever.",A Good Day to Die Hard

As you'd expect with McLaine around, a big mess is made out of the operation and of Moscow. And that is just the first of a relentless string of very impressive action sequences, which feature one of the greatest car chase sequences ever filmed. The plot is merely an excuse for loads of crashes and explosions, and makes very little, if any, sense. McLaine's trademark sardonic one-liners are replaced by very dry, almost British tongue-in-cheek wit, which may be inconsistent to the early Die Hard-films, but it works pretty well within the film. Fans of the franchise will not be looking for an ingenious plot, so they will not be disappointed. If you are unfamiliar with the series, please, do not forget to check you brains at the door.

He almost ignores what is actually happening in the movie.When i say he acts ignorant he is having a conversation with someone and the bullets are flying around he just does not come across as the true hero we all know and have come to enjoy watching.At this stage in the characters life it is impossible to make his character look like someone who is new to all of this , but the director seriously tries to give that impression.So what if he is not in LA or DC or even America, he is still the same person.I found his character so bad at the beginning that i was going to switch the movie off and just call it a written tomato like so many movies being released these days from Hollywood.But i managed to get over the initial 50 minutes and then the action actually prevented him from making too much of a mess of the character.

John McClane (Bruce Willis), who has not been in touch with his son for years,knows about his son to be in jail and travels to Russia to help him.

Because I believe that they are one of the best action movie series ever, and I love watching John McClane kick ass in a very believable way. So having said this, I think the latest Die Hard movie was just a parody of all the previous Die Hard movies. I wasn't entirely sure if I was watching Die Hard, or Terminator 2.0.Here is the plot in a few sentences: 1. Father goes to Russia because he finds out son is in jail. 2. A few minutes after arriving, Father takes over the city in a Mercedes, even though he has no idea who the good guys and bad guys are. 3. Son helps a prisoner escape who has information for the CIA, but everyone at the safe house dies and son is stuck with his father. Father still doesn't know who good guys and bad guys are but either way he likes shooting and killing people. 4. Prisoner's daughter is bad, prisoner has no information for CIA, he is after all a bad guy all of a sudden. 5. After a quick drive from Moscow to Chernobyl (only 900 km), everyone dies, of bombing, shooting, falling, suffocating, beheading. Except the father and son, who survive thanks to a nice clean swimming pool conveniently located in Chernobyl.Here is the plot that they should have used to make it look like a real Die Hard movie.1. Father finds out that son is on death row in Russia. He decide to go save his son. 2. When he gets to Russia he goes straight to the police to try to find help for his son, the police laugh at him, and have no intention to help him. Father tries to prove his son's innocence, meanwhile he discovers that son is an undercover agent for the CIA. By the time he finds out that, the CIA wants to stop him from getting involved. Father ignores them and goes to help his son anyway, who meanwhile escapes with the other prisoner. 3. CIA agents in Russia get killed while they have the father detained by the Russian bad guys. Father escapes, goes after son, who by now is all alone in the mission, no one even knows that he is still alive. They finally meet up and they get betrayed by the prisoner they were tying to protect. 4. They kill all the bad guys, with the help of a Russian police officer who wanted to arrest the father all along as an accomplice in his son's crime, but who eventually realizes they are the good guys. The end.I don't know about you but for me a story like that sounds more like a John McClane type of situation than the Terminator 2.0 type of movie. I was very disappointed, and I'm very surprised that Bruce Willis signed up for it after reading the script. I wanted more story, but I only got lots of special effects.

316,artyyeo,Worst day to die hard,4,19 February 2013,"I have watched all of Bruce Willis' Die Hard movies, some of them I have watched several times.The current one seemed to have lost quite a bit of touch with the style that made the Die Hard series a class of its own. To me, I think this one has knocked it out of place so much, I am not sure if it will ever recover from it.The editing is one of the poorest I have ever seen across all the movies I have watched. If I were to rate the editing, I'd give it a failing grade. There are multiple scenes in there that were completely out of place and they made the actors looked like they didn't know what they were doing. The car chase scene was absolutely too long in the beginning. I fail to see what good it brought to the movie for being so extended. Sound editing were too raw and after a while, I was looking for when it was going to end. Too much loud noises were slapped into the movie in a rampant manner and not intelligently placed. After the first 25 min, I was getting tired of it. It was not even interesting anymore. I'd say this is fine example of what you'd call the unrestrained use of technologies.I thought the dialogs were a little clever in the past but this one was way under par. They were poorly put together and reflected very little skills. The so-called lighter moments were ineffective and poorly developed due mainly to the failing dialogs. Failing grade again in this department.For a while, I thought Bruce Willis was done with being a foul-mouth craze but looks like it is back and roaring back in a big way. The level of vulgarity sounds 1980's. I did not think it was needed to make this movie good, just as much as the last Die Hard was well done without this much vulgarity.Acting skills and the role that Jai Courtney played was coarsely developed. He seemed and felt unnatural and awkward.

317,manateegrey,"Good enough, but not on par w old Die Hards",6,24 July 2013,"Y'know, this film is just what I expected from it. Granted, it's a Die Hard flick so you would hope it'd be awesome and on the level of the first 2, but you have to keep in mind that it's 2013 and the entertainment industry is incapable of producing any movie with a semblance of intelligence.Maybe I'm being a little harsh. The movie is entertaining. It has amazing action shots, and really well done special effects.One thing I really, really don't get is why they made John McClane so effing annoying? He's supposed to be a badass, and in this flick (mostly in the beginning, at least they turned it down a little bit towards the end) he is just a bumbling dumbass.Seriously, the first scene in which the action starts, he literally messes everything up for his son, and continues to ruin everything while just walking around yelling his son's name. Who wrote that scene?! It literally made me cringe.I also thought the casting for his son was strange. He looks incredibly Russian, and would've been better cast in the opposing camp.The daughter is incredibly annoying as well, but thankfully she has little screen time.All in all, the movie managed to avoid the 'let's introduce the main character's kids into this sequel and ruin everything' trope. It was fun, it was entertaining, it had no artistic merit.",A Good Day to Die Hard

People..please..stop comparing movie sequels to the previous ones. It makes your judgment to the movie sort of bias or unfair to the new movie. Sequels are sequels. It's like you're comparing numbers (e.g. 1 vs 2 or 3 vs 4). I bet most of the time the favorite number is 3 for some. After seeing this movie, it's good enough for a popcorn action flick. It is worth your money and for a home theater enthusiast like me. This is gonna be in one of my movie collections that will rumble my 5.1 setup with loud sub.

320,wickedragon,Where is my feel good action movie?,2,27 January 2015,"As my summary says; where is my feel good action movie.Truth be told I only saw the first thirty minutes of the movie and was totally sickened by it.First, the good. The music, the shooting, the lighting, the setting, the casting; it's all competently done. Nothing wrong with any of those things.I'm not sure what the movie tries to be. It's obvious that John McClane is supposed to be his own silly sidekick here. Spoiler: John McClane idiots his way through from beginning to .. well, about the half hour mark. And not just in a ""I'm to stupid to fully grasp the situation"" kind of way, but rather he seems oblivious and uncaring in regards to the world around him. Like he's a character in a movie and nothing of this is real.The action is very actiony. Shooting and explosions. But unlike in the previous Die Hard movies where most of the deaths were for either cops, swat or criminals this movie sees fit to start really killing civilians en masse. Just like, kill them all.The movie does not go into lots of details about their deaths, but barring protocols for the instant teleportation to safety being installed in Russia in the Die Hard universe kids, toddlers, men, women dogs etc are left dead everywhere.That's not a feel good action flick. That's as much ""feel good"" as watching a documentary about massacres in South Sudan.So 2 for me, and I'm not watching any more of this.",A Good Day to Die Hard

And why did he get all the lines that Bruce/John always say and ... well it just didn't Work. Utter utter crap. Who among the producers or studio executives thought that was a good idea? Very F....... disappointed! It all just ends in big explosions, without any Heart. The Trailer look so promising but it all ended in a big mesh and without any great moments.

324,Extraneus92,This is an Abomination,1,12 June 2013,"For me, this is one of, if not the worst film that I have seen in the last five years. I'm not even sure that this deserves the grace of a 1/10. As a massive Die Hard fan I was excited upon hearing that more films would be made. Perhaps this was down to my younger innocence or misguided hope. Though, this is not Die Hard. I'm not quite sure what this is. I think this barely makes the grade of being classed as a film. This monstrosity is the effect of throwing money at a previously successful title and hoping that consumers would be distracted by the massive bangs and whoophas. People deserve more than this.I largely think that this is poorly written and directed, there is no real story, no real point. John has gone off to Russia to become reunited with his son. I know that the original was an 80s action flick, but this isn't even on that level, this was just made up of ridiculous car chases and then some explosions and some loose overused reasoning underneath the entirety.The characters seemed like they were written in about five minutes in a meeting of someone who works several other jobs. Seriously, there is nothing to any of the antagonists. This is highlighted by the attempt of giving one antagonist reason through him making a reference to his murderous hunger being based upon his repressed desire to dance. I'm sure that nobody really knew what was going on half the time and that they were most likely just transported to the studio and given a script and told to 'act'. But what of John McClane? Well I don't know who that was, but that certainly wasn't him. In this film he was closer to an escaped lunatic from a notorious maximum security mental health facility caught up in the action than our beloved John. Though, indeed, perhaps the least likable character was his son who offered absolutely nothing to a story where much of the plot revolves around him.All in all this is dreadful, and I felt that I had to come here and write this to voice my opinion for the good of the series. When I think of the Die Hard series I don't add this. It's not Die Hard and even on a film level, this is awful. The only reason I didn't walk out of the cinema when I saw this was because I honestly believed that it couldn't get any worse, but unfortunately it did. I didn't know that it was possible to incapacitate a much loved series while simultaneously creating a film which no self respected person could ever be satisfied that they did a good job with on a watch back.",A Good Day to Die Hard
325,megavenganceman,A Good Day to Suck Hard,3,18 February 2013,"This woefully inept underwritten, very badly edited and directed entry in the otherwise usually reliable Die Hard franchise isn't just disappointing, it's disheartening. I for one was not among the Live Free or Die Hard haters that seem to overpopulate the online community these days. It was entertaining and reasonably exciting with a couple of things they got right from the previous three. Up until now, the Die Hards have been about ordinary people doing extraordinary things in extraordinary situations when pushed to the limit. There were average people like limo drivers, janitors, air traffic controllers, cops, computer nerds and even convenience store clerks all lending a hand to John McClane when the going got tough. McClane used to use his wits and his street smarts. Now he drives crazy, yells a lot and shoots people. The frenetic chainsaw editing makes the action scenes incoherent and the plot hard to follow. The tone is all wrong. There are slow-mo scenes for no reason and overbaked emotive scenes that don't pay off. There are villains with little to no personality and McClane's son is a whiny, thuggish bore. McClane isn't so much smart alecky as kind of an ass-hole now. This would all rate the film okay if even it featured exciting action scenes that you could follow. It doesn't. The shaky cam treatment adds nothing but distraction.

326,alex-kirkby,"CIA, 007 of Plainfeld, New Jersey",9,20 June 2014,"Why is this film bad? I have no idea, after watching the other 4 Die Hard movies I became a big fan of the series and also becoming a huge fan of Bruce Willis. Between 1988 and 2013 there have been 5 Die hard movies and I have not been disappointed yet. OK I will amite this is the worst one of the series but that's doesn't make it a bad film. I think people only have ago or have some kind of problem with this film only because the title is Die Hard. I bet if this had a different title then people would of given it more of a chance. OK this film is set in Russia, bit of a different place from America set from the last 4 films. Parts of this film do seem a bit over done for example the Jeep pushing the armed truck which is 3 times the size of the Jeep off the bridge. OK unlikely that it will happen but it was a good stunt the other bit of the film that I fort was a bit over the top was Bruce Willis and his son sliding down a orange tube which stands at the same hight as the Empire State Building well a Russian Attack Gun Ship fires on then and come out with only some cuts and bruises in really life they both would be dead. This film involves the CIA like the films before this one they have all involved enough organisation of public service, the first had other police officers, the second had the army, the tied let Bruce Willis have a side kick Samule L Jackson and the forth had the FBI. This film is good in my opuion and I don't really care if people think I have bad film taste. I liked this film and it is worth a try and if you are one of those people who try and compare it to the others then good for you but try not to think of it as a Die Hard film try to think of it as a funny over the top action movie.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Unfortunately, Willis comic timing was a bit out of sync with the scenes.PLUS points, were the use of the original music score in some scenes and i must say the action got better as the movie moved along.

From my viewpoint there was pretty solid acting form all the cast members save for Willis, who's main mission seemed to be the utterance of corny one liners of bravado from an almost brutally uncaring father.The special effects, though impressive, are not supported by any form of situational tension. Put simply, people survived the survivable so many times that I found myself now laughing out loud at the almost cartoon hilarity pouring from the screen.Apparently inhaling and being sandblasted with highly toxic radioactive dust doesn't effect anyone's health anymore as we find our protagonists hoovering the stuff up like a Dyson on steroids. As the movie progresses *sic it becomes apparent that the McClane's have some mutated gene that makes them impervious to most everything that would maim, burn and kill mere mortals.In spite of the glorious CGI, this is easily the weakest and the most forgettable Die Hard movie to date.I could have walked out of the cinema at any time without feeling that I'd missed anything more than my admittance fee.Overall a fairly vacuous film that I would rate as mediocre Action/Comedy.",A Good Day to Die Hard

They should have taken some of the money and invested it in a good screenwriter instead of the destruction of tons of hardware.There is too much shooting and destruction. It's okay to have a lot of action in a Die Hard movie. But endless action scenes can't compensate for the lack of story.The characters are colorless.

But with A good day to die hard? Nobody cares anymore, not even the audience.A good day to die hard is about as by the numbers written and directed as you can possibly get. Apparently, John Mcclane has a son we haven't seen since the first film who's a super spy and they break some guy out of prison for some reason. The problem is that John Mcclane feels like a guest star in his own movie! His role is reduced to second banana and his son is poorly written with hardly any back story. The set up isn't fun or exciting, and feels about as fun and well written as last year's ""Taken 2"".A good day to die hard might be exciting if you've never seen motion pictures before but... nope, not even under those circumstances, this movie is so bad that watching it will probably make you not want to watch another film, ever again.

Everything in this story is so far beyond believable it's impossible to write it off as ""Oh well, it's a movie"". Bruce Willis should be wearing tights, a cape and a big ""S"" on his chest. Who needs Superman? How many stories can a human being fall and still get up and walk away, without even a limp? How many bad guys can shoot at you from about 20 feet with fully automatic weapons, and not hit you once? Even when you are standing upright in the open, making no attempt to hide.Even the plot goes beyond silly. The bad guys have some weapons grade Uranium stashed away. Where? Chernobyl. They walk in the front door. We'll ignore tight security the Russians maintain around the place. But did we miss the fact that the Russians encased the whole thing in a solid concrete sarcophagus? And what about the gazillion rads of radiation? No problem, the bad guys just spray the whole place with this chemical which instantly.....uh.....neutralizes radiation. They really should patent that stuff. And did you know that a helicopter can hover in place at about a 45 degree angle with a truck hanging from the tail?

Bruce Willis is still up to the job of portraying this character; however, he wasn't given much with which to work and ends up coming across as a sidekick instead of the former powerhouse of the series.

So is this enough to make a Die Hard movie... Hell No !!!.I wont comment on the original Die Hard and on the ones that were made during the 90's, (except i'll say that i liked 'em) but when they released the 4th installment in the series back in 2007, i was expecting to watch exactly this movie that i did with ""A Good Day to Die Hard"", but that was another case, i was very pleased with it, and i thought they really were serious about this series. But the 5th one belongs on another universe, it is not worthy of the franchise name, it is a pure commercial movie that doesn't really care if we like it or not. Even Bruce Willis looks like he's in vacations in Russia and not on a Die Hard movie. The script is a joke (something that we've seen ages ago) only with John McClane and his son in it chasing the bad guys.And as a matter of fact they announced another Die Hard movie, which is being developed, so the question is: Are they going to do a Die Hard movie or just another action-flick which none of us will remember the next day we watch it.",A Good Day to Die Hard

It's purely an exercise in ""If 5 explosions is good in an action film, then 25 will be totally awesome bro!""John McClane isn't a hero in this one, he's a psychopath. I'm not sure if he was written to pretend to be 'dumb' or if the angle they were trying for was that he truly was an American ignoramus completely oblivious to the existence of other countries. Either way, it's incredibly annoying and lacking any of the charm of previous Die Hards. He flat out murders people, drives a vehicle ""monster truck""-style over lines of cars containing people. His one-liners are terrible. His son's character is terrible. He has calm cellphone conversations during a high speed chase. I gave this one a 2 based solely on the amount of property damage and explosions, for those who enjoyed Transformers 2. The only other movie I can think of that forcibly crammed so many unnecessary action movie tropes in so remorselessly was Tango and Cash.On movie night, if it's this movie or nothing, please choose nothing.

And this time he's On Vacation.Following reading a lot of reviews that dubbed Die Hard 5 as boring and subtitling it ""A Bad Day To Die Hard"" I wasn't expecting much from the fifth instalment in a series of films which I thought peaked with the third and fell away with an average fourth film.But I was pleasantly surprised by Willis' latest outing in the white vest.The story centres around McClane's son, Jack, who is working as an undercover CIA agent who is aiming to stop all out carnage between two men. Naturally John is looking for his son and stumbles across him at the most inconvenient of times, slotting himself slap bang into the middle of the action.Bruce has still got it. Sure, he's older, but the craziness still exists. There's plenty of comedy to be had mainly revolving around the disfunctionality of McClane's family life, but the film really comes to life during its action sequences which are as good, if not better than they have ever been.One early sequence involving a huge chase through the streets of Russia is insane and ends awesomely, and TW climax of the film is much more explosive and fun than anything in Die Hard 4.0.Forget the horrific reviews the critics have given this, go see the film and judge for yourself. Is it the best of the series? No. But it is entertaining and will raise a few chuckles as well as a lot of ""Woah!"" moments.Yippie Ki-Yay Mother Russia!",A Good Day to Die Hard
340,BernardGT,Not an Ode of Joy you wish it is,4,10 February 2013,"John McClane is back for another round of 'hard to die' movie - for the fifth time and now he goes international in Moscow, Russia. Sure, the last one was pretty much swayed from the original cowboy Yippee Kay-Yay movies, but changing the scenario to suit the modern technology seems fit. DC's round of non-stop counter cyber-terrorism looks fun. But is this trip of our favorite hot-headed foul-mouthed tough New York detective to Russia does the same job of delivering loud kick-ass action with a ride of fun as usual, or does it succumb to a tiring piece of repetitive actions?Russia plunges into crisis when a trial of the former billionaire Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch) becomes a subject of political scrutiny and national threat. Matter complicates when Jack (Jai Courtney), the estranged son of John McClane (Bruce Willis) is implicated in a murder of one of Chagarin's (Sergei Kolesnikov) associates. The whole trial is a setup by Chagarin to cover-up his illegal WMD manufacturing. As John arrives in Moscow to see his son, his untimely visit turns into a chaotic one, joining force with his son to protect Komorov from possible political assassination staged by Chagarin.It is unfortunate because A Good Day to Die Hard is not exactly the Ode of Joy you will expect. I do love the past movies - all four in the franchise. Even the fourth one is enjoyable and possesses enough punching and ass-kicking moments. It is evident that the last installment paves for some sensible direction but this is not really the case. The plot is convoluted, heavily relied on twists and not thrill to pace the motion. Surely it does retain the old funky one-liners, fun actions and ridiculously insane set-up, but it fails to deliver an ultimately high satisfaction. Casual movie-goers will likely to find this movie fun but those familiar with the franchise will immediately notice more problems within it.As much as the scope of the story goes wider into a foreign territory, the scale of action and story goes the other way round, unfortunately. Skip Wood (The A-Team) gives McClane & Son a smaller adventure to tackle with, something that also lacks a proper punch and real excitement. Things also get toned down pretty much with the writer resorts to use plot with high preference for recycling cliché materials and elements from the Cold War, resulting a totally predictable showdown of the third act. With the exception of the first act which has intriguing fast-pace car chase in the streets of Moscow, the other action set pieces are rather grounded, less ambitious and lack of punches. In fact, some of the shaky camera works well at some specific time but also been distracting when it is unwisely over-used.All in all, A Good Day to Die Hard is a passable action flick that will unlikely to win over those who are familiar with the franchise; but even with the recycled plot and raw set pieces, it still save us with little fun to savor.",A Good Day to Die Hard

All the car chases, gun firing, glass shattering, big explosions, occasional expletives, etc, etc. add up to an entertaining film that you can walk away feeling happy you saw. It may not have been the best film of the 'Die Hard' series since the storyline could have been fleshed out a little more but who goes to see a 'Die Hard' film starring action-legend Bruce Willis expecting a long, drawn-out story that will get people yawning. You go to see the ACTION! To get fired up and hear loud noises everywhere. I liked that the story in this particular film was about John McClane trying to save his son from the Russian police and the bonding that happens between them during the film. They started off not really liking each other but by the end of the film they began to accept one another and act as a father/son team. It's your typical action-hero film with a little bit of,should I say, humanity thrown in. The pros of this film: The special effects were superb Bruce Willis showing a humorous, laid back side The soundtrack. Had the right tempo for any circumstance.Guns, guns, guns! There was enough of them and kept the main cast on their toes.Cons: Bad script writing and certain dialog (even Bruce Willis could have done better; he didn't really act like he was in character most of the time, sort of lost) Lack of information of key characters: The movie failed to really explain why John's son, Jack, was captured by the Russians and why John was so willing to rescue him at all costs (it says why on here, but the movie was vague about it). Also, the other bad guy,Komarov, that was running away never quite got any background info fleshed out (only hints of that he caused the Chernobyl accident). Not your typical 'Die Hard' movie. This one was a little softer and didn't nearly contain as much profanity as previous installments. Choppy, nonsensical scenes: some scenes were never explained or were confusing, cutting to the next scene without a lot of reason. Certain characters, such as Komorav's daughter, changed loyalties (hero/villain) without any reason to why they would do so.Factual errors: Going into a radioactive plant such as Chernobyl without any protective gear on could be fatal. That's why I didn't understand how John and Jack went in there unprotected and came out not sprouting a third arm or something.

First we have to opine on this episode of the John McClane (Bruce Willis) series. Frankly,Eh. Here's the thing. If you want action, fighting violence, blood and gore, I give this movie 8 stars. If you want a novel and an intriguing plot line, 4. Save your money and your time. In this movie, Willis goes to Russia to rescue his estranged son John Jr. (Jai Courtney). You'll find a few good car chases, a bunch of explosions and some nifty fighting scenes, especially in Moscow. And a father-son re-meet and greet and make up love fest. I took my son Michael and his friend Timmy to see the movie. Both guys are 14 and can they eat. Michael Really Liked the movie. In fact, ""8 stars all in."" Timmy liked it too. I explained to Michael that we simply Had to see the original Die Hard movie. Fortunately we own the DVD. Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman, Professor Severus Snape in the Harry Potter Series) still rocks, even after the 12th or 15th viewing. Thankfully, Michael immediately came to his senses and saw the difference. I enjoyed the movie too.Which brings us to our second level of this review. Lisa Schwarzbaum, film critic, reviewed A Good Day to Die Hard in Entertainment Weekly (EW, February 22, 2013). She adorned the movie with a ""C."" We give the movie a 5 stars all in. In Lisa's inimitable style, to make a short review shorter, she said, ""Boo-hoo. Now go kill some scumbags,"" (the second line is a Bruce Willis line from the movie). That about sums it up. Thank You Lisa Schwarzbaum. What's more, Lisa bids we loyal EW Entertainment Weekly readers adios, adieu, after 19 years as a film critic. In that same EW issue, she also says, ""Your mission is to read with an open mind, watch movies with an open mind, and use the places where we diverge as inspiration for an ongoing conversation about this ever-changing medium we love together.""Couldn't have said it better myself Lisa. Above all, Lisa says she Longs for reader feedback - both positive and negative. As a published author and film critic, that hits the button with me. Bingo. So, if you like Bruce Willis and Die Hard and want to see some more fighting, see the movie. #5 and the original. Lisa, we look forward to reading about your next adventure. Wishing you All the best!Arthur VanDam, author and film critic",A Good Day to Die Hard
344,Amp1234,Not a good film,2,19 February 2013,"I actually just created a (long overdue) IMDb account just so I could review this film. I grew up with the Die Hard films and was truly let down with this one. When I saw the trailer I was excited to see the action and R rating were back. The camera work was really terrible. It was obvious at early points in the film they were purposely shaking it to give it some kind of grunge effect, but it only makes you dizzy. It seemed really amateur. John Mcclane seemed invincible. They all did. I didn't think the acting was as bad as everyone says. They did what they could with the script they were given. The story is unoriginal. There are no memorable villains.I saw this with my best friend and when we were kids we'd always watch the first and third die hards. We both walked out of A Good Die to Die Hard shaking our heads, and laughing. Also, our massive theater was empty on opening day. Its fair to say this is an ugly stain on an otherwise decent franchise. Giving it a 2 out of 10 was generous. The whole thing was unbelievable. Not worth seeing in the theater, not even worth renting. Wait until it's on basic TV as background noise.3 words to describe this film: Disappointing, Unbelievable, Loud",A Good Day to Die Hard
345,phil1945,"A movie no one wanted to make, no one should bother to watch.",2,18 August 2013,"Just like the once proud and formidable Dallas Cowboys franchise, the Die Hard series has lost its way and went on a crusade to drag its once glorious name and legacy in the mud.The script appeared to skip the editing room and go straight to the wood mill, where it was promptly chopped up by a team of hardy lumberjacks. This film does not flow at all, and looks as if it was patched up together in a hurry by the three blind mice.The plot is stupid, generic, forgettable and of no consequence or importance.John McClane looks tired and a little bit bored, but quite confident because he knows how this song ends. John is out of breath, funny jokes and smart ideas. He is confused, and is confusing to the audience. Is he in Russia to be the savior of his son, or is he a tag-a-long for his son's, ""Save the World from an Evil Russian"" mission. It is unclear, and I doubt anyone working on the movie gave it much thought.In fact, the whole movie seems to lack much thought and effort.John McClane's son Jack is an abomination. This guy might be the worst spy off all time. What spy says things like, ""I am out of moves,"" ""going in guns blazing,"" and never has a backup plan for anything. He is always nervous and panics like a 12 year-old who just broke a window with a baseball. Not to mention he gives up on his mission and needs a pep-talk from his dad to regain confidence in himself. Jack is dumb and his charisma level might as well be twenty thousand leagues under the sea. He is tough, hot headed and daring. He would be a perfect high school football player, rodeo cowboy or a soccer hooligan. If this is the guy the United States government sends in to prevent an international power shift, someone in the Pentagon needs to get slapped.Another glaring problem of this production is the villains. They are boring, generic and not a bit menacing. No one really cares about them and then they die.After doing a little bit of research I was stunned to find out, that a good number of the villains are either Russian or Eastern European actors. You would think that this small detail would make them more authentic, but it does not. In fact their accents sounds fake and forced. Almost as if the director instructed them to Russian-up their accents to drive the point home of whom exactly are the bad guys and which country they are from. This odd-sounding accent helps the movie lose credibility with the audience and takes everyone out of the mood of the film. The conversation subject matter only makes things worse. Stating things like, ""I hate America, and especially the cowboys,"" sounds juvenile and fake to me. I can see a 10 year-old émigré kid being bullied by American classmates saying that, not a thirty-something mercenary.Another problem with the henchmen is the fact that they are ridiculously easy to kill. Not unlike at shooting range, one needs only to stand upright and fire his weapon of choice in the direction of the perceived threat. These are supposed to be well trained, armed to the teeth killers, not cardboard cut-outs.The dialog was choppy and often pointless. The humor was nonexistent.The car chase scene at the beginning of the movie is the sole bright spot of this heartless, soulless and mindless creation. It included an armored military vehicle, and was fun, exciting and destructive. If only the rest of the movie would have taken notice.In conclusion, A Good Day to Die Hard is a good waste of time. This movie has neither the heart nor the pulse, and is a poorly assorted collection of scenes that you've seen many times before. This picture is sure to be scorned by Die Hard fans and casual movie watchers alike.",A Good Day to Die Hard

If for some reason you're still forced to watch it, I recommend bringing your own bag. Filled with gasoline, and inhaling from it deeply using your diaphragm before the movie starts.

But like when Po doesn't make the noodles in Kung Fu Panda the secret ingredient was missing. What that secret ingredient is I don't know but it just wasn't there. A Big spoiler now. There is no Yipppee Ki ay muther.... you know the rest. In fact there is no swearing of any kind it's a 12A. This really detracted from my enjoyment of the film as there is one scene where a swear word is blatantly cut. Takes me back to the good old days of watching TV edits of Die hard. Yiippee ki ay kimusabi being the funniest edit I've ever heard.I wanted to see old action and I got 12a fun for the family watered down mediocrity. At the end of the film there's a scene where they are on a roof ( John and his son) and you can see fire hoses. And i'm like please let him wrap the fire hose round his waist again and say something like "" I learnt this a nokatomi plaza"" and jump off.

352,Dourankev,Capitalism dies hard,1,23 May 2013,"The film is very stupid. Produced for stupid people who have a lot of free time. The scenario is with a very low rating. It doesn't cost a penny. Mistakes are one after another. For example, the city of Chernobyl is not in Russia, and is located in Ukraine. Every ""Google"" idiot knows even that. Cheap... What is the reason? For money. For profit. For squeezing lemons with the name Bruce Willis. And money, money, money. Even if you don't have a good script, even if you don't have an interesting idea, you always win. So the hero never dies. The American Dream has to maintain - ""you can achieve anything only by yourself"" (not true) and that money can make more money. Shame about the people who have lost their time to watch the whole film, from the beginning to the end. Pity about the millions of dollars that were spent on a stupid idea. Millions of dollars could be invested, for example, in the development of new medicines. But profits are more important than people. Capitalism is dying hard. But dying!",A Good Day to Die Hard
353,Vercettiter,"It's decent, but it definitely could have been better.",7,26 November 2013,"I did like 'A Good Day to Die Hard' (a little bit). It certainly could have been miles better, though. The other ones, even the fourth, were a lot better if I have to be completely honest about it. If anything, it could have used just a bit, like maybe 10 or 15 more minutes of just dialogue at least! You know, hearing a significant amount of entertaining exchange between the characters, getting to know them each a little bit more, and shall I say also adding somewhat more of an actual STORY in the process? There was almost too much action at times! Don't get me wrong, it still felt quite a bit like Die Hard, but then it was like Die Hard was a person and mated with Bourne just before it cut off it's own nuts. Don't get me wrong, this movie has some of that good old dialogue exchange, but it certainly could have used more of it! What would be wrong with that? I'm not sure if that would have saved it, but it still would have made it better. It is still an okay movie though. It was! And yes, the villain definitely isn't a memorable one like in the other ones, but I thought he was alright. The twist in this movie wasn't much of a twist if you realize him and the other guy were enemies to begin with, but I didn't know that at first (which was good). All and all, it's a pretty alright movie. 7/10! It would be better if Die Hard didn't end on this low of a note, though.",A Good Day to Die Hard

355,centralbeerangi-307-394889,Fading fast,6,13 February 2013,"This installment of the Die Hard series sees John McClane travel to Russia to help his son who has run into trouble with the Russian authorities. I was disappointed with the movie overall--the story lacked tension and real mystery and despite a couple of plot twists it is not as compelling as any of the previous entries in the franchise. I would rank the plot at the same level as the previous movie directed by Len Wiseman. Even at 98 minutes the pacing was sluggish especially in the early going. There are several action set pieces in this film that feature lots of explosions and gunfire but I found them repetitive and boring. In fact in two key action sequences a helicopter is featured and both are similarly structured for the most part while concluding slightly differently. The obligatory automobile chase scene is filmed with shaky cam with so many cuts that last micro-seconds that its dizzying. This is unfortunate because the stunt crew do a fantastic job of destroying cars and trucks and there are genuine thrills to be had if only the editor had held shots longer. The chemistry between Willis and Jai Courtney was not there for me; you will know what I mean when you compare the brief scenes between Willis and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who scintillates in the 2 minutes she is on screen, to the rest of the film. So in the previous three months that has seen releases from Cruise, Stallone and Schwarzenegger, we now have to add an entry from Willis and to my mind here is how I would rank the films: 1. Reacher 2. The Last Stand 3. Tie Bullet to the Head and A Good Day to Die Hard A final post script: At the screening I attended, the movie was projected digitally at an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and ALL of the subtitles were completely cut off. According to IMDb, this movie is supposed to be in 1.85:1 ratio. A 1.85:1 ratio film with subtitles when cropped to 2.35:1 would result in the the subtitles being cut off. I don't know if this was a mistake of the projectionist, who by the way tried in vain to fix the problem, or if Fox Studios decided to release the film in 2.35:1 by cropping the original 1.85:1 version. All of the dialog spoken by Russian characters with each other is in Russian and subtitled so if you can't see the subtitles you are likely missing expository dialog. My rating would be unchanged regardless.Geek Update: The correct aspect ratio for this film is indeed 1.85:1. I went back to the multiplex and confirmed this recently when I watched a few minutes of the film again. This is the first Die Hard film that has not been shot in widescreen. It was shot on film using spherical lenses in the super-35mm format. The director apparently framed the shots for the 1.85:1 ratio (a squarer image than the 2.35:1 ratio) and extracted the image from the exposed super-35mm negative. My experience watching the film in two different aspect ratios illustrates another dissatisfying point of this movie. John Moore's framing has so much ""safe-action"" in the center of the screen image that even when cropped to 2.35:1, other than the loss of the subtitles there was not one single indication of the director's true intended aspect ratio! By cramming all the relevant detail into the middle of the frame, this means that there is so much irrelevant visual information in the top and the bottom of the 1.85:1 image that after these portions are cropped out there is no real loss of compositional clarity. Why would/should someone pay hard earned cash to see this on the big screen? Save your money, wait for it on cable.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Bruce Willis has a great performance as John McClane for the fifth time.No matter how old Bruce Willis gets he can still do A top notch action movie. Tha actor who plays his son Jai Courtney does A decent job as Jack McClane but he could have done better making his character more believable. The story of the film is not the best story and should have been worked on more by the writers.When it comes to dialouge, Bruce Willis delivers wise cracking and funny one liners, but the overall script could have been better. The performance of Sebastian Koch as Komarov was very disappointing, the reason being is because the character he plays in the movie is A little over the top, but if your looking for an action movie with really nice action sequences this is the movie to watch.",A Good Day to Die Hard
358,Laxontlyn,Oh... That was a nose dive.,4,2 February 2014,"Being a huge fan of Die Hard movies and I mean huge! First time I saw John McClane was when I was 5 years old (Ye, I know that this is not the appropriate age for that movie) and I loved it. Then my parents got another VHS tape - named ""Die Hard 2"" and I loved that one as well. Later, I've seen ""Die Hard 3"" and while my first reaction was 'meh', later it has grown on me. ""Die Hard 4"" turned out good, it integrated J. McClaine well enough in XXI century. So I thought that there is a bright future for the franchise. When Die Hard 5 announced I was excited. But it did not lived to my expectations.I want to focus on characters. My God, how underdeveloped they are. John McClane underdeveloped? How? Easy, spend the majority of the movie on shooting stuff (by the way, action in this movie is not that bad) and spent 5 minutes on main characters. His Son is just He is not a fan of his father, and that's it. In the last movie, we at least saw some reasons why daughter had some issues with her father, but here... 2-3 lines of dialogue and off you go. I can overlook an underdeveloped supporting character, but not the a main character. It is is the biggest sin in any action movie, you must have something going on for the main lead, some cheesy one-liners, some view on his tastes, how he sees world or how he interacts with it, something! You must invest people into your main character, because stand-alone action impresses no one in our time. You can't just slap a confession scene (""I am a bad parent"") and assume that that it is enough. Overall, action is okay, but without any investment in character development, no juicy plot or villain and lack of humorous remarks from your beloved main character it falls apart really fast.

360,SimGunther,It's a Good Day for this series to Die Hard,5,7 July 2013,"What happens when you get an incompetent director and a simple-minded writer to take on such a big movie franchise like this one? Well, you get ""A good day to Die Hard"". Understandably, John Moore's Filmography is not the greatest with his recent flops of ""Max Payne"" and ""The Omen"". I still don't know why he continually gets work in Hollywood despite his horrific pieces of work.The plot of this film is unnecessarily convoluted for such a seemingly simple premise as it presents itself. There are really no clear motivations until two-thirds of the way through the movie. I do not mind mindless action in a film of this scale, but if the majority of the film is going to be about mindless action, it makes your film seem bloated at times. While the action scenes were somewhat enjoyable, some of the camera work seemed like it was building unnecessary tension as there were random zoom-ins, ridiculous amounts of shaky-cam and slow motion shots. The music during the action sequences maybe the saving grace of this film, but it can be very forgettable. The majority of the characters were not memorable as most of them seemed as cliché as can be and are not as fully developed as I wanted them to be. The carrot- chewing tap-dancing Russian (Alik) is overthrown by a less enthralling villain (Komarov) who is void of much personality. The lack of a distinct and memorable villain is considerably an ""epic fail"" in ""Die Hard"" standards and even compared to many other action villains is very middling at best. Jack McClane is portrayed as a whinny character that complained a lot about his daddy issues and made him very unlikable.There is very little tension as it sets itself up to make you believe that John McClane is a superhero. The script is truly the weakest aspect of this film as it took away from the human aspect of John McClane's character as he is now a somewhat unlikable person who has no care for those around him and can now take huge amounts of life- threatening damage and still be fine. At times, he did not care what danger he was facing. It doesn't help when he keeps saying that he's ""on vacation"" when he's really not. The entire film is never grounded on any reality whatsoever as Jack and John McClane get thrown out of helicopters, go through countless plates of glass and wood and can still run without hobbling around. There were numerous continuity errors that made the production value seem amateurish along with choppy editing and uneven pacing that made the film seem nothing more than just a bunch of cheap thrills. There were at least a dozen times in this film where I screamed at my TV saying ""That's ridiculous!"" and ""They should have died right there!"" Why trucks that are five or more tons do these insane 360 turns and flips that are not supposed to happen simply because of their design I will never know.As far as I know, the actors did their best with what little good material there was and I honor those who had to work with John Moore and Skip Woods. However, Woods and Moore missed big time as they threw together a mindless action flick that was entertaining at times, but simply failed to deliver on many people's expectations. ""Die Hard"" fans of the series are going to be severely disappointed and should avoid this at all costs. For those looking for a sub-par action flick to kill 91 minutes out of your day and are not huge fans of the ""Die Hard"" series, this film maybe your ticket to an average action-fest.I will give this movie a (forget-me Uranium mind-bomb) out of 10.",A Good Day to Die Hard
361,TheMovieGuru87,"Good on its own,....but worst in the series",6,15 February 2013,"So before the haters of the old school action star start flapping,here is my professional outlook on the new Die Hard. As a stand alone movie, it was a good action flick. Entertaining as hell, I mean Bruce Willis...did they use a lot of CGI? Unfortunately yes, but it worked OK. But damn do I hate CGI. The plot was typical but worked as well(although the dialogue left something to be desired).As a stand alone I give it an 8. As part of the series, I would have to say it is the ""worst"" in the series, but that is not saying much seeing how it is still a Die Hard movie. I give it overall a 7 simply because the plot was weird for a Did Hard movie.There was no hostage situation, crazed hijackers, or a madman trying to claim revenge on McClane. It just seemed out of place to be considered a Die Hard movie. Overall though, you like Bruce? You will like this. You like Die Hard?

Ridiculous stunts at the end, shameless ripoff of the 1st film's slow-mo fall, lack of a real villain, lame one-liner ""dialogue"" between McClane and his son, and the cherry on the top.....

Not to mention McClane and his son happily breezing into the site of one of the worst nuclear accidents in history with no apparent concerns for radiation sickness, just a lame joke about a third leg or losing hair.

363,ProfessorKaos64,"A mixed bag of nuts, even for ""die hard"" fans (pun intended).",5,17 February 2013,"Take this movie as a stand alone flick. Take out what films you know John Moore has directed, that is stars the unlikable son of John McClane, its horrible plot and franchise worthy title. What's left is a so-so action film that has some decent action scenes. Put that back in and you have the worst Die Hard film released to date. On a comparison note, I did enjoy Live Free: Die Hard, but this film is far worse. Yes, we have our tried and true hero John McClane, but this time it seems he has relegated his talents to being a long lost family man, and less of a balls-to-the-wall cowboy (the famous line being absent in this film, despite the R-Rating). Maybe I should give Bruce Willis some credit, he is doing action films at a ripe 57 without steroids (*cough* Stallone *cough*). And for his credit, he still has some punch, but the excitement of the original trilogy's John McClaine is far gone. Sidekicks are never, and were never John McClanes thing, and the only pair up that seemed to work so far, was the obvious and great chemistry of Zeus in the third film. Both attempts, since have fallen flat, mainly due to un-inspirational characters and flat acting. To be honest, if they believed Willis needed a side kick to ""appear young,"" they should have cast ""Marky Mark"" for all we care. We still love you Bruce.The plot itself is pretty bad to be nice. What starts out as a spy- themed-action-packed plot, ends in an accumulation of scenes in which I had NO IDEAD that it was the end of the movie. I'm serious, the plot development was that bad, there was no climax, and you are left with a half written plot, devoid of heft and content. Yes, some of the action scenes were quite enjoyable, especially the car chases, but it falls very flat. The villains themselves, were 1 dimensional, interchangeable with a plaster manikin animated in post process. However it was quite nice to be treated to having the ""T-Mobile Girl"" as a villain. Hats off to the casting crew there.Let me be clear I am a very big Die Hard fan, hence why I paid to view this film, but it was half-hearted, and bereft of substance. Please, PLEASE, PLEASE stop making Die Hard films. Let us remember the oldies and avoid another ""prequel complex"" best illustrated by the Star Wars film universe. Yes, this film is worth a watch, but a purchase will be left best to ""die hard"" fans (I never get tired of that pun, sorry).",A Good Day to Die Hard
364,sowyau,A Very Tired John McClane,3,27 June 2013,"Bruce Willis, I first came to know him since the TV series era, Moonlighting (from year 1985 to 1989), the non stop bickering between him and Cybill Shepherd, the wonderful chemistry from the odd couple. This Moonlighting Theme Song reminds me of used to glue to the show regularly on channel TV3 on 11:30pm (or is it 12:30 midnight?). Saying that kind giving away my age. I am not that old, mind you.The previous Die Hard movies are always about the right man at the wrong place and wrong time. The reluctant hero is always forced to take matters into his own hands in a confined location with race against the clock. Bruce Willis reprised his role as New York City police detective John McClane for the fifth time.This time, His NYPD badge means nothing when he goes to Moscow looking for his now grown up son Jack (Jai Courtney did not annoy me with his performance here), who was imprisoned for an assassination incident. The problem escalates when a high rank ex-Russia government officer executes a sinister plan to smuggle nuclear weapon (whole lots of uranium based canisters) for reason that I did not fully aware (sorry I must have blank stare moment during the scene they mentioned it). Obviously the father and son team up to stop them.No brainer to say it is always a tough act to follow the first Die Hard, I mean this was the movie which re-invented the action genre back in late 80s. Those days, it was a timely antidote to the invulnerable action movie protagonists such as Arnold, Stallone, Van Damme, Norris who so used to blast off their enemies without making much sweat. Two decades later you still find the concept of ""Die Hard on a...... (fill in the blank: train, stadium, boat, bus, plane etc). Die Hard 2 and 3 did not embarrassed their predecessor. When it comes to the forth one - Live Free or Die Hard, you start to feel hmmm..... this is really stretching the point of being a proper Die Hard movie. Let me tell you what is wrong is AGDtDH: The plot and John McClane. I did not have the EXCITEMENT of watching a Die Hard movie. What happen to the wise cracking everyman hero that I used to know? McClane mocked the villains delivering witty lines, and oh who can forget his smirk! I dare you not to cringe at some poor dialogue, ""You know what I hate about the Americans? Everything!"", the carrot chewing villain scorned, the said villain with his superior have about one tenth of Hans Gruber on Flamboyant Metre scale. The same villain's SWAT-like team possess one tenth of Simon Gruber's IQ, They line up and are shot down one after one like a sack of spud. I was expecting to see the vulnerable McClane, but what I get here is him doing some superhero stunt with his son. And the indisputable proof of how much Die Hard's writing had fall from grace is the repetition of ""I am on vacation"", McClane quipped four times through out the movie, as if the screenwriter wants to coin another immortal catchphrase from ""Yippee ki yay, motherf**ker"". The ""I am on vacation"" line is totally corny and out of place. Bruce Willis looks bored and tired. (Read: not acts to look tired, but Bruce seems not really bother to be in McClane role). The only saving grace is the high tempo cars chase scene at near beginning of the movie, where McClane Sr hijack a Mercedes Unimog SUV in pursuit of an armoured tank like vehicle which in turn on the trail of McClane Jr. Overall It is only a half-ass effort from the movie studio to cash in the diminishing Die Hard brand, in other words, a stripped-down sequel nothing more than a poor attempt made to appeal to younger audience.My movie review at www.sowyau.blogspot.com/",A Good Day to Die Hard
365,SanitariumLXIX,Swing and a miss,6,15 February 2013,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. Yeah, it has non-stop action, explosions, and the famous Yippie kay yay, motherrrrr...you get it line.But what is painfully missed is the witty dialogue of its predecessors, a compelling villain like two of the previous four films had, and character development.The dialogue was painfully dull. It lacked any of the soul of the prior films, and when it tried to throw you a bone with a lame attempt at a signature one-liner, it missed and hit the cat.If you thought the villain in Live Free or Die Hard was lame, he's Hans Gruber compared to any of the baddies in this go-round. There are several twists that attempt to keep you guessing as to who the real bad guys are, but they leave you feeling insulted rather than shocked.Surely we know who John McClane is by now, but if you're going to throw his son into the mix, at least give HIM some depth. Especially if you're going to throw some clichéd ""Daddy abandoned me"" issues in. There is no depth in the relationship between John and Jack other than Jack's resentment about ""John""'s leaving him behind to jump off buildings, blow up airplanes, or destroy New York subways. And when they finally make amends, it's obviously forced.What sank this movie ultimately is its run-time. At 97 minutes it is the shortest of the franchise. Had the makers gone the full 120, there would have been golden opportunites to expand the story, gone further in depth with Jack, and a few more explosions to boot. If you just want action, this movie gives just enough of that. But if you want the real Die Hard feel, sorry folks, it didn't show up this time.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Action is brilliant as always but not like the other Die Hard movies. It's not entirely the movie's fault but the cinema messed up as they forgot to apply the sub titles for when it's in Russian language. Most of the dialogue is in Russian and nobody could understand anything what the story was on about??? Such a shame I was looking forward to it since I first saw the trailer for it last year.

Is this a sign of our times that if someone feels threatened by a criminal, once he is unarmed you're allowed to MURDER them?This one action was TOTALLY out of character for the John McClain character. He was a Good Guy, but this one action may have tainted the entire series.I'm not a hippy-liberal, I shoot guns and hunt and fish, and actually am a State Officer. You don't kill unarmed criminals, that is NOT for YOU to decide, and you ESPECIALLY do NOT put it on film as a good thing to do because then the hot-heads in your department will take that as a sign that it's open season on every 16 year who speeds or runs a red light.The writers violated the John McClain Character and in one scene threw into question the entire movie.",A Good Day to Die Hard

It also proves (maybe) that if WE don't want it WE won't watch it, hopefully in the future (I doubt) Hollywood will finally stop making unwanted sequels and reboots. I haven't been to the theater in months because I don't want to pay good money for 90 minutes of fluffy re-imagined by the book sequel garbage. And yes I will never buy another DVD again because I'm tired of those shitty grey colored disks that have nothing more than the film and some subs for $20.

So I had expectations with the fifth movie 'A good day to Die Hard', but this movie disappointed me. Before talking about what I didn't like about this movie, let me tell what I like because this will take only few words. Bruce Willis's performance as usual but he didn't have much to perform except running, jumping, crashing and shooting and first of all giving some dull quotes in every scene which meant to be punch lines. Actually all the character in this movie had nothing to perform but only things that I have already mentioned; I liked all the performances though. So you can understand this movie is full of these things except a good story line. This movie has no solid plot like the other movies of the series. For me story had nothing to say to be interesting.

The great Die Hards (especially the first one, but parts two and three were great too in my humble opinion) were awesome but also not so over the top. This latest Die Hard is also very short, it goes by quickly and the plot is a bit too thin. The villains could be better and Bruce Willis is pretty much just a parody of himself at this point, just going through the motions and collecting his pay check after another ridiculous series of action scenes. It is good enough eye candy, better than a lot of other crappy action movies out there, but not nearly as good as the other Die Hard movies.",A Good Day to Die Hard

I just think that somewhere along the road, something must have gone terribly wrong. For instance, the story of the bad guy(s) is fair enough, but they could have made it much more interesting! A bit more insight in the villains mind. And the story itself would benefit from more surprises and maybe a bit more real conversation between the action-sequences. And speaking of the action-scenes: there's something that could have been done better! There is way too much shaky-cam and CGI! And with these problems, it leads to the fact, that this doesn't always feel like a Die Hard movie. The parts that feels most like Die Hard, is probably Willis spitting out funny one-liners, and when he gets that look on his face. That John McClane look. The movie does of course have some other highlights. Parts of a car- chase is very good, but much of it gets ruined by the shaky-cam and strange angles. Still I must say that I enjoyed the movie to a certain point, it did make me smile quite a bit.

378,marcusfernandez-28887,This is not a Die Hard movie. Period.,2,23 June 2019,"The Die Hard franchise is one of the best out there. Not only are the movies great (yes I love the 4th one too) but they gave us one of cinema's coolest characters, John McClane. The one man army John McClane. This was all until the 5th one.
You simply cannot consider this film a part of the franchise that redefined action. Die Hard 5 couldn't have been further away from a Die Hard movie.
To begin with, John McClane, the very character this franchise is built on, is pushed to the margins. Bruce Willis tries but he's working with a script that would work better as a Transformers movie.
Secondly, there's really no villain in this movie, there's no Rickman or Irons or Olyphant. What makes the first four great is the challenge, the formidable, menacing yet charismatic opposition. That was completely absent in this catastrophe.
Sure, there was action, and not all of it awful but there was never the intensity or tension that the previous films had. There were loud, big explosions, there were car chases and crashes but there was never a moment in the film that you were with the characters, never a moment you felt the frustration and emotion.
At the end of the day, Die Hard 5 not only fell flat, it shattered before impact. A Die Hard movie is better than loud noises and explosions, it's about character and survival and pushing against impossible odds. I guess it wasn't that hard for this franchise to die, just put John Moore behind the wheel and throw in Jai Courtney as well. Voila! Franchise dead.",A Good Day to Die Hard
379,carterferguson,Definitely worth your time. Some great action.,8,22 December 2013,"I read some really damning reviews of this so took my time to watch it. I'm glad I finally did! It's a great movie and has some incredible action sequences - there's plenty of talent both in front of and behind the camera. Take a minute to give it a watch.Some reviews have said that Bruce Willis ""phones in"" his performance, but that's pretty unfair. The issue possibly is that the script isn't quite as clever as previous Die Hard's - I mean Die Hard 2 is a bit ropey, though lots of fun, but as a series it has a certain charm and cleverness. This film isn't quite in the true Die Hard vein however but to hang it on Bruce Willis is again, pretty unfair.The set up is pretty much the same. Drop Bruce Willis in a situation and let him fight his way out of it - and in this one its his son who shares that action with him, always just about one step behind. The difference filmically in what I see is that its an especially choppy action cut (lots of fast edits) and its set in Europe, and shot with a European feel. That said it looks GREAT - just not very Die Hardy. The CGI also got a kicking in other reviews I'd seen, but watched on my 42"" 1080HD LG, I have to say it looked pretty damned good to me.I'm not going to prolong this. Ignore the negative reviews.

380,midwestdawg83,"Not Enough McClane, Too Much Mindless/Pointless Action",5,5 July 2016,"As a big fan of the original, I was interested to see what would happen when John McClane is in another country. Seeing as how this was a poorly-directed action movie, I was disappointed.I say poorly-directed because of the cause and effect of the action sequences. As the hero, McClane isn't supposed to cause wanton destruction and indirectly murder civilians. The overly long car chase makes it clear that several car drivers died as a result of the chase. It's rather bizarre to see a hero act as such.Also, the Die Hard series is famous for smack talk. McClane talks smack to the villains and just about everyone else in between. He barely cracks jokes here. The movie felt more like a cheap Euro-action movie that was labeled a Die Hard movie after the fact. Think of all the cheap European action movies Wesley Snipes has made.Jai Courtney's acting is stiff as McClane's son. The small scenes McClane had with his daughter were far more interesting. He has better chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Winstead, hands down.Another downfall of the movie was the unclear plot. Some Russian political story that required a lot of subtitles was not a wise choice. As an action fan (and Die Hard fan), I don't wanna read subtitles 1/3 of the movie.Compared to ""Live Free or Die Hard"", it's a pretty big letdown. Bruce Willis does his best with what little he's got, but he can't save the convoluted plot or stop the villain from being so lame. The villain was a Russian gangster, politician scientist. Not sure, TBH, it was confusing to understand his purpose. That's a major flaw, especially for a Die Hard movie. The main villain isn't interesting or worth understanding.It's an OK action movie overall, but in terms of the series, it's the weakest. Lack of character development and comedy.",A Good Day to Die Hard
381,danmankp37,A Good Day to Waste 10 Bucks On a Movie,2,16 February 2013,"A Good Day To Die Hard is one of those movies that is sure to suck in fans of the franchise based on nostalgia but I strongly encourage you to stay away and simply pop in Die Hard on Blu-Ray. This 5th DH movie was one of the most poorly put together action films I have seen in the last 5 years. This time we find out hero in Russia to help his son Jack who has been arrested. I don't even know if the so called story even qualifies as an actual plot. Something about Uranium in Russia and McClane's son Jack is a CIA agent trying to get this political prisoner away from the bad guys because he has some document they need... That is the nut and bolts of this poorly edited and lousily scripted mess. This movie simply flies from one scene to the next as an excuse for more guns going off and explosions at the shortest run time in franchise history of 87 minutes. I have no idea why they felt the need to include so much family drama around McClane? Having his wife involved in the first 2 worked even having the daughter play a minor role worked in the 4th but now his Son is basically this Superspy tough guy right along with McClane side by side shooting up the baddies. And of course we get the clichéd story of the father and son being estranged, what else? I didn't think I could see a worse action movie than Total Recall in 2012... This was pretty darn close. Fans of the franchise please avoid this one at all costs..",A Good Day to Die Hard
382,jeppe-jacobsen,No need to summarize.,4,12 February 2013,"Before going to the cinema: To me, there's no doubt that Die Hard 1, 2 and 3 were among the finest action films of the 80s and 90s. No. 4 was decent, but I was kind of laid off as he hung on the wing of a Raptor aircraft. That was to me a bit overmuch. I hope this one here captures something more of the humor from the first three films. I really like the idea of it taking place in Russia.After watching the film: I was immediately apprehensive when I saw it was only 97 min. But of course; rather an appropriate length film than a lengthy film which loses momentum. A good day to die hard, however, put the stove on for high political drama and spy-style thriller, but there is not actually any of the these elements that succeed very well. If it is a spy movie, you are after, then there are Mission Impossible films that are significantly better. John McClane's person is still supplied with a good deal of charm and humor by Bruce Willis, but his son Jack played by Jai Courtney is very shallow and transparent, which is disappointing. The film simply pushes too hard to get started on the car chases, Russian helicopter show offs and so on Therefore it scarcely achieves to establish Jack as McClane's son leaving many questions unanswered. How did he become a CIA agent? How is it that John so quickly just travels to Moscow? There should have been screenplay for at least 30 or 40 minutes more. It contains movie ideas enough. There are both old Russian double-dealing, trafficking of plutonium (or uranium?), Nuclear disaster, etc, etc (great stuff!). There is just none of it being utilized to get characters, plot and drama to come into its own. We are just too quickly paced way onto the final, which takes place in Chernobyl, which is great, and a lot of gunfire and explosions happen, which is well made, but also quite exaggerated and predictable. At one point a storage room with uranium is completely cleared of radioactivity (which is not possible), but I was glad they did it, because otherwise Yuliya Snigir, who plays the villain's Russian femme fatale of a daughter, would have had to wear a mask much of the time, and then I would not have had her to look at as the main attraction. She is though, despite the fact that she is gorgeous, just as superficially told that as the rest of the cast. Well, were the Die Hard films ever anything more than just good mainstream action movies? Yes! I think they were, indeed! Please note that a Die Hard film has always had a very charming and well played villain. In the first we had Hans Gruber, in II: Col. Stuart, in III: Simon Gruber in IV: Thomas Gabriel. In this fiver-sequel here, I can't say there is any villain I am interested in. Sebastian Koch tries hard to get the Komarov-person to function, but there is simply not manuscript material for us to get close enough to him. Bearing in mind - and knowing - that we cannot expect that this film should present us with something even close to Jeremy Irons performance in ""Mega hard"", this is simply not good enough. Chagarin and Komarov simply remain Russian 1 and Russian 2, which is really annoying since they are both played by good actors. It could have been a good theater film but it is not. It is a home video film at best . 4 of 10",A Good Day to Die Hard

After hearing about new Die Hard is coming out I was waiting for it and after the date of release I was looking for possibility to watch it in Cinema. The tickets here are not too expensive, but I would rather wait for my friends to borrow me DVD and buy BigMac in McDonalds, that would be even cheaper. Yes, the special effects on the big screen look great, but they are too much unrealistic. Like the escape from first attack of the helicopter, the jump down the building. Also the car escape on the big road. John is driving not too heavy car and he on the purpose bumps into Bulletproof heavy truck, seriously? As much as I understand Jack McClane (Jai Courtney) is a new John McClane, although I, personally can not imagine Bruce Willis to be replaced by anybody. Especially after seeing Jack McClane giving up after the lose of partner and ""client"". I have two opinions. The first, the production of Die Hard movies should stop now, before it becomes too commercial. And second opinion is I would like to know what is next, even if it is not too good.

Big disappointment as, like I said I've always enjoyed the DH films. Even Bruce Willis didn't really seem interested with the source material put in front of him. The baddies weren't really baddies, there was no excitement, no suspense and no emotional impact at all.

386,lubentodev,I start to wonder can it get any worse?,2,17 May 2013,"This movie was a huge disappointment, which is a surprise - considering my low estimations. You wonder why I didn't expect much - check the previous sequel of Die Hard. But let's be specific - the movie has little to no actual screenplay, we just go from one explosion to the other. Yes, there is some dialog, but no, it's dull, colorless. There are attempts to make a joke, but they're pathetic beyond belief. Here definitely I should say a word about the villain - well, there are three of them, perhaps, but just one has a sort of character, the others just get to die. So this one antagonist, which we get to know - not very deeply though, is even worse than the villain in Skyfall (gor those, who haven't watched it - this means pretty bad). I start to wonder - do we seriously just want to watch series of explosions and gunshots? I, myself, am neither amused, nor thrilled. But the plot, the plot... It could have saved the movie, but instead it makes it worse. Yes, I was surprised for a second in the middle. And that surprise was pretty much the only positive thing about the movie. But it was so little, so late. We don't see an actual investigation of the father-son relationship, nor some competition between the main protagonists. There is some tension between them, but it's artificial to a degree when I just don't get the point of it. In summary - this is the crown jewel of latest Hollywood filmmaking - expensive and free of any idea, just like Transformers, latest Bond movies (and i don't really like the older ones, they're just better than THIS), Avengers, etc. So I hope - because this is the reason I'm writing now (those of you who believe in the franchise will probably check it out either way), that the shower of poorly thought and absurdly expensive movies will end or at least be slightly reduced...",A Good Day to Die Hard

They were hardly profound, but they were at least good entertainment. The plots were easy to follow and the action scenes were interesting. There were even some good personal interactions to give the stories some heft. Not so with ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" This movie is an abomination. The plot is unfathomable -- I left the movie laughing, wondering what I had just seen. The action scenes are utterly implausible, sheer nonsense. I understand that, in order to enjoy movies like Die Hard, you must stretch the imagination a bit; but the scenes in this movie are absolutely ridiculous. Bruce Willis's death-defying falls from tall buildings are utterly absurd. This, coupled with a bad plot, is not enjoyable. And, surprisingly (and inexcusably)the sound track is bad - it is hard to understand what some of the actors are saying, although I am sure that I missed nothing important.

Although we associate Die Hard in the silly action genre, it is easy to forget what made die hard so popular in the first place - a seemingly ordinary guy flung into an extraordinary and dire situation prompting the audience to find humour and entertainment as well as an emotional attachment to the main protagonist - John MCClane.Despite Die Hard 4.0 getting a lot of criticism from fans of staring from that winning formulae (seasoned veteran style Bruce Willis rather than ordinary guy Bruce Willis)and going for a different angle (cyber- terrorism), as well as being not as violent by targeting a younger demographic, I still felt that Die Hard 4.0 was a relatively successful relaunch of the franchise to a wider audience - if a little ridiculous and weak at times.Even Die Hard 4.0 is a masterpiece compared to this instalment, which almost too comfortably relaxes into the father/son story cliché, which is the only real story that makes sense in the whole movie. There are more plot holes and unrealistic moments that bullets fired in this film (AND THERE IS A LOT), which detracted me not only from the excuse for a plot, but even from the few little moments that stood out as interesting. The story literally feels like they have filmed the action sequences first and then made up the story afterwards. You know if a film is bad if you are even bored of Bruce Willis kicking Russian ass - a fun and interesting concept performed in a sheer lazy way.If you are a fan of the Die Hard franchise then chances are you will watch this anyway, however if you are not then this heap of a sequel is well worth a miss.",A Good Day to Die Hard

To start off, the story-line is of no particular interest to anyone. a loose story that is easily forgotten and some forgettable villains. the action was over the top - which i can forgive because of the previous film die hard 4.0 - but the action scenes were just awful. bad camera shots, poor editing, and overall not very exiting to watch, i was wanting them to end which is a very very bad sign when you're watching a die hard film.The whole story between john and his son was cheesy and overdone and to be honest, you couldn't really care about it. they spent to much time making this the main story rather than the actual events taking place that day. the film was also very short, half an hour less than the others, and what was apparently a whole day, seemed like two overdrawn action scenes and a couple of ""father/son"" moments.The ending was was extremely over the top and what was supposed to be a very stylistic ending just ended up being over the top and didn't fit in with the rest of the die hard films. overall this is a very strange film. its so unlike the others and i guess so bad, it doesn't seem real. i cant really get my head round it. I know i'm contradicting everything i just said but the film still does have a few moments which you enjoy, most of them not being amazing but in comparison to everything else, are memorable. i still love die hard and i want a 6th, but this i the worst of the series. still needs to be seen if a fan though.",A Good Day to Die Hard
391,ServalanQueen,Disappointing sequel,3,14 February 2013,"I really enjoyed the trailer for this film and went with high hopes I would enjoy the film too - but I'm afraid if you've seen the trailer you've pretty much seen the best bits. I actually fell asleep in the second half of the film, despite all the explosions and gunfire. I found the film just completely unengaging unlike the other Die Hard films which managed to combine action with characterisation and humour. I found myself not caring whether John McClane lived or died because he had less personality than a terminator in this movie, and that's something I never thought I'd say. Not so much Yippee Kay Yay more RIP. Let Bruce retire and the franchise rest in peace. I'll continue to watch the first three films with great pleasure - especially at Christmas - and the fourth film occasionally - but I never need to watch this 5th film again. Having said that I do like the actor Jai Courtney, and enjoyed him in Jack Reacher, so maybe if they do a 6th film with him and a better script and director I would chance it.",A Good Day to Die Hard
392,jayore3,My thoughts on whether you should see the film or not.,1,30 April 2013,"My goodness did this movie disappoint! This film was awful, and doesn't deserve to be associated with the Die Hard series. Lets dive into a spoiler free look at the problems of this film. The plots in the previous films were simple and easy to follow. They were action movies that stayed simple and fun. This film has one of the most incomprehensible plots i've ever seen in an action film. The plot twists were just stupid. The script is awful as well. John McClane always has great one liners and insults towards his nemesis in the film. He has one or two good lines in the film, but most of them suck and at times he's kind of boring. His son is just as bad though played well by Jai Courtney. He has a few good scenes, and he's kind of cool, but his character is boring and doesn't have much to do except complain about Daddy issues like Indiana Jones in The Last Crusade. Only in that film it was well done! The villain is an absolute disgrace to movie villains, and the twist with another character is even worse! Lets talk about one more thing..The direction and the action sequences. The action sequences had some good moments, but John McClane is for sure a superhero in this film! His son is to!! The car chase had good moments, but for the most part it was badly filmed and it ultimately dragged. John Moore's direction and Skip Wood's script makes a terrible combination. It's mostly hand held work that looks likes something my friends and I would film. It's all corny and illogical, but there were a FEW good moments.Overall, this movie was terrible and I hope they can redeem the series with a sixth film and reject the fifth film from the series. I give it an F.",A Good Day to Die Hard
393,wfuller1994,....The f**k did I just watch?,1,8 September 2013,"Okay, I love Die Hard, but this bulls**t is NOT Die Hard. Every single thing that made Die Hard such a great franchise is stripped away in this lazy, poorly written, and AWFULLY executed mess. In this movie, John McClane has to travel to Russia after his son (Jai Courtney) is arrested after killing a man because he's with the CIA and is protecting a political prisoner. Unlike the other Die Hard movies that had simple plots and great action, this has a complicated and hard to follow plot and atrocious action. (watch the car chase closely and you'll notice that there are times when the armored car doesn't even touch the cars that are pushed aside to simulate them being hit) Not only that, but with the exception of Willis (who's character of John McClane is awfully written) the acting as well is awful. Whoever directed this train wreck should be fired immediately and Fox should publicly apologize for allowing one of their most popular franchises to be butchered to this magnitude.0.5/10",A Good Day to Die Hard
394,ryguymovieguy-887-268397,A good day for this franchise to die hard,3,3 January 2014,"Where to start with a sequel i at least thought would be decent when in reality its the worst film in the die hard franchise by far. Bruce Willis is back as john mcclane in Russia searching for his son jack after he gets into some trouble. Im going to list my problems with this entire order 1. Bruce Willis hardly ever acts like the john mclane we all know and love instead he acts like a annoying old man who just drags himself around the set. 2. The runtime in this film is only 97 minutes and it hardly gives time for character development like the other films did considering they were all over two hours 3. This film has by far the greatest villains of the whole franchise: director john Moore and skip woods who's scriptwriting and directing becomes filled with so many plot holes and shaky cam you will be nauseous. 4. Getting to the real villains we have a villain named komarov who is only revealed as the villain in the third act and the villain for the other period is a bland Russian and his team who don't do anything but yell and shoot. With all this i will list some positives there is some action that is impressive such as the car chase in the first 30 minutes but that soon runs for too long. Jai Courtney as well does his best but his best definitely isn't enough. Overall this is the worst film in the franchise it has unrealistically stupid action , no development in character or plot and Bruce Willis hardly ever resembles john mclane.",A Good Day to Die Hard
395,mange01,Oh dear,2,30 December 2018,"Die Hard films used to be fun. No matter how much trouble John McClane was in, he had a wisecrack or two and Bruce Willis always looked like he was enjoying himself. They were fantastic action films, with great stories and memorable villains. And then they made this one.So, what's it about? Well, a Russian oligarch is about to go on trial for corruption because he fell out with an aspiring politician. For some reason, John McClane's son Jack, who is in Moscow, shoots a man in the head and is arrested. John finds out and flies to Russia, hoping to... something. That's it. The film spends all of 5 minutes setting this up before John is sat in a taxi in Moscow. There's no point to any of this, there's no motivation behind anyone's actions and the villains are completely anonymous. One of them is called... Chagurin? Chagrin? Something like that. The ""plot"" meanders on as John rescues Jack, they fall into the middle of the two Russians' dispute and ultimately end up in Chernobyl. Of course they do! Because when bad guys in Russia have an Evil Plot, it has to involve the only place other than Moscow that moronic screenwriters think the average cinema-goer has heard of. But don't worry, they never even try to explain it. Or the fact that Chernobyl is in Ukraine now and not Russia. Or the villains' motivations. Something about a double-cross? I didn't catch it.Throughout all the other films, John McClane was reckless, but he never intentionally endangered the lives of innocent people. In fact, he tried to help them. In this film, it's like he's playing a video game and he gets points for causing more damage and injuring more people. After he rescues Jack, they pursue the bad guys through Moscow traffic. John commandeers vehicles, punches passers-by in the face, smashes through barriers and into other cars. Then, he drives his very large SUV on top of the traffic, crushing the vehicles beneath. He leaves a trail of destroyed cars and possibly maimed and dead commuters lies behind him. And this is all played for laughs because as he drives off, a woman screams in terror and he yells, ""sorry ma'am"" in reply! Do Russian lives mean less than American ones? He's possibly injured or even killed people and at no point does he care or do the Russian police even show up! The rampage continues for about 20 minutes and no-one tries to stop any of them.This utter stupidity continues throughout. But it isn't even fun stupidity! The whole thing has such a dour, po-faced glumness to it that there's no enjoyment to be gained from it at all. Even the attempted ""jokes"" fall flat because Bruce Willis is so grumpy throughout the whole film. There are a couple of lines that made me smile, but there were even more missed opportunities. At one point, John and Jack shoot a glass ceiling and shower some henchmen in glass and nobody thought to have John tell his son ""shoot the glass""?!?So, what do you get when you take a Die Hard film, suck the life out of it and in its place inject a threadbare plot, endless stupidity and mind-numbing dialogue and then film it in a slapdash way and make it both boring and grim? You get this awful excuse for a film.",A Good Day to Die Hard

John McClane, one of my favorite film characters of all time, is given a horrendous treatment no beloved character should ever be given: relegated to a sidekick. This is HIS movie, not his son's!

Slap on a die hard title, throw in John McClane and you can take a B list action movie to a great box office hit... Try again.This was by far the worst die hard of the series. There was a definite lack of any kind of plot or story. I honestly believe they came up with the action sequences they wanted to film and tried to build a story around them. In the end not only was the story disconnected I as part of the audience felt very disconnected.John McClane was not the character so many of us have come to love. His witty remarks and banter were almost none existent. The villain really had nothing to do with him as it was more based around his son. Let's face it Bruce is starting to age and John McClane can't be expected to remain the character we so badly want to see on screen time and time again. Some movie series should be allowed to remain cult classics without bringing the actors back and forcing mediocrity in the hopes of squeezing a little more money out of a successful franchise, ultimately it kills the franchise and leaves fans disgruntled and questioning why they did it.My biggest beef was the final scenes and the location they chose to have the story based around. One minute the place is a radiation hot zone and the next they're running around shirtless or in t-shirts.I don't even think I will be adding this to my movie collection when it's released to blu-ray.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Sure, there is clearly a huge budget behind the action scenes, and if you can live with a complete lack of story, you might be able to enjoy most of this movie. But if you expect at least a mediocre script, you will be disappointed.If you live on the European continent you will laugh at the script writer's complete lack of knowledge of European geography. Be prepared for an alternate reality in which Chernobyl lies close to Moscow (it is in fact a 14 hour drive) and Grenoble is a city in Switzerland (it is in fact in France).You can learn a lot from this movie, though. As an example, I learned that radioactivity is not that dangerous, and you can remove radioactivity effectively using a simple spray.

Skip Wood's mangled screenplay has little to no care as to what makes it's lead character so appealing in the first place. We remember not only the action beats of the original film, but the affability of John McClane himself - a workaday cop in the wrong place at the wrong time, his intimate chats with fellow cop Al, and his strained but affectionate relationship with his wife displayed his vulnerability.The original film further highlighted this with its simple moment of having McClane walk barefooted on cracked glass.

These film snobs go into a movie trying to compare it to movies that are done artistically. That is like trying to compare comic book art to Renascence paintings. You have missed the whole point of movies! They are a source of ENTERTAINMENT and not political strategies or life decisions that will impact your life and others around you. If you sit around judging movies and considering every little thing wrong with them, then not only do you have a seriously closed mind, but you have no life! Seriously, go do something useful. I'm sure most of the so-called ""film critics"" on this site have made no great contribution to this world other than giving a close-minded opinion about a movie that wasn't made exactly the way they wanted it to be. Are you still in the state of mind that you possessed as a little child who screamed for his mother to buy him candy in the grocery store? This movie was good in my opinion. John McClane finds himself in a totally different situation than he ever has in the previous four films. But such is life! Are you doing the exact same things now that you were doing 20 years ago? Of course not! And to assume McClane will be finding himself in similar situations in each film is not exactly ""changing it up"" for the character. Have an open mind going to see this. Yes, it is very different than the other Die Hard movies, but enjoy watching John McClane aid his son in his CIA mission knowing that because of the history of first four movies, McClane will kick ass, and make all who oppose him DIE HARD.

404,kubo600,Too much action for an old guy.,7,16 February 2013,"First of all, I rarely see products started by Bruce Willis. Yet I learn that he is one of many popular icons of action movies, and to support my comment, I'd like to use ""Die Hard"" as a firm evidence.To be honest, ""Die Hard 4"" was the first movie of it's series I had watched, and ""A Good Day To Die Hard"" was the second one. There are too many action scenes, in my opinion, covered the whole movie. I spent 97 minutes of not being rest. There were few of relax (or slow) moments (or shots), if it was not ""none"", are given, which let audiences joined the ""destruction mission"" of our main characters.The two, one of them was formed, agents use muscle and all the energy to finish their mission. The script was simple, as far as I get: to get all the things burned and to kill the devil. The one and only funny detail that amused me was that ""the father on the vacation"", which he repeated a few times, three as I had counted, was by accident involved in ""undesirable mistake"" made by his son. He reacted as if it was his duty which needed being done, not only for helping the son, but also because of his manner of that can't stand the trouble.All I cited is quite enough to make sense that Bruce Willis still is not tired from doing his carrier of acting, especially extreme action regardless of the age (58). Thumbs up for John McClane !!!For Jai Courtney, I think he was very good at starting Jack McClane who had a complex thought about his father and his son's role.

Not usually one to pick holes in the plots of films, but given the 'plot' must have been pretty far from the mind of the Director, just going to pick out a couple of my favourites. Firstly, if you ever find yourself in a room full of nuclear radiation,be sure to avoid sporting any sort of radiation suit or protective clothing and 'BLOW' the radiation away with a fan. That's right, blow it away. Also, if you're planning on throwing yourself off a 12-storey building, through windows, roofs, walls...have no fear, you'll be just fine.

407,TomMix86,A Valentine's Day Heartbreaker,3,16 February 2013,"I don't mind admitting I was very excited about A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD. The series has always been a firm favourite of mine. Admittedly I wasn't that excited about it initially. I did enjoy the fourth film, but to me it felt the least like a DIE HARD. A film that was certain to effectively be LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD 2 was something I'd definitely want to see, but didn't feel I really needed. And then more details came out; John Moore... Skip Woods.... February release date; something seemed off here. That all changed when the first trailer came out. I loved it. All that sweetly orchestrated carnage! Bruce in fine wise cracking form! It looked like it may even be returning to the claustrophobic suspense of the original films. Sure, John Moore hasn't made a good film yet, but Len Wiseman's other films are all terrible too, and McTiernan and Harlin don't exactly have spotless resumes either. I was in, and I could hardly wait! Later trailers revealed some corny dialogue, but nothing I didn't think I could find a place in my heart for. Unfortunately the film I saw on Valentine's Day 2013 was very much a film from the writer of ""HITMAN"" and the director of MAX PAYNE; dumb, yes, but more to the point excruciatingly dull. Despite all the publicity about this being the first script to be written specifically for the series, it sure as heck doesn't feel much like a DIE HARD. Willis doesn't really seem to be playing the character from the first film, or from the last film, or much of a character at all. And I'm sure many of you will not be surprised to learn he has rather less screen time than he had in his previous films. McClane Jr. seems to eat up much of it, in a film that was almost certainly pitched to some execs as ""really his story"". Bruce probably doesn't have much more screen time here than he did in THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY. As I have no knowledge of the back-stage machinations of 20th Century Fox, I can only lay most of the blame for this film at the feet of John Moore. Skip Woods' script is well below the series' standard, but even without the polish or extra draft it obviously needed it still has a few nice ideas. It seems like it could have been the basis for a passable, if weak, sequel, but Moore's tone-deaf, monotonous, incoherent style and ugly visuals smother any joy that could have been wrung from it. This is a lifeless film. Scenes that seem like they should have been exciting pass by without provoking any reaction. This film kept reminding me of the scene in HITCHCOCK where the eponymous director talks to his wife about PSYCHO ""refusing to come to life"" in the editing room. A car chase which took 78 days to film limps on for fifteen minutes or so without a single exciting moment while it's playing, or a second to remember it by after it has finished. After this, the first big set piece of the film, fails so badly, all hope is lost and the film never recovers. Sadly, what we have here is less a suitable DIE HARD 5 and more another John Moore film that's as forgettable as all his others. To add insult to injury at the end of the film we get an embarrassingly poor recreation of one of the most iconic scenes from the original film instigated, all too inevitably, by McClane Jr. A terrible idea, horribly executed. Still, at least that moment made an impression, which is more than I can say for most of this film.This was a heartbreakingly bad film and perhaps the worst part is that I know I'll put myself through it all again. Not until it's in the bargain bins though. Who knows, maybe the mooted Director's Cut will be an improvement? I'm pretty sure it couldn't be anything else.At least I'll always remember how excited I was when that first teaser hit.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Demolishing half of ""Moscow"" (the most parts were shot at Budapest) without any cops trying to stop them was the most odd thing. The action scenes were without any idea, so that's why they needed to blow up and demolish so many things. During the actions there were so many stupid movements that no cop or CIA agent would do, it's hilarious.I had no thrill at all during the movie, never worried about any character ""Gosh, I hope he'll come out well from this"", and that's because John Moore worked on the different characters as if a clock- maker would work with a sledgehammer.

There was no way that this could be a disaster. I'd watched the first 3 films, and even the fourth had it's moments of brilliance. How wrong I was about this film.It is by far the worst film of the Die Hard franchise. Jai Courteney takes over every scene, pretending to be some kind of Jason Bourne rip- off, with very little charisma. Whether Bruce Willis was told to take a back seat in this one, I don't know, but this was certainly the case. John McClane is reduced to being a spare part. The plot is wafer thin, with poor direction, and very little suspense. Considering how the original film was over 2 hours long, and this is just 98 minutes, tells you just how little effort has gone into the plot, or the script. The film also suffers from an over-use of CGI, making it look unrealistic.There is no history about McClane's son, about how he became a super- spy, and why he was in Moscow. And how McClane just suddenly bumps into his son, in the middle of Moscow, understanding how vast and large the city is, makes this even less plausible. Also, we don't even know about the villain's real motives, even at the end. And there is no memorable villain in this film. Think Jeremy Irons, or even Alan Rickman. All you get here, is clichéd Russian bad guys, embroiled in a terrorist plot you end up not caring about, with Anti-American motives. I was becoming very restless in the cinema watching this, and I felt this was a waste of my time and money. If you are a Die Hard fan, please avoid.

Fortunately for the film's investors, who are involved in such a forgettable sequel, it's franchise's reputation alone will guarantee a universal paying audience, and perhaps the series will live to die another day?Personally, I doubt Die Hard will ever have another heyday, let alone a return to form, but for now, it's worth a watch if your expectations are kept at an all time low, or you're just drunk and looking to be entertained by a bunch of sounds, shapes, and colours for 98 minutes or so.",A Good Day to Die Hard
413,sportyrich2000,A Bad Day To Watch Die Hard,3,30 December 2013,"If we for the moment take this film out of the rest of the series and see it as it's own film, does it make it better? Unfortunately not. The plot at times is inexplicably thrown together, the action sequences are awfully directed and the script seems to have been written by an infinite amount of the Teddy Bears in Argylle's limousine.There were times in the film where I just wanted it to end which is not something that should happen in any action film but as we take this back to it's series we can make that argument more solid. When in Die Hard did we ever think 'you know, I'm just not interested anymore'? Die Hard 4.0, the lower end of the series, still had a moderate pace and characterisation throughout. This film just had set pieces strung together linked by Bruce and Jai walking in the dusky light. Also Die Hard 4.0 is lambasted for Bruce Willis riding on the back of a jet, silly yes but this was beyond that. One scene (sort of SPOILER) has Bruce thrown full pelt from a helicopter through a glass window 50 metres away and then rammed by the same helicopter as it explodes finally falling through 3 concrete floors. He stands and walks away. Man of Steel felt more pain. All the way through Bruce exclaims chalkboard and nails style, 'I'm on vacation'. Sorry Bruce, loved you in the first 4 films but this time I kind of wish you had taken one instead.I just hope we can have Die Hard 6 for the one reason. It needs to wash away the memory of this dark, slow-mo saturated, script deficient waste of a successful movie series.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Jackson, I have been a big fan of Bruce Willis. The bad news is, like most of the 80's icons, Mr. Willis is aging. The good news, however, is that he is aging like wine. I will not lie, if you are planning to watch this expecting gold like the first through the third, you will be disappointed. Hell, I was disappointed with ""Live Free..."". But I can assure you that if you are planning to watch this for incredible gun fights, destructive car chases, illuminating explosions, beautiful slow motion action scenes and Mr. Willis' hard-ass dry humor and bad timing wit, you're in for a treat. It has definitely been a while since I have seen such impressive and entertaining action. And boy does this deliver.Director John Moore did a fantastic job with the action scenes and the tempo of the movie.. For people to smash this movie because it isn't what Die Hard used to be is unnecessary. One cannot improve perfection, but from the mind of someone who enjoys lots of carnage and a good pace I can say for myself I will be buying this one on blu-ray just to watch the body count rise. Yippie-Kay yay indeed, Mr. McClane.",A Good Day to Die Hard
415,lizawinthrop,I personally loved it.,10,30 June 2013,"Fun though it was before A Good day came along, I think Live Free was an unnecessary sequel, then once along came A Good Day I was captivated and came to the conclusion that Live Free was probably a hypothetical early treatment for the fourth installment that by some glitch in the script filing department was grabbed by a studio exec in a hurry mistaked as a different script and by long term accident by the crew that had not been informed what the actual aimed project was, it made it through full production and it wasn't until filming was complete that they realized 'oops, wrong script', and A Good Day is the real worthy definitive standalone fourth installment that faithfully with heart explores what McClane is up to in the 21st century, and really just a perfect in every sense of the word sequel as a father son movie, and overall just a sequel genuinely faithful and worthy to the originals and not just some silly shoddy sequel of the devolution of the 2000s, so for this sequel time just stood still.",A Good Day to Die Hard
416,theredtank,Much ado about snuffing,1,15 May 2013,"If I had a time machine I would go back to the time I started watching this movie, but instead of strapping in and waiting for an officer McClane ride of adventure, I would've asked my wife to bash me about the head with a frying pan for 96 minutes. The same amount of mental damage would have been equal. When Bruce Willis was promoting this movie in the UK he was very surly, now I know why. How can anyone promote this pile of crap, I mean there aren't many ways of describing a turd are they? It reminded me of when Mr Burns (simpsons) scalded his monkey for mistyping their version of a tale of two cities, it seems this was their follow up version. After 10 minutes of vehicle stealing, car chasing, tyres screeching, in a city he had never been in before, crashing through barriers and bridges like he had G.P.S.inserted manually into his head. I sat looking at the screen like Alex did in clockwork orange, pleading for someone to turn on the lights. No one did, no one put a bag over my head either, and my wife left the frying pan at home. I left after watching the movie in a wheelchair as most of my brain had frozen, and I could not command my legs to move. It really was that bad.

417,sajid_trash,Is this the end of the road for John McClane?,3,23 May 2013,"In the summer of 2007 everyone around me was disappointed by the Die Hard 4.0 but guess what, i was sold due to the iron man Bruce Willis and a strong negative performance from Timothy Olyphant. And adding some cool modern day stuff into this epic movie really did make me excited.But this one is BAD. Really i couldn't wait till the end. Before 20 minutes of ending, i got up and sat on the computer to find out, ""Is it really that bad or i was not in a mood for a movie."" Sadly no, i was in a mood. Its horrible. John Moore has successfully destroyed the series. In the past movies we have seen some extra ordinary actions and those got us thinking, "" Yeah, may be somebody can do that kind of thing!"" But this one delivers us with so trash of actions which you wont believe in your nightmare. First Jack and John McClane rescues Komarov. With this much destruction even a die hard DIE HARD fan would feel ashamed and would say, ""Take a break now, would you?"" Then comes the jump scene of the duo. They jumps from over a 10 storied building without even knowing whats underneath and they finds themselves on the construction safety THINGY. I won't spoil much, but again with a jump sequence, the last scene where they jump from another building and finds themselves into the pool! WOW! One question can come to mind, is there no law and order in Russia? In this havoc, where were they? Or the SUPER MOORE thought thats unnecessary? And i really don't want to say anything about the villain. Cause there was none in this one. And lastly... what in the god's green earth they did to McClane! He is not even the shadow of the old McClane and the heart breaking news is... truth is he seemed like a sidekick this time. I really am having DIE HARD time to give this movie a 4.

419,eturk-135-690080,Did I see the same movie as everyone else?,7,14 February 2013,"Looking through the user reviews here on IMDb, one would think that this movie is awful. I read through them before I saw the movie and was expecting to be disappointed as the opening sequence played out. The first 20 minutes weren't that bad at all and I began to wonder what the problem was. As soon as the action picked up, I completely forgot about the opinions of others and really began to enjoy it. Strange, right?Thinking about it, I think I've figured out the number one issue that people have here. This is a fun movie. Ya hear that Die Hard fans? It doesn't just need to be tension and suspense. This sequel amplifies two aspects of the series. The humour, and the action, and let me tell you, it does great in both of those. The action is very over the top, but not in a bad way. The way it's presented is sometimes irritating due to frequent camera cuts, but this was only a real problem during a car chase near the beginning. I never noticed this a second time throughout the movie so I wouldn't put it down as a huge problem. The action is well handled when it comes to gun play and the explosions are fine. Nothing to write home about, but they do their job of being explode-y.Now let's discuss the humour. This is by far the funniest of the Die Hard series. Now most die hard fans of Die Hard (see what I did there?)will complain that the series isn't supposed to be funny. Well my advice to these folks is to get over it because this movie is hilarious. There's no getting around it, it's really funny. There was only one thing that seemed really forced and somewhat irritating. The fact that our hero, is on vacation. He must use that line six or seven times. We get it John, you're on vacation, get over it. Other than this repeated joke, most of the lines really work. Oh, and don't worry, a certain catchphrase that was cut short in the last movie has its cameo. Maybe I'm crazy, but all of these other reviewers really seem like they're complaining a bit too much. Of course the only legitimate complaint I've heard is about the villain. Yes, a good villain is something that all Die Hard movies should have, and this really doesn't deliver in that aspect. He's really not on screen for most of the movie and his plan seems kind of clichéd, but ya know what? I found myself not caring as I sat in the theater. The action and humour were enough to make up for any faults this has. Long story short, see this movie. I have a feeling that fans of the Die Hard series might complain about the new tone of this, but they'll get over it. This is my third favorite of the series (behind the first and third one)and I couldn't be more satisfied with it. Saying that, it does have plenty of faults, so I'll give it 7/10",A Good Day to Die Hard

The action scenes are very well produced, but without a strong emotional core story it's all worthless. John McClane is supposed to kill the bad guys like a ""tank"" (that's what die hard movies are about, and that's why I'm a big fan of it) but in this movie, I didn't really see a strong emotional reason why he was in action at all. For some ""file""? To help out his son? Not such a strong emotional reason. I really love the Die Hard movies, big time, but this movie did not have the kind of spark that the previous ones.

Some scenes too long, and if you've seen it you know which one in particular I mean. 3. Slow beginning. But what critics aren't telling you is whats good about this movie. 1. Over the top action. 2. It is back to R rated more room to move around.(Comedy and Violence) 3. The old Bruce Willis smart ass is back, more comedy. This movie overall pleases but it does not mesh together after the 97 minutes in the theater. So if you're looking to see this movie get a matinée or wait until rental.",A Good Day to Die Hard

But any semblance of logic, reason or believability is definitely flushed down the toilet.I think the director/producers were aiming for the ""so bad it's good"" category. Not sure it's quite there, but I find the depraved level of ridiculousness to be amusing. I mean, this movie is a joke. Some people get offended at how bad it is, but I just laughed at / chucked at it.Oh man, action movies sure have gone to the dogs nowadays.

I just wanted some good old fashioned action and was not disappointed. The car chase with the resulting mayhem and destruction was over the top entertaining. Each set of crashes outdid the previous one. They must have destroyed 200 vehicles. I found the scenes at Chernobyl to be extremely interesting even if they were filmed in Bulgaria. The wasteland that they somehow created was very real looking and certainly made me wonder if it actually was filmed at Chernobyl. Anyway, maybe I am easily entertained.

This is just a disgrace to an action movie that was a game-changer. I won't spend too much time talking about this piece of garbage, as everyone has already pointed out every single solitary thing wrong with it.

I hate this movie. Bruce Willis is not John McClane, he is Bruce Willis. He does not care, he's just collecting a pay check. Jai Courtney gives a very boring performance with no humor or personality and he has no chemistry with Mr. Willis. The greatest die hard villain is in this movie and his name is director John Moore. He did a pretty bad job. Even the action is not enjoyable. The climax of the film is a CGI fest with Willis and Courtney falling through floors and glass with helicopters crashing into buildings in slow motion. None of it is believable.

I was very, very wrong. The magic from the Die Hard universe is completely gone. Its not the lack of action or the plot itself - it simply seems like Mr Bruce Willis has already retired and he just didn't notice that the camera's were still rolling. I guess this paycheck came without any demands... As a lone movie this review and vote might be very harsh. But as a movie with a legacy of 5 really good movies - this film is not worth seeing.

This is by far the worst one of the Die Hard series and one of the worst action movies I've ever seen.For the first half an hour I had no clue what the plot was, let alone who the bad guys were supposed to be. Just pointless action, and ridiculous sequence of over the top shooting in the middle of Moscow. They destroyed half the city and I don't recall seeing one cop in the whole damn movie. As far as acting goes, Bruce Willis's acting is also bad in this one along with everybody else's. He seems he was bored shooting this movie in the first place. And we were constantly reminded of the fact that he is old. Every five minutes somebody would make a comment to Bruce that he is old.But my biggest problem with this movie is that they destroyed the whole idea of Die Hard scenario. All the Die Hard movies have one bad guy with an evil plan and John Mclane comes out of nowhere to ruin those plans. In this movie, there is no such thing.

When you watch it, you'll find out why this review works.For the sake of actually giving you a proper review, though, I will try to take apart this film. I will spend slightly longer on taking apart this film than the makers spent on putting it together.My main problem with this movie is in fact this entire movie. Never before have I seen so many plot holes, so many gaps in logic. The laws of physics, biology and, yes, even chemistry are totally ignored for the full 97 minutes. Not to mention the laws of other school subjects such as Geography, Modern Languages and History. Not to mention that they seem to have thrown out all the books on script-writing, cinematography and direction.It manages to offend/alienate the people of Russia, Ukraine, France and Switzerland in just one scene. That's 262,000,000 people in the space of 5 minutes. Just for the hell of it I worked out that that means they could have offended the entire population of the world in just under 2 hours (119.86 minutes if your interested).But the film is nowhere near that long. Normally I would complain that it was too short; the 97 minutes contained very little really. But in this case I was really glad to see the credits start rolling.But at least they probably found some amusement in the offence in the stark refusal of the writers to look at a map. For the rest of us, and especially Die Hard fans (see what I did there) the offence we take from this movie is not at all funny.As it happens, the movie is not at all funny either. McClane seems to have run out of witty one-liners that make his character so good. The bad guys barely speak, which rules them out, and there's none of the gung-ho funny moments or threatening situations that make the other films great.There is no sense of desperation for McClane, it all seems far too easy for him. But then he is on vacation I guess, and it's something he seems very keen to share with everyone he sees.I love Die Hard. I even forgave Die Hard 4 when it CGI'd together a scene from Transformers and and a scene from True Lies to make what I believe is called a terrible error of judgment.I hate this movie. It gets a 3/10 rating because the acting was actually okay, and some of the action was alright too. But this is just drops in the ocean people.Some people may like this movie when they see it, but I would not spend any money on it just in case you are disappointed. I bought the box-set of Die Hards 1-4 which they released when this movie came out, and now I am glad I did because I don't know if I would buy a box-set that contained this utterly lazy, poorly conceived and executed, rushed job that it is. I don't want to own it, I don't want to see it again and I don't want it in my house.A Good Day To Die Hard...Jesus Christ.",A Good Day to Die Hard

The second and the fourth were OK. But this one is not OK, not even close. No plot, no humor and no acting. But the action scenes do look rather expensive even if very stupid. In this situation the length of the movie (a bit more than an hour and a half) is a good thing as to sit there longer would be a torture. It is easy to get too emotional and try to give this movie 1*, but one has to be realistic - there are lots of much worse movies, hence 5*.

I enjoyed the action. Especially the car chase through Moscow.However, I still don't see how a massive heavily armoured truck that probably weighs 5+ tons can catch up with a much much lighter and most likely faster delivery van.But that's not my main gripe...The ""bad guys"" jump into a helicopter and fly to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Bruce and his son give chase after stealing a car, but:#1: They lay about talking for ages. #2: It took time to look for and steal the car. #3: This is the kicker: According to Google Maps it takes OVER 12 hours to drive to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by car! The bad guys should have been out of there hours before Bruce & son arrived.I dunno, it may just be me but things like this bug the hell out of me. As in fake computer sounds and when cars are constantly changing gears in movies but not going faster.And why do the slower cars (as in this movie) always catch the faster vehicle?Not a bad movie for light entertainment, but just doesn't have the depth as the previous releases. 5/10.",A Good Day to Die Hard
435,rebeccagruber,Delivers a load of action and is smarter than it looks,8,14 February 2013,"Reading other reviews on this movie makes me wonder if we went to see the same film. Admittedly, my expectations for this fifth installment in the series was fairly low, seeing as I wasn't overly fond of the fourth movie. I liked it, but thought it was unoriginal and had characters that felt out of place.But Die Hard 5 (as I'll call it) made up for that easily, with a truck load of action and fun, leaving me with a feeling I haven't had in a very long time leaving the theater - wanting to see more. People say it doesn't feel like a true Die Hard movie, I have no idea what they are talking about. My feeling is that an action movie like this couldn't have been delivered this way without McClane in the middle of it, it wouldn't have been nowhere near as good - he fits in perfectly! Or rather, the movie fits him perfectly.Sure, the plot is silly, but in all honesty that goes for any and all of the four other movies of this series if you ask me. When I go to see a Die Hard movie I want to laugh and be awed by awesome action scenes, and this movie definitely delivers.It had me laugh out loud on several occasions, it managed to greatly surprise me - which no action movie has done in a long time, if ever, and every action scene had me with a big smile on my face thinking ""more more more!"" and ""WOOOOOW!"".It doesn't get the ten because I felt it was a bit short, and there are some scenes the movie doesn't really need. All in all though, I really recommend it.Don't go see this movie for the deep character development or philosophical storyline - see it for some really good action and McClane delivering one-liners like it's 1988, and you won't be disappointed.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Paid $17 for IMAX, felt totally wasted when I walked out.As previous reviewer noted, the film is packed with ""action scenes"", usually overlapping one another, cutting camera angles so fast that is is actually nauseous to watch. Despite so much action, there is no coherent story line, nor any emotional appeal to the audience. The tension never rise high enough to grab audience's interest.

She enjoyed it, mainly due to the humour, but she's not a huge fan of action movies.I, on the other hand am a big Bruce Willis and Die Hard fan, so I suppose my disappointment is more pronounced.This one felt a hammy version of the others. The plot, acting, dialogue and action sequences were all poor. At times, the acting and dialogue were almost a caricature/parody of the other four movies.More than once I expected a wink at the camera.There is a distinct lack of tension throughout the movie and at no time do you really believe the heroes are up against it or in serious danger. The possible dire consequences also don't really seem to matter so much...a case of so what? The key ingredient of the Die Hard movies was Bruce against almost insurmountable odds, yet triumphing with ingenuity, bravery, wit and luck but always aware of the danger.I didn't feel any of that for this movie and at a rating of 5, I am being generous due to past glories.I really enjoyed the other 4 but this one was probably one too many.",A Good Day to Die Hard

I've been a Die Hard fan ever since I saw the first movie, but this was absolutely a bringer of tears. The cinematography is very sloppy. There are moments where you don't have a single clue of who's doing what. And I couldn't help feeling like this was just some kind of early demo, a raw cut of what it was supposed to be. This movie even succeeds in making a - pretty spectacular - car chase boring, just by not shooting/cutting it right. And boy, the finale... gazing at a pack of milk can be more exciting. Missed opportunities!The dialog doesn't help this movie either. Very linear, sentimental or very cliché (McClane clearly states he's on vacation... a zillion times) I never had the feeling that words were spoken because they where necessary, that they were sincere. It was more like it was written... because it sounded tough, sounded good, sounded epic, and not because it was essential to the story. And, mainly because of that, the interaction between characters also felt very stiff and unemotional.As far as the plot goes... not much plot, didn't like it, end of story.That said, some movies are so bad they become amusing. And this is one of them. At some points it really is a very amusing movie. But it's sad to see Die Hard becoming... this. The previous movies have a certain ambiance, a feeling that is own to Die Hard.

I eventually watched this new film but i decide to wipe my mind of my Die Hard Love and be open minded. And you know what? It wasn't all that bad. It had Bruce Willis's Catchy one-liners, His son is played by a believable actor, he looks and acts like a mini McClain. The story line was a bit bonkers but not OTT like Die Hard 4 and the Helicopter missile. Guns, Bombs and Action nothing new but still works for me.I think some people like to moan and slate films before really taking it all in.

Action scene seems to be the highlight, besides that I can't give much credit.The bad of this, is a very long list. The worst for me would be it's horrible plot. As if I traveled back to 1980s action movies with steven segal where the plot itself was very predictable. Acting/casting was sub-par, sounds was no good either.I do not recommend this movie to anyone. It seems as though this movie is made to exploit the previous Die Hard movies. And sadly to say, I have also fallen victim to this. It is safe to say, Died Hard franchise is dead and you will not want to waste your money even for the DVD.",A Good Day to Die Hard
442,michaelberneman,Great action but...,5,14 February 2013,"Let me start off by saying that like everyone I had a feeling this could go wrong. You have a terrible writer, Skip Woods(even if I enjoyed The A-Team) and a terrible director, John Moore. The people at Fox must be idiots because John Moore has not made one good film, so to trust him with the Die Hard franchise seemed a bad idea. The film has a lot of action if not too much, there isn't any dialog!!!! At 97 minutes it's the shortest one in the series ans it sure feels that way. Every other film in the franchise were longer, they gave you more time to explore the rest of the film. But this one feels so rushed, like okay let's go there , and then here,... The film has no structure. It's like they said ""alright guys were gonna make this as fast as possible"" Bruce Willis is fine but it's like he doesn't even talk during the whole movie, his chemistry with Jai Courtney is fine. The plot is okay even if you can see the twist coming after 25 minutes. What makes this film still enjoyable is the action even though it's disturbed by shaky-cam, bad editing and bad CGI effects. If they are gonna make another one they should bring back John Mctiernan and make the movie on a smaller scale. Back to basics!! If they make it on a bigger scale than they should make it as good as With a Vengeance.And another thing: You can't drive from Moscow to Chernobyl in a couple of hours!!!!!!This is by far the worst entry in the franchise",A Good Day to Die Hard
443,MrVarta,Horrible acting from both Bruce and the other actors.,4,17 May 2013,Well the movie begins with a car chase. What is freaking horrible to watch. I takes 30 min of the movie which is insane. In those 30 min u get the most horrible acting you've ever watched. Bruce is a great but in this movie not even close to great. His acting skills makes it slightly watchable but the punch lines the jokes etc. is not even funny but more irritating to hear and to watch.I had trouble to even watch the first 40 min then i had to quit the movie i can't watch such a waste of cash and crappy movie.I'm not really a Die Hard fan but i liked the series. But what they have done with this movie is otter disgraceful. They should be ashamed!,A Good Day to Die Hard
444,Delboy1066,Hey! It's A Die Hard Movie,7,15 February 2013,"Firstly this is a Die Hard movie, and its a all action in your face movie. OK its not the best story line but it does hold the action together. I will be the first to admit that you do feel like your being pushed, hurriedly through the film. Its not worth thinking about how you got to this point in the movie. You really just have to sit there and not think too much about the story and enjoy the movie for what it is. Yes the McClane's should have been killed many times through out the bloody massacre of ""Scumbags"". And the dialogue, what little there is, is made up of one liners that are sprinkled through out the movie.But don't let all of this put you off! It is still a Die Hard and i for one still want to see more of the aged John McClane blowing the hell out of every one and every thing. Enjoy my friends! ""yippee ki yay""",A Good Day to Die Hard

I'm a huge fan of the first two parts, I considered the third one a decent movie, the fourth one kind of sucked, but this one... I don't know how could they mess up so bad with a good franchise. No plot, no chemistry, no funny jokes... unbelievable boring! Better wait until it's shown on TV!I think that the Die Hard series died with this one.. John McClane at his 50's isn't as cool as John McClane at his 30's!I read some of the other reviews, and, unfortunately, I'm not the only one who is a little bit disappointed...",A Good Day to Die Hard

McLane JR wasan't bad in his role and he didin't replace Bruce Willis, if there was a modern version of Die Hard witha younger actor, McLane JR would have done a good job as he did in this film.The R-Rating is hardly enjoyable, there is a bunch of plot holes and Die Hard tried to be too much.In Live Free or Die Hard McLane had his moment in the end where he has a walkie talkie and he is talking to the bad guy like in the first film and it is really epic and all that.In this film there are a few references to Die Hard but that is not enough. The movie is a fun ride, and you will enjoy it. Don't over-think it McLane n Russia was good addition to the Die Hard films. Now why the hell is John Moore direcig his bring the last director back or Die Hard 2 director or even Die Hard director, this one didin't know what to do with the saga.I wish the end got me to leave smiling and i force a smile and said ""THIS COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.So A Good Day To Die Hard is arguably the worst Die Hard, but it still owns a place in your collection, any true Die Hard fan will look at it past it's flaws and walk out and smile.Bruce Willis still rocks though and he is what keeps you into the movie.(7.5/10)",A Good Day to Die Hard

449,Robgundy15,The Rocky 5 of the Die Hard movies,2,13 February 2013,"This movie was just horrible. Live free or Die Hard was a good movie with a good story. This movie was a bunch of action scenes with a swiss cheese plot, poor character development and a forceful attempt at humor. The antagonist wasn't remotely threatening at all. They clearly made 1 to many. The movie basically just throws you into the thick of a plot that don't really have an idea of whats going on. Lets not forget all the failed heartwarming attempts at compassion between father and son which like the humor, was terribly forced. John Mcclanes son refuses to call him dad and refers to him just by his first name, how cliché. stay away from this movie its trash",A Good Day to Die Hard

It lacked the die hardness of the previous 4. The script was...wait, there was no script. Its like someone wrote down a really, almost forgotten, bad dream that they had. So if you are planning to get this on DVD, don't.So all in all it was a really bad movie. I like to see the action on the screen, no see things crashing around.

It was just as good or a little better than the R RATED version of Live Free or Die Hard.The movie had great action, and chemistry between John and Jack. The story was good but, could of been better. The movie was too short running at hundred and forty minutes. I thought the story could of developed better, if it would of been longer. I was happy that it was rated R but, it felt like a soft R by cutting down profanity, especial the F bomb and the blood violence that we saw in the first three. The movie deserves better than a 5.8 it should be at lest a 7.1 or 7.0. But, all in all it was a good movie. Don't listen to all the bad reviews and talk about the movie go and see it for yourself.",A Good Day to Die Hard
452,guitarspin,Okay,6,23 February 2013,"A Good Die to Die Hard is the fifth instalment of the Die Hard Series. I found this movie to have a lot of action but not a lot substance. I would say it's on par with the fourth Die Hard and that's not saying much.I think either the franchise needs a reboot or this should be the last one. To me the Die Hard series is in a bit of funk and seems to be stuck in a transitionary period. The last three movies have had Bruce tag team with another actor to fight the bad guys, Samuel Jackson, Justin Long, and Jai Courtney most recently. However, the big difference between the third movie and the last two is that in the last two the partner isn't the calibre of Jackson. Also, there seems to be a huge lack of character development of the villains. In the first Die Hard and the third one, Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons characters were developed very well.Moving forward they should either have Bruce Willis by himself running the show or let someone else takeover in a reboot, somehow they need to take the franchise in a new direction and badly need a strong actor to play a villain or at least develop him. For example, Mad Max has been rebooted with Tom Hardy taking over for Mel Gibson, Joel Kinnaman is taking over with a RoboCop reboot.",A Good Day to Die Hard
453,glammering-443-888993,Worst film ever,1,9 March 2014,I simply could not find a plot in this film. I like action but it has to supplement a plot so that you have a story line. If someone could explain the plot to me I would be interested. Maybe. You throw in a twist here and there. The son is CIA and dad doesn't know. Daughter is true and threatened and then not and actually is bad. Did I care? No. I got so bored and I kept waiting for a plot but there was not one. So good luck. To try and save you from wasting 2 hours I am going to try to add more lines but in reality the film was a bore. It could not even get Chernobyl right. There was a National Geographic on Chernobyl that had more information that was accurate than this stupid film Why did every time I see a truck or helicopter did I know it was going to be wrecked or blown up. So predictable.,A Good Day to Die Hard
454,salt-levent,Die-hard has been going down since Die-hard 4,3,9 May 2014,"I do not know where to start. The whole story is a mess and if you take action scenes out, nothing meaningful will be left.First off, finding a person who can speak English in Russia is next to none, unless you are in an international hotel or a touristic place. Your only options are either to speak Russian or have somebody who can translate. Otherwise, you are done. However, in this movie, almost everybody, even a taxi driver speaks English and sings Sinatra.Second, the distance between Moscow and Pripyat is around 700km (440 miles) and more importantly Pripyat (Chernobyl) is in Ukraine, not in Russia. To reach there, you need to cross the border, going through customs, which is not a case with a stolen car loaded with weapons (I am not even commenting about possibility of hitting a luxury car parked in front of a nightclub and loaded with military grade weapons). Even if they manage to do this, considering least 7 - 8 hours drive time plus the time losses at the customs, the odds are that McLanes could hardly make it there before the end of the show.Last, Chernobyl is not a deserted place. Since mid-2011, a construction project has been going on for installation of a new confinement over the damaged reactor to prevent leaking of radioactive material to the environment (the old one is falling apart).",A Good Day to Die Hard
455,deherwe,Dying a Little Too Hard,6,9 March 2013,"The worst that can be said about this film is that the script hits too fast, too hard. Many action movies begin with powerful action sequences that have little to do with the major conflict of the film. Take the last Bond film, for example. It began with a chase and shootout, showing the conclusion of a previous caper. A Good Day to Die Hard sprints though scenes thinly establishing the primary conflict in order to get to the first action sequence. From there, all the action deals exclusively with the primary plot arc. This unfortunately minimizes the drama of the action for at least the first third of the film. Moreover, this lack of attention to establishing conflict makes the dialogue sound hammy, particularly between McClain and his son, because the audience does not fully understand their relationship. All of these problems however, settle out by the end of the film. Further in the movie, the father/son relationship is given the depth it deserves after the son is injured. By that time, there is a bit more drama backing the action sequences and the audience is allowed to see more of a transformation of McClain from a clean-shaven wisecracker to a bloody mess. On a whole, this film stumbles at the starting block with too big a leap, but limps to the finish line with a true Die Hard spirit.",A Good Day to Die Hard

A Good Day To Die Hard is a huge mess. No good plot, bad cgi, rushed scenes etc. Only thing I found good was the action. An R rating didn't help this one at all. It almost seems like they tried to make this PG-13 at first, but then changed it to R later because fans were complaining about Live Free or Die Hard's (Aka Die Hard 4.0)'s rating. The movie has PG-13 / 12A violence, and this is disappointing. John Moore could of done so much more with this film, but instead, he messes it up just like he did with Max Payne. Good action, but no good story or character development. Jai Courtney (who starred in Jack Reacher earlier this year) did well on his part, and I do hope he returns if they are making a 6th one, but I am begging, please get a good director for the 6th one, since Bruce says it will possibly be the last one. Bring McTiernan back, and let him end the series with a huge bang! I am sorry to say this, but the film was not good at all.

458,andrewsmith1-609-479980,Here's why it's just so bad ....,2,15 February 2013,"As a fan of the Die Hard series I feel the need to warn others - Don't waste 97 minutes of your life on this movie! Yes, it really is that bad. Here's a concise summary of why it's just so bad: 1) John McClane's role is really as a side-kick. Why do this to the big man .... why? 2) The movie lacks a bad guy. Does the movie have people that are bad - of course, but it lacks that McClane v Super-villain factor. 3) There's very little of the Die Hard humour we've all grown to love. 4) The movie parodies the Hans Gruber death sequence - never - never do this. 5) Jai Courtney is terrible. It's hard to discern if it's the role he's been asked to play or him, but either way he come across as a spoiled brat pretending to be Jason Bourne. 6) There's hardly any script - it's as if the script were sandwiched in post production to fit around the bangs and crashes. 7) It's not in the USA. This sounds trivial but it's not - the film just doesn't work outside of its tried and tested environment. 8) The car chase scene - oh my. If you do choose to watch the movie after reading this the good news is that yes, it does eventually end - although it may not feel this way. So in summary, go plant a tree, play football, go for a walk, in fact - do anything but for the love of all that you hold dear - don't waste your life on this.",A Good Day to Die Hard

It never established a clear relationship between foes. It never was funny or witty. If you like to watch totally unbelievable action scenes with tons of stuff being blown up, shot up and destroyed you will like this movie. True Die Hard fans will hate it. Unlike the previous four, I will never watch it again no matter how many times it ends up on TV.I actually fell asleep during the last 20 minutes of a matinée. What a waste of $6.

460,tomperry9192,Disappointing,3,17 February 2013,"From being a huge fan of the Die Hard series, especially the first three films, I found this film boring and not of the style of a Die Hard film. Bruce Willis is looking tired, old and in this film I really feel like he is a shadow of his former character. He has no charm or substance to him. His son takes most of limelight in the film. Bruce Willis is more of the supporting act rather than the main act. The plot is weak and too much CGI was used.The director/producers have shown laziness in their work here and really have not put any real thought into the scriptFor those Die Hard fans out there, don't waste your money watching this film",A Good Day to Die Hard

The movie lacks a plot because it kept taking a twist on the plot and action. Worse of all, I think most of the action is Bruce and his son jumping through glass atrium ceilings or outdoor scaffolding, of which no person could survive: Not even for a movie character! Perhaps a low budget may have contributed to the movie's failure. It very apparent that they ran out of money to complete the film. It's easy for a movie goer to see that the film wasn't finished and ready for distribution. Most importantly, Bruce Willis fails to carry the movie with his character. Quite frankly it appeared to me that the character Bruce Willis played in this movie was ready to retire to an old folks home.

Outdated cliché's? Apart from the premise itself, too many to count. I am (was) a fan of the Die-hard franchise. The previous episode was just plausible, and had enough of the new mixed with the best of the familiar John Mclean to make it watchable. But this smash-fest is a complete face-palm.

463,sentient-cabbage,What did I just watch?,1,20 May 2013,"Director John Moore has committed yet another atrocity, in the same vein as his awful rendition of the Max Payne franchise.Not five minutes into this movie it explodes into a veritable pandemonium of car chases, gun fights, miserable one-liners, explosions and bad guys dying by the truck load, with no explanation or background as to why any of these things are happening. It's a ridiculous orgy of violence strung along a thin plot that is littered with holes, and this bland cocktail is accompanied by worst dialogue in recent history. Uwe Boll makes better movies than this.Screenwriter Skip Woods completely misunderstands what makes John McClane a likable character. The John McClane we know and love has integrity. He's a good guy who gets thrust into a bad situation and tries to deal with it the only way he knows how - like a bull in a porcelain shop. The character that Skip Woods has come up with, is a reckless, irresponsible maniac, as illustrated by the scene John inexplicably assaults a random civilian in the streets of Moscow, steals his car and then wise-cracks about the man not being able to speak English. This version of McClane is little more than a misogynistic flag-waving idiot, and even the good acting of Bruce Willis can't get you to accept him as John McClane, because the guy on the screen simply doesn't do anything the way McClane would.Willis' acting is up to his usual standard, but unfortunately we only see some of it in the few tiny moments between the gunfire and explosions, and there's just not enough room in there to both tell a story and develop characters. In part, this is due to the short running time of 97 minutes, which makes it the shortest Die Hard movie yet. Likely, 95% of the films budget was blown on that ridiculous opening action scene, leaving us the production scraps for everything else.Dear Hollywood, stop crapping on all the franchises of my youth.

First of all where is John Mclane he is not in this movie. Jack (The son) is the worst character i have ever seen in a movie he looked so awful. The action in this movie was so horrible just explosions everywhere and guns shooting. There is no fight scene in this movie, can you believe that? The villain/Villains is so so horrible and awful that i am speechless. You don't know who is the villain I'm justing going to say there are many villains, and everybody is awful. The CGI was so damn awful it was a scene Jack and John falls from a building i was like where did they go. They just disappeared in the air. If people thought John was a superhero wait until you see this movie. John is in a car and it flips 9 times and he gets out and starts walking WHAT?? he just came out without a scratch.

You know those days when you really wish for something? I mean, really, really hope for something good? I felt like that about the new Die Hard movie. Mind you, I had no great expectations for it - but hopes, yes I had those. It could have been so nice. I thought perhaps they'd have learned from the just-decent 4th one, bring back the swearing, the jokes, the confined spaces, the hide-and-seek. You know, perhaps even a peek of Holly McClane, or TV reporter Dick Thornberg? That would have been so awesome. Instead, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a weakly written, blue-tinted shaky-cam action flick that takes itself too seriously. Got nothing better to do on a Tuesday night? Yeah, stay home anyway.Okay, fine. So the swearing is back. Yay, I thought for a moment somewhere in the first third. But then I remembered the ridiculous twenty-ish minutes I'd just sat through. Here's a rough summary of the beginning:John McClane learns his son is in jail in Russia. He travels there to, I don't know, I guess help him out or talk some sense into him. It's not really explained. But before he goes, his daughter tells him not to make a mess. OOooOOOoo foreshadowing.We learn the son is actually involved in a plot to help out a political prisoner at a court hearing. I think.Next thing we know, the whole courtroom explodes. Because a mean politician wants the prisoner dead. Son drags prisoner from the rubble into a van outside but as they're about to take off, McClane jumps out: HE WANTS TO TALK TO HIS SON.Son shoves gun up father's nose, tells him he's busy and to back off. Consequently, father joins never-ending, ridiculous car chase across Moscow involving explosions, wanton destruction, countless car wrecks and people driving off bridges. You know, BECAUSE HE WANTS TO TALK TO HIS SON.What the heck did I just walk into?!No seriously, it doesn't get much better. First, apart from a few well- delivered lines by Willis, there's little to no humour in this movie. It's all straight-faced and serious. McClane's son is a random CIA dude, no special character traits. Their relationship is badly introduced and expanded upon. ""I hate you"" - bullets bullets bullets bullets - ""Okay you know what, I love you. Let's go kill more people.""Secondly, it doesn't look or feel like a ""Die Hard"" movie in any way. There was an article on Cracked a while ago outlining what it would take, and ""Good Day"" has none of it. For instance, no confined spaces. No hide-and-seek. No sabotage, no cat-and- mouse. Numerous locations instead: we go from America to Moscow to Chernobyl, and believe me, when they reached the last location, I really really hoped it'd turn into a Die-Hard-1-esque guerilla warfare tour de force. Nope, didn't happen. No kick-ass black guys like in Die Hard 1, 2 and 3 either.The direction and cinematography are your typical early 21st century mediocre action flick fare. Except for a beautifully designed scene in an empty ballroom, it's desaturated and tinted blue, and not even in a cool ""Payback"" kind of way. The plethora of action scenes? Mostly nauseating shaky-cam. Oh, and the boobs Willis smiles at in the trailer? Not in the movie. Granted, I didn't miss them either. What I did miss was the excerpt from Beethoven's 9th, 4th movement, ""Freude schöner Götterfunken"": again, present in the trailer, absent from the movie.Refreshingly enough, there are some other references to the 1988 classic. We have a deception scene reminiscent of the first encounter between McClane and Hans Gruber. We get a falling-off-a-roof scene, too, served with a little twist. Now, if you think those are lame attempts to copy something that used to be good, well then I guess then you're right. But hey, it's better than nothing.So, anything redeeming about ""A Good Day to Die Hard""? A few things. There were some nicely done plot twists I didn't see coming, and I enjoyed them. Sadly enough, they stick out from the otherwise mediocre writing like Bruce Willis from the rubble around Nakatomi Plaza. Shaky- cam aside, the action scenes were quite well done and if they used CGI, they did it tastefully enough: a lot of that stuff looked gritty and real. I also liked the sound mix. Yeah, the movie sounded really good. But you guessed right: none of that saves it. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" didn't make me angry like ""Prometheus"" did, but it made me sad. Sad like the sad old eyes of Bruce Willis we get to look at for 2 hours. Spare yourselves the trouble, stay home and watch any of the first 3. Or the 4th if you're so inclined. That was decent enough.",A Good Day to Die Hard

As always John had good intentions that go wrong and runs into the bad guys. Lucy makes an appearance and tries to give dad advice on how to handle the situation. Lots of high speed traffic action with armored vehicle that makes for some great stunt driving and plenty of action. You want to see things blow up you will not be disappointed with this movie. John still deals with some of his demons from the past. There are a few scenes that pay homage to the other die hard movies. I was well done in trying to pass the torch to the son to maybe continue. John has his line it this move as well and if you like the DH series you will not be disappointed with this one.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Part four was by no means perfect (i liked it just fine, not as good as the first three), but these movie is so God awful it makes Live Free or Die Hard look like Citizen Kane. The lines are so contrived and cheesy you almost expect a laugh track to come after them like you are watching an episode of Mr. Belvedere. Willis sleepwalks through his performance and there is no chemistry between him and the capable but incredibly wooden Jai Courtney. The cgi is distracting and poorly done and John Moore couldn't direct his way out of a paper bag. His direction style makes Michael Bay look like a nuanced french film director. The only reason this movie gets a 3 from me is because the phrase Die Hard is in the title and the car chase in the beginning isn't half bad but somehow it's still pretty boring. the color scheme in the film is bleak and listless and there is literally no villain presence. you never once are on the edge of your seat and there is no tension, as John Mclane lacadaisacally dispatches bad guys without so much as a drop of sweat or a drop of blood after he gets thrown through windows.

It seems that the director/producers focused solely action, and churned out a soulless, mediocre film that didn't give this viewer an opportunity to get caught up in characters or story.Granted, the big explosions and action sequences look technically great, but on the whole this film falls flat.",A Good Day to Die Hard

I'd rank it 4th out of the five. I care for the 2nd one with the airports. 2 was funnier than this one though. It seemed like the plot was kind of slapped together. Like, we are going to be in Russia, what can we do there that would be hard core? I know! Let's go to Chernobyl! They have radiation there! Also the bad guys are Russian so what is there motivation? I know! Lets make them sell radioactive material for dirty bombs and nukes because all Russian bad guys have access to nuclear material!

480,NEMount,Not As Good As The Original But Still A Valid Entry,10,14 February 2013,"I have, since a little kid, been a tremendous fan of the Die Hard series. I dare say it may be my favorite long running franchise aside from the ever rising Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is with this that I have never posted a review on IMDb up until now. The reason for this first review today is to disclose my personal thoughts and recommendation towards this new entry in the Die Hard franchise. A lot of people have negatively commented on A Good Day To Die Hard, the film that finds John McClane traveling to Moscow to try to talk some sense into his ""wayward"" son only to find that he has been embroiled in a massive conspiracy involving mysterious military forces. While I completely respect everyone's opinion, I would have to disagree with majority voice in saying that is film is terrible and in some views a disgrace of the Die Hard series.I found this film to be the next logical step in the franchise showing an elderly John McClane not only angry with the circumstances around him but also mass confusion as he is out of his element being a in a foreign country. As I was watching, I had a weird initial feeling that this wasn't a Die Hard film as well. However, about 15 minutes into the film it dawned on me that this wasn't the case and this is what the filmmakers wanted. If you wanted to see John McClane as he was in the first Die Hard movie then you should watch the first Die Hard movie. This is 25 years later and the character is different however not as radically different as some say. He is still the cocky, awesome, and heroic cowboy he has been for the last 25 years.In some aspects, this is ultimate Die Hard film. While not on the level with 1, 3, or 4, I found this to be better than 2. This film wants to make you uncomfortable and illicit a different feeling from the other movies in that McClane is a fish out of water and doing his best to keep up with his son as well as staying alive and keeping one step ahead of the bad guys in a completely foreign situation. The one caveat is that the plot is a little thin however, I am confident that will be address in the recently hinted at Director's Cut John Moore is working on.In summary, if you are a (respectfully, a reasonable) Die Hard fan this should do it for you. If you don't like anything after With A Vengeance, then you probably shouldn't go see this despite my very strong recommendation to give it a chance. Please don't expect Die Hards 1-4 because that's not what you're going to find. It is an entirely different experience that, in my opinion, adds a new dimension to the Die Hard series. I found A Good Day To Die Hard to be an action packed extravaganza with very solid performances and incredible set pieces. Plus, let's face it - It's just awesome to see John McClane back and doing what he does best.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Helping his son Jack McClane (Jai Courtney) against the evil, over and over again they help each other out en watch each other's backs. Explosions and car crashes are daily events and they are well equipped with dozens of different types of weapons.The film is fun to watch, and that's it actually.

Whoops, I'm sorry the lighting is really good. The framing/cinematography MIGHT have been good if it weren't for the apparent fact that the hand-held camera operator suffered from spasms. I'm not sure, but the editor might have been suffering from the Delirium Tremens as well. This might have been the final nail in the coffin for John McClain. It makes me sad that the only way to keep the McClain character going is to give him a crappy story, crappy lines, crappy direction, and crappy scenes.

483,rhymetymewins,A Good Day to Cry Hard,1,16 February 2013,"""Die Hard"" has officially become the very movie that it was intended to be the antithesis of. Allow me to preface: I love Die Hard. I mean, I LOVE Die Hard. I'll defend 1-4 to the death. Yes, the fourth was amazing. Yes, I can recite all four almost line-for-line as I watch them. This, was not Die Hard. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" feels as though John Moore acquired a ton of money to shoot a handful of eye popping action scenes, and then string them together with painfully contrived dialogued scenes to fit his film into the franchise. I'm talking ""Phantom Menace"" painful, only this film is worse. Gone is the playful wry humor. This film tries to be a Bond/Bourne hybrid, & fails at that, too. Actually, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" takes the absolute worst parts of the first four. It takes the cheesy slow motion of the first one, the lack of caring of the villain of the second one, the forced plot twist of the third, and the more over-the-top scenes of the fourth, and meshes them together. This film wants you to think it's a ""Die Hard,"" so it has the most awkward homages randomly tossed in to remind you. But perhaps the worst, and I mean absolute worst part of the film, is the haphazardly thrown in catchphrase toward the in, that isn't even used in the most opportune time. This film takes itself too seriously. The action scenes are too long. The plot is nonexistent. Characters serve no purpose. This is the very film that the ""Die Hard"" of '88 rallied against. I had to pull an all nighter to finish my homework, skip my daily workout, and spend a fortune on a ticket to see this movie, and it really did hurt. This is reason why just because we want more, does not mean we should ever get it. Do I recommend anyone paying a cent to see this? That's a big ""yippe ki-NAY!""",A Good Day to Die Hard
484,kim-tvedt,Lost for words!,3,23 May 2013,"I still remember the first time I saw 'Die Hard', when I was about 12-13 years old. It was Christmas and as per usual I got all my candy (chips, chocolate, soda, you name it) and watched a lot of movies on TV. Just planting myself down and doing nothing but watch movies (this is mainly before Christmas Eve, like the 3-4 days before). I was switching through some channels and I landed on a channel that was showing 'Die Hard'. I knew of Bruce Willis and I was in the mood for an action movie. I was 12-13 years old and I remember the experience I had watching that movie. I still watch it every Christmas (and the sequel). I love 'Die Hard'. In my opinion the best action film ever made.As I have grown older and wiser, I still love the heck out of 'Die Hard' and I thoroughly enjoy the other two that form the original 'Die Hard Trilogy'. And even though I taught entry number four to the series had some issues and the fact that they made it PG-13, I still enjoy that as well. And in my book it was clearly the worst of the movies. That is, until I just saw 'A Good Day To Die Hard'.My God, this was one stinker of a movie. Some of the action was pretty good, sure. But the acting, the story, the pace, the editing: AWFUL. To be honest, when a fifth 'Die Hard' movie was announced, I was excited. Because, even though the fourth one had problems (idiotic villain, some bad acting etc), I personally enjoyed it. It had action, humor and McClane may not have been as wisecracking as he once was, but I just blamed that on the fact that the character had gotten older and perhaps changed his way a bit, but he was still the McClane we all know and love. Therefore I thought that another one seemed legit. That it would surely borrow from the previous entries (the original three) in terms of humor, character and so on, and be like the fourth one, not quite up there, but still enjoyable and fun to watch. Boy, was I wrong.And so I was excited for a while, for the fact that a fifth 'Die Hard' was in the making. Especially when it was rumored that Aaron Paul was going to play John McClane Junior. And then I read it. John Moore was going to direct. The idiot who almost ruined my good memories of 'Max Payne' and 'Max Payne 2' by making perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen. A movie I despise, hate, loathe. I gave up any hope of a decent movie, right there and then. And I was right. I came home from work, made a nice dinner, and was ready for the fifth entry to the series. I had read all over the web, forums, papers etc about how awful it was. Everybody hated it, and I thought: 'They don't have a clue what they are talking about, bunch of newbies.' I did not take long for me to realize that the stuff I had read were true. SPOILER ALERT! : The car chase sequence early in the film is a perfect example of that. It has been a long time since I have seen such bad acting, bad editing and the jokes and stuff that McClane makes just sounds so stupid and are almost cut away (herein lies the bad editing I mentioned) before he is finished saying them. It does not work at all and I was laughing, shaking my head, cursing at the same time. I was so angry at how bad that sequence was and that they had stripped McClane of everything he is supposed to be. This review (if you can call it that) has gone one long enough now, so I'm not gonna say much more. Just the fact that 1) I did enjoy this more than 'Max Payne' (the movie), although not by much, at all. 2) I like to believe that I have not watched a 'Die Hard' film, but a random action movie of very low quality (felt like a really horrible TV-movie sometimes), and that the fifth 'Die Hard' film we really wanted is being planned as we speak.PS: This 'review' has been written right after I finished watching it. I could not contain myself. Do yourself a favor, just don't watch it. You'd be better off watching 1-4. Those are worth watching.",A Good Day to Die Hard
485,nillerus,Uninteresting mess,3,11 February 2013,"I gave this 3 stars, as compared to the other movies in the franchise. As a standalone action flick I might stretch it to 6/10.The Die Hard series is all about violent and bloody mass murder, that is somehow kept fun, because of the characters and dialogue. That's a precarious balance to maintain, and this movie just missed the tone of Die Hard completely.The world isn't fleshed out at all. There is no feeling of continuity between this and the other movies. Lucy McClane is thrown in for a brief moment, but the otherwise excellent and hilarious relationship between father and daughter that is established in Die Hard 4 is just gone.The characters are bland and two-dimensional, both on the good and evil side. Perhaps the most grievous exemplar of this is John McClane Junior, who just doesn't bother to act at all. There is absolutely no chemistry between father and son, Junior being actively dislike-able. At one point I was rooting for the marginally more charismatic bad guy to shoot him in the face. Even McClane lacks his hilarious one-liners and quips. You're going to be heartily sick of the phrase ""I'm just on vacation"" halfway through this movie.The story lacks any real cohesion, the dialogue is horrible, in parts even nonsensical: ""Who's the smart one now?"" ""Hey, I'm just here on vacation"" (not verbatim).The best action happens 20 minutes into the movie, the climax being anything but. It does feature an inexplicably half-naked Russian guy with ""CCCP"" tattooed on his back though, so there is that.There is just no point to this movie. It's a mediocre action film, with Bruce Willis tacked on.Stay at home and watch any of the other Die Hard movies.",A Good Day to Die Hard
486,divyesh,Die Already !,5,7 February 2013,That's all i have say about this movie. Had high hopes after watching live free or die hard.Needless to say it is by far worst of all Die Hard movies. Simply a few action sequences stitched together. It comes across as very hurried effort without any attention to overall outcome. Action by itself is very mediocre and dated. I am afraid the whole team did not have put in enough effort that a die hard series movie should deserve.it may still do well because viewers like me would want to give it a chance after watching the 4th one. it has become some sort of a formula in Hollywood to fork out crap sequels after a hit.Die hard series deserves better than this.,A Good Day to Die Hard
487,jphastingsspital,It's a Good Day to Spoil a Film Series,2,15 February 2013,"(Contains very mild spoilers for the other Die Hard films; will not spoil the film anywhere near as much as this film will spoil your day)John McClane, a man who puts his job as a policeman above all else, is quickly brought to realise that he missing out on the finer things in life. Just as this sinks in, he discovers he is alone, caught behind enemy lines in an unlikely situation where his unique blend of don't-give-a-crap and in-your-face arrogance can aggravate ""the baddie"" to the point where they sideline their original plot in order to stop him instead. In doing this he buys enough time for: the baddies to thin themselves out (and be picked off), the reinforcements to arrive, and his ex- wife/partner/family member to appreciate his passion for his job. Cue credits: the baddies are foiled, family is closer; ""Yippee-ki-yay mo fo"".This is the plot of Die Hard, Die Hard 2: Die Harder, Die Hard: With A Vengeance and Live Free or Die Hard. It works. It's not complicated—it doesn't need to be—it's a Die Hard film.My general point is: It is *not* a Good Day to Die Hard. One or two people do die, but not particularly hard. There is no 'behind enemy lines', there's little quick talking attitude to get our protagonists out of trouble (there's little talking at all), there isn't really a baddie to speak of, there's no plot (which the baddies are tying to complete; there's also no plot to the film), there's no ""good man trying to do right by his own morals"", there are no reinforcements, and in general **there is no tension**. The film starts with an extended action sequence which finishes an hour an half later, having given Bruce Willis enough time to catch his breath and say enough to allow him to call it a ""speaking role"".The clincher? (if one was needed) We do not watch Die Hard films for cerebral engagement, we watch for simple, enjoyable action with enough predictable moments for the secondary characters to shake their heads at each other, chuckle, and say ""That John McClane, always getting into trouble."" - this film misses that by such a margin as to be completely unfollowable, forgettable and, frankly, irritating. The words ""Yippee-ki-yay"" don't even pass Bruce's lips.Do not waste your time with the so-called ""5th"" Die Hard film. It never existed.",A Good Day to Die Hard
488,stephenmcastro,"John McClane takes a back seat as the film forces long lost son ""Jack"" to take the wheel.",2,15 February 2013,"1.5 /5 stars.""A Good Day To Die Hard"" takes John McClane out of the drivers seat, demoting him to sidekick and placing his long lost son Jack McClane in the forefront. But, the underdeveloped and unexplained character of Jack, in addition to the poorly written dialogue and underutilized Willis, easily makes this the most disappointing film of the franchise.""A Good Day To Die Hard"" is a good action movie, but not a good ""Die Hard"" movie. It lacks everything that makes the series unique and enjoyable, replacing the humor, charisma, and character of John McClane, with 100% mindless action sequences and an incomprehensible story. If you were to ask me what the movie was about, I wouldn't be able to tell you.We pay to see John McClane save the day, but instead he's written more like a parent chaperoning his sons secret mission. Bruce Willis feels like a cameo in a Jack McClane movie rather than the star of the new Die Hard flick. It might have been because he was just as confused as we were about what was actually even going on. At no point did I know what was happening, or why. I didn't know who the villains were or what they were doing. I also didn't even catch their namesall I remember is that they were Russian.Nearing 60 years old even Willis has more energy in him than the entire script. Action sequences are connected by awkward scenes in which John McClane has heart to heart conversations with his son. These scenes get extremely repetitive and go absolutely nowhere. And John's only dialogue during action sequences is ""I'm on vacation"". The audience laughs, thinking he's joking. But it appears he's serioushe's on vacation. He doesn't care about what's going on, and he doesn't care about getting to the bottom of the situation. He's on vacation and just wants to talk to his sonAs a fan of the entire series I know that nobody goes to see these films for story or world class dialogue. But, the past 4 films in the franchise have all been well written, well constructed, and well executed. But, the writing in this film is too bad to ignore, making me wonder how much effort actually went into this movie. It's directed by the same guy who did the ""painful"" movie ""Max Payne"", and written by the same guy who did ""X Men Origins: Wolverine"" and ""Hitman"". So I guess the poor quality of this film doesn't come as much of a surprise. The only thing that made us remember we were watching Die Hard was the fact that Bruce Willis was lingering around in each scene with a confused look on his face, begging to be given something relevant to do or something witty to say.All-in-all, ""A Good Day To Die Hard"" is the ""Terminator: Salvation"" of the series. I'm going to act like it didn't happen and wait for them to give it another shot It's obvious that Willis did what he could with the poor script he was given. But when the credits rolled up on the screen at the end of this movie I couldn't help but wonder what Bruce Willis saw in the script that made him agree to do it. While reading all three of his lines, did he seriously think, ""this is going to be awesome, the fans are gonna love it""?To read my full review, visit: moviemumbles.com",A Good Day to Die Hard

490,max-andre-muller,Stay away,1,21 May 2013,"Disclaimer: I am a HUGE fan of the first three movies of the franchise, they are in my mind the best action movies ever made. The fourth one was OK.As of writing this I am about 3/5ths through the movie and I am seriously contemplating not watching the rest, which for me is unheard of.I don't't usually bother writing reviews, but right now I am so disappointed that I have to vent my frustration somehow.The only similarity between the first four movies and this one, is the fact that the main character's name is John McClane, and is played by Bruce. If you removed either one of those two things, you would have a hard time guessing that this was the latest installment in the Die Hard franchise, or even a Hollywood production. It has the feel of a french/German/Russian/polish co-production that spent one half of their budget on Bruce, and the other half on cgi.What the movie is missing:1. John McClane - The main character in this one has the same name, but he is now just a stupid American abroad that decides it would be cool to kill people because he has nothing better to do. He doesn't hesitate to kill, he has no qualms about it, he doesn't try to protect innocent bystanders (in fact it seems that he himself is the reason for a lot of collateral damage), and he is not funny. At all. Bruce, you should be ashamed of yourself for taking part in this forced sexual assault on a beloved character.2. A good Bad Guy. I'm guessing that the script was so bad that they could not get a decent actor to take the part.3. A plot. 4. A script. Obviously they must have had a script since none of the actors seem capable of ad-libbing anything. My point is that they had the wrong script. One could almost be led to believe that they just bought the script to a second-rate action-movie and renamed one of the main characters John McClane.5. A decent director. Not only is the script itself terrible, it is made even worse by the directing. Which probably wasn't easy.I am now living in fear of the possibility of a sixth Die Hard movie, while at the same time hoping that the John McClane story can get a better ending.",A Good Day to Die Hard

498,boris_novikov,Die Hard V: Review from Russia,6,18 February 2013,"From that very moment when John Moore was appointed to steer the fifth Die Hard — the John Moore who wasn't able to make things cool with the adaptation of Max Payne — everybody started to think (and say out loud that) it is going to suck on every level there is, especially after the plot was unveiled and people had been told that John McClane was going to go to Mother Russia to crush, kill and destroy every bad guy just to save his son Jack's ass. And to judge by reviews, everybody had decided that A Good Day To Die Hard would suck anyway long before the movie was finished.But I have to say that the flick is not that bad, and even the main theme (the reason for everything is money) is still there, just like old times. Although I can't say that I liked it very much. Those are right who say that even in comparison with Die Hard 4.0 the result of Moore's work looks like an opened puzzle box, but the puzzle isn't finished.On the one hand we've got Skip Woods who remembers that in the last film John McClane was quiet as a grave most of the time and nobody liked that, everybody wanted that very McClane from the first three movies. So Woods wrote the script where our old friend John went senile and started to crack jokes and say things, but there was a slight problem. He joked, but it was not very funny and, which is much worse, he had been choosing the wrong time for it. He laughed, joked and made that thing with his eyes when he should've kicked asses, shoot from guns and smoke cigarettes. But on some level this works: old hero is more like the good old hero from the first movie that he was in the fourth, and it seems to me that nobody cares that people may change with time. But anyway, we all thing that this is it, in a second our old Roy the Cowboy will unleash hell! But John Moore tells the cameraman: now you shoot like you'd been drinking all night long. And this is how the movie looks, and it is him, Jonathan Sela, who is considered to be responsible for the viewers' desire to rip off someone's hands. It is not that hard to watch the movie in the moments of peace, quiet and calmness, but when the action starts it is easier to go blind than to understand who is chasing, shooting and killing whom. On the other hand, Woods' screenplay is capable to set at a gaze even without the director's help. Pripyat? Okay, we've got what's everything has to do with the Chernobyl disaster, but why the goddamn hell should anyone to go there and keep there something small but important? Especially if the writer has no idea where this place is. Well, he has definitely heard that it's in Ukraine, but I guess he thinks that Ukraine is somewhere near Moscow: I find no other reason how the hell could the stolen car with tons of guns in it be there simultaneously with the gunship Mi-24?But the main problem of A Good Day To Die Hard is not in the screenwriter or the director. There is no conflict in it. There is no real confrontation. There is no real bad guy. In the first, second and third movies we had very charismatic, very flamboyant and, let's admit it, wowable antagonists. In the fourth the antagonist had a hot and spicy Maggie Q who kicked McClane's ass like it was someone like Jonah Hill, not Bruce Willis. But here we have nothing and no one. Chagarin played by Russian actor Sergei Kolesnikov is just a contour, it is not flat enough to be considered a flat character. That Dancer dude, Alik, is a jackass not a evil genius, so in the end we have Yulia Snigir who is too sweet and too hot to think of her as of a badass character, and Komarov, and I've got to be honest, this isn't a guy who is capable to do stuff that Hans Gruber, Colonel Stuart and Peter ""Simon"" Gruber did. Besides, John McClane just doesn't have enough personal reasons to go deeper in that thing that is happening around him. He saved his son in the first 15 minutes, for Pete's sake. CIA doesn't want Chagarin to become a minister of defense? Oh yeah, The Bold and Bald One is such a patriot that he just can't stay away from it. Back in the days the troubles became and obstacle for John McClane on his way to happiness just because he is a magnet for bad stuff, but since Die Hard 4.0 it happens just because it has to be John McClane. I am not sure that I'm making it clear enough, but it doesn't hold the water. At all. I remember that John Moore said once that in the first movie it was one building, in the second movie it was an airport, in the third one it was New York, in the fourth one it was America, and now it is time for the whole world to become a battlefield of John McClane and Bad Guys United. Nope, it still does not hold the water. If there is going to be a sixth installment, those guy have to make it back, like it used to be, to close the loop. And let John to solve all his issues with Holly, for the love of God, he did already make things right with everybody others of his family.",A Good Day to Die Hard

My biggest complaint about this movie is how short it is; about a half hour shorter than any other Die Hard. Bruce Willis's performance is his weakest as John McClane, but still not that bad. McClane and McClane Jr have decent chemistry. If nothing else it is very entertaining and will excite Die Hard fans with references to the previous films. The Russian theme was great, very fresh and different for the Die Hard series. The best part of the movie was Yuliya Snigir as the Russian villainess Irina.

Maybe when it comes out on DVD it'll be the extended edition ( seriously it was barely and hour and an a half long) and it'll actually have a story instead of just long drawn out action scenes, one-liners, and dialogue we can actually hear over the load background noise. I use to rank Die Harder as the worse of the franchise, guess who just moved up a step. The only thing that this movie benefited the franchise is that John's son at the end actually mentions the fact that his name is actually John McClane Jr. not Jake ( in Die Hard (1988) his kids are named Lucy and John Jr.), But not actually explain the name change in the first place.Much like when they took Oceans 12 to Europe and twisted Indiana Jones into confusing whirlwind that involved aliens, they should have just stayed in America where John McClane belongs.

This movie shamelessly redid the same thing of Die Hard whereby Gruber pretended to be a hostage plus more tired reworked scenes from the previous Die Hards. This is not to be watched by a Die Hard fan, rather by someone who doesn't LOVE movies and watches them as a by-the-way. This so called installment in a franchise that changed the action packed world has finally reached its uttermost down point. The studios have really raised the bar for themselves. I have no idea how they will manage to make a worse Die Hard. Anyway, they could always get M. Night Shyamalan. Oops, I know these have no respect for the franchise and might just do it.

I am a big proponent of the view that action movies are what they are and should not be judged by regular movie standards. That said, the disappointment I experienced after watching A Good Day to Die Hard gets worse the more I think about it. It goes without saying that in making the 5th movie of a series Bruce Willis and everyone else involved completely sold out. But I hardly expected there to be absolutely no plot and far less character development then the movies my high school video class used to make. It's safe to say that after sitting there for two hours I could tell you nothing about who the characters actually were. I had no idea what Bruce Willis actually did to cause his son to sulk around like a 6 year old girl. His son, by the way, put forth one of the worst acting performances of any human being (I'm not even including actors) that I have ever seen. I'm not even upset about the $13 dollars I paid to see it. Hey guys here's the spoiler - the entire storyline is about a billionaire who kills countless people for...(drum roll) MORE MONEY!!! Yes, the bad guy sat in prison for 5 years so that he could break into a radiation filled safe to steal uranium so that he could make more money. Freaking Commando, starring Arnold, had a complicated plot. Yes Commando. Heck, I'd argue that Predator 2, Starship Troopers 1-75, and that Jack & Jill movie, which I've never seen, had better plots.

Moments that explore the relationship between John McClane and his son are hard to relate to in the way that is expected.The action scenes are still worthy of any Die Hard film and are pulled off very well by Willis.

506,cbattric,"Never trust a Russian, apparently.",5,19 February 2013,"People love to throw around ""this is the worst movie ever"" reviews a lot. Every movie has one. A Good Day to Die Hard is not by any means impossible to watch, and while I do not recommend you see it in IMAX like I did, it is a solid, fun action flick. Let's face it, anyone who is a massive fan of the Die Hard series like me is going to see this movie for the nostalgia. Times have (unfortunately) changed a lot since the 80's and 90's and McClane has had a hard time coping, like we saw in Live Free or Die Hard. This movie did a better job of this by limiting all of the 21st century rhetoric that just took essence from the character, but also sacrificed a real connection with John this time around. Regardless of this, John has always kicked ass. This movie is no exception. In IMAX i felt like every bullet was slamming into my chest and the explosions were earth shattering. The visuals were great and the bad guys were taken out in every way you expect.One crucial flaw I noticed was the lack of connection between the two McClanes. This was probably intentional, but it still seemed like something was missing and it took entirely too long to actually recognize Jack as John's son. In other words, you are shown Jack, told he is John's son and expected to accept it as being obvious, but it doesn't click easily. Any emotion between them is a comedic moment and brushed off until the final moments of the roller coaster. Between this, a pretty predictable story, bad guy(s) from another country that America has had tension with, and the now cliché stab at Bruce Willis' age every once and a while, this a bad Die Hard film. But as an action movie, it is easily passable. Go see it if you're an action junkie, go see it if you're a Bruce Willis or Die Hard fan. Just don't expect gold (or silver for that matter) if you go for the latter.",A Good Day to Die Hard

I did have an idea of how this movie would play out. Die Hard 4.0 was alright, but it seemed to have more emphasis on action and crazy stunts. Well that is what I thought before watching ""A good way to die hard"". This movie was disappointing. There didn't seem to be any structure, it was just action scene, a drawn out car chase, action scene, 2 minutes of dialogue, action scene, another action scene, 3 minutes of dialogue, little twist at the end, action scene and then the end. That is how I view it in my mind. I don't know much about why Jack joined the CIA, I don't know why exactly John Maclane went to Moscow to see his son (after finding out news about him killing somebody) only to complain about he suppose to be having a vacation. There was no recognizable characters about from John. I will give a Jai who played Jack (John's son), who did play the role of a ""like father like son"" really really, not to mention he is a fellow Australian who also lived in Sydney like myself.

510,rpcorbitt,A Good Day to Watch Another Movie,2,24 March 2013,"http://aussiefilmnerd.com/Directed by: John MooreStarring: Bruce Willis, Jai Courtney and Sebastian KochBarely written by: Skip WoodsIs it Rambo? Rocky? Terminator? Lethal Weapon? For my money, the greatest action movie franchise was always Die Hard. Until now. Rocky, Rambo, Terminator, and now Die Hard, all made the same mistake. They got greedy. By default, that puts Lethal Weapon to number 1. It's number 1 because it bowed out at an appropriate time with arguably it's strongest entry into the franchise. Die Hard had that option with the powerful and funny Die Hard 4. But no, they had to make this. Did it have testosterone? Sure, more than China's female swim-team. Did it have Bruce Willis in some form of blood covered white garment. You bet it did! Was it a giant advertisement for Mercedes that will spell an untimely death for the franchise? 100% yes! Well, at least it made me hope this will be the last.I would love to give an in-depth insight into the plot and characterisation for you, but the filmmakers left all that aside to afford more things that go boom. Essentially we have John McClane going to Russia to find his son, Jack. Once reunited, this team of bald badasses attempt (as if he would fail!) to prevent the theft of nuclear weapons. Seriously, I would love to expand, but that is it, as fleshed out as it can be.The screenplay was delivered to us from the writer of other pointless films such as ""The A- Team"", ""X-Men Origins – Wolverine"" and ""Hitman"". Honestly, with a CV that reads like that, I'm actually less surprised that it was this bad. The first entry into the series is actually used in guides on how to write a perfect screenplay. How far we have fallen.I do have a few nagging questions though;1) How can you fire a helicopter gunship at a large building in the metro area in Russia and not spark some attention? Not a peep was heard from any cops, security guards, concerned citizens or even members of the military. Russia has the 5th largest military in the world and one helicopter is allowed to run riot. Hrmmm2) Why blow your budget on a car chase so early in the piece. We don't know what is going on yet, nor do we know, or care about any of the characters in the chase. Leave chase scenes for thrilling conclusions, not confusing semi-intros.Anyway, I shouldn't delve too deeply for fear of getting even more depressed than I am already. I will say one more important thing though. For me, action films have, like all films, always been about the characters. The Die Hard series has given us the perfect anti-hero fighting off some of the most impressive and diverse bad-guys ever to hit the screen. This latest addition gives us an empty shell of McClane, fighting a bunch of nobodies.""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is laughable as an action film in its own right, but utterly insulting as an entry into this franchise.

""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a disappointment; the beginning of the films doesn't immediacy of the first three and is more like a Bourne, Mission Impossible or Daniel Craig Bond movie. Willis' John McLane has been more toned than the fourth one and when he does show signs of the old McLane it seems very forced like these days when I say or do something funny. Some of the stunts were pretty lame like the helicopter scene at the end, which was also ruined by the addition of CGI in slow motion. Also, the fact that the f****r part of Yippie Ki-A Motherf****r was cut out in the U.K Version deserves added scorn. I do think Jai Courtney however was good as Jack McLane and the villains weren't too bad, but they're hardly a Hans Gruber, his brother Simon Gruber or even a Col. Stuart.

Where CGI was used, it was to the highest level, very polished and of high quality. First 20 minutes of the film you get a true sense of crunch and impact as cars and that amazing APC smash together. Scenes with civilians in cars being affected by the APC are epic.Score and Sound Fx people did a great job also, the chase scenes had great heart pumping scores, with realistic feeling sound effects from the Sprinter, APC and general tire/rubber slipping. Normalisation was spot on, with no one sound drowning out the others (which i personalty feel happens a lot in action films)..The BadContinuity is a joke, I'm assuming the final edit people messed this up for everyone. Entire chase segments have a total lack of continuity and breaks the effect of realism previously achieved by amazing camera/stunts/CGI work. ( body damage appears without incident , then disappears again, then an impact on the perfect body work explains the scene from 2 minutes ago, then some how the body work is repaired again.)

They were all out, full blooded, no-holds-barred action festivals. I don't see where this one goes too wrong when fitting this mold; it's got good guys, bad guys, gun fights, car chases and explosions. When you add this to the idea of John McClane finding his 'delinquent' son in Moscow, who turns out to be in the CIA and teaming up with him, that for me makes a damn good Die Hard movie.

Its painful sitting through the poor quips and overall bad script. It like they forced the franchise before Bruce Willis ages even more.I would rather have sat through Barney.Cherry on the top: When they fighting bad guys in Chernobyl ....they fall in water sputter about with no concern with the radioactivity of the water...only to dismiss it as rain water.....ha ha ha haSigh...""It's a good day"" to avoid this movie",A Good Day to Die Hard
521,PetitRamen,The worst Die Hard I have ever seen,3,26 February 2013,"The trailer gave us hope but finally, this is the worst Die Hard they produced for several reasons : - The script is inexistent : OK this is not the most important part for a Die Hard movie but at least you wait for something fun and attractive. On this movie, you will be shocked by a boring story. The movie lasts 1 hour but I had the impression it was really long (I watched my clock after 45 min).The bad guy : first you have all Russian cliché you can imagine (really cheap). And in addition, the main enemy is really, really stupid and not charismatic.The lack of humour : where is John McLane humour ? Except one sentence he repeats several time during the movie, the good humour with jokes we know were gone... Aoutch.The duo son + father : it is not a bad idea but finally, they are doing the same thing and they lose both their charisma. Except the first 15 minutes, it's boring.Again, I recommend not seeing this movie, even if you can have a free ticket. I really hope producer will read reviews on IMDb because Die Hard 6 has been announced. I hope they are not going to do the same mistake (keep in mind that Die Hard 4 was really really good compared to this one).",A Good Day to Die Hard
522,matthewsoanes,"You want action, you get it!",9,12 March 2013,"The critics have got it all wrong!!! I was surprised to see such poor reviews for a die hard film, since the first 4 were all excellent. Though this is not the same, this is basically another expendables film but with an incredibly wild car chase that takes action films to the next level. Your aren't gonna see much more creative, over the top and ambitious action stunts like in this film. And yet this is what action films need to have if people want to remember them. You need an over the top stunt to make sure people won't forget the film, taken 2 for instance was a film that lacked that crazy ambition, it's car chase was dry with no exciting the stunts that made me go WOW. Die hard 5 however has this WOW factor, and reiterates this factor several times in this film with loads of stunts that shocked and surprised me. If it helps, i am a massive fan of the fast and furious and the expendables films, and if you like both of them then go and see this film. Forget about well worked scripts, story lines and plot, who needs one when the film has such awesome action, Enjoy.",A Good Day to Die Hard
523,archblood-476-976750,Not Much The Good Day To Live For,5,8 February 2013,"In a Good Day To Die, the iconic trigger-happy detective, John McClane (Bruce Willis), wonders wearily about being in in the wrong places at the wrong time. Although he seemed unaware of the answer, I think the most obvious has to do with the refusal of Hollywood executives to retire our battle-scarred hero, thus dragging him through yet another gun-blazing extravaganza which promises millions in box office takings.Either that, or McClane is simply hard to die. Life for him must indeed be a series of violent chronicles in urban war zones.So back for the fifth installment in the Die Hard films, McClane is, this time, taken out of the US and flown into the heart of Russia, of all places. You know the trope concerning this type of situation; when the American meets the Russian, the former is the hero and the latter as the East European madman who's usually very well-armed to the teeth.The story concerns about the arrest of John's estranged son, John ""Jack"" McClane Jr (Jai Courtney), whom, unbeknown to McClane Senior, is a CIA operative entangled in an assassination plot, further complicated with a political conspiracy involving nuclear arms and some devious Russians. John tries to reconnect with Jack in a frantic marathon of firefights and explosions, the outcome, predictably, leaves more than a dozen body bags in its wake.However, the chemistry between Willis and Courtney is as good as the short-lived magnificence of bright orange fireballs, a point of redundancy for the the father-son relationship in AGDTD .Both are hot-headed in their own ways but after a fierce exchange of sarcasm and scorn, there's nothing much about the relationship which remains engaging. The poignancy is largely absent even with John's occasional (and sometimes unnecessary) heart-to-heart talk with his son, though the pair does work out some laughs through the usual McClane wisecracking. It wasn't like the interesting partnerships fans had seen in previous Die Hards, notably, between Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's Zeus Carver in Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995), and even between Willis and Justin Long's hacker kid character in Live Free Or Die Hard (2007).What father and son does bring into the film is widespread destruction in a megaton load and you get what you want for your typical dose of gun porn. The initial action sequences reverberate with raw energy and high-octane kinetics, particularly a rip-roaring car-chase scene which makes all the car-chase scenes in the Jason Bourne movies look like ballroom dancing. But the best actions are already completed in the first act of AGDTD. The rest are what you expected from a typical gun porn; bullet dodging, ammunition popping and yeah..... explosions, even with director John Moore's gratuitous efforts to amp up various level and degree of damage.If the actions had gotten kind of routine and dry towards the finale, the story development did not help much. Yes, Die Hard movies had always thrived on formulaic plots, yet, there at least exist a distinct semblance between all the films. Not this one. In a critical perceptive, it could be seen as a trash 90's action flick being polished up with the today's CGI technology. The only brief respite AGDTD has from mediocrity is a surprising plot twist which leaves a rather benign impression on the overall story.Characters, on the villainy side, are at best forgettable. Yuliya Snigir suits up as the sexy Irina, the series' third femme fatale, and Radivoje Bukvic as the cocky henchman of a corrupted Russian official. Sebastian Koch plays Komarov, a political prisoner, that Team McClane must protect as he holds the key to a mysterious file.A Good Day To Die is clearly the least exciting film in the Die Hard franchise and has brought nothing refreshing to the series, other than the actual introduction of McClane Junior. Barely enough a decent action flick, the movie is woefully dependent on the appearance of Bruce Willis, for whom the role of John McClane is sacredly his alone, and the 57-years old has always played it well, since the first film. Jai Courtney did reasonably fine for Jack McClane, though it still lacks a memorable impact.John Moore should know better. The Irish director belongs to that undying lineage of action filmmakers whose abiding faith in pyrotechnics remains as unquestionable as their arrant neglect for story and character development. It says a lot about the kind of films they will continue to take charge, though that may not always mean bad news for the action genre.",A Good Day to Die Hard

I don't quite understand why people hate this movie. It's a sequel: of course it's not going to be as good as the original. People should really give this film a chance.

525,jammersmashedface,Apparently NOT a good day to Die Hard,3,14 February 2013,"I have been a fan of ""Die Hard"" since I was a child, and its sequel (""Die Harder"") was one of the first movies I remember seeing at the theater, so needless to say I have been lined up on opening day for each sequel that followed. That tradition, should they continue to expand the franchise, ended tonight with ""A Good Day to Die Hard.""It's not that McClane/Willis has become old - hell, we know he has and he's not alone. But to best illustrate that the character has gotten on in years, they've decided to make our beloved John McClane clingy, needy, and most-unforgivably... bitchy, for the entire length of the film. He is pushed to the back of almost every action scene, and other than a thoughtless punch to a non-plot-necessary aggressor, he barely bothers to fight, preferring to use ridiculously impressive fire power far, far, far from the scuffle. Even during the more elaborate action sequences, McClane struggles to keep up, even going so far as to force himself into the situation. I would like to say that Willis phoned it in, but his intensity in some later scenes suggest otherwise - no, this is just the direction they decided to push this iconic antihero, with a prominent son character that is both deplorable and despicable, and with McClane acting less like a hero and more like a clueless and anxiety- ridden soccer mom, you very quickly find yourself cheering the Russian bad guys in the hopes that two incredibly lucky shots will end this charade once and for all. And to add insult to a lot of other insults, our always-anticipated catch phrase is sputtered out and sandwiched between such crap dialogue that you can't even force yourself to be elated at hearing those words for the first time in years. It was the perfect icing on a very disappointing cake.The movie itself was shot horribly, with repeated use of what I like to call ""I found Waldo"" cuts (far away, sudden dramatic zoom), some of which repeat over... and over... and over again, scene by scene by scene. The editing was poor, the special effects seemed impossibly over- the-top to be believable, even the audio engineers butchered this by making tiny love tap punches sound like someone whacked a wet trash bag full of watermelons with a metal bat. EVEN THE OPENING CREDITS SEEMED AWKWARD!I give it three stars because I still love Bruce Willis, and as I told my wife on the way out of the theater tonight, even a bad ""Die Hard"" is still better than your average movie. But if you care about the series, if you really enjoy the character, don't watch this film. Just pretend like it never happened, and when you buy the Complete Boxset this Christmas, toss the fifth disc in the trash can and replace it with ""Hudson Hawk,"" which would have made a better sequel than this film has.",A Good Day to Die Hard
526,mikrosha-567-847411,Makes Die Hard 4 look like a masterpiece; seriously.,2,20 February 2013,"To start off, I am a huge fan of the Die Hard movies. I saw Bruce jump of the Nakatomi Plaza building when I was five years old, and watched it over and over again from that moment on. Die Hard 3 was also incredible, in some cases even better then the 1st, and the 2nd was no masterpiece, but fun to watch.Until last night, I thought the 4th movie was only so so, but now, I completely changed my mind. A Good Day to Die Hard was such a terrible movie, that is makes the CGI-filled and action overdone Live Free of Die Hard look amazing!The director did every single thing wrong: the humor was not funny and definitely was not as theme-driven as the first three movies. None of it was smart, it was all forced. The action was overdone and just was too much for what should have been another day for the unluckiest man in the world, John, who just ends up being at the wrong place in the wrong time. You thought he was a super hero on the 4th movie? Well, this movie flips him inside a moving truck, multiple trucks, off multiple bridges, hanging of multiple high things (like a helicopter), getting shot at Call of Duty style and not getting hurt, and finally, coming out of all of it without a scratch. It seems as though the writers of the movie wrote the action scenes first, or the action ideas; like: ""we need to have him destroy a car he is driving three times, have him hang off a tall thing two times, kill 16 people, cause 8 explosions, etc"". And only THEN they sat down to write a story to match this overdone insanity. A regular guy with normal human fears and emotions is now a demolition-loving maniac who does not care for his own life (nor does he really worry about his son who is constantly almost dying). The fact that the bad guys in the movie ware not at all interesting and their motives were lame would have been fine if only John was done correctly, but the only part of the movie I even slightly liked was the acting of John's son; other then that, 2/10 stars from me.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Need to concentrate on the reason we love John..his wit..his ""sassy"" personality...his interaction with the other characters in the movie..For example..not a spoiler but one of the first scenes is his interaction with a taxi driver..that character and John really got along and bantered..he should have re-entered the movie somewhere towards the end..I am sure that there will be another Die Hard because the franchise is a good one..still marketable.

I've pretty much liked them all--even the fourth one, which generally garners mixed reviews.But this movie. Wow. If I didn't attend the theater with other people, I would have left early. Echoing what many said, there's no character development, the action sequences are so outrageous and over-the-top that I actually found myself laughing. The only thing that stopped my laughing was the nausea and migraine that the sound and film editing caused. Even on the rare shot with calm dialogue between two characters, the camera wouldn't stay still. It created a constant feeling of stress, which was compounded by the score. Basically, the movie goes from 0 to 60 in 10 minutes and doesn't slow down until the end.Even sitting here now, I couldn't tell you one thing about the plot or the characters. Hell, I don't even remember the bad guys name. In fact, who was the bad guy? That's how bad the development of the plot was. Even the twist was lame and boring. I generally try not to say this less than 24 hours after seeing a movie since emotions are generally yanked to the extreme on either end, but I can quite confidently state that this movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.

I found the film to be a bit predictable in parts and a bit boring at times but all in all it wasn't a bad film nor was it in league with the others. The plot of the film is very light and not very good to say the least, in fact you could almost say there was no plot.It's not a film id have on d v d as I feel it's a onetime only watch and I'm glad I didn't pay for my entry to the cinemas as I feel I would of been very regretful after viewing the film.

531,dr-noleg,Not as Epic,6,7 February 2013,"A Good Day to Die Hard surely doesn't live up to expectations. I certainly do not mean it is not to watch for all Die Hard fans such as myself, but after watching it you'll feel like the movie will be soon forgotten unlike its previous opuses Die Hard, Die Harder and Die Hard with a Vengeance. I had no clue who John Moore was until I looked him up and found out he was behind Max Payne and Behind Enemy Lines, which after a quick thought are also not particularly memorable. Anyway, without spoiling much of the action, the whole movie stands on three action scenes: car chase, gun fight, and finale. Unfortunately you might witness major failures in each of them as I did. The car chase suffers from its choice in camera shots, it is a fun one but I felt like i missed on a lot due to unnecessary close-ups on characters and weird camera angles. Now that I am writing it I feel the middle action scene I just called ""gunfight"" is the least messed-up but that might be because the two other really left me with a bitter aftertaste of ""come on McClane can kick ass much better than what is given here""... As for the Finale, well I'll let the fans see for themselves but as mentioned in the title not as epic and intense as what you ought to expect from a good old Die Hard, even Live Free did better but that's just me... Other than that, I gotta say the new kid is alright to me, fits the ""McClane family picture"" and lastly, screw Singapore BFC for freaking censoring each and every F words in the movie which just made one of my favorite heroes end up saying ""Yippie Kay Yay Mother ------""!!!

The plot renders all comments unnecessary and the acting is appalling. At first I thought I was watching a comedy or a travesty of the previous Die Hard movies but I soon realized that this was actually supposed to be the next big action movie. Hollywood has created one of the most ridiculous and nonsensical action movies ever. In point of fact, it should be nominated in the category of the worst movies of all time. The actions scenes throughout the movie are so preposterous and egregious that they actually become very embarrassing and unbearable to watch. For example, suffice it to say that Willis and his son go to Chernobyl in order to save the world from Russian terrorists and they do not even have protective suits on them in spite of the high levels of radiation. This is just one of the grossly pathetic examples of absurdity and the omnipresent American patriotism, which is not only sickening but also extremely tiresome. I for one am really tired of the Hollywood's constant portrayal of the Americans as saviors. It is about time that Hollywood starts refraining from making prejudiced, biased and jingoist movies.

Also, did anyone mention to Bruce Willis that acting is a central point to being in a film. He spends the entirety of this moaning ""I'm on Vacation"" - err, hang on a second. You've just flown to Russia to find your son, who - by the way - has been locked up in jail.So that's vacation, eh? I think it's a given when watching Die Hard that you leave your brain at the door. But in place of realism and, sometimes, acting you're always given a few genuinely funny lines. A Good Day to Die Hard doesn't even deliver an occasional gag.Over the years I've really enjoyed the Die Hard franchise. While 4.0 didn't seem to fit in with the original three films, it was a decent enough film in it's own right.A Good Day to Die Hard adds nothing at all to the franchise, save yourself the time/money/headache and see something else instead.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Just odd how Jesus Christ's name are repeatedly used but other religions remain untouched in movies these day. I think we have a large vocabulary to choose from. The movie was not that bad, but yes not as good as the previous Die Hard's. I'm also a huge fan of the first three movies, but this movie was a bit too 007 for me.

The plot is weak story-line weak and its a very short movie which is rushed from start to finish. They are glimpses of good action but even that cant save it. I only hope for Bruce Willis sake this isn't the last one as it would be a shame to end it on such a bad note. Also i found the characters were all a miss mash of poor dialogue and some characters have very little impact on the movie. Bruce himself said on a certain show that he was a little miffed at the title of the film and he just quite didn't get it. Maybe in an indirect way he was saying he thought the movie was bad.

If you want to say it wasn't the best Die hard of the series thats fine, but to say its the worst movie ever or the worst in the series......Wrong. Die Hard WAV is the worst in the series even though it was directed by John McTeirnan. I mean Die Hard 3 had the worst plot and was pretty much the same plot as Die hard one where they were trying to steal money from a building. The villain sucked(Really Jeremy Irons!) Die Hard 5 was even better than 4.0. Die Hard 5 was done fairly well, We needed to see john's son to complete the series because they did one with his daughter. If they hadn't brought in Lucy Mclane I would have said no. I don't mind seeing John as the side kick because it create a role for the son to take the reigns from his dad as the New John Mclane( as he is John Mclane Jr). Action was awesome Tons of cursing like the original, and some humor. Only complaint I have is that the Twists weren't need in the movie and the bad guy wasn't that great.

And Explosions Let me get this review started by saying i LOVE the die hard series i was so pumped to hear about this movie because i THOUGHT they were going back to there roots , their rated r gritty classic mclane , although i though live free or die hard was a decent sequel lets face it, John Mclane looked immortal in live free and like a super hero . i was so pumped for this movie i even went to a five movie Die Hard Marathon and it was one of the best theater experiences i ever been to , seeing all the classic die hard movies in one room with the Die hard fans UNTIL ""A Good Day Die Hard"" came on . Good: Visuals? I Guess Listen , are the action scenes dull and no way are ""Die Hard"" Caliber scenes ? Yes , but they look great but at the same time you can tell they spent all the budget on these ""Action scenes "" and forgot about everything else . Bad: Dialogue : Completely ruined the ""yippe Ki yay "" line , i don't even remember it i just know it was towards the end and didn't even make sense . To Many im a""Old"" cop jokes , stupid daddy issue comments from Jai Courtney .John Mclane lost his hair and Apparently his Personality:Im sorry guys John Mclane is dead , to me it was just bruce willis acting like bruce willis and its not his fault it was the writing . John Mclane is a funny guy and never loses his humor or charm even in the baddest situations. but in AGDTDH his jokes are so flat ,you feel so bad for Bruce willis, because his lines are just TERRIBLE . Plot : Honestly Don't know what happened in this movie . Explosions , Shitty Lines , daddy issues , Russia , Villain Switch . That pretty much sums it up. Villain (s) : During this movie you THINK you know who the villain(some douche that eats carrots ) is but a hour into the movie they make a villain switch . and both those idiots are the weakest villains not only in Die hard but maybe in recent memory. Mclane Super Hero Effect : NOT A FUGGIN SCRATCH! ""A Good Day to Die hard "" is a slap to the face to die hard fans. 3.5 /10 A MASTERPIECE OF SH%$",A Good Day to Die Hard
546,sir_burn,This isn't Die Hard,4,12 March 2013,"There are plenty of long and witty reviews to this movie. I'll try to sum my opinion up quickly:This movie has no relation whatsoever to previous Die Hard movies other than the title and the main character name.* John McClane has finally become Wolverine. * Bruce Willis seems to be playing himself and not McClane. * His one-liners aren't funny anymore. * The bad guy has as much charisma as a table. * The bad guy never carries out any evil action. * The son is as likable as a table. (I see a recurring issue here, maybe the producers should have contacted IKEA in order to have more interesting stuff on screen). * The plot is ridiculous to the point of making you laugh.Should you watch it? The chase through Moscow is worth the ticket price, but forget the title and just enjoy an average action movie.",A Good Day to Die Hard

The action sequences are good (a few seconds of which could even be ""great""). All the latest gizmos, weapons, luxury cars, etc. But what did you expect? Wrecks? Well you will get some of those too.The filming locations were good too: an instant switch from the modern Russian capital back to an old city in Ukraine - great stuff.So - summarized - this Die Hard movie is far from being a Die Hard movie, but still worth a try if you like action movies, especially with a Russian/Ukrainian zest.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Every other scene features a Merc getting bashed in, Obviously sponsored by Mercedes! G wagons, Sprinters and a Unimog to mention a few. I know the Die Hard films are far fetched, but like you'd find a brand new Unimog being driven around Moscow. Do you know how much those things cost! Also the latest G wagon! They've gotta be at least $100k. And as if the guy driving it wouldn't be a mafia boss with bodyguards and guns! It even features a Maybach!

550,troberts134,Definitely a DUD,2,8 June 2013,I rented the movie on pay per view this movie was one of his worst action movies I think. It was late on getting started on action unlike the other movies he made. I think all the action in the last one made him have a head injury cause this one is no where near his others. The way the action went of the last installment before this one was very extreme. It left you thinking that this movie would have far more action and pick up like the other one did. The writer who wrote the script definitely has to rethink the action before the next movie comes out. I mean come on the ones who watch it just for his action are going to be falling asleep in the first ten mins because there isn't any action. What were they thinking? I'm a die hard fan but I can't even keep focus on this movie not enough action took forever to even get one car blow up. If you plan on renting this movie I would advise against it find a friend who has bought it and borrow before you spend the money to rent or buy this movie.,A Good Day to Die Hard

Please wake up and smell the coffee producers of Die Hard! I really liked the first three Die Hard movies, great script, simple, great one liners and very sharp humor. De co-cast has to like Samuel L. Jackson (With a vengeance) and then the roof will be on fire! Why not Bruce Willes in Die Hard with a real villain like Jeremy Irons was. He was perfect for the role.

Hollywood has in fact gone completely crazy... they don't seem to have any shame for producing something like that! Of course, why would they have any ... as long as ""the movie"" makes the profit.Its Russian consulting team deserves to be castrated. In the course of this ""movie"", a bunch of Russian criminals and corrupt government officials prefer to speak English among each other. But even if they bother speaking their native tongue, they do it with a humongous anglo- accent. Suuure, why hiring better fitting actors or at least dubbing their replica with accent free voices. The car chase in Moscow downtown seems like being some kind of rally. No police presence except for one poor traffic police crew at the end. Multiple civilian casualties caused by the ""hero McClane Senior""'s driving are simply welcomed in the city for which (of course) he's released back to his homeland as a hero at the end of the movie. Next the two heroes steal a ""Chechen mafia"" car. And guess what ?.. Of course its trunk is another ""Fort Knox"" loaded with heavy arms. Don't you find it's a bit Cliché and simply RACISM ?.. Then they take this fancy stolen car and make a ""quick trip"" to the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster - Chrnobyl. Well, good luck with driving ~1000 km without being stopped by traffic police. I'm sure they simply welcomed the two American heroes (one of them is a CIA spy, by the way) in the stolen vehicle. The last but not lease - US military DRONE (!!!) in the Russian air. Of course, we're just a colony, right ?..People deserve better !",A Good Day to Die Hard
553,yaroslavburdin,"John McClane, what you've become?!",2,26 November 2013,"A little background about how much I love this franchise: in 1966 Roderick Thorp writes the book The Detective, in 1979 Thorp writes his second book of the series Nothing Lasts Forever. This book was used to create scenario for the Commando sequel. Because Arni turned down the role, Bruce Willis, unknown artist for the ""big movie"" for those days, took the role in adopted scenario. And I can tell you without a dose of irony, the film turned out amazing. The main character of the movie was not a superhero, as the usual action movies would show him. Not the guy who can kill tons of people in few minutes, no. He is a simple guy, tired and dirty, wounded and sweaty, who tries to survive and defeat the superior enemy, using all his strength. That is why the movie called Die Hard. This movie as a number one of representatives of the best action movies in the history, McClane as the number one of representatives of the best characters in the action movies. By itself franchise is not soiled by ideology like Rambo or similar movies, and it is nice. In theory the fifth movie must be about McLane, in theory the characters of the movie must know the meaning of the word motivation. In theory. In theory the fifth movie is the most ugly, stupid and incompetent action movies in the entire history of cinema.Movie begins with newscast, which says that things in Russia are getting worse— mass protests across the country, and it happens because of the trial of the billionaire. Are you serious?! In this way Khodorkovsky would love to take part in this film. You will ask what McClane forgot in this movie? It turns out that McClane's son kills random guy in the Russian club. His son negotiates with EVIL KGB, and gets free. Jesus, how stupid it is... Knowing nothing about this, McClane goes to Russia. Benefit in Moscow where not all taxi drivers speak Russian, McClane finds an English-speaking driver, who helps him in finding the court with Chagarin. Later, the court blows up, but luckily to our friends, Jack and Komarov, feeling no blast, use the truck to escape. Looks like the getaway turned out good and everything is well, right? F*ck no! McClane stops the truck and Komarov GETS, so the Russian police notice him, and the chase begins. Cars teleports from one location into another, going from street Evropeyskaya, to Kremlevskaya, than Budapest!! (To find out the precise location is impossible, because the operator with an editor struck Parkinson's disease—everything trembles and zooms). McClane catches up bad guys, simultaneously killing drivers on the road. John McClane, what you've becomeLater we found out that Komarov has a daughter and he doesn't want to leave without her, though our heroes go to hotel Ukraine with guns overweight—it's Russia. Than CRAZY action begins—we have a helicopter, which flew in the center of the Moscow under order of the unassigned, unassigned, unassigned defense Minister and begin blowing up the hotel. Against military helicopter, Russia pulls all its main forces!!—TWO cop cars without drivers. FACEPALM. I will not talk about the second part of the movie because it's even worse, and who knows, maybe there are some kamikaze that want to watch it and I don't want to spoiler the plot. Wait, there is no plotAnyway, fifth movie killed franchise, which until then held in order. This movie is stupid in everything—dialogues, characters, etc. We don't see McClane in this movie—there is Bruce Willis and some other guy. John Moore worthless once again proved his nickname. Don't watch this movie.",A Good Day to Die Hard
554,fusechick,"As a Die Hard fan, I am very disappointed.",3,16 February 2013,"I was very excited to see this movie, as a long-time Die Hard fan, and I came back very disappointed. What bothered me the most was the TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE script. It is nothing like the scripts in the other movies... this time it is cliché and boring. And no funny one-liners. I guess the director wanted to make this movie very straight forward and cut to the chase right away, which isn't always bad. But there was no good explanation of the plot; things just started happening and over-the-top action scenes without really knowing why... McClane does not come off very likable to begin with too. I feel like this movie only brushed the surface in terms of showing his personality, which is usually what makes the other Die Hard movies so memorable. And it was only 1 hour and 37 min. I feel like it could of used more time to show some character development, especially for the villain because that was non-existent. This movie overall seemed liked a rushed project. As if they just threw Bruce Willis in this over- the-top, not-thought-out action movie and slapped Die Hard 5 as the title. And whoever wrote the script was extremely lazy.

556,kevdennison,How to Tell When Your Action Movie Career Ended Decades Ago 101,2,17 February 2014,"A Good Day to Die Hard showed me two very big things:1. The importance of a worthwhile supporting cast.2. Bruce Willis just doesn't care anymore. He's in it for the money.Say what you will about Life Free or Die Hard, but Justin Long was a GREAT sidekick and Timothy Olyphant was a delightful villain. In fact, the more I think about that film the more glaring the overall problem becomes. Bruce Willis is bored. I mean, look at him! For the entire run time of this film he barely put any effort into McClane whatsoever. No matter how much people may try to play off his disinterest, melancholy and detachment as ""McClane"", I'm not buying it. It's not McClane, it's Bruce Wills. I don't even get why he is even making movies anymore. Each and every new action flick that comes out he just looks more tired, more bored, more moody, more sluggish and more lazy than the one before. A Good Day to Die Hard is the epitome of it all.Now, with Live Free or Die Hard we had Justine Long and Timothy Olyphant to at least somewhat mask this whole disaster. Long was perfect as the goofy sidekick to grumpy Bruce and Olyphant was an adequately sarcastic, egomaniac that made for an entertaining adversary. But you see, that's what makes the fifth installment is so painful. Willis didn't have a Justin Long or Timothy Olyphant to cover up his sluggishness. Instead, he had the very bland, one-dimensional Jai Courtney to play his young carbon copy and an army of underdeveloped goons chasing them. By the time the REAL villain is revealed, it's just too late. We've spent the entire film seeing practically nameless bad-guy after nameless bad-guy get shot, stabbed or blown up and then suddenly the big bad comes out but there hasn't been any tension built between him and McClane. Part of what made the first four films so great was the build-up of cat and mouse, the battle of wits and the sarcastic banter leading up to the inevitable moment of McClane vs Hans Gruber (Die Hard), McClane vs Colonel Stuart (Die Hard 2), McClane vs Simon Gruber (Die Hard With a Vengeance) and McClane vs Thomas Gabriel (Live Free or Die Hard). In the fifth installment we have McClane vs hundreds of stunt actors vs quirky carrot eating guy vs brunette girl with absolutely no personality vs ineffectively surprising mastermind revealed in the last half hour. It was literally one action set piece after the other with one of the single most uninteresting ""plots"" and lackluster ""character development"" I have ever witnessed.I shudder to think how astronomically bad Live Free or Die Hard would have been without Justin Long or Timothy Olyphant to save the sinking ship. I sincerely hope they stop with these films. Bruce is done, stop forcing him to do what he clearly is doing solely for the paycheck, with little care for his fans. And don't you dare try to reboot this either. Just leave it be, give more to some other young action star out there so we can get some good action films out in circulation again.",A Good Day to Die Hard

Well this is the worst one yet for sure. It's full of clichés, mistakes and is just generally awful. Although it's called A Good Day to Die Hard it should really be called A Good Night to Die Hard because most of the action seems to take place in the dark. I was watching it on DVD and spent more time seeing myself as a reflection than I did the film.

I will admit that it steps away from the Die Hard feel a little (could just be the film texture), but the McClaine character keeps you involved. My only knock is that there should have been another action scene. It felt short on action scenes. The movie runs about an hour and a half, so it's a quick flick too. I believe the other Die Hards are longer. Perhaps the movie could have had a deeper story and more refined dialog. his is probably better than your avg Jason Stratham flick.

This film starts with one of the best opening scenes I have seen in cinema, and a solid cast makes the constantly moving story-line both fun and interesting to watch. We return in this film to the same characters we all loved in the last one, each one bringing something new to the table as they are given their own stories. And of course no-one could forget Gandalf, such a favourite character whom we lost in the last film makes his epic return just as he did in the books. Now, with the fellowship estranged and the dark powers of Mordor rapidly approaching on the people of Middle-Earth the story becomes urgent for the characters, and through this a new threat of Saruman battles against the forces of the men of the Rohirrim.

567,Dross_Rotzank,Far better than Live Free or Die Hard (NO SPOILER review),7,14 February 2013,"The movie certainly suffers from a lot of issues. That was to be expected. However, unlike Liver Free or Die Hard, A Good Day to Die Hard biggest problem wasn't it's director, it was it's script writer, Skip Woods.Despite the fact that, pretty much like the last movie, McClane is now a bald James Bond instead of an everyday man in extraordinary situations (which is truly what McClane is all about, not ""a rebel who defies authority"", like Bruce Willis thinks) the R rating does wonders for the character and it's surroundings. The atmosphere of the movie feels a hell of a lot more at home this time around than it did last time.Grit and intensity, nowhere to be seen in Die Hard 4, is finally back to some (very welcomed) extent. Action is more down to Earth. Moore is by no means a cinematic genius, but we should thank him for this. He's not anyone's first choice to direct anything in this franchise, but his style is undoubtedly more adequate for Die Hard than Wiseman's (whose take felt septic and artificial).THE BADDialogue. Cheesy at times. Stupid at others. And it's a God damn shame, because with some thoughtful corrections, the movie could have been far better. I wish they scrapped the part where Lucy calls him on the cellphone. Stupid.Terminator McClane: yes people, he's still the insufferable, indestructible, committed super hero he was in Live Free or Die Hard. Don't misunderstand me: Willis moans and even whimpers sometimes, but it feels artificial. Lacked grit. And there was a point when the character was far off of what he truly is (certain dialog should have been given to Jack instead of John, who is supposed to be very reluctant).They don't fully take advantage of the R rating. Which was unintelligent. I mean: if they intended this to be an R rated movie, why not go all the way through and put it on the same level the original trilogy is? Perhaps because they expected to make cuts in certain countries. A shame, because there are a couple of kills that are both memorable and (very) brutal. Choppy edits. Remember the clips and special featurettes? The scenes they belong to didn't get much better. That's John Moore for you guys. I like to do my homework which is why I knew this was to be expected. It even says so in his IMDb page; ""known for his choppy edits"".HOWEVER, I think they heavily cut certain parts to shorten the movie. You remember certain pictures on set of John and Jack fighting against two guys from the Russian mob? Not in the movie.THE GOODOver the top? Yes. But not as cheesy, cretinistic and ridiculous as the last movie was. Nothing in here is nearly remotely as corny as McClane surfing a jet. Or a Terminator action figure coincidentally hitting a key to detonate a bomb inside a computer, or McClane being saved by two cars conveniently running on opposite direction of a flying vehicle. Or toll boots magically serving as catapults instead of being simple constructions on flat surfaces.The villain: far better, far smarter, far more menacing than Thomas Gabriel. People are talking crap about ""OMG YOU NEVER KNOW WHO THE VILLAIN IS!"". Are they silly? There IS a clear main villain. However, they broke the Die Hard tradition in the sense that while you know who he clearly was from the start in all the previous movies, here is kind of a plot twist at the last 20 minutes. Still far better and definitely more menacing than Thomas Gabriel. And he actually tries to pull a Hans Grüber! To no success, unfortunately... (You'll understand when you see).Climatic, at least. Live Free or Die Hard villain death was pretty ""meh"", gray and boring. Here the delivery is much better. And the kill was brutal. (Both of them).The action felt more down to Earth.While the true John McClane is still nowhere to be seen (perhaps Willis doesn't have it any more) at least the ghost of him was present in this movie.THE FUNNYCole Hauser. What the hell??? CONCLUSIONSCan this be considered a worthy successor to the original trilogy? No. But at least is not as alienated to the Die Hard ""feeling"" as Live Free or Die Hard was. A Good Day to Die Hard is the half-witted brother of the original trilogy, and that dim familiarity makes it enjoyable. It's a guilty pleasure. If Die Hard 1 is Rocky, and Die Hard 2 and 3 are Rocky 2, this movie is the Rocky 4 of the franchise. (Live Free or Die Hard wasn't anything at all). And it's a bloody shame, because I feel critics are mostly tearing this apart for being the fifth part of a franchise whose most recent take we saw recently. They are being overly sarcastic dicks like they were with Die Hard 3, which is far, far better than Live Free or Die Hard. And that happened simply because the previous movies were too close.if Live Free or Die Hard was released today, it would have gotten all the bad reputation this movie is having.

568,ansonfw,Is it worth your time?,4,12 December 2018,"A good day to die hard is an extremely complicated movie filled with suspense and plot twists. The main themes we come across in this movie is family and the importance of family. The main characters of this movie are Bruce willis as John McClane, Jai Courtney as Jack McClane, Sebastian Koch as Komarov and Yuliya Snigir as Irina. As the story progresses we see the relationship between John McClane and Jack McClane develop. After watching the movie I noticed there were many plot holes and questions I still felt like were unanswered, now this mix with some terrible jokes and difficult to understand mumbled lines made me feel extremely disappointed but on the other hand if you are someone who enjoys lots of action and large explosions in the classic Hollywood fashion you are sure to enjoy this. In this movie they also used slow motion in a way that created suspense and left me sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what will happen next as well they also had a good use of zoomed out shots to establish things and help us understand better what is happening in the scene and where we are. All in all I would advise this to anyone who likes action movies and does not care a whole lot about the plot but for anyone looking for a clear story that is interesting and is not filled with unanswered questions I would not advise it to you.",A Good Day to Die Hard
