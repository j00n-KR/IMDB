0,TheLittleSongbird,Didn't like it,3,14 July 2011,"I am not a fan of the show, though I don't detest it. I didn't like this film very much at all, as much as I wanted to. I did like the production values and soundtrack, and the stars are decent enough and have good chemistry.Against all this, the writing for this movie was pretty poor, unfunny and sappy in alternative to funny and poignant. And the story is predictable with forced messages, and the characters are clichéd and shallow.Overall, while I am not a fan of the show, I do think it is better than this movie and its sequel, neither of which I liked. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Sex and the City
1,SnoopyStyle,mostly for the fans,6,7 February 2015,"Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) is still unmarried to Mr. Big (Chris Noth). After 3 books and 3 years, they are searching for the perfect apartment. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is happily married to Harry Goldenblatt (Evan Handler) with an adopted Chinese girl. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has settled in Brooklyn with Steve (David Eigenberg) and their son Brady. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is in L.A. with Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis) who is now a superstar. The gang reunites often to spend time together. Carrie is concerned about selling her place to move in together and they agree to get married. However the wedding gets out of hand when Vogue's Enid Frick (Candice Bergen) wants to make Carrie 'The Last Single Girl'.I didn't watch the TV show and this is not aiming for me as an audience. I do like the women's chemistry and their friendship. Carrie and Mr. Big's struggles provide a bare backbone to this movie. It's still perfectly watchable for non-fans but it's probably much more compelling for true fans. The girl talk is fun... sometimes. The drama is light glossy for the most part punctuated by big reversals. For me, this is a 6 but that's just for me.",Sex and the City
2,claudio_carvalho,Love and the City,5,10 October 2008,"Mr. Big (Chris Noth) and Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) buy a magnificent penthouse in Manhattan and they decide to get married. Enid Frick (Candice Bergen) invites Carrie to take pictures for a special edition of Vogue about marriage of women of forty and something years. During the preparation, Carrie raises the guest list from seventy-five to two hundred guests, and a simple wedding dress to a fashionable Vivienne Westwood, intimidating Mr. Big in his third wedding. Meanwhile Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has no sex with Steve (David Eigenberg) and he confesses that he had had one night stand with a woman. On the eve of the wedding, in the rehearsal dinner, the upset Miranda tells Mr. Big that marriage ruins everything. On the next day, the scared Mr. Big calls off the wedding leaving Carrie in the church. Carrie feels humiliated and depressed and Samantha (Kim Cattrall), Miranda and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) decide to travel to Mexico with Carrie to the hotel where she was supposed to spend her honeymoon. When Carries returns, she hires the assistant Louise (Jennifer Hudson) to help her to organize her life. When Miranda discloses what she told to Mr. Big to Carrie in the rehearsal dinner, their friendship is shaken.The disappointing ""Sex and the City: The Movie"" is a pale shadow of the wonderful TV series. The wittiness of the shows is completely lost in a shallow and too long story full of merchandising; most of the situations are naive and silly for characters of forty and something years old; and the conclusion is corny, but I liked the celebration among friends in a simple restaurant. I found contradictory that a movie explores love while a TV show uses sex as the central theme. What Miranda could expect after six months without sex with her husband? The new color of the hair of Sarah Jessica Parker fits very well to her type and the fabulous Kim Cattrall is still a very beautiful woman in spite of crossing the age of fifty years old. Miranda and Steve together on the Brooklyn Bridge may be corny, but I found it one of the best moments of the movie. The behavior of Samantha is sexually too contained, and I indeed expected more eroticism of this character in a feature. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Sex and the City: O Filme"" (""Sex and the City: The Movie"")",Sex and the City
3,kosmasp,FtfF,7,16 August 2008,"I could also have written FTF, but I choose to the female in there for the summary line. FTFF = For the Female Fans. Of the show that is of course. As user ""Aluísio Parondi"" has stated correctly, this shouldn't be judged against the movie. This movie does only exist because of the fans demanding it to be made. And the fans seem to have spoken again, because another outing will be released 2011 (that's the current status on the follow-up/sequel).Why do I think this is strictly for the fans? Well for once you have the whole background of the characters. Yes indeed, at the beginning of the movie, you'll get an update on every character who she is, what she's been up to. But even if it's a good introduction, it almost only revolves around the (4) big players. Secondary characters aren't introduced (a maid for example), especially because they/she do(es)n't play a major role here. Still if you've been with a character for a few seasons, you kinda begin to like him her. And the archetypal structure/splitting of the roles here, works just fine.On the other hand, yes this could've been a TV movie or just an overlong episode. Yes there are still downfalls. Women might get ecstatic when hearing the name Vitton or whatever, but it will leave (most) men cold. So the fashion parade, is for the female fans then. The fact that none of the women seem to have money problems is a bit odd (to say the least), but then again if that's what is bothering you, then you shouldn't be watching this in the first place! Sex and the City - The movie, delivers on it's premises/promises and that's the bottom line, nothing more and nothing less!",Sex and the City
4,BA_Harrison,As my wife succinctly put it'This is boring!',3,22 November 2008,"'What's a gore-loving horror fan like ba.harrison doing watching a chick flick like this?' I hear you ask (I thought the medication was supposed to stop the voices, but there you go...). Well, believe it or not, I'm a fan of the series (let's face it, it's pretty lewd and often features Kim Catrall in the buff, going at it like a woman possessed!), and so I thought I'd check out the film to see how well it made the transition to the big screen.Not very well, I'm afraid to report!Instead of sexy, smart, and sassy, Sex and the City: The Movie is saccharine sweet, slow, silly, and superficial. Rather than seizing the bull by the horns and allowing the girls to be even more outrageous and daring than usual, the film's creators have sucked the format dry of everything that made the show so much fun, and delivered an overlong piece of manipulative and schmaltzy pap that feels reserved in comparison with the series.Gone are the risqué sex scenes featuring the four stars (only Miranda is seen getting a good seeing to; the rest of the girls keep it under wraps); gone is the witty banter about taboo subjects such as masturbation, the taste of semen, and anal sex (even the word 'sex' is considered too strong for one scene!); and gone is all the charm, wit and insight that made the original programme so irresistible: all that is left is a predictable love storyand that ain't what the title promised!",Sex and the City
5,Quinoa1984,"it's full of laughs, tears, hugs, and lots of fashion... that all doesn't make for a very good movie on the whole",5,31 May 2008,"Whatever I or any other critics or most viewers have to say, as with most movies adapted (or extended) from TV shows, Sex and the City will either appeal to their fanbase, or annoy the hell out of those who are not fans. Now, this doesn't mean that fans may also have problems with the film. It has problems even if you are a die-hard fan. But it is shallow entertainment on its watchable playing field, where things are sentimental and not with much to make the audience think very hard. Unless, like me, you do think about a lot of what you just saw in a movie, and then realize certain things (and I say this having watched episodes of Sex and the City and enjoying them as *half hour* pieces on HBO).Like, for example, Carrie Bradshaw, played by star Sarah Jessica Parker, as she is the one character who significantly does not really change not simply from start of the movie to end, but from start of the original series till now. The simplistic change to note is that she learns to love and forgive and not think about herself too much in terms of marrying Mr. Big (Chris Noth). But the character, and also at times how she plays her, is so thinly veiled that there is no real change sensible. While Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Samantha (Kim Cattral) go through their own relationship problems in the film (as well as in the series) and seem to kind of mature and come to some self-realizations that might possibly stick, the protagonist seems to stay in a constant state of the same thing with this guy over and over again. Maybe some may feel there's a catharsis for Mrs. Preston by the end, but I didn't see it, at all.Aside from this, there's problems with, simply, having a Sex and the City movie this long. It's basically five episodes strung together, more or less separated by slight plot twists (slight as in they're read from such and such a moment to a T), and (groaning as a member of the human race, not as a guy) schmaltzy montages. The dialog has moments that come out as charming or even clever- certainly Charlotte's jab at Mr. Big is a laugh out loud moment- but they're sprinkled about with a bunch of real duds and bad puns (""Mexi-coma!"" hilarious!) It goes without saying as well that there's an obvious attempt by the producers to ""color"" it up with Jennifer Hudson added to the cast, in a performance that continues her streak of turns from Dreamgirls to now where it's obvious that she's trying to act as opposed to acting naturally (some may disagree, but the character in and of itself here is superfluous).Now, as Ebert also noted, this might not be the reviewer to be relied upon to give the opinion on this. If you're a woman and you know you want to see it, it's worth seeing, and if you're a guy you'll... probably be dragged along to see this as well. But unlike some other TV shows that have been brought full-throttle for summer blockbuster prestige- The Simpsons, The X-Files, South Park- it didn't merit it by the final results. It's a final, coda/mini-season in sheep's clothing. 5.5/10",Sex and the City
6,edwagreen,Sex and the City ***1/2,9,20 November 2008,"Wonderful film. Makes me sorry that I never watched the television series.It is great that it deals with inter-personal relationships. The 3 gals around the orbit of Sarah Jessica Parker are all just fabulous. I take exception though to the acting of Cynthia Nixon. She was so fabulous in the Kenneth Branagh series on Franklin Roosevelt, when she totally captured the role of Eleanor. Here, she is just out of the picture. Same comment for Jennifer Hudson. Hudson showed her mettle in her supporting Oscar performance in ""Dreamgirls."" Here she is so blasé.Nonetheless, the picture succeeds because of these great relationships. Marriage as a way of protection is shown not always to be the best policy.I take exception to those who say that this picture is not Oscar material other than for the clothes. That's a sexist opinion. The writing and Sarah Jessica Parker's performance as well as that of Chris Noth deserve consideration.",Sex and the City
7,sunwarrior13,Carrie And Her Friends On The Big Screen,8,20 September 2012,"Sex and the City is a blue romantic comedy film adaptation of the HBO comedy series of the same name about four female friends: Carrie Bradshaw, Samantha Jones,Charlotte York Goldenblatt and Miranda Hobbes, dealing with their lives as single women in New York City. The series often portrayed frank discussions about romance and sexuality.Sarah Jessica Parker returns once again as Carrie Bradshaw, the style-maven journalist whose romantic exploits were the key focus of the show. Also reprising their roles are Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, and Cynthia Nixon, with the series' executive producer Michael Patrick King taking on writing and directing duties.The film begins with a montage of the four female friends walking through New York City and a recap of what happened in the TV series as well as what happened between the season six finale and the film.Several years have passed since viewers last saw Carrie and company, though she's still involved with Mr. Big and completely consumed by her obsession for name-brand accessories. Meanwhile, Miranda is adjusting to married life and motherhood, Charlotte is still clinging to her dreams, and Samantha and handsome, steely eyed TV star Smith Jerrod are now living together out in L.A. Of course, when the girls all come together, it's just like old times.This film offers well-developed characters, smart dialogue, interesting plots and sub-plots, and a ton of heart.It did about as much as a fan could hope for. It gives all four of its main characters plenty to do, it pays tribute to what's best about the series and it gives us another chance to spend time Carrie and her friends.But unfortunately,it never lived up to the TV series for it was riddled with clichés and it feels like a TV marathon of 6 episodes for 2 and a half hours.Finally,the movie becomes more about consumer-driven fantasies of the four women rather than sex,romance and friendship.Nevertheless,the hardcore fan will enjoy this movie reunion.",Sex and the City
8,zardoz-13,The Best Chick Flick of Summer 2008!,8,4 June 2008,"Fans of the HBO chick flick TV series ""Sex in the City"" won't find anything terribly surprising about the new feature-length film ""Sex in the City"" except that writer & director Michael Patrick King has refused to tamper with the surefire formula. King knows a thing or two about the characters that Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kristen Davis and Kim Cattrall immortalized between 1998 and 2004 because he penned 22 episodes and helmed 10 of them. The big-screen adaptation of novelist Candace Bushnell's Cosmo-style characters who gossip about life, love, shoes, and sex in the Big Apple is a predictable, superficial, but fashionable exercise in materialism and narcissism. Our heroines deck themselves out in a number of outlandish, eye-catching outfits and celebrate the bonds of friendship even after adversity confronts them. Happily, nobody dies, contracts a life-threatening disease, or winds up in rehab for drug, spousal and/or alcohol abuse. The worst thing about ""Sex in the City"" is that it is rather bland and its revelations won't hoist eyebrows. Occasionally, like its ground-breaking HBO series, this two-and-a-half-hour soap opera reminds us why it qualified for an R-rating with its nudity and sensuality. You'll get more than you bargained in this R-rated movie. When ""Sex in the City"" appears on DVD, you'll want to pause at least one close-up shot to check out some anatomical features. As the story unfolds, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker of ""Failure to Launch"") and Big (Chris Noth of NBC-TV's ""Law & Order"") have just moved into a posh Manhattan penthouse. Carrie ignores to the real estate agent when he observes that the last two married occupants ended their relationship and their lease with a malicious divorce. She and her gal pals, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon of ""The Pelican Brief""), Charlotte (Kristin Davis of ""The Shaggy Dog"") and Samantha (Kim Cattrall of ""Star Trek IV""), attend a jewelry auction. It seems that a wealthy man locked his girlfriend out of their house, and she has decided to make their break-up an event by auctioning off all the pricey jewelry that he bought her. Sexaholic Samantha has flown into New York City for the event. She spends the bulk of her time managing her live-in lover, TV celebrity 'Smith' Jerrold (Jason Lewis of ""Havoc"") who plays a hunk doctor. The gals applaud Carrie's new digs, but they wonder what will happen to her if Big ever gives her the boot.One night, Big and Carrie discuss their relationship in light of their new penthouse apartment, and the two decide to tie the knot. Everybody is overjoyed about Big and Carrie's wedding. Things start to go seriously wrong. Miranda is appalled when her husband Steve (David Eigenberg of ""The Mothman Prophecies"") informs her about a one-time only extramarital affair. Lately, not only has Miranda has been so immersed in her law practice that she neglected satisfying her own husband, but she also failed to keep herself trimmed so that she doesn't appear too hirsute in a bathing suit. Meanwhile, Samantha hasn't been getting enough of her hunky blond lover 'Smith' because of her late night TV shooting schedule. The frustrated Samantha finds herself behaving like a voyeur as she watches by their next door neighbor Dante (newcomer Gilles Marini) who beds babes on an apparent 24/7 basis. Finally, after adopting an Asian orphan, Charlotte discovers to her surprise and happiness that she has gotten pregnant. When the day of Carrie and Big's wedding at the New York Public Library comes, Big gets cold-feet, cannot contact Carrie, and abandons her. Naturally, with 250 wedding guests awaiting her triumphant moment, Carrie is furious. Of course, everything works out in the long run. There is nothing either deep or philosophical about ""Sex and the City."" Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte do a lot of drinking and talking. After Carrie's disastrous wedding, she finds it difficult to recover. Samantha arranges things so that all four of them can go to Mexico where the newlyweds were supposed to vacation. Once Carrie gets back to New York, she hires an assistant, Louise (Jennifer Hudson of ""Dreamgirls""), to help her unpack and move back into her venerable old apartment. Louise has come to New York after her own similar debacle in St. Louis when she couldn't marry her boyfriend. Out of the four, Samantha's antics stand out the most, especially when she turns her body into a sushi buffet for her lover. On the other hand, Kristen's saga is the least compelling, except when he suffers from Montezuma's revenge in Mexico. Miranda comes off as the least sympathetic. Meanwhile, the men are relegated to the sidelines. The dialogue has its witty moments, particularly when Kristen pleads with her friends to substitute another word for 'sex' when they are around her impressionable Chinese daughter. Aptly, our heroines revert to code, and they refer to coitus as coloring with crayons. ""Big likes to color outside the lines,"" Carrie boasts to her friends about their amorous adventures. Samantha's pet pooch provides some laugh-out-aloud moments with its randy shenanigans. ""Sex in the City"" doesn't differ drastically from the award winning HBO cable series that spawned it. The more that Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha change, the more that this charismatic quartet remains the same.",Sex and the City
9,Calicodreamin,The ladies,7,12 January 2021,"The queens of NYC are back in spectacular fashion. Is it Oscar worthy? No, but it doesn't need to be.

10,anaconda-40658,Better Than Expected.,10,15 June 2015,"Sex and the City (2008): Dir: Michael Patrick King / Cast: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral, Cynthia Nixon, Kristen Davis, Chris Noth: Spectacular chick flick about romance, relationships and the struggle to maintain them. It chronicles four women who have been friends for years. Fashion editor Sarah Jessica Parker is preparing for her wedding only to be left at the alter. Kim Cattrall is in Hollywood dating a young actor. Kristen Davis exercises and is expecting her first child. Cynthia Nixon learns that her husband had an affair and struggles to forgive. Surprisingly well written with director Michael Patrick King going above the successful TV program. Parker shines as a woman at home in fame and fashion but still feels a void where love departed. It seems to be the one thing she hasn't mastered. Cattral is the ultimate cougar seducing young men as if to revisit youthfulness herself. Nixon lives in denial and struggles with resentment. Davis is about to enter the stage of motherhood. Chris Noth plays Parker's fiancé and the process is trying as he struggles to bring this woman down to normality and routine. Fans of the successful TV show will not be disappointed yet the film can easily appeal to those unfamiliar with it simply because it takes its message seriously. It becomes an insightful view into romance and marriage and the transformation between the two. Score: 10 / 10",Sex and the City
11,phd_travel,Enjoyable even for fans or non fans alike,8,6 August 2010,This eagerly anticipated movie doesn't disappoint. It doesn't have the feel of the TV series anymore but it does satisfy.There are genuinely touching moments like on 5th Avenue when the wedding fell through. Steve's infidelity seems a bit contrived. But it does link up with Big's cold feet well. And how SJP got out of her depression.SJP looks a bit older - better hurry up with any more installments or it'll be like golden girls soon.If you are a fan of the series you probably will have seen it and enjoyed it but if you are not a fan it still is very fun.,Sex and the City
12,Sylviastel,"Okay, maybe I was too harsh on the show! It's Dame Vivienne Westwood, ladies!",8,14 July 2008,"I am one of those left-wing liberal feminist who felt that Sex and the City was quite misogynistic and chauvinistic towards women well until now. In this film, I wasn't expected to feel sympathy to the characters but I did especially Carrie Bradshaw played magnificently by Sarah Jessica Parker who I still remembered from Square Pegs. Yes, I'm that old. Anyway, she becomes complex especially since she prepares for her wedding. I don't want to spoil anything but it is two and half-hours of the same stuff written by one of the show's writers, Michael David King. The cast reprises their characters including Kristen DAvis as Charlotte York Goldenblatt who is now a full-time mother to Chinese-born Lily and wife to Harry in New York CIty. Sex-crazed Samantha Jones is still in one relationship with a man who becomes a television star but he is too busy working in Los Angeles. She gets a dog and gains some weight but not significantly to make people notice. It was one of the things that bothered me in the film. I also was concerned why Lily wasn't there in the hospital room with Harry and Charlotte and her new sister, Rose. Oscar Winner Jennifer Hudson is Louise from St. Louis who is hired by Carrie to be a her personal assistant. Miranda and Steve split up. Stanford finds love. THere is the fashion show but I'm not much of a fashion buff so I could care less. But when Carrie was posing in wedding gowns by top designers, she stated Vivienne Westwood. Honey, it's Dame Vivienne Westwood now. Oh well, the fans of the show will love it. I just think it's funny that even Larry the Cable guy was dragged to see this film by his wife. I would have loved to have been sitting next to him in the theater. I love watching the scenes in New York City and the fans should get a thrill of seeing New York Public LIbrary and Bryant Park. I won't say anything about CArrie and Big.",Sex and the City
13,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Sex and the City,6,31 May 2008,"I've got to admit that I've never seen an episode of Sex and the City prior to this movie, so I'm probably a good gauge whether someone going in blind will still be able to enjoy the movie. In short, yes I did, primarily because it's so cliché of a romance movie and I'm in the mood for some formula after frying my brain for the last work week. But like in true Singapore fashion, the same reason why the television series never made it to our free-to-air channels, is precisely because we cannot stand sex. I've said it before and I'll say it again, stop complaining about dwindling birthrates when we can't even watch some harmless humping on the screen. In true capitalist fashion, the distributors decided on the M18 rating, with the censors exercising their scissors to trim it for that. An R21 rating will enable this to go uncut, but no. So while we can see a dog hump everything in sight, human copulation is a strict no-no.So yes, the version screened here is the censored one. NO sex please, we're Singaporeans. Welcome home, I thought. Anyway even without the sex on screen (which I'm sure we can all imagine in our erm, heads), the first impressions I have on the characters, especially Sarah Jessica Parker's New York #1 Single Girl (read: worried woman at 40 afraid of being left on the shelf and miss the train) Carrie Bradshaw, was that she's so whiny and shallow. It's all about the materialistic labels, as if not having a brand plastered on herself would mean the end of the world as we know it.And succinctly put, that was the impression I got, which irked me at the beginning, until slow, and surprisingly, it started to grow on me. Stop the press, a chick flick which disses men at first opportunity, being appealing? Yes, you heard me right. While I had disdain for the Label part, what with the gushing over Vogue spreads, and having being sponsored gowns that rattled off like a who's who in the fashion industry (although I do admit that the Vivienne Westwood wedding gown was stunning) that made it look like wanting to go one up on The Devil Wears Prada, the Love part was what made it a tad more interesting.As the series alluded to, the Big Apple is where the everyone goes to in an attempt to get their dreams come true and their love life sorted out, or so Jennifer Hudson's very minor supporting role as Carrie Bradshaw's personal assistant. I thought I was watching Desperate Housewives in their 40s, with the return of the principle cast of Cynthia Nixon as Miranda Hobbes, who's having problems dealing with infidelity and the grappling with the notion of forgiveness, Kristin Davis' Charlotte York, the ditzy one (yup, there's always one) amongst the group, and Kim Cattrall's Samantha Jones, the one who put the Sex in the city, but now living on the West Coast, and having to fight temptations with staying next door to a hunk (oh yeah M18 allows a cock shot too), resisting her internal urges to play the horizontal tango. For those who are virgins to the series, you'll thank the filmmakers for summarizing everything for you in the series when the opening credits roll.But we all know that this movie is all about Carrie Bradshaw, don't we, as the trailer already suggests, the central story revolves around Bradshaw's impending marriage to her Mr Right, Mr Big (Chris Noth, and to the clueless like me, I thought it refers to an appendage, does it?). And in formulaic fashion, you know what would happen, and what would happen next. It runs fairly predictably, but the only thing that keeps us glued onto the screen, is because it appealed to our internal curiosity to observe how surprisingly these characters are brought to life by their charismatic actresses. That's also one major contributor to the fun factor, as you also laugh at some subtle remarks and actions - the iPhone bit just cracked me up, and so does the growing of the national forest part, despite being prominently featured in the trailers.And it throws down a few life lessons too for everyone thinking about marriage, the severity of it (if you still subscribe to the notion), and that's to be dead sure before you even moot the point. Forever's a very long time, and you've got to be dead serious when making such commitments. In any case, whatever you do, never ever leave the bride at the alter. To me I think that's quite irresponsible, ungentlemanly and really very wrong. If you have cold feet and want to call it off, do it early, not at the very last minute. Though I think it really makes a good catalyst for a movie, like Run Fatboy Run.So will Sex and the City make a lot of money, and wise enough to play during summer? Going by the crowd reaction, the fans have turned out in full force to support the movie and reminisce about the television series they loved, with the return of characters they spent a part of their lives with. To the uninitiated like me, they definitely have piqued my interest to try and watch the series. Uncensored of course, somehow, somewhere, where there's a will, there's gotta be a way. And later in summer we'll see the return of yet another television series to the big screen, and I can't wait for Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to dig up another case of the X-Files.",Sex and the City
14,siderite,What a painful experience!,6,13 September 2008,"I will mark it just as the IMDb grade because I am the wrong person to analyse it. I use the comment system to remember which movies I saw and I do believe I will either block the memory completely or remember it as a painful experience.The idea is that the movie is made EXCLUSIVELY for women. Maybe an even more select audience such as big city women, I don't know. Most of the feelings expressed in it felt either terribly misplaced, over exaggerated or plain offensive. I kept switching from feelings of bafflement to ones of annoyance, disgust and self analysis. I mean, this movie was a success, my wife liked it, so what was wrong with me?Bottom line: as a man, I can't possibly understand what happened. It felt like a film made by aliens for aliens. Any slight resemblance to the world I know was random or offensive. I can't believe I actually lived through it.",Sex and the City
15,Smells_Like_Cheese,A comment from someone who has not watched one episode of Sex and the City,7,1 June 2008,"I admit it, I'm a girl, I have never seen one episode of Sex and the City, it never sparked my interest and when I heard about the movie coming out, I was sure that I wouldn't wanna see it, but I was invited by some friends of mine today and I got to see it for free, so what would I have to loose? I thought it was probably going to be awful or that I wouldn't get into it. Well, first of all, I do have to admit, never underestimate the power of estrogen, because about 90% of the audience(women) were all dressed the same and acted the same as if they belonged in the show, this was a bit scary. But anyways, I hate to say it, maybe because I'm a girl, but I did enjoy Sex and the City the movie. I thought it was well put together and just fun to be with the girls. Now maybe it's a good thing I haven't seen the show because I don't have to compare it, but I think, oh, my god, I can't believe I'm say this, but I may just start watching the series.Carrie just got everything she's ever wanted along with her friends: Miranda, Samantha, and Charolette, they are just living the highs of life, love, and really big closets with name brands. Carrie just got engaged to the love of her life, Mr. Big, but he freaks out when the wedding gets more and more big and he decides that it's too much and leaves the wedding before it gets started. Miranda's husband cheated on her and she refuses to forgive him. Samantha is having second thoughts about her relationship and wishes to return to the sex vixen she always was. Charolette finally gets the baby she's always wanted. But in the mean time Carrie is just trying to get back to life with her friends.Sex and the City, no, it's by no means a guy's movie, in fact I think that's the reason for the low rating here on IMDb, a lot of guys do resent this film. It's for a girl's afternoon, even I hate to say it, I did think it was cute and just fun to watch. Do women act like this? Unfortunately some do, but it's not believable that all women behave this way, not everyone does all the things these girls do. Some women do look up to this behavior, I don't go for it, be yourself, don't be like what I saw in the audience, be an individual. Sorry, that was a little too after school special, but seriously, just it was sad to see that in young girls. But I do however would recommend this movie for not only the fans, but for all the girls looking for just a fun afternoon of laughter and tears.7/10",Sex and the City
16,blanbrn,A good big screen adaptation of the female series that's filled with it's typical laughs and raunchy scenes of sex!,7,30 May 2008,"Well it's finally arrived ""Sex and the City: The Movie"" and many see this as your typical all female flick and true most of it's core viewers are females. Even though the big screen take of the HBO series is well done as it's long and well detailed about the lives of the four super Manhattan vixens: Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha and it picks up where the series left off. And the girls are just the same with the highs and joys of feminism like independence and sleeping around all with hopes of shopping for a mate and they hope to find love. Just like the series the feminine mystique is carried on well. During the film it's filled with the typical ""SATC"" themes of love, tears, fashion, depression, lavish vacations, good sex, bad sex, and in the end friendship and unexpected happiness.Carrie(Sarah Jessica Parker) is again back with Mr. Big(Chris Noth) only to have her ups and downs in the relationship even after they decide on marriage which takes an unexpected twist and ends in a happy yet low key manner. Charlotte(Davis)is still happily married and expects another kid on the way. While Miranda(Cynthia Nixon)has a roller coaster of a ride with Steve as their marriage is rocky and she's still as high strong as ever. Last but not least my favorite gal free spirited and sexy Samantha(Kim Cattrall)can not satisfy her sexual cravings with hunky actor boyfriend Smith while they live in L.A.. Overall it's filled with many laughs, and touching moments that extends itself out to wrap up the adventures of these girls in a sweet and delightful sharing way as all of them keep one another company during the good and bad.

17,theowinthrop,"Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, Charlotte, ""Big"", Smith, Steve, and Harry - five years later.",9,15 June 2008,"Films based on television series are usually quite dismal. Remember such bombs as MCHALE'S NAVY, of the recent BEWITCHED? The film version of the cable comedy hit SEX AND THE CITY, has gotten a real drubbing from several critics. A drubbing it doesn't deserve. The performances are good, in particular my favorite Kim Cattrall as the sex wild but sympathetic Samantha. Given her personality and honest sex hunger hers is the most difficult set of problems one can imagine. Sarah Jessica Parker's ""Carrie"", Cynthia Nixon's ""Miranda"" and Kristin Davis' ""Charlotte"", all get equal time for their personal forms of angst, and make the most of them, but for fun-loving Samantha, any nuttiness she is involved in just always fascinates me.If you saw the series this film makes plenty of sense. It is five years since Big (Chris Noth - now we learn his name is John James Preston) took Carrie home from Paris (after the failure of her love affair with Alexander Petrovsky). At that point Miranda and Steve (Dave Eigenberg) were facing the Alzheimer's disease of his mother. We are told now that she is in an old age home. Their problems deal with Miranda's careerism as a first level lawyer - she can't keep a balance with Steve's sexual desires for her, and the marriage begins collapsing as a result. Charlotte and Harry (Evan Handler) are happy about their growing adopted Chinese daughter Lili. As the film continues, Charlotte gets some surprising health news later in the film. Samantha has moved most of the time to California to manage the career of Smith (Jason Lewis) in Hollywood, but she spends as much time as possible with her three pals in New York...she feels rootless in Hollywood, despite her continued affection for Smith and his for her.Besides the regulars there are other figures who came back. The girls' gay pal Stanford (Willy Garson) is back as is Carrie's editor at VOGUE Enid (Candace Bergen), and Miranda's one time maid - now Brady's Nanny - Magda (Lynn Cohen). One wishes some of the others who dropped out of the show (Aiden, Berger, Petrovsky, Natasha) could have been written in, but it probably would have been too complicated for the script.The main plot of the film is whether or not (as in the series) Carrie and Big will marry. The series ended with him admitting his love and taking her back home, but in five years, while they have lived together most of the time, Carrie and Big still live separately. They are looking for a flat when the film begins (and find a heavenly one) but in a conversation with her pals Carrie realizes that they consider she is in the least stable relationship because she and Big never married. She mentions this to Big, while they are preparing dinner together, and he offers to marry her. She accepts. Unfortunately things get out of control. First Carrie's engagement becomes known to her boss, and she becomes part of a special ""wedding"" issue for VOGUE. This allows her all the benefits of the magazine (such as the clothing in the shoot), and she ends up getting a wedding gown from one admirer. Carrie and Charlotte start planning the wedding together - soon there are over 200 guests. And Carrie also gets carried away regarding renting a public building for the wedding ceremony. All this disturbs Big, who admits he really would have been satisfied with a wedding at City Hall. To add to the growing crisis, Miranda learns from Steve he had a one night stand because he felt Miranda no longer loved him. She starts separating from him, and also resists his constant attempts to apologize. The crisis arises the night before the wedding when Big hears something that sends his fears over the edge. I won't say anything else - but keep in mind, at least an hour of the film remains to be seen.SEX AND THE CITY is not a sad film - it has a lot of the same humor in it that the show did. It also has one improvement. Carrie hires an aide named Louise (Jennifer Hudson). She is the first character of African-American background who has an equal role (or would have one) in the make-up of the show. It was always a knock at the series that the four gal-pals were white women, and one black woman would have made some difference. If the show should be revived Ms Hudson might be brought back - she turns out to be full of common sense and surprises to Carrie. One is glad the writer created her at last.",Sex and the City
18,MLDinTN,the movie should have never been made,3,29 March 2009,"I was a fan of the TV show and it ended how it should have. This movie was made just for the money, I guess they didn't care how it ruined what we think of the 4 leading ladies.Be warned, it is no where near as good as the TV show. First of all, all the witty, coarse sexual talk is nearly missing. Plus, Samantha has a boyfriend through the entire film, and that just goes against everything she was on TV. And Miranda's guy, Steve, has become a total wimp and Miranda is just grouchy. Charolette was still her happy self and a lot like her TV character. While Carrie, was still with Big, and we finally learn his name.The main plot is Carrie is jilted at the alter by Big. She remains depressed throughout the film. She and her 3 girlfriends find time to still hang out in New York. Will Carrie ever talk to Big again? After watching this, do you really care? FINAL VERDICT: The writing just wasn't as good as the TV show. And at over 2 hours, the movie is too long. Please, don't make a sequel.",Sex and the City
19,ericstevenson,I need to watch more TV,6,22 March 2018,"I have once again never seen the original show. Judging from the title, I assumed this would have some sex scenes in it and it did. This movie takes place over about a year telling the story of Carrie struggling to marry her boyfriend, Mr. Big. The best part is probably when she flips out after he says he wants to call the wedding off. The acting and characters aren't bad at all. The main problem with this film is that it's just too long.It's two and a half hours! This story isn't complicated at all! From what I heard, there were a lot of things that happened in the show that this movie undid. I guess if I was a fan of the show, I would dislike this more. I admit that everything is portrayed fairly realistically. It isn't really my thing. **1/2",Sex and the City
20,inkblot11,"Girl bonding is stronger than superglue, as this film aptly shows",7,18 September 2008,"Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is in the midst of looking for a new apartment with her great love, Mr. Big (Chris Noth). She is overwhelmed when they locate a penthouse beauty and Big promptly plunks down the enormous sum of money to buy it. Things seem perfect. However, a couple of days later, she gets together with her three close pals. Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a happily married mother of an adopted toddler, Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is a talent agent who is making a visit from her new home in California, and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is a lawyer who lives in Brooklyn with her spouse and young son. Over a lengthy chat, someone suggests that marriage is the ultimate. Carrie realizes she wants an official attachment and when she meets up with Big again, she makes her wishes known. To her surprise, he immediately proposes and they begin planning a simple wedding. Yet, these four friends will have a boatload of troubles before Carrie's big day. Charlotte, thinking she is infertile, becomes pregnant, causing her joy but anxiety over carrying the baby to term. Miranda has some new troubles with her husband and moves out while Samantha misses New York every day and wonders whether she can stay faithful to her much-younger beau. In such light, can everything go perfectly for Carrie, too? Don't bet the farm! This is a lovely film for women everywhere and their partners. Girl bonding is stronger than superglue, in some cases, and these women rarely let each other down or to suffer life's disappointments alone. As the four close friends, the cast is wonderful, as Parker, Davis, Cattrall and Nixon continue their hit roles from the long-running HBO series. Noth, too, reprises his role as the supreme Manhattan catch of the decade, as he is most handsome and engaging. The rest of the cast is quite fine as well. The costumes, naturally, are out of this world, so as to make one dizzy with admiration for the designer togs and accessories. Likewise, the setting in Manhattan is lovely and ""happening"" while the writing, direction, and production values are all above average. Then, too, even if you have never seen an episode of the original series, you can still enjoy this movie where every viewer is brought up to speed on past and present occurrences. However, if you are devoted fan, you will be delighted to continue the adventures of these ladies. One word of caution to those unfamiliar with the television show. The word ""sex"" in the title is significant, for although there is no overabundance of activity, these girls do have some very close and eyebrow-raising encounters with the opposite gender, from time to time. All in all, however, this movie is about friendship and how it brings us great times and helps us, ultimately, bear the human condition.",Sex and the City
21,tabuno,Eventually Enjoyable Romantic Drama,8,20 January 2019,"1 June 2008. From a male perspective, this movie was difficult to sit through at first, until the female bias and apparent male-bashing was eventually balanced by the end of the movie. This movie has a little for most of the different female role-types for women between 30 and 50, some female to identify. While this blatant, politically-correct movie might have been a distraction, their depiction on screen was more of a valuable lesson in diversity training more than anything. This movie reflected the reality of differences, eventually highlighted the female and finally male emotional issues in many relationships. Eight of Ten Stars.",Sex and the City

23,didi-5,a great conclusion to a great series,8,31 May 2008,"The movie version of 'Sex and the City' has been a long time coming; it now being four years after the final farewell episode, in which Carrie and Mr Big got together, Miranda and Steve married, Charlotte and Harry were poised to adapt, and Samantha said bye to NY to be with Smith in Hollywood.The film doesn't attempt to reprise the series at all: rather, it is a continuation several years later, with the one concession to new viewers not familiar with the TV show of giving a quick back story for each of the characters, illustrated by clips from the TV version.This new SATC is more or less three films in one; first, a 'will she, won't she' as Carrie prepares for her wedding to Big, which ends up with 200 guests, a shoot for Vogue, and an expensive Vivienne Westwood dress. Of course the course of true love does not go smoothly for the happy couple, or for Miranda and Steve.Then a holiday for the girls in Mexico, showing the best of female bonding against all the odds, followed by Carrie's return to New York, employing a personal assistant ('St' Louise from St Louis).The final part of the film ties up loose ends and presents a plethora of happy endings, as you'd expect from this modern fairytale. Does Carrie actually get her man? Can Samantha survive in Hollywood, eating so she doesn't cheat? Does Miranda really suit a married mother's life in Brooklyn? And what is Charlotte's worst day and her best? Alternatively hilarious and sad (as indeed was the TV series), this film has high production values, eye-popping fashion, and a good soundtrack (Al Green's 'How Do You Mend A Broken Heart' and Aerosmith/Run DMC's 'Walk This Way' spring to mind).Hugely recommended even to the man in your life.",Sex and the City
24,johnnyboyz,"Cynical when it isn't inducing the odd cringe through its humour, Sex and the City proves that some television shows just shouldn't be translated to the big screen.",4,7 February 2009,"There's something distinctly misguided and wrong with Sex and the City and it lies in its atmosphere as well as its approach to its material. I don't think it knows what it wants to be and ends up several things, usually all at once. Is it a light and fluffy comic piece about contemporary life in one of the world's largest cities? Or is it some sort of harrowing look at breaking up with someone? Or maybe it's supposed to be some kind of escapist fable about friendship and pulling through amidst thick, thin and everything in-between. The thing is it's so all over the place, and at over two hours long the film most definitely outstays its welcome, that it's everything before ending on a note that reeks of some kind of false, circular journey we're supposed to think the lead characters have been through.The gist of the bizarre clash of ideas is best illustrated during the opening half an hour or so during which we get a lot of fluff and a lot of sugary establishment of characters and the world in which they live before, at random intervals, cutting to explicit sex scenes between people we've spent all of about ten minutes with. It's an odd jump in content and consequently, changes the atmosphere from one that is syrupy and light hearted as these women establish their lives before changing tact and giving us the raw human form. It's a bizarre, bizarre blend of the innocent and the explicit that sets in motion a pretty bland chain of events.The film obviously wasn't made for me or the audience demographic that I fall into but I'm not sure if it even appeals to the audience demographic it thinks its being made for. The film is 'Bratz: The Movie' for adults, featuring colourful and casual female leads strutting through a New York City that exists purely within the universe of iffy movies and it sees them getting into dainty little situations and exchanges. The women are Carrie Bradshaw (Parker); Samantha Jones (Cattrall); Charlotte York (Davies) and Miranda Hobbes (Nixon), whom during the film will indulge in a variety of activities and exchange a number of dialogue tidbits to one another to do with how often one must shave below the waist and how shops and fashion labels are really great things to live by.The film is about four women and how they live their life but it is directed by a male named Michael Patrick King. I was wary of this going into the film and unfortunately, rather than act as an interesting or constructive piece as the guy at the helm attempts to deconstruct the gaze and present these women in a positive light of some sort (something I was optimistic it might've done), he has them say some pretty nasty things about one another and to one another while there are plenty of examples of product placement buried within the dialogue. Companies such as Netflix, Prada and Dior all getting a mention, which is quite sad. Additionally, other characters cannot help but feel disappointed that they're ""eating everything, apart from a certain male character's genitalia"" and when one other male partner states, following one of those many out of place sex scenes, that they feel 'distant'; one of the women snaps back: ""Distant? You're still in me!"" Dialogue like this shoots down any of the above hopefulness/general theory.It's difficult to describe, but you know when you watch a Saw sequel and you witness these traps that crop up at certain points and you think 'Blimey, who thinks this stuff up?' Well, the same can be said for lines of dialogue like the ones just mentioned. It's out of place and the focus isn't actually on the fact that they may possibly be 'distant' from one another but more so on the snappy comeback, echoing the disjointed tone the overall film has. So once all the sweet and nicey, nicey pleasantries have been set up, we quite crudely get whacked around the head with a proverbial hammer when it appears Carrie's long term partner Mr. Big (Noth) doesn't want to get married after all and after all the proposals, stands her up on the big day. Needless to say, she isn't pleased and heads off to should-be honeymoon destination Mexico with her three buddies.I thought the film was going to branch off into something else. The distinct change in tone is obvious: colourful and flowery to gloomy and depressing as Carrie tries to recover from her breakup and I thought it might look at what it's like to get over a relationship from the perspective of a late thirties, American woman who's successful in her own right. But what we get is a series of crass sex jokes; more Apple Mac.; Mercedes-Benz and Gucci product placement as well as just a general feeling of tedium as the film drifts towards its non-event of a study and then completely cops out with a nicey, nicey finale.The film tries, it so desperately tries. Mr Big has been married twice before and that's supposed to be a precursor to Carrie's catalyst; but a catalyst for what, I ask. One other male partner early on has an affair and some contractual issues create friction for another couple but there is no love lost here and there is no real empathy with anyone, just colourful, flowery people ditzying around a sugar coated New York that doesn't see much happen. What does it teach us? Well, as long as you have a huge wardrobe for all your clothes and skills in cooking Sushi for you husband then nothing else matters. There must be more to late thirties life as a female journalist in contemporary New York than that.",Sex and the City
25,jzappa,An Epic of Astounding Triviality,6,22 September 2008,"This epic big-screen contrivance of Sex and the City prolongs the chronicle of the four heroines of the funny television series, the first five or so episodes I have seen, and in the company of two friends who had already seen every episode. The characters are older now but no wiser, and all confronting a number of romantic moments of truth. I suppose I am able to safely say Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is in the 10th year of her liaison with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) when they more or less make a decision to buy a penthouse. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) has gone to LA, where her young sex partner has turned out to be a daytime TV idol. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and her husband have adopted a Chinese daughter. And Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is in a predicament with her husband.What with one thing and another, stagy plot developments affect the four best friends to travel to a lavish Mexican spa, where they go sunbathing in figure-squeezing swimsuits, and Miranda is made fun of for the copious increase of her pubic hair. A little afterward, Charlotte craps her pants. This is one scene where I did laugh. Looking back on it, the occurrence actually isn't nearly as funny as its position in the story as a key moment!The original TV show was a hit for its sexual outspokenness, and sometimes it was quite funny. In the film, however, it seems to mimic the comic style of the Farrelly brothers, big gross-out moments that are more like set pieces than part of the story. For instance, Samantha's dog is a compulsive masturbator. She's been fixed, but she has not lost the urge.By now, I should have informed that I am not the person to review this movie. Maybe you will enjoy a review from someone who excludes himself of the cultish eligibility of the movie's audience, and has lost a lot of respect for most of the characters that grew on him before and is jaded by their brainless dialogue. There is an elaborately extensive montage of wedding dresses by renowned designers. What are those of us filmgoers supposed to think who don't resound with the luminaries of designer labels?From what I saw of Chris Noth's Mr. Big character on the show, he had a cool, mysterious vibe. Here, he is dull. He's classically good-looking in the hunky yet romantic Rock Hudson convention, and has a breathy, unnaturally serene voice that supplies routine encouragements and hackneyed lines with a good knack for timing. I think he is supposed to be the turning of the tables in the sense that most of the time, the woman is made to be the hollow token romantic interest and the men are running the show and now for the sake of a predominantly female franchise, the roles are reversed. He poses as if knowingly posturing as the ultimate man.The most human character is Jennifer Hudson, who is still in her 20s and, hot off her earth- shattering performance in Dreamgirls, has not quite yet become skilled at being a lackluster commercial sketch. Her character was written that way, however, because she does everything we have seen before in a chick flick or a musical. She is hired as Carrie's assistant and and over time Restores Carrie's Belief In True Love. However, Hudson is welcoming and responsive, which does not illustrate the four self-obsessed, obsessively materialistic and unapologetically stereotypical girly-women.And that is my central peeve with this movie. I have no one with whom to sympathize. At all. Zero. And I felt sorry for Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. These four women have not a mature bone in their bodies. They are shallow, gossipy, idle, pampered, materialistic and indulgent. Take for instance a surprise encounter with Mr. Big at a restaurant that leaves Charlotte so furious that she goes into labor. She doesn't just get this furious. She lets herself get this furious and make a scene, no less, because she and her three friends have decided to villainize him rather than reach a communicative understanding with him about why he did what he did. All of that, by the way, is done with the maturity, tact, understanding and communication of a landslide boulder, a landslide boulder that has seen way too many stupid soap operas and Hollywood romantic comedies. I believe that every single moment of dramatic action in the story is perpetuated by these four drama queens who need such drama to occupy them. I don't believe these women would be able to occupy themselves productively on each other's own. Carrie is a writer. I don't know why, though, because even in her narration, nothing sounds intense or fathomable enough to merit a successful career in the literary field, which sure enough she has.These women do not seem to have any capacity for understanding the men they want to believe they love, because if they did, they would not seize the opportunity to abandon their living situations entirely for the sake of having an emotional roller coaster ride they could easily avoid and actually rather want.All of this goes on for over two and a half hours, through New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day and other conveniently spirited holidays. But this is the precise Sex and the City film that devotees of the series are aching for, and it has experienced commercial success, recording the biggest opening weekend ever for a romantic comedy, and also for a film starring a woman. What drew me to seeing this movie was not only the appeal of what I have seen of the show, but the mere fact of its running time! I love movies that run two and a half hours and over, especially when they don't seem like the sort of movie that would. This film, however, like its main characters, makes a huge epic deal out of trivialities.",Sex and the City
26,Turfseer,Strictly for die-hard fans,5,29 June 2008,"I used to watch the TV series on HBO on occasion and found it to be (as one reviewer here put it) ""light and witty"". Sex and the City (The Movie) is much more heavy handed. There were few laughs during the screening I saw. Let's face it, Sex and the City is for the most part a glorified soap opera.The main plot revolves around Chris Noth's Mr. Big getting cold feet just as he's about to get married to Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie. Mr. Big is nothing more than a big wuss--a one dimensional character who unconvincingly hurts Carrie's feelings at a crucial moment in their relationship. Two thirds through the film, Carrie suddenly realizes that she's responsible for the breakup--that she pushed Mr. Big into having a big wedding even though he didn't want it. But her insight is short-lived. When Miranda reveals that she ran into Mr. Big the night before the wedding and told him how horrible marriage is in general (she's upset because she just had a run-in with her estranged husband), Carrie (very narcissisticly) won't cut her best friend any slack.I had trouble with the denouement when Carrie and Mr. Big reconcile--it was hard to believe that Mr. Big would have called off the wedding in the first place (he had ample time to call it off before and he knew how much the woman he loved would be devastated had he called it off at the last minute--but he goes ahead and inexplicably does it anyway).Why also would Mr. Big fall for such a confused person as Carrie, who wanted a showpiece wedding? And then suddenly at the end Carrie sees the error of her ways and now a wedding before a municipal judge is okay? I suppose the happy ending is obligatory in a movie like this but it would have been more intriguing if Carrie had remained true to her neurotic core.Samantha, whose character has the most comic possibilities, is wasted here. She's stuck waiting for her boyfriend to get back from work with her sushi dinner which she's placed all over her body. Not funny! And I didn't believe for a minute that she would remain true to her boyfriend with sexy hunk Dante beckoning her in every scene.For awhile, Charlotte has nothing much to do but get sick from the water while in Mexico and soil herself (again not funny!). More predictable shenanigans occur when Charlotte gets pregnant and has a baby (it's all heartfelt but nothing very dramatic).Finally there's Miranda's relationship with Steve which was perhaps the most realistic part of the movie; although Cynthia Nixon's character oftentimes became too mean and shrill for the audience to have much sympathy for her.As an actress, Jennifer Hudson will always do best in soap operas (the love fest between Carrie and her character was devoid of any meaningful conflict).Sex and the City would have worked much better had about 45 minutes of footage been edited from the final cut. Had more thought been put into the plot, it would have been a much better film. Still, the performances are entertaining and it will pretty much keep you interested to the end.",Sex and the City

I write a weekly column called ""Text & The City"" where I text all my film reviews to all humanoids possessing cell phones. OK, stop! Come back! Just having a little fun there with my film review of ""Sex & The City: The Movie"". Well, undoubtedly ""Sex & The City: The Movie"" does control the chick flick monarchy and I can see why so many females loved it. However, last I checked, I am a male humanoid so I cannot have the same exact sentiment as the fems on viewpoints of ""Sex & The City: The Movie"". Not to sound subjective, but let's face it, most males do not get an adrenaline rush when the characters in a movie are talking about Gucci bags, grandiose shoe closets, and colored dresses. The movie contains the similar themes as the hit TV program. The New York female quartet of Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda are still the same within their personality characteristics but obviously life has changed a bit for them. The charismatic Carrie is marrying her steady beau Mr. Big, the nymph Samantha is living in Hollywood managing her young boyfriend Smith's career, the neurotic Charlotte is living the white picket fence dream with her husband & child, and the career-driven Miranda is trying to save her stale marriage. The movie did make me chuckle at times and I can see why so many are obsessed with the protagonists' fixations. But I must say to Writer-Director Michael Patrick King that you tried to control your ""Sex & The City"" movie kingdom in a communist mode by giving it an overextended running time. 145 minutes!!! Come on Mike! There is nothing wrong with too much sex; but in this case when it comes too many sulking Carrie and nymph-tic Samantha scenes, etc., it does not result in a cinematic climactic gratification. And why include Jennifer Hudson playing Carrie's assistant? Her acting was horrific! Let's just say that The Hudson River was drowning with thespian inefficiency. But I still love Jennifer! It was just the wrong role for her. Now, I did think that Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie was randy baby! Her Parker Sisters were not too shabby either: Kim Cattrall as Samantha, Cynthia Nixon as Miranda, and Kristin Davis as Charlotte. But they have played these characters before! Like around 500 times! It's called ""Sex & The City: Seasons 1- 300"". But for some reason, you could never get too much of SJP as Carrie! She is the mojo of ""Sex & The City"". So come on guys: get your Prada bags, high heels, and . OK, wrong target audience and obviously I do not speak Prada. Anyways, ""Sex & The City: The Movie"" is wittingly orgasmic at times and Parker's bouncy performance is also suffice for me to give the film a sexual marginal recommendation. So hit it, if you cannot get the bigger & better movie deal! *** Average",Sex and the City
29,Chris_Docker,Vuitton and the vixens,5,30 May 2008,"Girls love sex - especially when it comes packaged as, ""big love of one's life."" Who wouldn't? And 'The City' has nothing to do with stockbrokers. It's bright lights. Excitement. The girls' nights out. Successful, independent women. Expensive shoes. Designer label. Labels and love - the two big ""l's"". Big Apple. New York. City of Dreams. So is Sex and the City, the film version of an award-winning TV show, every girl's dream movie? The film  a short two and a half hours  successfully reprises the TV show format. A decade on in the lives of our characters and we follow them for another eventful year. Carrie now a successful book author - and sometimes contributor to Vogue. Says Kim Catrall (who plays Carrie's friend Samantha), ""It was about women joining together as the new family, girlfriends sticking together through thick and thin."" As a girl-bonding movie, it certainly works. On the way home, several hundred dresses to discuss, Manolo strappy sandals, and moral dilemmas like, if you have a secret that would hurt your best friend to know, should you 'fess up? Says, writer-producer-director Michael Patrick King, ""Miranda's the sarcastic, sort of angry, one. Charlotte's the sweeter, sort of preppy one, the more traditional one. Samantha's the sexy, sort of power-hungry one. And then, there's Carrie, the indefinable one."" Their TV personas are already developed and, unlike many TV-shows-made-into-movies, Sex and the City doesn't try to go overboard but develops existing characters and situations.Although everything in the film is well-signposted, I don't want to give anything away. As with genre films, it's the small variations of plot that make it satisfying. A couple of scenes stand out for me. One is where Samantha covers her naked body with hand-made sushi as a Valentine's gift. Beautifully shot, it illustrates her outrageous sexual appetite in a moment that is genuinely artistic and more memorable than a bedroom full of dildos wrapped in cling-film. More clichéd, is the man next door having a slow-motion outdoor shower, but even that didn't seem out of place given Samantha's showy temperament and transfixed gaze.The plot development where Miranda makes an unguarded comment which she is afraid to tell Carrie is well-handled. The restaurant scene where Miranda finally screws up the courage is believable and dramatic while still retaining its humour.But I felt it would be unfair to review this film from a male-only point of view, so duly took my partner along. I tried to set the mood with Shiraz and Spanish tapas, casually asking what she thought of the TV series. ""It's the ultimate sell-out!"" she says. I was taken aback. I thought it was about strong, liberated women of today? ""Yes, but their lives revolve around getting a man."" Seen from that perspective, it is hardly the feminist frolic of fashion and feisty friendship. And of course, our whole film is obsessed with the idea of marriage. In a neat tables-turn  what Scarlett O'Hara might call giving men some of their own medicine  men are casually dehumanised. Either as sex-objects (for Samantha), or as provider (for Carrie, remarkably). The other two males (those stabled by Miranda and Charlotte) are insignificant and weak. Carrie's man is famously not given a name (recall how Célestine was reduced to an object in Buñuel's Diary of a Chambermaid by the old man who simply called her 'what he called all the maids'). Carrie is a successful author yet, when contemplating a new flat with her man, she lets him pick up the bill, ""like he was picking up the check for coffee."" The romantic dénouement is based on what would, without the happy Hollywood coincidences, be deemed stalking in real life.The best part for me was seeing Jennifer Hudson, who plays Carrie's assistant Louise. Hudson also contributes a fine song for the film which adequately expresses the theme of, ""Good men are like designer labels and it's hard to spot the knock-offs."" Hudson is a fine actress in her own right, not just a one hit wonder who got an Oscar for Dreamgirls after failing to win American Idol. She exudes screen charisma. Every expression, every intonation, was a joy to behold. Although the clip from Meet Me in St Louis rather reminded me of what a really good movie looks like, Sex and the City, however enjoyable, isn't one. It's a remarkably pleasant way of spending two and a half hours, but the performances are largely pedestrian. Unlike Devil Wears Prada, it's about labels, not an appreciation of the design behind them. By being successfully chic and delightfully superficial, the characters distract us from the wedding bells goal and the way their lives really stereotype them. We never learn much about their work, or about them as people independent of a man's penis. It provides the dual fantasy of apparently liberated woman while retaining the old penchant for ball and chain.""I want people leaving the movie theater feeling, 'all right, great, that was a lot!'"" King says. ""That was drinks, appetizer, main course, and dessert, dessert, dessert!"" And, like most desserts, Sex and the City is ninety per cent sugar.",Sex and the City
30,MaxBorg89,Great TV series becomes good movie,7,10 June 2008,"Contrary to popular belief, Sex and the City is not a show only women are likely to enjoy: it contains wit, warmth, intelligence and superb characters - all elements any true film or TV lover should embrace, regardless of gender. Even now, four years after it stopped airing, Darren Star's HBO hit stands out as one of the network's best achievements and one of the most accomplished television comedies of all time. Plenty of people waited for the film version to be released, and the general opinion is only fans of the show will like it. Well, as a fan I can say that's not true: by comedy standards, Sex and the City: The Movie is good. Of course, ""good"" isn't satisfying enough, especially since the picture is written and directed by Michael Patrick King, the best of the show's writers (he was responsible for the final episode, among other juicy efforts), but it's certainly a more encouraging prospect than ""absolute rubbish"".The series famously ended with all four of the female protagonists obtaining a hard-earned happy ending, and that's exactly how we meet them again, four years later: Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) has published two books (much like Candace Bushnell, whose newspaper articles inspired the program in the first place), is working on a third and is still happily involved with Mr. Big (Chris Noth); Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is still married to Steve (David Eigenberg) and divides her days between the job and taking care of their son, Brady; Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Harry (Evan Handler) have adopted a Chinese girl named Lily; and former man-eater Samantha (Kim Cattrall) enjoys life in L.A. with her young client/lover ""Smith"" Jerrod (Jason Lewis), though she can't resist the temptation to fly to New York and catch up with her oldest friends as soon as she can. In short, it's all perfect. Too good to be true? You bet.Plotwise, Sex and the City: The Movie is in some ways a montage of the best moments of the series (evoked in the opening credits): big question (does true love last?), most of the main characters in a crisis and a fairy tale-like solution at the end (hint: there's a reason Carrie keeps reading Cinderella to Lily). This montage theory is reinforced by an actual montage that occurs in the film, when Carrie does a fake fashion show and wears her old clothes in front of the girls, who have to decide if they will be kept or trashed. The one outfit they all agree on keeping? The tutu Carrie wore in the series opening credits. It's a fun, nostalgic moment that really works, but King doesn't just indulge fans of the show: having some partial knowledge of what happened prior to the movie is recommended, but the film holds up pretty well on its own, being basically a Woody Allen comedy with Parker playing the leading role instead of Allen - just like she did in the TV version.That said, there are problems. Surprisingly, the running time (145 minutes or, if you prefer, five episodes chucked together) is the least of them: sure, the movie is very long, but the memorable moments outweigh the weaker ones to the point that the picture hardly ever gets tired or boring. However, that doesn't mean the weak bits aren't significant. Firstly, there's Davis, whose character is the least appealing in the film, mostly because she is always excessively cheerful, something she expresses through a horribly giddy scream. Secondly, there's the new entry in the cast, namely Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson as Carrie's assistant Louise: the role obviously embodies the movie's opening line (""Women come to New York for the two L's: Labels and Love""), and Hudson puts her soul in it, but the overall feeling is she's nothing but a shallow plot device. And then there's the worst offense (sorry for the latent sexism in this remark): the way the film's male cast is treated. Why are Lewis, Handler and Eigenberg (the best of the three) given more screen time than Noth or Willie Garson, the only male performers who appeared in every season of the series, not to mention the show's most loved actors besides the leading foursome? Okay, so Noth gets to be as charming, smug and ridiculously likable as ever in his handful of scenes, but Garson, who reprises his role as the wonderfully gay Stanford Blatch, has his part reduced to three short scenes and half a line. Why did he even bother to show up?And yet there's plenty to cherish: the writing is as sharp as it's always been when left in King's hands, Parker's performance and voice-over are still as adorable as they used to be (and her duets with Noth are among the best ever filmed for a comedy), and Cattrall and Nixon still get the best lines (amazingly, though, the steamiest sex scene in the whole film does not feature Samantha). Plus, despite the show's trademark quick wit, two of the biggest laughs originate from a physical gag (Samantha buys a dog - a female, worth noticing - that humps everything in sight) and a bodily function joke (""Charlotte Poughkeepsied in her pants""), both of which work quite well, surprisingly.Bottom line? The movie's appeal boils down to a simple yet unquestionable truth contained in the narration: whenever Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha are together, the film, flawed as it may be, is as deserving as the greatest episodes of the TV series. Not fabulous, but hey, those four women are always worth spending two-and-a-half hours with.",Sex and the City
31,juneebuggy,A guilty favourite,10,18 November 2014,"A guilty favourite for sure. I remember the first time I saw this being surprised by how good it was. I went in not expecting much as I didn't think there was enough material based on a simple TV show to warrant a two and half hour long movie about shoes and sex. But this sucked me right in with surprising depth to all the converging stories of the girls (and their boys) while covering a host of real life issues.My only problem would be the excessive wealth all the characters seem to have amassed ""that pillow cost 400 dollars"", the apartment Big buys and outfits with a gynormous closet, Carrie's Vera Wang wedding dress, her new assistant. It was fantastical, which may have been just the point. This is a fantasy.Ultimately if you're a fan of the HBO series than you will love this, its funny, sad, frustrating and will have you cheering with some great HEA's (although I wouldn't have been able to forgive ---...again, but what a moment) 12.30.13",Sex and the City
32,davispittman,Entertaining and FABULOUS,8,1 November 2017,"Sex and the City really is a fabulously entertaining film. It's nothing that will win an Oscar or anything, but if you like the essence of Sex and the City, then you'll love this movie. The cast of course includes Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kristen Davis, and Kim Cattrall. The four go through some pretty substantial changes in their lives during this film. The moxie mainly focuses on Carries relationship with Big. But it also contains subplots like Miranda's marriage, and Samantha living in California with her beau. I have not watched the TV show yet, but I still really enjoyed the movie. I liked it because it is funny, romantic, and has some dramatic aspects too. The writing was pretty well done and I liked it, it worked for the film. Fans will not be disappointed. The costume design of course is absolutely heavenly! The fashion was always a huge part of the TV show. The shoes, the dresses, everything. The actresses had great chemistry throughout and I think Carrie and Big make a great couple, theirs is a relationship to root for during the movie. The other women and their subplots have things going on that make you root for them in end. I suggest this for a fun girls night! Of course guys can enjoy it too though. 8/10 for Sex and the City.",Sex and the City
33,rooprect,Sex and the Sellout,2,2 June 2017,"Before any of you accuse me of being a furry-legged feminist, I'm going to admit I may have furry legs, but I'm a guy. So stick that in your Bic and smoke it. I don't even know what that means.As my opening sentence might imply, I was offended by this movie because, unlike the groundbreaking TV series that spawned it, a series which didn't just flaunt girl-power but was actually a nice spin on human independence across all genders, Sex and the City the Movie is just a regurgitation of the age old Hollywood obsession with getting married as the pinnacle of human achievement. In other words, the entire plot centers around Carrie acting like a giddy (or depressed) schoolgirl consumed with nothing but the idea of marriage. Not even romance, I'm talking about just plain old walk-down-the-aisle marriage.Endless montages of wedding dress tryouts set to 80s music (not even the good stuff) are so laughably cliché, I thought for a minute I was watching the deleted scenes from Grease. The difference is that Carrie is not a beauty school dropout; we are supposed to believe (as it is repeatedly shoved in our faces) that she is a stinking rich, successful woman who ostensibly has the brains and ferocity to conquer New York City by herself, and yet when a marriage prospect enters the picture, she turns into a quivering, braindead reject from a George Romero flick.OK, but when life suddenly takes a downward turn for her, I sat up and thought: ""Ok! Now this is where her character develops a soul."" This is where the out-of-touch elite socialite comes crashing back to humanity and is forced to deal with the same problems that us regular schleps must deal with on a daily basis. Y'know, things like fixing our miserable lives by using our brains.Oh wait, she and her friends just throw money around, pay people to repair the damage and go back to shoe shopping like nothing ever happened.Are you familiar with the term ""deus ex machina""? It's a theater term from ancient Greek days meaning ""God on the machine"" and it refers to a type of conflict resolution where some twit dressed as God is lowered onto the stage on a goofy contraption so he can wave his hands and fix the entire mess. Well, here the recurring moral of the story seems to be ""Dior ex machina,"" or ""rich people don't have problems like you worthless schmucks who wallow in trivial things like... bills.""Building on that, let's take a minute to talk about how out-of-touch this movie is with social issues: the flamboyant gay stereotypes for comic relief, the use of a pit bull to denote a bad neighborhood, the token black chick introduced in the 2nd half (but note the segregated parties she attends, not the rich folk). This movie is so out of touch with real life you'd think the screenplay was a collaboration between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The amount of fur worn in this movie should speak for itself. Note: fur never looked good on anyone. Does anyone really think looking like a frickin grizzly bear hobbling down 5th Avenue is sexy? Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattral look as dopey in fur as Orson Welles in that scene in Citizen Kane, only Kane was supposed to look stupid.10'll get ya 20, this was not written or produced by the people who gave us the TV series. It was a different crew of Hollywood goofballs who beat the series into the antiquated box office formula that's been around since the Stone Age. (Yup, just checked, different people altogether).In the end, I was so thoroughly aggravated by this movie, a total corruption of the TV series which I had enjoyed but am now starting to question, that I immediately wrote a letter addressed to Hollywood stating: ""Dear Hollywood, I respectfully submit my request to punch Sex and the City. No, not just the people in it, I want to punch the entire collective entity."" Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to practice my left hook.",Sex and the City
34,EUyeshima,"Like an Old Shoean Old, Simply Fabulous Manolo Blahnik Shoe",8,14 June 2008,"I can well imagine anyone with only a passing familiarity with the 1998-2004 HBO series would be bored to tears by a big-screen adaptation that runs an epic-length 148 minutes. I suggest they trust their instincts and stay away, as this 2008 movie is for those of us who appreciated the zeitgeist the show so accurately captured during its run. Focusing on four tightly-knit female friends living the high life in Manhattan, the sitcom was often hilariously ribald. At the same time, the comedy was offset by surprising dramatic elements in tackling issues facing women at the turn of the millennium. Directed and written by Michael Patrick King, who wrote and directed several of the series' turning-point episodes, the movie picks up the quartet of women four years after the last show. Even though the time lapse had more to do with cast salary negotiations, the delay allows an enhancement to the dramatic resonance of the various story lines that a simple continuation could not.For those unaware, the focus is on Carrie Bradshaw, a Manhattan fashionista who has served as a beacon for single women as she moved from New York columnist to contributing Vogue editor. Her best friends are yearning romantic wife-and-mother Charlotte, uptight alpha-lawyer Miranda Hobbes, and lascivious talent manager Samantha Jones. Each character represents an archetype for the contemporary urban woman and has lives that tap into the psyche of its most devoted audience. The plot is expected but reassuring as all the key male characters return as well. Carrie is still seeing the elusive ""Mr. Big"" (whose name was revealed on the last show as John), and in matter-of-fact fashion, they decide to get married. Naturally, since Carrie is the defining icon of single life for her readers, her wedding explodes into a lavish affair complete with a Vivienne Westwood wedding gown. Uncertainty between the couple is the only certainty. Charlotte has already found upscale domestic bliss with her mensch of a divorce lawyer, Harry Goldenblatt, and their adopted daughter Lily.On the left coast, Samantha has miraculously sustained a five-year relationship with much-younger Smith Jerrod, a TV actor whose career she has managed to catapult with her PR savvy. Miranda is still living in Brooklyn with her puppyish bartender husband Steve and their son Brady, but marital problems lurk. King's level-setting of the various situations is blessedly brief during the first part of the movie, and it doesn't take long for all the predicaments to unfold to our rapt attention. All the women are now in their forties (with Samantha verging on fifty) and naturally look fabulous, but they also show how their lives result from choices that they sometimes look back on with understandable doubt. The only one who really doesn't look back is Charlotte, but her much-planned and sought-after happiness becomes a source of guilt and neurosis due to their sisterly bond. There wouldn't seem to be much room for any new characters, but we are presented with Louise, a vivacious girl from St. Louis who gets hired as Carrie's personal assistant.If the film does disappoint, it's probably during the middle which sags a bit, probably because King's approach to the story lines still retains the episodic nature of the series. Moreover, it's a double-edged sword when you have the same cast repeat roles they played for so long on TV. The upside is the instant familiarity, but the downside can be a lack of surprise. Luckily, the actresses fare pretty well on the latter. It honestly feels that every role Sarah Jessica Parker has played in the last decade (""The Family Stone"", ""Smart People"") comes back intractably to Carrie. There is no question that it's a great, multi-dimensional character that she explores with emotional fluency, and it's refreshing to see her lack of hesitancy in exposing Carrie's unadorned side as well. As Charlotte, Kristin Davis has some of the film's funniest lines, and her perky demeanor remains untarnished. She also has the film's defining sisterly moment when she protects Carrie at her most vulnerable. Cynthia Nixon has the most daunting task in showing the shards of insecurity within the often-embittered Miranda, and she responds with the film's sharpest performance.However, I have to say the scene-stealer remains Kim Cattrall, who has a grand time making Samantha the full embodiment of female empowerment. Samantha's valiant attempts at monogamy are hilarious, and at the same time, age has mellowed her unapologetic character. Unsurprisingly, the men are overshadowed and as characters, rather underdeveloped (by intention, I'm sure). Chris Noth somehow has to bring humanity to a mythic character with perennial cold feet, and David Eigenberg elicits true sympathy to Steve in a most affecting manner. At least Jennifer Hudson shows she has more than Effie (""Dreamgirls"") in her, though her Louise feels somewhat studied and comes across as a bit more than idealized. A review wouldn't be complete without mention of the film's costume designer Patricia Field (""The Devil Wears Prada""), who has really defined the look of this show with her audacious fashion sense. Between the clothes, the sharp one-liners, and a quartet of actresses who know their roles outside and in, this marathon candy box of a film won't disappoint fans of the series. Others should stay far, far away.",Sex and the City

They are 4 overly dressed women who come across as empty shells. Maybe there are women like that, I sure would not want to know any of them. Chris Noth also plays the same character he did on TV.

36,aharmas,Dazzling contemporary comedy,10,30 May 2008,"Finally a movie that lives up to the hype and defies expectations by taking the familiar, somehow tweaking the formula a little bit, making a very smooth and confident transition into the big screen, and giving us a hell of a great time.The film highlights the best of the series: the amazing chemistry and bond that was at the center of the successful TV series, an enterprise that was lucky to have some sharp, funny, and somewhat insightful writing about the way modern men and women handle relationships. Whereas, we would like to think that we adhere to the rules of romance, ""Sex"" clearly shattered the idea that there was a happily ever after, but it really never turned its back on the concept of hopeless romance, and how we just keep on going regardless of how tough the road can be.Carrie proved over and over that getting to the ultimate goal was never easy, as the path is peppered with insecurities and a few unexpected twists and turns. It is impossible to truly understand its logic, whether there is any, and what the gals in the story have given us is the acceptance that sometimes our emotions overrule reason, and this might not be such a bad idea, but it's something that you have to handle very carefully.Each member of this quartet bring something to the composite of the perfect women, the delicacy and conservatism of the old fashioned Charlotte, the vibrant sensuality in Samantha, the driven and cerebral Miranda, and the complicated and perceptive about everyone else but herself, Carry. They are kindred spirits and know and understand each other very well. They offer support in times of distress, yet there are times when they can also sabotage each other's happiness, as it occurs in this film.In the movie version, the story continues as Big (John) and Carry struggle to reach their long awaited bliss. At the beginning it appears as if is finally there, but things get complicated, and before you know it... everything looks pretty dismal for them, and life also throws a few curves to everyone else because we wouldn't have dilemmas, problems, and an interesting movie otherwise. In the end, we are not really sure if things are going to work out because in the series, not every ending was happy, too. Yet, all of us in the audience hope there is a happy resolution somewhere, and we wait to see if such a thing is possible in our modern contemporary world.To make the ride as enjoyable and dazzling as possible, we are given a much clearer and vivid picture of how the world of fashion is an essential part of Carry's universe. She never proclaimed to be perfect and recognizes her defects as her universe is almost perfect at the beginning of the movie. Yet there is a undercurrent of darkness and uncertainty, as we sense that Big might not be able to live up to her expectations. Yet we see their strong bonds, their enduring affection and love for each other as friends and soul mates, and we just know that unless there is divine intervention, these two people are meant for each other. In less epic proportions, we have the personal conflicts of Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha, who in the film grow up to find much better versions of themselves.So be prepared to see a dazzling display of the fashions, the admiration and love of the characters in the film for the grandiosity of a place like New Year, the sense of romance that makes the heart of this film beat stronger than the so called romantic films of the last few years. There is love in the way the production came together, in the way the characters interact with each other, the way the words of an insightful writer can see what really matters to us, as imperfect as we can be.The film will disappoint the cynics that are going in looking for its flaws instead of its assets, and the latter are way stronger that any misstep in these fantastic two hours that combine love, friendship, survival, and a reaffirming belief that in the end everything should work out, pretty much the way our hearts hope it will.",Sex and the City

Obviously if the ending was to be a wedding there would have been no story, consequently some obstacles must arise and although they seemed a bit contrived, I accepted the fact that this movie was more an appropriate way to wrap up the series than a stand alone movie.The girls are there, their boys too and some fabulous outfits and accessories. Besides, the story moves forward with some believable twist for all the girls, not just for Carrie. Who could have asked for more?I am surprised by the comments of people describing the film as ""shallow"".. I wonder if they followed the series and what exactly were they expecting....

As a fan, I wanted to follow the stories of four women in Manhattan in search for ""the two L's: Labels and Love."" The 148 minutes long movie tried to cram the stories of four friends after we said goodbye to them four years ago but it did not exactly succeed and it lacks humor and wit of the show. The jokes in the show were often on the verge of good taste but they were not as banal and vulgar as the one that made devastated and heartbroken at some point Carrie, laugh again. Having being the fan of the show since its first season did not stop me from seeing how shallow, selfish, arrogant, and often unpleasant and not interesting the foursome of single and fabulous Manhattan women in their late 30s and 40s were. Thanks to good writing and competent directing and 30 minutes per episode, the show was always fun to watch even if it was not realistic at all, more of the fairy tale with a lot of dirty talk. I think the big part of my love for it was the fact that ""Sex and the City"" has been one of the best dressed TV shows in history. Nothing is wrong with adapting the fairy tale on Manhattan to the big screen but at 148 minutes, the movie version did not make the multiple stories interesting enough. Somewhere in the middle of the movie, I simply stopped caring for the characters and concentrated on their clothes, shoes, and bags that were fabulous as always. My interest picked up again when the film introduced a new character that was missing from the show, Carrie's personal assistant Louise from St. Louis (Jennifer Hudson). Hudson was refreshingly natural, young and effortlessly beautiful, genially sweet, intelligent and practical but sadly she did not have enough of screen time. I don't regret seeing the film - that's what devoted fans are for, and I liked the ending. For good ending, I would forgive a movie many sins.

40,eric262003,A Movie That Lives Up to the Series,9,30 March 2009,"I'll do my best not to give away too much spoilers, but for those who are concerned if the movie lives up to the series, well all I can say is that ""Sex and the City: The Movie"" is an excellent movie that everyone can enjoy. Never one will it disappoint you and I guarantee you, you will leave the theater satisfied.To those who have been a fan of the series in it duration from 1998-2004 will appreciate it greatly. All the story lines, the plot and the themes are all there. From the sizzling romantic scenes, the friendship that stems between the four ladies (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davs) comes to life here just like in the series, the feeling of them just having fun to their lives, their sense of superiority towards their male counterparts, the flashy clothes, and the glamorous view of the Big Apple. Did I forgot something? Oh, yes the sex, though it was watered down just a tad. Now that these girls aren't as young as they were 11 years ago, they have decided to climb to newer, more mature heights. It was also a delight to see some recurring characters from the series appear in the movie that have made an impact on these girls' lives. Prior to watching this movie, I was reluctant to see the movie at first. This was partially due to the lambasting reviews by the critics. But after much thought the negative rap by the critics was mostly through sheer ignorance knowing that they weren't fans of the series to begin with. Other whined because it was too long, but I thought it was well timed at 2 hours and 30 minutes. But it was just like seeing some old friends you haven't seen in ages and are curious as to what they've been up to in the last few years. Years ago I wasted little time when the show came on, and I wished that I was a part of these girls' lives. These four girls were like the friends I never knew. After being absent for so many years I was hoping that a movie would reunite Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda, well my wish came true and I couldn't be much happier. It have everything going for in ""Sex and the City"" movie. And if those who think otherwise, then watch something else. I highly recommend you to this movie, rent it, watch it and you will be mesmerized. It's good to see my favorite girls again painting the town red.

Meanwhile Samantha gets used to the challenges of relationship life, Cynthia's bo cheats on her and puts their marriage in jeopardy and Charlotte gets pregnant! Guest starring Academy Award winner Jennifer Hudson and Academy Award nominee Candice Bergen.Yes it reads like the back of a Season 7 DVD packet back because Sex and the City (2008) is just that, another season of the highly celebrated HBO TV Show masquerading as a movie. That in itself, would probably be enough to entice its primary audience and to you I say kudos. Read no further, go enjoy yourselvesare they gone? Ugh. If I may be honest, I liked the four episodes of the show I watched. While I am far from the primary demographic here, I found it kind of refreshing that a show taking place in upscale New York City circa 1998 could conjure up such interesting if vapid characters. That and before Game of Thrones (2011-Present) and The L Word (2004-2009), it was a premium cable show not afraid to show some skin. Plus is it possible for a straight man to find Mario Cantone hilarious? You're darn right! But come on! Was this movie really necessary? The only fathomable reason for this useless, listless piece of chintzy trash to exist is to give anthropologists an ironic before picture of the 2008 financial meltdown. Four aging (but still fabulous, fabulous I say!) women walking around in designer clothes complaining about their dreary upper-crust life, blissfully unaware of the possible hurdles they will have to face in a few months time. If this were real New York, ground zero for the Great Recession, Carrie would be selling her Dolce Gabana pumps for a hot meal. Miranda would be divorced because finances are a bigger reason for divorce rates than fidelity and Charlotte would be on food stamps. So much for happy endings where people find sweet, sweet, love in the big city.This movie attempts to be about love but it really isn't about love at all. If it were it wouldn't have been nearly as episodic or emotionally unaffecting. No this movie is a blatant attempt to cash in on the franchise; calmly stroking the back of those still holding on to Carrie's heyday adventures as if they can live vicariously through the popular author and her sisterhood of traveling mini skirts. Oh, it would be so nice to be able to pay for two different upscale apartments in Manhattan and still have enough cash to hire a token black assistant but as the credits role did you really get any value from this movie? Anything other than the feeling of déjà vu and amnesia I got while watching Sex and the City? I really do feel as if I have forgotten this before.The movie ends in probably the best way it could have. The four girls walking into an exclusive looking club wearing top-line dresses. They sit and enjoy the eldest of the four's 50th birthday with a small cake and martinis as younger women pass by. While the sentimental and the already converted might see this scene as a blissful farewell/passing of the torch, I see it differently.

44,jaredmobarak,The last single girl  Sex and the City,5,20 August 2009,"I learn something new everyday. Here I thought the feature adaptation of the immensely popular HBO show ""Sex and the City"" was written and directed by its creator Michael Patrick King. After a little research, I come to find that King was only a producer on the show, with only 31 writing credits as opposed to the full 94 for real creator Darren Star and literary basis Candace Bushnell. Despite this, though, it would seem that King is now the driving force behind Carrie Bradshaw and friends, becoming the voice of middle-aged women everywhere. Isn't it a bit strange that a man has written these women to be as pop culture iconic as they are? Kudos to him, because Bradshaw's opening monologue to the Sex and the City movie is very appropriate—this story is about labels and love in New York City. Thankfully, that's not all its about; in the end, the tale is actually intelligently written and quite witty, causing this cynical male to laugh and smile more times than he ever could have imagined.Sarah Jessica Parker truly does embody Bradshaw to perfection. Being that it all happens through her point of view, (even when she isn't present at the event on screen, she is still the one narrating; believable I guess since this quartet tells each other EVERYTHING), it is crucial that her character lives and breathes reality. A writer of moderate success, she is happily in love with manfriend Mr. Big, (I do enjoy Chris Noth, I don't know why, never seen ""Law and Order"", his smugness just makes me smile though), and threatens to throw her whole existence out the window with the biggest business deal she's ever shook on, with him as a partner—marriage.The whole will they or won't they, stay together/break-up/get married, is actually the most conventional and boring part of the film. This storyline is the quintessential chick flick cliché and it does what it does without surprise. Spanning over a year in time, I did enjoy the six months these two lovebirds are apart, because that is when the proverbial sh*t hits the fan in all their lives. Parker shows some very nice range as the downtrodden, heartbroken waif attempting to pull herself back up and become that strong woman so many viewers idolize and hope to be. But this isn't the Carrie Bradshaw story, thankfully, because that would have been torture. It is about four women and the different places their lives are at; how they help each other; and how they balance being the women they've strived to be while still having a relationship with equally successful males. It's these stories that truly captivated me into accepting the fact that, while Sex and the City is not my genre, topic, or even sphere of consciousness of choice, it did engross me enough to be happy to have seen it.Kristin Davis is very enjoyable as Charlotte, the youngster of the bunch in her mid-thirties. With such a bubbly and childlike demeanor and attitude, her zeal for life is contagious and something I think everyone strives for. Being that her mid-movie meltdown concerns having too much good happen to her, making the ""inevitable"" fall too daunting to imagine, you can see how truly happy she is, especially with husband Evan Handler, (one of the gems in ""Californication"" and unfortunately wasted here, much like Willie Garson's Stanford who is nothing more than a prop for the background). Cynthia Nixon, on-the-other-hand, is the exact opposite. A lover of sex and promiscuity, she finds herself in a relationship with a younger male that loves her dearly, but the monogamy is too much to deal with. She isn't ready to realize that being with one man in a relationship does not mean she has become dependant on him. The need for multiple men, to be in full control, is so ingrained that she must find a love for herself—a balance with her body—before she can ever commit to someone else. How can one love if unable to love oneself? It is the age-old question and one that she needs to come to grips with soon, as she turns 50—either to accept or change.The storyline that really grabbed my attention, though, was of Miranda Hobbes, played wonderfully by Cynthia Nixon. Here is a career-driven lawyer that has compromised herself in order to make a life with husband Steve and child Brady. Whoa, I just realized the husband is Steve Brady and the son Brady Hobbes  guess you have to watch the show to understand that one. Anyways, it is their intriguing evolution as a couple that I found myself wanting to be resolved the most. Whether the two got back together, after a short separation due to his indiscretion, or not, I found myself invested in the subplot. The acting, on the part of both characters, was real and palpable. The love mixed with a loss of trust shone through and you will find yourself pulling for them in the end. Why you ask? Because this film isn't only about labels and love—just don't tell Jennifer Hudson since her Louise cares only about each—but also forgiveness.This isn't high school where grudges rule and you most likely will move on to never see any of your classmates again; this is a professional world with intelligent and capable women. Life is too messy and too short to go through it with hatred and regret. Bad things happen and you can either walk away, letting them despite what you feel, or fight tooth and nail for everything you want and deserve. Sometimes those tough patches are merely bumps in the road to true bliss, but you have to be willing to find out for sure. And that, I believe, is the real moral behind this story—happiness does come with a price, and even though it may cost a fortune, it most definitely will be worth every penny.",Sex and the City
45,khanbaliq2,The hit cable series Sex And The City catwalks its way onto the big screen.,6,2 July 2010,"Sex And The City is vulgar, shrill, deeply shallow and overlong. After four years, four female friends (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon) reunite in New York to find their love lives as complicated and eventful as ever.The film is a slickly assembled spin-off from a popular US TV sitcom that makes few concessions to the uninitiated. Awash with sentimentality and designer labels, the result is little more than a glossy advert for hedonistic materialism.

46,cultfilmfan,Sex And The City: The Movie,10,31 May 2008,"Sex And The City is based upon characters from the book of the same name by Candace Bushnell which later became a hit television series on cable TV. The film follows the friendship of four women in their early to late 40's as they deal with the different loves, or lack of in their lives and how they can always rely on food, fashion and each other when things get difficult. I' am going to start off by saying that I have never seen much of the Sex And The City television series. Basically, I have seen a few minutes of it here and there, usually late at night before watching a movie on one of the artsy channels I get with basic cable. Before seeing this film I thought the women characters were probably self indulgent, materialistic and so into themselves that it would probably be an annoyance to watch a full length movie running for more than two hours about them. Still, there was something that made me want to see this film. Perhaps it was the decent reviews it was getting, or maybe I figured that because the show was from HBO, who brought us some other really good adult television series that maybe I should just give it a try and to be honest I was in the mood for a mature adult comedy, so for all these reasons I decided to see the film. Looking at the rating I gave this film, you can easily tell that I loved it. These characters didn't annoy me at all and actually after awhile I found myself actually liking them and sort of rooting for them through their various trials and errors in relationships. I found the writing to be witty with a lot of sharp dialogue and one liners, and I also liked how the film developed the different relationships between these women as friends, but also with the loves of their life as well. Like, I mentioned earlier I was never an avid watcher of the series, but I quickly got to know these women and their lives and they seemed to be honest and true to life characters who could easily resemble well to do women in big cities like this. I also thought the way the film handled the love relationships between the different men was done in a true and realistic approach as not to sugar coat and make everything happy and smiles all around for these relationships because in reality we simply know that that is not true. Sometimes things work out for these characters and other times they don't just like the rest of the human population and I like the way the film handled that with an authenticity that made me appreciate it more because of it's honesty and being able to relate to it in certain ways. The film does have a longer running time, but I found myself enjoying it, so the time never bothered me. I 'am actually getting really sick and tired of some reviewers who complain about films going on for more than two hours. If it is a decent and thoroughly enjoyable film, then why should it matter how long the film is unless you don't like it. I've also read that many male moviegoers are trying to avoid this film like it were the plague. Let me state that I' am a male viewer and I really enjoyed this film and actually it has more laugh out loud moments than any other film I have seen this year, including the overrated Forgetting Sarah Marshall. This is the real relationship comedy of the summer and it worked for me as a male and for the females I think they'll love it just as the ones in the audience I was in loved it too. One of the year's best films so far.",Sex and the City
47,rzajac,The worst aspects without enough of the redemption of the TV show,3,24 September 2008,"For much of this movie, I felt that it showcased the worst aspects of the TV show, which at least had enough pearls of wisdom (intellectual and emotional) from time to time to offset the damage.In short, as with the TV show, the writers made a creative decision that in order to achieve the best narrative on womanhood and relationships they have to buy in to a set of (what I believe to be) genuinely venal, shallow myths.There are some redeeming moments/ideas here, but generally it didn't work as well as they made it work on the TV series. On TV, they had to make it do this at least once a show. In the movie, it can drone on and on before they get around to a bit that warms your heart and higher self.But, while you wait, you just want to throw stuff at the screen.",Sex and the City
48,fernandoschiavi,"It is a pleasant adaptation. The televison structure, and innovations and originalities are calculated in millimeters. Everything is there to please a specific audience",6,5 December 2020,"Almost 100 episodes of the TV series helped to precisely define the tastes and wants not only of Carrie, the protagonist, but of the other three women, as or more interesting as the journalist. It would really be very difficult to transpose facts and moments to the cinema in order to reach fans of the series and people who have never seen a single episode of ""Sex and the City"". The film is for those who saw Miranda change and accept married life in Brooklyn, for those who were shocked to see Samantha abandon polygamous life to embrace love, for those who followed Charlotte's drama in her first marriage and the difficulties in getting pregnant and, especially, for those who observed all the nuances of the relationship between Carrie and Mr. Big.Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is married and happy in her relationship with bartender Steve (David Eigenberg). Samantha (Kim Cattrall) moved to Hollywood to take care of the career of her boyfriend, TV star Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis). Charlotte (Kristin Davis) manages to adopt a Chinese girl, named Lily, and maintains the life she has always dreamed of. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) remains in love with John Preston, Mr. Big (Chris Noth), and plans to build a life with him. Life may well end like this, with everyone happy and ambitious about the future, but only as the last episode of a series or, perhaps, the end of the film. The reality is nothing similar and it is starting from that, from the inconstancy of humanity, that the feature film develops.
Happy, Carrie and Big decide to make official the relationship that lasted almost 10 years between breakups and reconciliations. The preparations end up taking on epic proportions, which does not contribute to John Preston's long-standing fear of commitment. Meanwhile, Miranda, constantly busy and torn between the responsibilities of work, her son, her mother-in-law and, ultimately, marriage, turns away from Steve. Sex is no longer frequent in the couple's life. Charlotte remains happy and optimistic, and Samantha, although living a peaceful reality, misses the life she left behind to follow her boyfriend.The film was written and directed by Michael Patrick King, screenwriter for several episodes of the series and also for ""Will & Grace"". The script made a beautiful summary of the series (at the time, they were between 30 and 40 years old), focusing on the post-Balzakian ""maturation"" of the four characters, the undeniable friendship between them and their respective lives. The feature film does not disappoint those who already know the TV show. All the elements that make up the success panel of Sex and the City were faithfully preserved in the first film based on the series: conflicts, love, friendship, shopping, disappointments and, above all, the loyal friendship that the four friends have for each other. These are the elements that make up the daily life of a woman who lives in a city like New York. In fact, the city, the hype of the fashion world, striking costumes (by Patricia Field, the name behind the fashionista vibe also in the series) and sex (what would be Sex and the City without sex?) Are also in the film.
The conflicts, although more dramatic than those portrayed in the TV series, remain very similar and, as the 148 minutes of projection pass, the feeling is that an entire season of ""Sex and the City"" has unfolded without breaks, without reruns. First the wedding is announced, then the great tragedy, the recovery in Mexico, the arrival of the rescuing assistant and, finally, the end of the protagonists. There are the typical jokes of the 6 years of series and the varied styles that made Sarah Jessica Parker a fashion icon. What changes from the television version to the cinema is not too much. One of the new elements is Louise, a passionate young woman hired as Carrie's assistant. The character is expendable and so is the actress. Jennifer Hudson, who won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in ""Dreamgirls"", incorporates the typical country girl who arrives in the big city to make dreams come true. Louise is boring and her participation is so fast that it doesn't make much difference in the plot.We also see the traditional shots of spectacular places in Manhattan, which make us want to board the first flight there. One or another romantic scene abandons the forced tone and makes us sigh with taste, like the one that takes place on the Brooklyn Bridge. John Thomas's photography and Ed Check's art direction, both indoors and showing New York and Mexico, are impeccable, as well as the soundtrack that shows from classics like Run DMC's ""Walk this way"" and new ones like ""All Dressed in Love"", by Jennifer Hudson, written for the film. The instrumental score of Dean Landon and Aaron Zigman also knows how to move and make you laugh when necessary.
But the main attraction is also the element that the series had most charming, and that remains safe in the film: the portrait of friendship between women, almost always so fragile. It is impossible not to be wrapped in some scenes that make us think of our own friends and how life would be impossible without them.
The series Sex and the City has always been considered feminist. The problem is the boutique feminism propagated in the film. Under the pretext of reaffirming the independence of contemporary women (nothing against it, by the way), a plot against the male is formed, ready to stand up to any ""injustice"" committed by men - wanting to have sex at least once every six months after getting married, for example, or giving her partner a very expensive jewel that she adores, but wanted to buy earlier. This is what happens in the film. There would be no film, however, if there were no conflicts, which here are essentially due to the lack of communication between them and them. Miranda steps on Steve because he, sorry, confessed to having jumped the fence once (the lack of bed at home, of course, doesn't even come into the discussion). Samantha is irritated by her boyfriend's delay on the day she prepares an erotic sushi, but when he wants to ""discuss the relationship"", it is she who turns to the side and sleeps. Carrie asks Mr. Big to marry him as if he were ordering pizza - or discussing a real estate deal - and then he can't settle for the groom's lack of excitement when planning preparations for the ""big day"". The girls' lack of willingness to hear the ""other side"", whether by humiliating the ex by screaming when he tries to apologize, or by throwing his cell phone into the sea so as not to hear messages, is primarily responsible for the misunderstandings that make the film. walking forward - or sideways - for more than two hours.
Even the scene time of each of the male characters is minimal compared to female supremacy throughout history. After all, what do they have to say that will change their minds, right? Or even: if it is to appear, then be Samantha's new neighbor who has the habit of walking around the house naked, having sex with a different woman every day ... What none of the decided heroines of ""Sex and the city ""confesses, but that ends up being clear in the conservative"" happy ending ""chosen for the story, is that in the end everyone wants to be Charlotte. Considered the most straightforward, funny and wife of the ugliest of the series' bugs, the character is the only one who can say that she is happy in her married life.Even with the aspect discussed above, it is undeniable that the plot manages to balance the parallel stories of each of the protagonists very well and manages to interweave them in a very competent way. The arrival of Sex and the City in theaters is much more than just a premiere - it's a real event! This film is, in fact, one of the greatest propaganda pieces of recent times - the number of marks displayed on the screen is impressive! The fashion side of the series is recovered with all its strength in this transposition, and the dazzle is inevitable: the world of these women is as unreal as it is attractive, and there will be few who will not spend the entire projection sighing for a little of that universe. If, as a trendsetter, the film works perfectly, as a film object it leaves a little to be desired. The televison structure, and innovations and originalities are as scarce as they are calculated in millimeters. Everything is there to please a specific audience, and it does so with an enviable aim.While filling the need for orphans from the series, which ended four years ago, Sex and the City also has the ability to win over a few more fans. That's because, regardless of whether it originated from a TV show, the film has the strength to walk on its own legs. Mainly by showing, with unique humor and cynicism, the way women today relate not only to the opposite sex, but to life in general.",Sex and the City
49,Rogue-32,Sushi never looked so good,8,31 May 2008,"Cheers to writer/director Michael Patrick King and all concerned, for bringing this project, initiated by Sarah Jessica Parker years ago, to decent fruition. While Sex and The City: The Movie is not a perfect film, it manages to cleverly pick up (a few years later) where the brilliant cable TV series left off.Taking a TV series - especially a seriously beloved one - and trying to turn it into a full-length feature is no easy task. Imagine, for instance, Curb Your Enthusiasm: The Movie (could possibly work, considering how clever Larry David is), Weeds: Fully Grown (love Mary Louise but this could be tricky), or, say, Californication: The X Rated Files (God forbid). Movies are different than TV shows, which people watch in weekly installments, at home, on their couches, where a different, more intimate kind of connection to the characters can be made. Translating this sort of personal thing to the big screen without sacrificing the underlying tone would be extremely difficult, but as I say, they pulled it off, and I was left still wanting more.The screenplay, for the most part, is fantastic. All four of the women have their own storyline, the most fun one being, of course, Samantha's. She has the best lines overall, too, superbly delivered, and the sushi scene is funny and sexy, with Catrall pulling it off in the classiest way possible. Jennifer Hudson fares extremely well as Carrie's wonderfully capable assistant, and NO, she is not a 'glorified maid', as some of the film's naysayers have suggested. The best element of the writing though, is the very clever way Chris Noth's character, John Preston, aka Mr. Big, is brought back into the story towards the end. This could have been handled in a contrived manner, but thanks to King's supremely thoughtful and creative sensibility, it's not. Everything flows smoothly in this movie, actually, which was one of the best things about the TV series - the writing was never forced, it had a breezy, light feel to it, always, and the movie, even with its sad undercurrent, still manages to achieve this.",Sex and the City
50,Danusha_Goska,"Enjoy It For What It Is, And Don't Expect Too Much",5,2 June 2008,"I don't know why ""Sex and the City"" got such bad reviews. I thought it was an okay movie, if you are in the mood to watch four, exceptionally fit, 40-50 something women parade around in outlandish fashions, and suffer and wisecrack through contrived relationship problems. The clothes are a scream, the relationship issues include possible divorce / break-up, pregnancy, and marriage. Solutions to relationship problems include a dream vacation at a five-star Mexican seaside resort.The movie is too long, and it is shallow, and the male characters all seem more like Ken dolls than real men, but those aren't fatal flaws. Maybe people didn't like it because it wasn't enough like, or it was too much like, the TV series. Moving a TV show to the big screen is hazardous. Whatever.

However, I found that the spark of the series had gone, and there were more dresses and less depth. I think the movie it is a bit too long, but there are still glimpses of the old brilliant scripts.Regarding the acting, the girls are still believable in their respective roles. However, Chris North (Mr Big), is just terrible. I mean, he has never been a good actor, but he's specially uninspired and inexpressive in this movie; he wasn't even on shape!This is, definitely, a chick flick. Not only that, this is a movie for chicks who loved the series, because, if you did, you have a background of several years to understand the characters, how they act and what drives them. So you don't need anything to be explained further, or the characters to have more of this or less than that. If you have never watched the series, the movie will not interest you, as it will look as a too superficial and poorly drawn story.To put it in a another words.

53,doctorsmoothlove,"Dude, where's my sympathy?",4,22 June 2008,"So far 2008 has been the year of risk-taking in Hollywood. Fledgling Marvel Studios released its debut film Iron Man, which has received much deserved praise. Paramount released a long-awaited Indiana Jones sequel, and now New Line has released Sex and the City. Well, OK, releasing a movie on a multi award-winning TV show may not seem too risky. It was a profitable decision by New Line and Michael King, but the film isn't very good. If anything, it will confirm the stereotypes that non-viewers of the show have about it. Of the many shortcomings Sex and the City has on its big-screen debut, the most damaging is its lack of a coherent plot. The entire movie is one episodic event after another one. This is caused by the film's portrayal of numerous courtships, none of which is appears genuine. While even the most bizarre romance films follow the basic formula of the genre (lovers meet, are separated, and reunited), most (at least the memorable ones) convince us that the couple deserves each other. Sex and the City tries to do this with not one couple, but three. While Carrie, Miranda, and newcomer Louise all meet Prince Charming, none of them has sufficient screen time to develop their romances. OK, I'll admit that Big and Carrie's interaction is probably obvious to fans as is Miranda's and Steve's, but Louise and her hunk have no excuse for the pitiful portrayal of their romance. Most of their interaction consists of glances and occasional playful looks. Few words are exchanged, and those that are do nothing in precipitating their marriage. All of these problems are magnified given the film's long but not-long-enough running time. A new season could have built the characters convincingly, but a two and a half hour film cannot. A movie should not have to rely on its audience's knowledge of its source material, as this one does. And, (don't gasp), King includes two joke characters to lessen the difficulty of watching the three relationships unfold. Samantha and Charlotte serve this purpose, the former having the most presence. Samantha's purpose is to poke fun at the sexual deviancy and consumerist portions of wealthy female culture while inserting supportive dialog when needed. Charlotte is a foil to the other women, being the only one married the entire film, oh and she poops her pants. No, I'm not joking, there is a poop joke in Sex and the City. And before you ask, it is nothing like Caddyshack. While neither humor character (nor her gags) directly detracts from the plot, her absence would have allowed the three couples to develop their romances. ""Surely not all aspects of the film are forgettable,"" I hear you ask. And, I answer with a resounding ""No"". There is a reason for non- fans to watch the movie. It's emotional, tugs your heartstrings, etc. But, it's a different approach to this genre-necessity. The movie relies on one's personal experience with the events happening to the characters. Carrie's wedding disaster is quite effective and made me cringe, as well as wet the cheeks of the women in the audience. I felt bad for Carrie not because of her anything she specifically did, but because I pity any woman who is stood-up on her wedding day. This is a common documentary approach and is effective when the film only wishes to communicate knowledge or inform us of an issue. Nevertheless, this appeal doesn't work with this film. Why does Carrie have to have the failed wedding? It could have happened to anyone else, given her lack of character development. However, the movie displays the bumps in female relationships more realistically than other recent films (see Miranda's angst with revealing her secret about Big's refusal to marry). It's one of the only sequences in the entire film that has enough screen time to develop. As you would expect, the script is also lacking in anything memorable. You won't quote Miranda as she tears apart Steve (though this scene is successfully emotional unlike Carrie's). Again, a poor script doesn't bury a movie, but the witty dialog the show had (I presume) is clearly missing. Ironically, noteworthy moments do occur during the numerous product placement scenes. The designer labels, Apple computer, or Starbuck's coffee is placed in the middle of the frame for all to see. While thinking about my own reaction to the film's emotional sequences and after reading other reviews, I resolved to give the film an average review. Since half of the world seems to have seen the series, they will love it. If you remember the Pokémon craze of last decade, and the rabid devotion its fans had to the sub-par movies it produced, you've arrived at Sex and the City. While infinitely more entertaining, this film doesn't offer anything to unfamiliar viewers. It's a get-together film that lets some of us see our old friends, no matter how ineffectual they've become. For those wanting a female buddy movie, try Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, it succeeds in the ways this film attempts but fails.",Sex and the City

57,diac228,"There isn't much sex in this city, but enough hilarity and drama to entertain the fans",8,2 June 2008,"With colorful costumes that scream expensive, quirky one-liners, realistic dialogue, great acting, great writing, controversial decisions, plenty of twists, exotic locations, and a heavy flavor of the New York lifestyle, Sex and the City The Movie plays out like 5 episodes of the massive hit television show, with 4 of the 5 episodes being superb, and the 5th being a bit on the iffy side. Fans of the television show will definitely not be disappointed, as the movie doesn't pull any punches, and in wonderful fashion (no pun intended) mixes comedy and drama. Unlike recent summer flicks that deviate far from a winning formula (Indy), Sex and the City stays close to the energy and the magic of the show. If you didn't like the magic before, then there is absolutely no reason for you to come within thirteen yards of the screening.The movie is just like the show in the fact that its four plots running together and meshing from time to time. We follow Carrie (who is getting married to Mr. Big), Samantha (who is having trouble being happy in paradise), Miranda (who is having trouble in her marriage), and Charlotte (who is finally getting her happy ending). New York is definitely the fifth main character in the movie like the show, because it enhances the film to an extra degree. There's just something about this city that can appeal to the masses; from the residents to the tourists to the dreamers. One can argue that the success of Friends and Seinfeld can be attributed partially to the setting, where anything can and does happen.The main focus however is on the marriage of Carrie and Mr. Big, which raises complications because Mr. Big's reclusive, secretive ways. I do not want to really mention anything else, its better for you to see the events unfold by themselves. Carrie is a woman whose dreams were so close to coming true she doesn't realize the trouble brewing. Miranda's sarcastic ways doesn't miss a beat, but may hurt more than entertain others. Charlotte's optimistic and extremely bubbly ways deliver some of the best laughs in the entire movie. Last but not least, the biggest transformation is Samantha, whose frank sex lines pull off major laughs yet at the same time we also see her losing sight of who she is. The major irony is that the shallowest of the main four characters goes through the deepest transformation. You'll have some shockers, unexpected hilarity, and uncertainty as to how it will all end. Predictable, this movie is not--except for the final act, but this occurs only because of faith the fans have in their characters.One of the strongest writing staffs in the history of television could be found in Sex and the City. This time, its just one writer weaving the tale. Michael Patrick King, one of the better writers and directors of the show, directed this gem with plenty of content and material to keep the viewers entertained for a long period of time, even if the running time extends that of beyond the norm. The product placement was a bit much, but the fans of the show have a profound love of the higher lifestyle, and King delivers this with extended scenes of expensive fashion and crazy fashion shows. Even Carrie sometimes notices the outlandish ways of her fashion (""I was wearing a bird"").The acting was for the most part good, with Kristin Davis and Kim Cattrall being the standout performances. Kristin Davis more often then usual pretty much grabs and steals every scene she is in; her anime eyes would have been perfect for Speed Racer. Jennifer Hudson's appearance was decent, even if short-lived and cameo-like. The men are underused, but each do a good job with the material they are presented. Chris Noth has the toughest job; remaining admirable even when he messes up badly throughout the show and in here is no different. You can sense his love for Carrie even when he doesn't say a word.Anti-Man seems to be the theme in the movie for the first two acts, since almost all the men are just frustrating to watch simply because of how badly they hurt our beloved ladies. Then the final act discusses forgiveness. So, with this in mind, most of the characters run through decisions that may alienate some viewers, and may cause discussions. Can you really forgive after certain actions? How long is it before you can move on? How can you tell the same action won't happen again? How can one prove that they are truly sorry besides just saying""I'm sorry?"" Many questions are explored, but few are ever answered, leading to more debates about fate, love, and destiny. While the questions fly, the ending appears, feeling rather rushed. Hence, this is why the first 4 of the 5 ""episodes"" were good, but the final ""episode"" was ho-hum. The movie shows the light at the end of the tunnel, but doesn't clear all the congestion.Bottom Line: Despite the last stretch, the path to the end of the tunnel was a nice one, full of humorous moments and realistic drama and situations that most in the audience can relate to. As a matter of fact, the only thing unrealistic about the movie is the ridiculous amount of money they can spend on everything. I guess it does pay to not own a vehicle. With that being said, as long as you enjoyed the show, you'll get a kick out of the movie, despite the questionable ending. The clever dialogue is back, the frisk comedy returns, and the quest for love and eternal sunshine in a cloudy city rages on. Sex and the City: The Movie: Not in the nearly perfect form of the television show, but delivers to the major fans nonetheless.Fabulous.",Sex and the City
58,johnnymacbest,"Nothing more than an extension of a canceled TV series filled with product placement, stiff-neck acting, and a brainless plot.",2,1 June 2008,"OK, ask yourself this: If you enjoyed the TV series and are already a hard-core fan of said series, do you really think it WAS REALLY NECESSARY TO MAKE A SATC MOVIE?!?!?! Of course not and I'll tell you why. 1. They waited too long to direct, produce, and film this movie. 2. It should've been made-for-TV in the first place (the recent Andromeda Strain a good example). 3 it was marketed poorly and the fact that it was certainly says a lot about the film as a whole. And four, it's target audience was FOR THE FANS!!! How casual moviegoers will take this is beyond me but I strongly think and certainly hope this will go down in the Bottom 28 right here at good 'ol IMDb. And its filled with product placement, LOTS OF IT, with the usual suspects of women's fashion and accessories, stiff-neck, lifeless writing and dialog, and a airhead plot with such one-dimensional characters and hammy romance that will make ""Showgirls"" blush with envy. This film was way too hyped up than it should be and despite having millions of dollars spent on its promotion, I think the fact that Sarah Jessica Parker's upcoming interview on 2020 after the premier starkly proves it right. Some even have the gall to claim that this ""Desperate Housewives on crack"" will oust Indy 4 from its #1 spot at the box office. I strongly doubt THAT would happen. Case in point that as the curtains go down, so goes the participants in this epitome of mediocre waste of celluloid that is the void between gods and men.

A very solid conclusion to the series, even better than the original series finale, until that dreadful sequel that should never be mentioned. If you watched the series, this is a must see.",Sex and the City
62,gregeichelberger,"Fans will mostly like this adaptation, others ...",4,2 June 2008,"Shame on this film; shame on ""Sex and the City."" I say this not as a fan of the show (I watched very few episodes), or as a male, or even as a person with a few morals up his sleeve. I say this as a film critic and one who has seen his fair share of poor writing/directing/and acting in the past 20 years. I place this pox upon this big screen version of the HBO series about four career women in New York City for one reason. The movie takes several key, emotional, heart-tugging moments, and then flushes them right down the toilet. One of these features a silly, but warm reunion and the next scene features the two principals engaged in anal sex. Hey, I'm no prude, but why the director (Michael Patrick King, who helmed most of the TV show's episodes) saw fit to totally throw up on this moment is beyond me. It's also beyond forgiveness in my book. The film, also like the four female characters it features, doesn't know when to shut up. There were at least three perfect times it could have ended, but no, it goes on and on and on - for a total of almost two hours and 30 minutes (it's ""Reign Over Me"" without the laughs). Then there is the unending fashion and shoe references. The girls never wear the same outfit twice, so they must spend literally thousands of dollars on just clothing and footwear in and of itself - not the best message of frugality in this economy (but I digress). I was also not too fond of the fart jokes, a sexually hyperactive dog and the stock over-the-top gay couple, but I could live with these, as well. Okay, with those things being said, I will give the movie credit for a) bringing everything up-to-date from when the show ended in 2004; and b) expanding the characters (newspaper columnist Carrie - Sarah Jessica Parker; uptight lawyer Miranda - Cynthia Nixon; nice but dim bulb Charlotte - Kristin Davis; and aging slut Samantha - Kim Cattrall). We now find out that Carrie is a best-selling author and plans to marry longtime beau, ""Big"" (Chris Noth, ""Law & Order""); Miranda is married to Steve (David Eigenberg); Charlotte is wedded to the spineless Harry (Evan Handler); and Samantha is giving monogamy a shot by living with Hollywood hunk, Jerry (Jason Lewis). Of course, the men take the back seat here, being portrayed as sex objects or generally sleazy, cowardly, stupid or emasculated goofballs (especially the idiotic Harry). But that's okay. I have no problem in Hollywood turning the tables on cultural mores. After all, women have been basically divided neatly into the virgin/whore category for decades. What's fair for the goose ... My beef is the execution here. On the small screen, the girls sitting around talking about the men/jobs/clothes/shoes in their lives was fine for 30 minutes, but now King has to fill much more time in a feature, and there is so much sitting around talking one person can watch (my mind wanders back to the abysmal second half of ""Grindhouse"" - I guess what this movie really needed was more Kurt Russell ... ). To compensate for that, King throws in the obligatory fashion show, a Vogue magazine photo shoot and the aforementioned graphic sexual sequences. Also, to make the lily white cast of the show a bit more tolerant and politically-correct, Charlotte and Harry adopt a little Chinese girl (who appears in every other scene and utters only one word, ""sex,"" - it figures) and Carrie hires a black woman (Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson) as her assistant. But, as I've written previously, any powerful emotional parts of this picture were trampled over by the director's need to include soft-core porn and fear of ending the picture. We get at least a season and-a-half worth of episodes here, where just a few were necessary. Still, fans of the show (the vast majority being female) will no doubt push this to the top of the the box office charts, dropping Indiana Jones to the runner-up position.If fact, for many ladies, this is not just a film, it's a event, with parties, dinners and other affairs surrounding the viewing of this movie. That's wonderful, but to this poor, illiterate and unenlightened man, however, it could have been better - so much better.",Sex and the City
63,brefane,The long goodbye.,3,31 May 2008,"Fans of the show will be happy to see the ladies from the HBO series unite once again, but really it would have been better for all concerned if they hadn't bothered because this plot less and pointless big screen rehash diminishes the series. The transfer to the big screen at 2hrs and 25mins exposes the hollowness of the characters that the breezy 1/2 hour episodes concealed, and the film is truly 40 minutes too long. And while the ladies and the world have changed in the ten years since the series began, the movie barely acknowledges this fact. Yes, Jennifer Hudson is on board to demonstrate cultural diversity, but the character is unnecessary. SATC:The Movie appeases its target audience with fashion montages, male nudity, spacious closets, and American Pie humor for giddy schoolgirls. The men are upstaged by the Louis Vuitton bags and Mr. Big is passive and colorless. The director's inexperience in the medium is palpable, and the movie feels like 5 episodes of the series drained of blood, and played back to back. The movie isn't very funny; it lacks true wit and polish, and some of what the script thinks is funny, is embarrassing, and apparently SATC2 is all of the above and worse, so I'll finish the franchise with this limp vehicle. All of the 4 leads have their moments, the girls still have the same chemistry that made the series popular, and as on the series, Cattrall's Samantha is still my favorite.",Sex and the City

65,jemps918,Unabashedly frothy and nostalgic,7,28 May 2008,"Unabashedly frothyat two and a half hours, Sex and the City: The Movie almost wore out its welcome. Good thing the girls have enough nostalgic equity to keep the chicks glued to this flick.Since none of my galpals were available, I saw SATC alone at the soonest possible time (I wanted to have my own opinion on it before reading the reviews). True enough, the theater was filled with girls sitting in packs and gay guy couples; lots of favorable reactions to the sparsely scattered witticisms and dramatic scenes (as if they were watching in their living rooms!). It was just v. annoying that several scenes were cut, despite the R-rating.For someone who's turning 52, Kim Catrall (whose character Samantha turns 50 in the movie) is still v. hot! Cynthia Nixon (Miranda) is 42 but she seems older, while Kristin Davis (Charlotte) is 43 but looks the youngest of them all. Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie) is 43 and she definitely looks it. Too scrawny-muscular, it was gross to see her wearing clothes that weren't age-appropriate; rather, those that showed her horrible upper arms and scary thighs. Her earnest acting and the emotional bank account her character has with the audience saved her from becoming too maudlin.Age has been kinder on the guys. Jason Lewis (Smith Jerrod) is still incredibly gorgeous, and Chris Noth (Big) still looks like that strutting cartoon rooster Foghorn Leghorn but an improved version. David Eigenberg (Steve) is still the weak but likable twit, while Evan Handler (Harry Goldenblatt) was content to be a useful prop.Jennifer Hudson as Carrie's personal assistant Louise is like a two-in-one that-takes-care-of-it casting decision of representing both blacks and plus-sized women in the foursome's world. At least her character was not super stereotypical.Directed, written and produced by Michael Patrick King, everyone's beloved SATC was released to great anticipation and delivered when it came to the couture (it spanned a year perhaps to showcase all fashion seasons). While it will not be able to please everyone who has emotional attachments to their preferred characters and story lines, the girls still had a few clever lines to share for the females who still care.",Sex and the City
66,joemamaohio,My Review,6,19 September 2008,"The girls are back and better than ever. Ten years after the series began, and four years after it ended, ""Sex and the City"" has hit the big screen.Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) is eagerly anticipating her new life and getting married to the love of her life, Mr. Big (Chris Noth). Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is in Los Angeles overseeing the career of her boytoy. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is happily married with a young son. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is also happily married with an adopted daughter.Of course, things don't go well for long. Soon the girls find themselves thrust into the worst luck anyone could possibly have - let alone four people at the same time - and they learn a lesson about forgiveness and the power of friendship.I've never watched the series, and my co-worker (who is totally obsessed with the show) wanted me to watch the movie, so I figured, why the heck not. And, to my surprise, I actually somewhat enjoyed it. Sure, it's nothing but fluffy sappy romance and a totally cheesy premise, but it was still genuinely funny and heartwarming, and it shows that, even though the years take people different places, true friendship can still survive.",Sex and the City
67,BumpyRide,Bring on the Cosmos!,8,2 June 2008,"This movie is a worthy follow up that should leave the fans of the show very happy and satisfied. There are many touching moments where you are literally crying one moment and laughing the next. The chemistry, and the majority of the entire cast of the show are all here. The story line drags at times, for me it was every Jennifer Hudson scene. She's new and takes up valuable screen time where we'd rather be hanging out with the foursome drinking cosmos and hearing about their problems.For a reviewer who said this movie was degrading and would be concerned if there teen daughter went to this move...I'd be concerned because the movie is rated R. In other words, adults only and for a reason.The group I went with totally enjoyed the movie and exceeded our expectations. It was as if the show never ended.",Sex and the City
68,swordsnare,'Drama' for Box-Office Sake.,3,18 April 2021,"The series had some finality to it, leaving it on a positive note. This on the other hand had to drum some unnecessary 'drama' for the sake of a box office release. Completely unnecessary.",Sex and the City
69,moutonbear25,The Big City,8,30 May 2008,"It's important to state right away that I am a devout fan of the ""Sex and the City"" television series. I have seen the episodes countless times and they still tickle me almost as often as they touch me. Clearly, what you're going to get out of the SEX AND THE CITY movie depends on what you're going in with. For anyone who cares as much as I did, and there are more than enough in my boat to sink it, these girls have been sorely missed. It has been four years since the boy who called love, Mr. Big (Chris Noth) found a crumbling Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) in Paris and told her finally that she was the one. Subsequently, it has been just as much time since Carrie foolishly believed him capable of feeling such things and forewent all her single sensibility for a crapshoot she called love. (It figures the one part of the series I would not like would be its conclusion). Who cares though? I still want more. When the lights went down and the sounds of that familiar theme began to rise (albeit just as a sample in some overwrought Fergie song), my romantic heart sped up just a little and an inevitable smile took over my face. But as the credits gave way to a recap of the characters' arcs whittled down to their barest bones, I couldn't help but wonder, who does director, Michael Patrick King think is seeing this movie that doesn't already know all of this as well as the fit of their favorite shoes?If you were not a fan of the series, this film will do nothing for you but remind you why. If you were a fan, you may feel some varying degree of disappointment but you'll still likely see it and love it more than once. How could you not? I was mildly disappointed and I still cried at least three times. I missed these girls. They kept me company on so many restless nights. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) taught me how to let go of life long enough to let love in. Charlotte (Kristen Davis) taught me that you might not recognize love when it finally comes to you. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) taught me that old habits eventually need to be left behind if your life is ever to become what it could. And Carrie  oh, Carrie. Carrie taught me about the constant struggle to find happiness in yourself and your own life regardless of whether you're fortunate enough to be sharing that with another person. So often did her poetic musings give me calm and resolve that the show became a necessary fix whenever I lost hope that love still knew where to find me. Though the ladies may mean different things to different people, the need for the SEX AND THE CITY movie is palpable within its devoted fan base. The movie itself however creates none of its own urgency and does little to justify its own existence. Yes, I wanted the girls back but it would have been nice if they came back for a reason. Without divulging too much (as I believe the fate for spoiling this film is castration), the good times pick up again four years after we last left the streets of New York City. Miranda's busy married life with Steve (David Eigenberg) has gotten stagnant; Charlotte lives in bliss with her husband Harry (Evan Handler) and their adopted girl, Lily; Samantha has made a life of monogamy and management with her young stud, Smith (Jason Lewis)in Los Angeles; and Carrie has somehow managed to domesticate Mr. Big, now known as John James Preston. It would even seem that they are headed toward wedded bliss. The big day comes though with expected big disasters and Carrie gets exactly what she should have seen coming all along. As I was never happy that the quintessential single girl settled for a man who hurt her repeatedly and consistently, it was hard to feel satisfied watching her make the same mistakes on the big screen. On such a grand stage, I wanted to see Carrie blossom into the true state of confidence and individuality that her character was destined to, if only just to remind myself that I have that same capacity. Instead, her small screen magnificence only half fills the new digs and left me feeling rushed and unfinished instead of post-orgasm elation. And with the last round of cosmos now behind us, I got my much needed fix but I can't tell whether SEX AND THE CITY (the movie) will keep the love flowing far into the future or finally put SEX AND THE CITY (the phenomenon) to rest.",Sex and the City

I was kind of young when the show first aired, so I liked the title, and I remember thinking Kim Catrall and Kirsten Davis were hot. What the hell happened to them??

74,vip-danii,8 Years Later...,7,14 November 2016,"I saw the movie when it first came out, and thought it was great. Now, however, having re-watched it, I see many a flaw.First of all, Carrie, who has always been a bit of a drama queen and is a life-long over-reactor, is worse than ever in this movie. She is also more selfish than ever. To be honest, I really don't blame Big for not wanting to marry her. To top it off, she blames Miranda for ""ruining her marriage"". The cheek! The way she goes on and on for months like it's the end of the world... it's pathetic.And they could've come up with something other than ""baby, turn around, let me see you"" - that was corny as hell and made Big look like a big crybaby.I see that a lot of people have a problem with Jennifer Hudson's performance... Weird, because I didn't see anything wrong with it. If anything, to me, she was the most ""normal"" (as in ""natural"") person in the movie. It's one thing that her lines were somewhat lame, but there was nothing wrong with her acting.I have always had issues with that Italian gay dude (Charlotte's wedding planner turned BFF). What an obnoxious f***wit; not to mention one of the lousiest actors ever. That guy was annoying in the sitcom, and totally crossed the line in this movie. I'm sure the movie would've actually been much better without his presence.Miranda and Steve... urgh, when did Miranda become so moody, illogical, and emotional? We already have one drama queen (Carrie); there was no need to turn Miranda into one.Charlotte, my least favourite character, was worse than ever here. Kristin Davis's over-acting has been hard to endure throughout the series, but now she's really crossed the line. She was beyond annoying in this movie. Her character is supposed to be cute, funny, and somewhat naive, but, sadly, Kristin Davis totally fails to capture the essence of Charlotte and end up being nothing more than just utterly annoying. It's no wonder she's friends with that obnoxious Italian dwarf - they're both equally bad (at pretty much everything, including acting). And it doesn't help that she drags that Mandarin kid everywhere she goes; I was surprised she didn't pack her to Mexico. Annoying, annoying, annoying. Everything about Charlotte was annoying in this movie.Samantha was the only one I wasn't disappointed with, although I didn't ""get"" the weight-gain sub-plot. I didn't see any extra weight on her at all, and I thought the way the girls were mocking her for this supposed weight-gain was totally ridiculous. She was fabulous, as always.All in all, not a bad movie, but a lot of things were overly exaggerated and over-dramatized, which just made the characters' annoying traits appear worse than they were supposed to be.",Sex and the City
75,Golden_Hope,Nice for Fans But Not Great,5,28 May 2020,"It has been a while since I watched the original series so when the movie started I found it cute and nice seeing these characters that I liked back together again.And there interactions at the start are the movie keep it entertaining but when you head into the plot that's where things come off the rails.I don't understand the plot and I think that is an issue. I won't go into spoilers but it just seems so strange that they decided that this is what they would do.I also find that this movie doesn't work as these characters have already reached their original ending if you get what I mean.Charlotte has a baby, Carrie and Big are together, Miranda has her family and Samantha sound someone she could be with. This all happens at the end of the show because that is the end of the story for these characters. This can sometimes seem forced for lack of a better word.The jokes are also very 90s cheesy sitcom jokes too.

This scene seemed dramatic and had some emotional impact.Otherwise, the characters did not seem real to me and Samantha, in particular, seemed to be somehow reminiscent of a sex-addicted gay male from the 70s. That said: At the insistence of my gay male friend who said I would ""love it"" and ""had to see it."" So, I watched.The four leads are the luckiest women on earth. They all have money to blow, lots of free time to talk about ""feelings,"" tons of opportunities to decide if they're ""happy"" and apparently lifetimes to relive their adolescent fantasies. I did not have an emotional connection to any of them; how could anybody? They were one- dimensional paper-dolls cut out of a gay man's fantasy world of single women with money who have nothing to do but search for Mr. Right in NYC. There was one line in the movie that resonated with some authority. At some point after the disastrous wedding that doesn't happen, Carrie says, ""After 10 years, he couldn't get out of the car?"" That kind of summed up to me what ""Mr. Big"" was about. It was so pathetic to think that he was sitting in a car, ""afraid"" to get out of it, calling Carrie on her cell phone, desperately seeking some kind of ""Everything will be okay"" message. These are adults? What really bothered me about the film was the half-ass way that Carrie and Big decide to get married. They decided it as if they were deciding what movie to rent from Netflix. ""Yeah, okay, maybe, if you want, sure, I suppose, okay, yeah."" This is an agreement to get married? Who cares about these people? Later, after Miranda, in a moment of anger over her cheated-once husband, tells Big ""You're crazy to get married. Marriage ruins everything,"" Big decides at that moment, ""Yup, she's right. I won't go through with this because Miranda said it ruins everything."" This is a ""financier"" who has to make hardcore decisions and yet is incapable of blowing off her angry comment as anything but that? He lets it dictate his life? Next: Why was Jennifer Hudson in this movie as Carrie's assistant? To bring in ""the black audience""? It was interesting to note that during the interview process the people who came before her were two white women, one who ""wouldn't lift boxes,"" and the other, clearly drunk, who was forced to use the word ""motherf*****"" as part of a joke, not to mention having an Asian man, in a business suit, wearing pink shoes. (Dear Producers: Your point?) So when Jennifer came along, she was a breath of fresh air, yes, but then... that made her the only choice in all of NYC to be Carrie's assistant? Okay, she was the best choice; but, no matter how the filmmakers tried to portray her, she still came off as slave girl to rich white woman. It was very degrading to think that Jennifer, who has real warmth and womanliness, unlike the four self-absorbed white wing nuts that power this movie, was used as Mammy to Carrie's Scarlett O'Hara. Everyone involved in this choice should be ashamed. I noticed near the end when Carrie moved back in to her totally redone apartment that at the party there was one black woman that was caught in the viewfinder. Wow. Jennifer and another black woman. In SATC. How generous.The worst offender was ""Anthony."" Are we supposed to think this man funny? When Samantha joins the girls after Carrie has retaken her old pad, she arrives looking a little chunky, accentuated by her stupid teenager mid-riff baring tank top. Okay, but that's her choice, right? To which Anthony says, at the top of his lungs, ""What's with the gut?"" This is the type of self-hating, cruel queen that derides and criticizes everybody and everything. He can only survive by the viciousness of his tongue, like Joan Rivers does. The whole idea that Stanford, who I guess had a more prominent part on the series (but in the movie has about two lines) would actually kiss this freak is beyond comprehension. (And kiss him in the most pathetic way, with both men looking around to make sure ""no one is looking."" What a sad comment on the filmmakers' view of their gay audience.)To put a rotten cherry on a melting sundae, when the girls go to Mexico for what would have been Carrie's honeymoon (right: Miranda has a job and a child, which she keeps on pointing out, but apparently neither has any meaning when a ticket to a ""5-star"" resort is waved in front of her face): Charlotte will only eat some kind of kosher pudding, because, well, you know, ""It's Mexico!"" (she whispers to the others as if, you know, they'll ""understand"" what she ""means"")--and then, when she accidentally opens her mouth while taking a shower, she of course gets Montezuma's Revenge (Whoopee! Justice at last!)--and then she actually sh*ts in her pants -- this is adult humor? This is what brings Carrie out of her depression?All in all, this movie is an insult on about every level I can think of. There were about five laugh-out loud lines, but in 2:24 of screen time, that ain't gonna do the trick -- and it didn't. And as I can see, even hardcore fans didn't like it, so I will feel quite good about returning this DVD to my friend and saying, ""It stunk.""",Sex and the City
78,lois-lane33,You can't polish a t**d.,3,4 October 2014,"Was something that Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones liked to say about stuff he didn't like. I agree with him. I think the show SATC was basically a witless t**d of a show in that there was no filtering anything and they actually used the F-bomb in episode titles. I think Kristen Davies is good looking and smart and could have done a lot better than this dumb show that confuses being intelligent with being gross. Kim Cattrall's fist claim to fame was getting loudly screwed in a film about High School under some seats in a large gymnasium. She probably couldn't have done better. The rest of them will probably never be seen from again as they succeeded in grossing out an entire generation of women for several years in a row. Turning a poorly written show into a movie doesn't make it work any better. Like finding hair in your coffee, SATC neither thrills, amuses, nor satisfies.",Sex and the City
79,selffamily,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful",9,13 June 2008,"I have long been a fan of the TV series, although Carrie makes me pull my hair out at times - some people really love to be victims - and I was apprehensive about the movie, knowing how they can be stuffed up at times. However, I loved it. It was like a family reunion, with Carrie being carried away with wedding plans, overwhelming poor Big with it and them blaming him for his reaction. Miranda being Miranda, she had her own share of grief and Samantha coming to terms with the fact of who is she and how she wants her life, then lovely Charlotte just doing what Charlotte does, funny, lovable, silly, protective and loyal all at the same time, and then happy endings abound.No it's not Tolstoy, and no it's not for the intellectuals who want to think life out - it's good fun, it's our old friends and it's nice to have them back again. Characters don't do what you want them to do, but nor do real live friends or family. I suspect that many fans will, like me, wish that they would bring these out every five years until they are old but not wrinkled, but still divine.Enjoyed seeing how the other half lives, no hint of poverty or violence or dirty. Pure fantasy and total enjoyment.",Sex and the City
80,Perception_de_Ambiguity,"Basically like the show, although it might feel a bit more fabricated, as if it wanted to please everybody",7,25 February 2009,"Let me say this first: It is totally, utterly, entirely, completely, absolutely... just like the show. The characters are the way they always were. It is sentimental but not over-sentimental. That is, as long as you care for the characters, I guess. The tearjerkers are followed by laughs are followed by tearjerkers are followed by laughs... Although in the case of the movie the tearjerkers held the upper hand, which worked fine.Now some comments about the plot. As you may know, the movie more or less starts with Carrie and Mr. Big marrying. At least that was their plan. But Mr. Big abandons her on the day of the wedding, which pisses Carrie off so much that she won't talk to him for the next several days or weeks or months or maybe even years? (I don't want to spoil it for you.) But the majority of the film is about this phase in which Carrie is dead unhappy, Mr. Big tries to contact her every day, and she slowly but surely forgets the guy. The thing is, that all this time she never really had a good reason to be that utterly depressed and to leave Mr. Big, because Biggie didn't dump Carrie, he just pussed out and decided against the wedding. You were hard-pressed to feel for Mr. Big what Carrie felt for him. At least I never thought: ""What a pig. How could he?"" So the ending is satisfactory to everybody, as happened what everybody wanted to happen and came what had to come.The same thing was the case with Miranda's plot. Her husband, Steve, did something that wasn't OK. But I could understand his reasons to do it and he regretted it deeply. Nonetheless Miranda got so sour that she left him until the end of the movie, naturally. So there was no big revelation or anything in the end that put things into a different light. It was just: ""Yeah, finally!"", and the audience doesn't leave stunned but satisfied.So in this department the show often did a better job, but it didn't bother me that much because overall I had a fun time with some laughs and some tears.For everyone who still is undecided whether they should watch it or not, I can say that when you love the show you probably won't be disappointed. But don't expect something that is better than the show. The film works on the big screen but isn't overly movie-like, so it can just as well be watched at home on your TV, unless of course there isn't even the question of whether you want to see it or not and you want to experience the film together with an audience of fellow fans.",Sex and the City
81,marissas75,"Sentiment, not satire",5,6 June 2008,"In going from TV show to feature film, ""Sex and the City"" is more colorful, fashion-mad, and ambitious than ever, but it's lost much of its humor and its edge. The TV series had an irreverent tone and each 30-minute episode was based around a central concern. The movie goes for sentiment over satire, and never develops a unified theme. OK, it all has to do with romance and happiness, but so does every romantic comedy. I expected something more pointed.Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) goes from ""Heaven on Fifth Avenue""--Mr. Big's penthouse apartment with a huge closet--to relationship hell, when Big gets another attack of commitment-phobia. The on-and-off Carrie-Big stuff has gotten old, and Carrie's love for him makes her look desperate, naive, or immature. And after a lot of scenes of Carrie's post-breakup depression, the movie gets her back together with Big in a hasty and unconvincing way.Miranda, like Carrie, gets a ""heavy"" storyline, but it's awkwardly handled. It's hard to believe that Steve would ever cheat on Miranda, and the script doesn't even try to explain his motivations. Still, Cynthia Nixon (probably the most talented of the four actresses) made me feel for Miranda, and I love her tossed-off quips.Kim Cattrall made me laugh as Samantha, and it's refreshing to see a 50-year-old woman portrayed as such a sexual being. But it's awkward for Samantha to live in LA and constantly fly cross-country to see her friends--and that makes the ending of her story predictable, too.Motherhood has done nothing to mature Charlotte (Kristin Davis)--she's more daffy and cartoonish than ever, with a cutesy happily-ever-after storyline. Again, I'd prefer something sharper, perhaps about how Charlotte juggles her identities as WASP daughter, Jewish wife, and mother to a Chinese-born little girl. (Charlotte's child, Lily, is also irritating--too docile.) I appreciate the impulse to add a younger, non-white woman to the cast (Carrie's assistant Louise, played by Jennifer Hudson), but her character exists to support Carrie, not to illuminate what ""sex and the city"" means for the next generation of New York girls. Most of the male characters are underwritten as well, despite the nearly 2.5-hour running time.Ultimately, the ""Sex and the City"" movie wants to have its Magnolia Bakery cupcakes and eat them too. It suggests that Carrie was wrong to get caught up planning a fancy wedding instead of focusing on what she and Big truly desired. But it also wants the audience to ooh and aah over the montage of designer wedding gowns. The movie says that guys may hurt you, but your gal pals will always come through--then says it's OK to mock a busy working mom for not having perfectly waxed her bikini line. And then suggests that if Miranda had ""maintained"" herself better, Steve might not have strayed. (To her credit, Miranda takes offense at this.) The annoying new song from the movie asks ""Labels or Love?"" and the movie responds that you cannot be a true woman unless you have BOTH. Perhaps that's just wish-fulfillment. But it's more materialistic, and much less sexy, than the TV series that I remember.",Sex and the City
82,loufalce,Pathetic Excuse for a Film,1,28 May 2008,"Yet another TV show {yawn} becomes a film. A gaggle of successful late thirty something women bitch, moan, and in general treat men like dirt as they wear designer clothes, try on shoes, live in overpriced apartment in gentrified neighborhoods,, advance their careers, attend fashion shows , go shopping ,and in general do the same thing they did in the late-and unlamented series. This disaster is overlong- 2 and a half hours- and, believe me it IS a chore to sit through. For die-hard fans only. The kind of movie that men get dragged to, and have to admit they liked to please their dates. It gives ""chick flicks"" their bad name. You've seen it all before-and better too. At least the girls are good to look at{and fantasize about} and provide decent eye candy, but thats about it.Now don't get me wrong. I can enjoy a well made and well acted ""woman's film"" just as much as the next guy, but this one just ain't it.If all this is not bad enough, there are more product placements in this film then you can shake a stick at.

84,robertallenandersonjr,Enjoyed this movie and I am only a teenage guy,8,18 July 2008,"Sex And The City was a very fun comedy for many women to see. I am a teenage guy and I really enjoyed this movie for the most part. It was a very good movie to see. I think it's good they made it into a movie. I really didn't have to many complaints about it besides for some scenes a little bit boring. I did like how they added a little bit of each of the four girls stories. They didn't focus in on one story the whole movie. They gave everyone enough screen time and it was good. Their was a lot of sex and some nudity so if you take a younger kid to see this just be aware. This was a really fun comedy with lots of romance and drama. I really thought the acting was especially good. You don't really even have to be a fan of the show to enjoy this movie as well. I don't watch the t.v. show and I wasn't confused at all. Another good thing is that they fill you in on all the girls stories in the beginning of the movie. This movie really didn't have to many flaws. It didn't drag on it was just a great movie all and all. The movie might have been a little bit long but was worth it. Overall this movie is well worth your money. It had a great story, and many different fun scenes. Go see it you will not be disappointed.",Sex and the City

Carrie was being Carrie & this upset him? She IS INTO the clothes, style, etc & she is being herself &he does not like it.IN this movie Carrie has NO financial problems. Just now had written 3 books. Throughout the show we heard her max out her credit card for shoes/clothes.They could have made Candace Bergen in her 1 brief scene look a little more done up. Made her look like an old woman working at ""Vogue"".For woman THE MUCH TALKED ABOUT ""FULL MONTY"" MALE SCENE. If you blink you will miss that part & it is in later in the film, NOT LIKE CLIPPING SHOW IT LEADS PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IT IS.The Miranda & Steve storyline we knew about before the film opened. Storybook ending.Stanford & Anthony did NOT like each other in the series, what is the difference here? Charlotte & Harry were just supporting characters in this. Hinted before the film opened she would FINALLY have a kid & does. NO SURPRISE. The small good Charlotte moment when she gets to confront ""Big"" Chris Noth. NEEDED THAT TO BE LONGER.I was totally unhappy how the Samantha & Smith storyline ended. While watching the film end you keep hoping for that storybook ending.

After seeing it in the theater, I started to watch the series which reruns on late night television. They don't have all the years of the show and keep replaying the same episodes, which, by now, I have seen all. And, I still, some nights, watch them over again. Needless to say, I have become a huge fan. The other day, the movie came on HBO and I watched it again. It came on the following day, and I watched it for the second time on TV, and I can watch it again and again. I do not know what all these negative reviewers want: it is a made up story. It is not real life, for as we well know, real life rarely has a happy ending. The movie, to me, is pure enjoyment and sizzling entertainment. Why over analyze it. Just enjoy it.

And the answer to the picking up? we got Sex and the City movie.With Sarah Jessica Parker as our favourite Carrie Bradshaw, she meets her 3 Best Friends Forever (BFFs), namely Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), Charlotte York (Kristen Davis) and Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), the 4 BFFs continues their journey of love, sex and fashion in New York City.Somehow, SATC gets a bit draggy this time round. Mabey the 148 minutes movie is compensating the fans for what has been lost in the past 4 years? And to summarized the lives of the 4 BFFs in the past 4 years in the first 20 minutes, it seems to be tricky to do so. Nevertheless, the first 20 minutes keeps the audience awake and excited with Carrie walking down the streets of New York with her big white flower dress, and of course getting married with Mr Big(Chris Noth).Charlotte is getting pregnant, Miranda's marriage with Steve is on the rocks, and Samantha is happily living with Smith, an actor several years younger of her age in Los Angeles. Though these are the main elements to sexed up the movie, the question of Carrie getting married with Mr Big is still the main concern for the fans.With the introduction of Jennifer Hudson as Louise, the assistant of Carrie, the movie reaches a new height, where Carrie teaches Lousie about love, and Louise teaching Carrie getting life back to the track.Compared to the first three season when SATC premiered in 1998, SATC movie shows more maturity among the 4 girls, where more or less, they are settled down with their life. At the same time, we can see more uncertainty, in terms of the views of their love life and the future for the 4 girls, Mr Big, Steve and Smith.Unlike other TV series turned movies such as The Simpsons Movie, one might find SATC movie too long and hard to digest if one did not catch a single episode or two of SATC. Strictly speaking, SATC movie is strictly for fans to get the final answer for the life of the 4 BFFs. So if you want to have a good time with your loved ones and your best friends with this movie, try to catch at least a season or two. If not, this might just be another popcorn big screen romance.P.S: To the four golden girls, have a happy life ahead.",Sex and the City

They easily could have edited down much of the material that caused the second act to drag on and on.Even worse, though I won't give anything away, there was a bit too much extensive bashing of a particular group that furrowed my brow.Other than that, everyone was back in character and the movie maintained the feel of the original series. The next film will soon be underway and, hopefully, it will be shorter as well as witty, full of fun, laughs and gasps as the original. Long live Samantha!",Sex and the City
89,commandercool88,Forgettable.,5,7 July 2008,"Like many critics before me have said, I am not part of the target audience for 'Sex and the City'. I'm not a woman, and I never watched the HBO series religiously. I will say that I have caught a few episodes here and there in the weeks leading up to the movie, and it's not half bad. It's light, funny, a guilty pleasure of sorts. In its transition to the big screen, 'Sex and the City' retains a lot of what made the television series so popular, but this bloated picture also lacks a certain spark that makes this merely okay.But it really doesn't matter what I think. Die-hard fans of the show, and there are many, will love what they see. But if you happen to be one of those who is not a big fan of the show, or haven't seen enough of it to follow all the story lines, you may be out of luck. For me, this picture that exceeds two hours simply has too much on its plate. It's an entire season squeezed into one package, bringing new meaning to the term 'choppy'. Halloween, New Year's, Valentine's Day. Six months, six long months. Fans will delight, but I just didn't find this to be the guilty pleasure its counterpart embodies so well.I've always been fascinated by the allure of these four women. To be honest, they're not very likable people. They're shallow busybodies who have enough money and time to do whatever they please. And it may be just this that explains the phenomenon. Perhaps 'Sex and the City' offers an escape for women around the world, a glamorous and unrealistic fantasy that's easy to long for. Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, and Cynthia Nixon have all come to embody their characters quite perfectly, and I do believe they've given it - and fans - their all. There's just not a substantive script to give them a needed boost.For what it is, 'Sex and the City' does exactly what it set out to do. A love letter to New York and the millions of fans who have stuck by their side for ten years. It's a light, breezy piece of entertainment. Funny at times, serious at others, and no shortage of romance and sex. Kim Cattrall's witty one-liners are still hilarious, and Carrie's relationship with Big as dry as ever. It's a sprawling experience, and at times feels like it will never end. But as I said when I first opened, 'Sex and the City' was not made for me. Perhaps in a few years when I'm all caught up on the show, but for now this long anticipated movie is mostly forgettable.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Sex and the City

However, this movie does not capture the spirit of the series, instead it delivers you a 90 minute long non-stop commercial, advertising it's sponsors and fairly aggressively promoting expensive shoes, designer-clothes, luxury apartments a heavily consume oriented lifestyle.This film has nothing on earth to do with art or even movie making. Every minute, shot, set, scene and character is literally DESIGNED to reflect on it's female target audience in a way refined enough, so a fairly large percentage of women will be able to identify with it, thereby like it, pay for it and worse, another percentage of these women will, to a certain degree, absorb it's dangerous idealism, which revolves around not a bit more then: BUY.

91,dudedazzreviews,Not absolutely terrible...but I can't see why women find it amazing...,4,12 October 2010,"Several years have passed since viewers last saw Carrie and company, though she's still involved with Mr. Big and completely consumed by her obsession for name-brand accessories. Meanwhile, Miranda is adjusting to married life and motherhood, Charlotte is still clinging to her dreams, and Samantha and handsome, steely eyed TV star Smith Jerrod are now living together out in L.A. Of course, when the girls all come together, it's just like old times.and so I thought, since the first release of the upcoming Sex and the City 2 trailer, should I brave it out and watch the first movie and see what all the fuss is about? My answer was obviously yes, I wouldn't be reviewing it otherwise. Take in mind that this is from a straight guy's perspective and from someone who has never seen any Sex and the City episodes. The story is actually not bad but it's not good either, it centres around Sarah Jessica Parker's character getting married to Mr. Big and her other three friends undergoing some sort of marriage or home crisis of their own. The acting was very good and the four main actresses kept a solid performance throughout in my opinion. The characters are mostly fixated on name-brand shoes and clothes, marriage, money, shopping and—of course—their sex lives, they were written okay, however there was very little character development and after a while, they start to get a little irritating and stereotypical. The direction and cinematography was great as the movie had the feel that it was a longer episode from the television series. The writing isn't bad either, I thought the script wasn't badly written and the story was mediocre.Before watching this movie, I saw the trailer for it and I did think that I might not like it. However I still gave it a chance and it wasn't that bad but it is definitely the biggest chick flick I have ever seen (and it was expected to be, after all, it is Sex and the City). A massive flaw for this movie, in my opinion, is the runtime. Two and a half hours is way too long for this movie, it should have been shorter. I found myself starting to drift in and out of the movie after an hour and a half. Also, as much as I like Jennifer Hudson, I felt that her character, which was the assistant of Sarah Jessica Parker's character, was kind of pointless. It just felt like she was there for no reason, she should have been in the movie a lot more than she was. However, in saying this, Sex and the City: The Movie is supposed to be about the four main women and each had their fair share of runtime so it wasn't really a massive problem. Did I enjoy it? It wasn't bad but it was nowhere near good. Don't get me wrong, I can watch chick flicks and I can enjoy them but this wasn't very enjoyable at all, it's pretty much stereotypical. I don't see how women can find this so fascinating. Overall, it's pretty much below average.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Sex and the City

93,JonathanWalford,Lack of Sizzle in the City,6,31 May 2008,"It was okay... I expected more but it was only just okay. Many others have already commented that the movie was more like a double episode and that is exactly what I was thinking as I left the theatre. Yes I laughed out loud (mostly when Charlotte Poughkeepsied her pants) but the élan was gone. With the exception of Charlotte most of the characters came across as uncommunicative, pathetic, losers -- bitter old maids who just looked desperate with too much make-up. If I had just watched this movie without investing all those years in front of HBO, I would be totally bewildered as to why I should care about any of these women or their loser or invisible boyfriends (two come across as losers, the other two are invisible). Rather than revisit all the characters and develop them in some way we are introduced to new characters instead. We didn't need the psychiatrist or the personal assistant - why were they there? Isn't that what friends are for? I thought the whole point of this series was that these women could always rely on each other when all else went wrong. Nope, apparently you hire a PA and go see a shrink... I really would have liked to have seen more of some of the regular characters, like Harry, Anthony, and Stanford. I also would have liked to have seen a LOT less of the biggest star in the film - fashion. There is just TOO much fashion - it has become a character in the film, and its not that interesting to watch on screen. The clothes became over-the-top statements. Carrie wears a studded punk belt with her first three outfits in the movie but then leaves a pair of brand new Blahniks in a closet for 6 months without a second thought -- this is not a fashionista... despite her wearing a big bird costume covered with black net to a fashion show in the middle of February, Carrie continues to don her ratty old vintage fur coat that she has owned for over a decade. The film is unsatisfying. If you are looking for a follow-up to the final episode -- a 'where are they now' kind of thing, then you won't be happy - its more like a continuation of the same crap three years later. THe single most frustrating experience of the entire movie is the build-up to the big wedding let down. It all seemed so manufactured - a pure invention of the writer. Where was the slow tension build-up, the wedding slowly getting out of control scenes that scare Big. Nope, nothing is mentioned until its too late. You know, I came here to write a review for my 6 out of 10 rating, but I am going to re-vote the movie to a 4 now. The longer I think about it, the more I don't like what I saw.",Sex and the City
94,FlorianLaur,Not nearly as bad as it's made out to be,6,25 May 2017,"I'm one of those males who actually likes this show...because I think I know how I have to view it and what to expect. I've read the(mostly bad) reviews about SATC - The movie. They mostly address the consumerism, the over-the-top-acting, the surreal situations or how annoying some characters are. But that's exactly what the show was about too:)! Carrie is a selfish, annoying prick who doesn't learn any lessons(in the movie, she actually does!) who always wants what she can't have and if she has it, she doesn't want it. Mr. Big(whom I respected for treating her the way she deserves it almost until the end) has folded and it's really hard to believe that either him or Aidan would ever be with a woman like Carrie. Her whole mindset seems to be stuck in her teens with her life all just being about parties, dresses and shopping. Charlotte is the whiny, annoying woman she was on the show too who's super-fussy about almost everything, but at least somehow learns that that's not how the world works. She kind of gets her punishment down in Mexico though;). Miranda and Samantha were the two characters in the show who were the least hypocritical(although Miranda had a few good of those moments too) and in the movie, Miranda does come off as quite the hypocrite, taking over Carries role(maybe for her to shine?). The way she behaves after what happens with her and her husband seems more fit for Charlotte or Carrie, not necessarily her, a woman who proposed over 3-Dollar-Beers(as she had put it). Samantha, being 10 years older than the other actresses in real life and on the show shows some depth and growth by still being with Jarrod Smith and not cheating on him. Sadly, it seems as if the movie focuses a bit too much on Carrie(but so did the show in the later seasons and it didn't work so well there either).But despite all that, I feel that the movie itself works as one long episode of the show. The feeling and atmosphere is basically the same, we have some very beautiful shots of New York(the New Years scenes!) and I was surprised that unlike most movies that come out years after a first part(or in this case show), they stayed so close to the atmosphere. It just feels like it should, in my opinion. Maybe people forgot the show or didn't watch it front-to-back before seeing the movies like I did...maybe they forgot what a selfish §$% Carrie is...so maybe they feel shocked about that and that's why they hate it? Or they only now realize how ridiculously overdrawn some characters are?But to me, that was always the fun of this show...I love to watch it cause I love to hate Carrie Bradshaw/Preston. And I laugh each time, thinking that millions of women saw this show, seriously thinking such a person could actually be a role model. I often thought that the shows creators really did a number on women with this show actually...it does seem like it's all pro women(and especially in the early seasons, the guys come off as jerks or morons), but I think the show was meant to show us that BOTH sides have a lot of flaws and there's a lot of hypocrisy on either side. I give Sex and the City a strong 6. It's the kind of movie you can watch as your guilty pleasure or to make your girlfriend happy and I've seen far worse movies than this one. I think if you loved the show, you should still be able to thoroughly enjoy the movie:)!",Sex and the City
95,jhsteel,Distilled down to a Rom-Com,6,19 December 2008,"I actually enjoyed it to some extent although I am a SATC fan. It wasn't as good as the TV show, but it was a reminder of why we liked it. The best thing about the original show was its daring and ability to challenge and the rounded nature of the characters. This film was a predictable romantic comedy, and although I was pleased to see the characters again, they weren't their old selves. I was particularly annoyed with Carrie for rejecting Big for being indecisive - the old Carrie would not have over-reacted like that. The apartment moving out-moving in-again was hard to believe, and as others have mentioned, all the main characters showed signs of not being themselves. However, I remember thinking that there were things about the plots in the TV show which also seemed unrealistic or too easily worked out, and it was also full of product placement. It also had a lot of in your face fashion - that is one reason I liked it. I feel that whenever a successful TV show is transferred to the big screen, something goes wrong. I understand the disappointment that many people feel, but it works at some level, especially for people who are not die-hard fans of the show and just want a bit of entertainment. However, the feminism of SATC is lost - I agree with that!",Sex and the City

97,VintageSoul56,Label Launching and Product Placement Aside...,8,17 October 2020,"Watching SATC movie, again, I like it. I've seen it several times. Aside from the label name dropping and product placement, the movie is still pretty much like the series. It showed all four main female characters pretty much like the series was. Similar situations that arose in the series, for instance, the whole Big Issue. The on again, off again relationship. I will say this, I never saw the chemistry between Sarah Jessica Parker and Chris Noth. For me, it was never there. I saw it more in Aiden (John Corbett) and Alexander Petrofsky (Mikel Baryshnikov). Miranda, my least favorite, whose job was always the obstacle in her relationship with Steve. I know that these are fictional characters, but she never had the time to listen and he strayed. I never saw why she appealed to him. Charolette, was happy once she stopped looking for the handsome knight and ended up with the court jester, but with brains and a lot of love for her. Samantha is always Samantha. I have to say, I prefer her to all of the others. She is her own person. She doesn't depend on a man for her happiness as the others do. She a very modern woman. Jennifer Hudson as Louise from St. Louis was a very nice addition. Loved her sassiness, sympathy & giving Carrie a run for her money in the doomed relationship story.",Sex and the City
98,tay-sedai,"I do love this movie, BUT",8,28 May 2013,"Every time I watch the Sex and the City movie (which is quite often, really), I finish up with the same question: Why is everyone so mad at Miranda for leaving Steve?Steve cheated on her. To me, that's the biggest betrayal possible besides, I dunno, him hurting her kid physically somehow. I don't get why her friends are always trying to get her to go back to him, to consider forgiving him, etcetera. I mean, they should know that it might be possible in future for her to forgive him...but why the pressure to do it quickly?At one point, Charlotte asks Miranda: ""Are you sure you can't give him another chance?"" and then somebody (perhaps Miranda?) says, ""What about Carrie? Do you think she should forgive Big?"" and Charlotte exclaims, ""NO! Of course not!"" because, um, Big left her at the altar. Yeah, that was bad, but was it as bad as cheating on her with another woman?I'm not saying that one should never forgive something like that. I'm just saying that I think these ladies have some weird priorities. And I think it's weird that Miranda's friends would encourage her to put up with being so horribly disrespected, but never entertain the thought that Carrie could forgive Big for the public humiliation of jilting her. I guess at least Steve didn't humiliate Miranda in public, right?I just don't get it, and perhaps I never will.BUT...I still love this movie...way, way more than I love the second one (i.e. I don't love that at all).",Sex and the City

100,amichnea,From a guy's point of view,10,29 May 2008,"Well for starters I gave this a 10/10... why? well because of all the idiots that gave it a 1, why no idea. The film obviously doesn't deserve a 10:):) but I would say that a 7 is more like it. Unfortunately we can't really get a rating of 7 because of the 1000 of 1's it got, so before I start please give this a 10 until it gets to the rating it should be:) In the words of Samantha ""Hey dickwise I am speaking..."" so stop boycotting this film and give it a decent rating.Now to comment on the film itself. My girlfriend asked me if I wanted to go with her and I said yes, just because I wanted to be with her and I wasn't looking forward to see this film, as a 27 year old male very much into my Superbikes, yes I am a biker, PC Games and most manly things:):) this film didn't appeal at all. We got the 5Pm show so there were few people, only me and another guy and only about 15 women. The 7Pm and 8Pm show had a nice long queue of women and girls:):)I never followed the episodes but I got the full series for my girlfriend and I did catch the odd episode every now and then, so I had a basic idea who was who and what was happening, plus my missus made sure to give me a summary of the whole SATC series:):) From the start you get a nice introduction and a quick summary of the SATC story so even if you don't know much you'd pick things up. Then again the film could be watched as a simple romantic comedy film, you don't even need to know the SATC background to enjoy it. I took the film as a romantic comedy and I really enjoyed it... Yes I did, I wasn't thinking I would after reading so much rubbish on the net but I did. It was funny most of the time, I actually laughed, there were no bad jokes in it, the acting was brilliant not sure why people complained about that, the scene at the Library when she called Mr Big was quite heartbreaking and the story not too bad. I didn't think the film was rushed or they just wanted ""your money"". I would even say that I could watch it again. I will most likely be buying it for my other half so I could end up watching it again in a few months when it comes out on DVD.Seriously what can I say more, I am a guy that went to the cinema with his other half because she wanted to watch the film so much and I actually enjoyed it. If you watched ""You got mail"" ""Just Friends"" ""Over her dead body"" ""Just Like Heaven"" etc etc I could name 100's of girly romantic comedies out there that a bloke can enjoy with his missus, then go watch Sex And The City the film...

101,LaurieMann,Mixed Bag of Fashion Porn,5,6 June 2008,"I've always been a fan of the TV show Sex and the City. Yeah, the women were a little shallow, there was way too much emphasis on labels but Miranda and Samantha in particular always made me laugh.The movie...oy...when it's funny (like the first third or so of the movie), it's quite funny.In the middle third of the movie, it completely, completely looses its way. There's some great photography (particularly during the Mexico scenes), but the movie has three of the characters behaving in ways that made no sense whatsoever. And I can't say what happens without going to spoiler city.The movie's last third ties up a bunch of loose ends and the ending is touching. But it fell badly into ""too little, too late."" Now, I'm delighted to go to a movie that focuses on women. I was really happy to go buy my ticket today, and I don't feel it was a complete waste of money. But it had some of the same plot problems as Indy Jones IV (except for the CGI) - the writers screwed it up. Like Indy, the audience went because they loved the characters. It would be nice if the writer(s) had paid more attention to what people loved about the characters and written a decent script. And I do think the SATC script was a little better than the Indy Jones IV script, but that's dammning with faint praise.The TV shows were about 25 minutes long. The movie is just about 120 minutes long. There is shockingly little sex or discussion about sex in there. In fact, there's an awful lot of complaining about NOT having sex. And, there were the implications that women must be razor thin or remove any body hair to be sexually desirous. There's more sex and sex discussion in the average SATC TV show than there was in the whole movie. Most of the sex involved Samantha's randy neighbor and Sam basically becoming a voyeur because her boyfriend was constantly working.I hope they do make another SATC movie, but I hope that the writer who wrote the witty first third of the movie gets to write the whole movie the next time.",Sex and the City
102,csagne,Better than expected,7,13 August 2008,"I was not expecting a ground breaking experience. In fact, looking at the stats on IMDb i thought this might be a total waste of time. You see, I'm a fan of the show (and a bloke) and the film was advertised far too much. The girls did little more since the end of the show a few years ago but rest, cash on the show, and basically starve artistically speaking. They were so much trapped in their characters that they probably had a tough time finding better roles. So in 2008 with a film that some describe as ""a pathetic pele-mele"" ""a money making venture"" ""betrayal of the spirit of the show"" I was not keen on watching it. Well of course it looked like a bread-making sequel for starved actresses, hey I heard Kim Cattrall delayed it because she asked for a fair lot of money to do it, and even advertised a book under the name of her character.But then I did watch it and, OK the show was usually funnier and better. But the film has a few clever lines and the plot does not get heavy on the stomach (treated in more time than in a standard episode, which is fair), and it looks like a longer version of an episode, which could have been chopped into 2 ""finale"" episodes. but it does not feel long, cheesy, or overdone - although the girls take all the attention, all the time. Supporting roles kept faithful to themselves, the set was as good as ever.In short I would have watched it earlier if there had been a little less marketing around it, because the marketing campaign gave me the feeling the film wouldn't sell itself, so needed to be sold. Do not watch if you did not like the show - but do you need this advice? Otherwise go ahead it's not the 8th wonder of the world but still worth seeing.",Sex and the City
103,John_Truby,Surprisingly effective,8,7 January 2010,"Sex and the City was a revolutionary TV show. Not because it showed women having lots of sex. That part was always unbelievable. Even young hip New York women don't have that much sex with that many different partners or they'd be dead. No, Sex and the City was a big deal because it showed women as main characters in the story of their lives, not as the supporting girlfriend to the male hero. It showed women in the day-to-day business of work and love - the very fabric of human life - and it didn't apologize for the fact that women craft their lives differently than men. If you don't think that's a big deal, try traveling the world as I did during the run of the show and hearing women from every conceivable nationality rave about this show.Over the years the show went from Sex in the City to Relationships in the City, which was more believable but less fun. Especially when two of the women got themselves into relationships that were just plain dumb. Smart lawyer Miranda with Steve the bartender was painful to watch, and hear, since Steve's how-dumb-can-I-talk voice was like nails on a chalkboard. And Charlotte's marriage to the impotent mama's boy was a clear case of theme driving plot into never-never land.Now comes the movie and it is surprisingly effective. I say surprisingly because turning a TV show into a good movie is extremely difficult, with a very low success rate. There are a number of reasons for the success of Sex (and no, the sex is not one of them). But let me focus on two. The first is the character web on which the book and the show were originally built. Character web is a crucial structural element for any work of fiction, in whatever medium, but it's especially important in TV. In the TV Drama Class I point out that mainstream Hollywood film emphasizes a single main character going after a single goal with a one-time plot that is usually highly intricate. TV, on the other hand, emphasizes a community of characters the audience wants to visit once a week, with plot being secondary and often predictable. Plot has grown more important on TV for 24 and Lost, but they are still the exception.With character community being primary, how you set up the character oppositions for the leads of the show is crucial. The four women on Sex represent four unique approaches to how modern single women craft their work-love lives. There's the driven professional woman, the narcissistic sexaholic, and the Princess who expects life to be a fairy tale. At the center of this mix is Carrie, a combination of all three who is the only truly well-rounded character of the four.This highly-differentiated character web sets up a second major reason for the success of the Sex movie, the story weave. In the Advanced Screen writing Class I talk about an advanced storytelling strategy called the branching structure. In multiple character stories, each character represents a branch. The trick is how you combine these branches without destroying all narrative drive. If you crosscut equally between many characters, the story has to track too many simultaneous actions and narrative drive disappears.But because Carrie is the first among equals in the character web, the branching story weave here is more like a single trunk with three other branches extending off. Carrie's story provides the strong spine that a mainstream Hollywood movie requires while the stories of the other women provide sub-plots, with each being a variation on the main line. Luckily Carrie has that one big event that can provide the spine of the movie, her pending wedding to Big. This event also focuses the theme of the film so that each of the four women can present a different approach to the question: how do women deal with the deeply-ingrained fairy tale image of being married to a man? Unfortunately this event left me quite ambivalent. I too wanted the fairy tale ending; boys watch Disney movies too. But emotionally it wasn't right. It wasn't earned. Here is a guy who has ""jilted"" Carrie for the entire TV show, then does it again at the altar, and she takes him back one more time. The writer justifies it through the Miranda subplot with Steve (also fake), with the statement that ""You've got to forgive."" Well, no, you don't. If the guy keeps blowing you off and humiliating you time and again in the process, at some point it's the mark of a mature person to say, ""Get the hell out of my life."" Of course, Carrie's marriage to Big does set up the inevitable sequel to this blockbuster film. Anyone want to place bets on Big being faithful?

Sarah Jessica Parker should also get a Golden Globe nomination. I saw this flic at a matinée - 95% women & i do mean older women - and their grannies too. i was one of the few men in the audience & there was a strong smell of estrogen in the air. there was a technical glitch which i've read on line has been a common occurrence in other theatres - half way through there are scenes where the overhead mics and lighting are visible & this goes on for about 10 minutes making the audience very uncomfortable. there are many funny bits & each actress gets to shine but overall this is a much darker movie than what you would expect : issues of aging (of course) fidelity, forgiveness etc. the storyline is mostly about Carrie & Mr. Big. Jennifer Hudson is stuck with the Hattie McDaniel part - she is basically Carrie's mammy & maid. Overall i would say the movie delivers & tho it is too long it is not too gay - the two gay characters are barely there - Sarah Jessica Parker is a good actress & makes the most of it.

110,wricketts,From the Ministry of Silly Movies,3,12 October 2008,"Cute enough for an evening's mindless entertainment, but exactly that and not a penny more. Put aside any thought you might have about not caring a great deal about what happens to a group of rich, superficial white women who (you are told) are actually very smart and talented but who (you are shown) are silly twits (not to use a different vowel) whose exclusive joy in life comes from sex and shopping, and not in that order. I know, I know; we're supposed to believe this is all about love (and the search for same), but it isn't; love is secondary. We're supposed to believe it's about solidarity among a group of women friends and it is, but that's more-or-less an accident. It's really about consuming  clothes, purses, shoes  and other human beings. The introduction of Jennifer Hudson (who tries really hard not to be appalled by the level of minstrel-show tokenism her presence represents) as Carrie's personal assistant is so painful and so blatant an attempt to give a tiny bit of color to the TV series' snow-blinding whiteness that you can't help but be embarrassed for absolutely everyone. Here's another film in which women are stand-ins for what is essentially a gay-male fantasy about women (an art form that George Cukor pioneered in 1939 with _The Women_) Take your brain out and store it in Tupperware for the evening; _Sex and the City_ will make you smile, but not laugh out loud.

There was lots of fun in it. they didn't overdo ,the fashionista bits and the sex and nudity was perfectly handled. I found the movie better than the series which was fluffy, and at times shallow (but still mucho entertaining and fun) while the movie was, dare I say, poignant and warm-hearted. I also take issue with those who say a REAL man wouldn't be caught dead at this movie. Yes if he was the stereotype male pig. I resent that, and lots of my male friends do too.

Eventually, I became a fan. I tried to look at this movie from two perspectives: 1. I am/was a fan of the TV series, and 2. I was never a fan of the TV series but was curious, dragged to the movie by partner who is a fan, etc.. I think the movie gave me just what I was looking for: the girls, the relationships, and poignant comments about love and life. It was a great looking movie, the fashion was spectacular. Even when I start to be a little critical about what I thought may be a contrived emotional outburst from Carrie (SJP),my spouse reminded me that Carrie had acted similarly on the TV show when confronted with furthering the relationship with Big. One of the challenges this movie has, is actually being a feature length film. I thought the time frame of reference helped (seasons and over a year), although it was a little ""telegraphed"" in it's approach.Whether there is a sequel, or the TV series is revived or revisited, I for one am anxious to see the girls, their lives, their relationships especially...whatever will happen to dear Samantha.

And frankly, I was surprised that I was drawn into the film. They did a pretty good job of interweaving the various plot lines - some humorous, some not - so the movie did not get too heavy and ponderous. At least, through the first 2/3 of the film. But for some reason the film started to drag after that point - the pacing felt off and the story started to over-focus on one character - granted the central one - but it felt weird.So, I gave it 6 stars - as my review title said - ""Not bad, but not great either""",Sex and the City

I mean it's got a B+ rating on movies yahoo so does this mean those fans are more in tune & are the real fans ? .My wife & I actually brought season 6 & watched it right up to when we went to see the movie ( did anyone do this ! ) & we found that the movie carried on where we left off only 3 years later .",Sex and the City

118,rh86,Bit of a shame really,5,9 August 2008,"OK, I did have some idea of what to expect before seeing this. Yes there was going to be a lot of shoes, dresses and Sarah J-P narrating the blindingly obvious. But the SATC TV series rose above this and certainly in the last season bought about some very intelligent, touching and emotional story lines.And then they came up with this. Two and a half hours of will Carrie and Big get married or not? This would be OK if it wasn't for the fact that pretty much everyone else got stuck on the sidelines except for Miranda. Samantha is now a nymphomaniac, Charlotte is basically there for comedy value and between them, Big, Smith, Harry and Stanford get about 8 seconds of speaking time. Miranda and Steve's storyline was the only one actually worth watching and credit is due to Cynthia Nixon and David Eigenberg for pulling something decent out this.Overall it just doesn't live up to the standard of the series and at times you just want to slap Carrie Bradshaw with her Manolo and tell her to get over herself (that quote came from a female friend of mine who used to idolise all the SATC girls)",Sex and the City
119,nhermida,A really good comedy--don't understand why so many don't like it,8,3 June 2008,"I was surprised that the movie is as good as it is. It is very difficult to be equally good or better than a top show like Sex & the City. However, they did it.I was even more surprised when my husband, who probably somewhat reluctantly came with me, said he liked it. Even if it was almost 2.5 hours, it kept us interested. The fashion was fabulous; the plot with Big really good; the four girls + Jennifer Hudson and their lives' happenings interesting; and it ended right.My advise to those reading my comments would be to go watch it yourself and decide on your own instead of letting the haters' reviews influence you.",Sex and the City
120,The_Matrix_Rocks,Extraneous Movie-Making,4,24 November 2008,"If ever there was an unnecessary movie, this is it! ""Sex and the City: The Movie"" is nothing but a naked attempt at cashing in on the wildly successful TV franchise. Dressing up that naked attempt in some stunning clothing by leading fashion designers still constitutes no justification for making this movie.The film adds nothing significant to the mythology of the Fabulous Foursome, and unfortunately, their ageing (in both senses of the word) antics don't translate well onto the big screen.Many a hit TV series has suffered this fate (think ""The X-Files"") and I never thought I'd compliment the makers of hit 80s shows like ""Knight Rider"", ""Airwolf"" and the ""The A-Team"" for knowing that discretion was the better part of valour.",Sex and the City

Before that I had never seen the show and upon seeing the film it instantly became a guilty pleasure for me. This is the kind of movie you watch as an impressionable teen and it motivates you to be fabulous! Even though, deep down, you know it's embellishing but you can't help but want to be a part of this world. This movie is downright sexy and fun. Stop taking it so seriously. If you like marvel/dc movies but you think this is trash then you're part of the problem in this world.",Sex and the City
122,StevieGB,I thought is was brilliant,1,13 August 2008,"the way they brought the gay characters forward and used a new black character to challenge the foursome's blinkered and self-obsessed view of the world. And the way it never dragged for a single moment during its whole two and a half hours. And the way it decided not to let very much happen at all so that it became about the characters, after all, who wants a story these days? And the way they did the pooh joke, oh I was rolling around laughing at that one. To think that they nearly messed it up totally by making an overlong, unfunny movie where nothing happens to a bunch of totally self-obsessed characters, and where the gay characters have a total of about two lines so as not to upset the audience in the southern states by their just being there, and introducing a black character just as vapid as the four leads in order to appeal to the black demographic.",Sex and the City
123,TomCruiseFan99,"If you liked the TV show, you'll LOVE the movie",8,3 June 2008,"First off, it should be extremely obvious to everyone, that if you were never a fan of the TV show, then you shouldn't bother watching the movie. Not that it can't be enjoyed as a stand-alone movie, but the emotional investment with the characters won't be established unless you were a SATC regular. And it's this link to the characters, having missed them for so long, that will generate added enjoyment and extra laughs once they begin their shenanigan-filled journey in this 140 minute romantic comedy.Yes, 140 minutes long, but I never noticed the length at all. I was having too good a time. The major plot line revolves around Carrie and Big deciding to get married, and of course this leads to much trials and tribulations. The movie was funny (hysterically so, in places), with Samantha and Charlotte's characters, being polar opposites of each other, generating most of the belly laughs.The character that was totally unnecessary, IMHO, was that of Jennifer Hudson as Carrie's assistant. I loved miss Hudson in Dreamgirls, but she was totally under-utilized here and served no function as any of Carrie's friends could have been used to serve the purpose of this role.All in all, the movie felt like an extra-extended TV episode, and I mean that in a good way, as everything felt totally in-synch with the TV show, the sets, the lighting, the performances all working in perfect unison. So from a guy's point of view, I loved it.",Sex and the City
124,andrewjerome,Stick to the TV show,1,5 May 2011,"Here's a film I was just not that into! As I sit here on my laptop I wonder: Does it matter that this ridiculous and regressive flick was written and directed by a man and concentrates on shopaholic stereotypes? Is the only way for serious women to gain power to suck it up and ride the coattails of shallow girl power? Do we all have to settle to succeed? For these women, who long for permanent attachments, there seems to be little room in their lives for the loving virtues and more for a world of strident self-gratification. In a way, ""Sex and the City"" suffers from bad timing. Its celebration of materialism feels a little out of whack with the national mood in the midst of a recession. Perhaps at some deeper level, this is a satire on the emotional inadequacy of the modern male achiever.",Sex and the City
125,JaysonT,An Almost-Perfect Outing with the Girls!,10,31 May 2008,"Here it is at long last. The one thing SEX AND THE CITY fans wanted after the series finale in late 2003 was a movie continuing the relationships we had grown to love. We also wanted to know if Mr. Big really was the guy for Carrie Bradshaw. Now, after almost five years, the big screen adaptation is out in the open. And is it big! At over two hours long, we're almost spoiled with vibrant cinematography, breathtaking costumes, elaborate and witty dialogue, and some interesting twists along the way. Most likely this review will only be enjoyable if you already were a fan of the show. Likewise, this is why most stubborn critics are panning the film- they never tuned into HBO to watch the damn thing! I will attest again that before you read the rest of this review, proceed with caution- I do give away a lot of secrets. Perhaps come back and read it once you've viewed the film.We're also spoiled that Michael Patrick King wrote and directed it, considering he was the main writer/director for many of the key episodes of SEX AND THE CITY. The movie takes us right where we left off. Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), has now made it official- she's with John (Chris Noth) aka Mr. Big, for good. This is not to say that we're at all surprised- during the entire series she was in and out of bed with him for many an outing (including an affair she struck up with him while in a serious relationship with someone else). He asks her what she wants from him- she says ""a really big closet."" Her wish is his financial command. And then they decide to get married.Meanwhile, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), is busy taking in the fact that Steve has cheated on her- only once. It's an excuse to get some ""Drama"" going once the girls sit down for their daily coffee shop talks. Samantha (Kim Cattrall- looking amazing at 52), has moved to Los Angeles with her live-in movie star boyfriend Smith, who has seen her through a lot of things, including Cancer. They seem just fine. And Charlotte (Kristin Davis), decides once and for all that besides having an adopted Chinese daughter, she will also get pregnant- which she does, this time successfully.All of these story lines intertwine just as they did in the show, with one big dramatic moment audience members may not expect. Carrie is given huge publicity (and stunning wedding gowns), for her upcoming marriage to Big. But apparently he's not ready for a third wedding to be so glamorous and big. So events happen that cause Carrie to go into a mental state of depression, and also an excuse for the four women to vacation to Mexico, where Charlotte has an incident that provides on of the movie's biggest laughs.Jennifer Hudson, who I feared would ruin the movie considering she's no actress in my book, makes brief appearances as Carrie's assistant- to undergo tasks such as uploading her personal files, and unpacking her personal shoe collection. Her presence is neither necessary nor irritating.Over-all SEX AND THE CITY is an entertaining romp back into the lives of women over 40 who are successful, sexy and vulnerable. All three of these descriptions have caused many sexist critics to diss the movie (and show) as pure fantasy and not realistic. These are the same critics who claim SPIDER-MAN 2 and BATMAN BEGINS are revolutionary for these ""fantasy themes and use of imagination"". But in their terms, the same can't be said for female heroines.I loved SEX AND THE CITY up until the final fourth, where two incidents caused me to roll my eyes in the theater, and cramp my fists together. (Please, again, stop reading if you have not yet seen the movie or don't wish to know). The worst is Samantha's subplot. She has a sexy neighbor who always is having flings with women and has a body good enough to ""taste"", in her words. Because she's in a committed relationship to Smith, she eats her way into weight gain to stop from succumbing to her urges. Oh, and she's peeved he bought her an expensive ring that she wanted to independently purchase. So she dumps him. At first we think it's a hoax- but no, Michael Patrick King actually thinks we're going to believe that the same woman who saw her man fly all the way from CANADA just to tell her he loved her AND survive Kemo therapy, will drop him like a one-night stand because she wants to do the next-door neighbor so bad she's gained 10 pounds. Was this added for shock value or an excuse for another sequel? The Samantha I knew would never have done such a thing. Not in the place she was when we left her four years ago. Despite the small talks about her claiming he's always first, and how she wishes he would be home more- this all makes no literal sense if we remember earlier in the movie how she brags that he's always making love to her. But perhaps in a new movie, she'll come back- or not.The other incident is more personal. The events that led to Carrie's depression involve Big and the wedding. And the ending caused me to believe that Carrie the character will never grow because she keeps falling back into old traps. Neither will Big.But over-all, SEX AND THE CITY is everything you need if you're a die-hard fan of the show. There's plenty of sex, puns, men and clothes for you to feast on for a few.",Sex and the City

There are so many laugh out loud moments and also a few gasps in anticipation of what is going to happen in certain situations. I cant put down in words how amazing this film was, the cinema was packed full and you could tell from the reactions from the audience that everyone loved it and was happy about the outcome. The acting was brilliant as always and the characters and their stories were well developed enough to last throughout the film. I have to say that I'm so happy that Carrie and Mr Big ended up getting married, and a sense of satisfaction came over you when the film was finished.

127,Bigbang,Girlzillas. Stay away from these monsters,3,7 February 2010,"In this movie, we have narcissistic girls running around obsessed with material items and their own happiness. A mans only purpose in life is to cater to the happiness of these women, but I shouldn't say ""women"" because these are little girls. Spoiled little princesses who think the world revolves around them and their every emotional whim. These girls offer absolutely nothing in their relationships with men. Notice how long it took Carrie Bradshaw to engage in just a morsel of self-reflection. Ya know, that maybe having a pompous bridezilla wedding was a major turn-off to Mr. Big? He wanted to marry HER, because he loved HER, the wedding is just a fun formality. To Carrie, the wedding is everything. She was not marrying Mr. Big, she was marrying herself, because that's all these entitled princesses care about. The guy is just another accessory like one of their overpriced Louis Vuitton handbags.The guys in the movie? Forget it. Cynthia Nixon's husband is...wow, the guy appears to be mentally challenged. I mean literally. As per Hollywood usual there wasn't an ounce of masculinity in this guy. Kristin Davis' husband is another non-entity. A guy with no edge, very little masculinity and just another servant to his wife's needs. Society's agenda to feminize and de-masculate men continues.Mr. Big isn't too bad, but believe me, the guy is a fool. Carrie is a very successful woman, why is he buying her all this stuff? Is he purchasing her love? Spoiling these brats does not make them love you more. He decides to marry her because she was complaining she didn't have any ""legal rights"" as a couple living together. In other words Mr. Big, if we split up, I can legally rake you over the coals and rob you blind in divorce court, where men have no rights. And what does he say? ""Okay let's get married."" Lol. Big mistake Big!Oh and of course there were a few fabulous gay characters as well. Is anyone else tired of the flamboyant gay queens who are into fashion and are girl's best friends? It can't just be me. I'm sick of it already. The only real guy was Samantha's boyfriend who didn't seem wimpy, but apparently was getting bored of banging her or something. Not surprised. And when she wanted to leave him, he was like ""okay, that's cool"". He didn't seem too bothered by it, which is not surprising. Why stay with an emotional and intellectual black hole like Samantha who offers nothing expect that she happens to have a vaj.I know these people are meant to be caricatures and it's a parody of rich women in NYC... but is it? I think this is the feminist, gay Hollywood fantasy. This movie is what we are left with after decades of feminism. Entitled, selfish princesses, and wimpy guys with no masculinity because we've beaten it out of them. A mans only purpose is to serve women. Eff that. Don't get me wrong there are still good women out there, but you won't find them in this movie.",Sex and the City

129,Darkweasel,You'll ignore this review once you see I'm male.,1,18 September 2008,"My wife watched the TV series. In other words that means I had to watch the TV series. I didn't hate it. A lot of episodes were good, some were bad, the rest were just average.This film was an insult to any fan of the show and I'm surprised so many ""real fans"" were suckered in by it. What happened to the characters? Well, for the most part the couples were needlessly pulled apart merely as a plot device to put them back together again later on in another glaringly obvious saccharine reunion scene. The only story which actually seemed natural was Samantha's, and Charlotte's baby story was a slap in the face to the TV series. Also, what was with the clothes? Did the makers intentionally try to make the stars of the show look as ridiculous and old as possible. I'm sorry, but Sarah Jessica Parker has the arms of a 60 year old and they should not be highlighted in any way. The ginger one's (2nd?) haircut did her no favours whatsoever unless she actually wanted to look seventy years old.In short, I may only be a bloke so most/all women on here will immediately shrug their shoulders and say I don't know what I'm talking about. However, I do know enough to realise when a show's creator is manipulating and cheating the very audience who helped make him successful.",Sex and the City
130,Grant_Price,More predictable than your mother in the bedroom.,4,5 June 2008,"Ah. The most unwarranted film since Lethal Weapon 4 is finally here. Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte are back in all their Prada adorned splendour to deal out powerful life lessons to women over forty everywhere. Taking its cues from the TV show which lasted nearly forever, Sex and the City manages to fill two hours and twenty eight minutes of runtime with break-ups, sex, shopping and drinking. It doesn't exactly break boundaries, but then people who willingly queue up to see this aren't really looking for challenging viewing on the level of Irreversible, are they? However, the core demographic may feel a little short changed by writer/director Michael Patrick King's approach, who does nothing whatsoever to show that the ladies have matured in any way. Carrie is still incredibly narcissistic, Samantha is still a nymphomaniac, Charlotte continues to waltz through her unrealistic life made of candy floss and Miranda remains sarcastic and pessimistic. Is this the message King wants to give? 'People don't change, they just get older until they die and have to be really lucky to find someone who tolerates them enough to stay with them. Chances are that you will die alone. Enjoy!' Also, guys in the audience may feel slightly bemused in the way that King presents all males as either one-dimensional puppets controlled by their girlfriends, cheats or gays. All this shows is that King must have had severe oedipal issues when he was younger.The performances are essentially the same as the ones the cast nurtured for ten years, which is to say they are neither interesting nor offensive. There is one instance about a third of the way through the film in which Charlotte (Kristin Davis) tries to stretch her acting abilities to include furious anger, but it just sounds like somebody stepped on a small dog's tail. One performance does actually stand out, that of 'Bald Guy Husband' played by Evan Handler, who is so spectacularly bad that I wish there was a spin off film just for him. In a scene where Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is talking, with a strained attempt at gravitas, to Charlotte about forgiveness, Bald Guy Husband sits there grinning inanely and staring at the side of Charlotte's face. Sometimes he interjects, always with a big smile on his perfectly round head, and then turns back to stare at his wife like a rapist. Magnificent.It is perplexing that the director felt the need to include three extended fashion commercials in the film, which could only have been there to secure funding and to pad the already so-long-I-wish-I-was-dead running time. The first is a wedding shoot for Vogue which could be argued is necessary to SATC's plot if it wasn't fifty eight minutes long. The second involves Carrie giving a Louis Vitton handbag to her superfluous assistant Jennifer Hudson, which is accompanied by a bizarrely emotional string arrangement indicating that receiving the bag is the equivalent of managing to escape from a concentration camp. Finally there is a catwalk show which is there solely to present a bunch of clothes to nobody in particular. The girls literally go in, watch it, then leave and go back to the story.Sex and the City certainly isn't a good film, but similarly isn't the fiasco it easily could have been had King decided to introduce a number of new characters and focus less on the awesome foursome. It doesn't contain the characteristic wit of the television series and relies heavily on visual humour to induce laughter, although these jokes are more suitable for three year-olds (Diarrhoea! A dog dry humping stuff! Get it while it's hot ladies!) Samantha's 'fat' stomach IS funny, but only because it will probably offend all the actual fat girls in the audience i.e. the majority. Overall, for fans SATC provides an enjoyable, light-hearted conclusion to the girls' stories while for the rest of us it is more like how Carrie Bradshaw feels about Botox: ""Painful and unnecessary.""",Sex and the City
131,churchofsunshine,On the fence with this one - not sure which way to jump.,5,8 October 2008,"I can't help but think that the producers of the ""Sex and the City"" movie were on something of a hiding to nothing. People who have never seen the TV show were never likely to pay to go and see the movie in the first place, while those who have seen every episode of the TV show might go and watch the film but would also be among it's fiercest critics. Maybe it is just the people who have seen the odd episode - the casual viewer - who might be the most forgiving and enjoy this film the most.If you're going to make a film out of a successful TV series the usual thing is to throw more money at it and make it look like something bigger and better than the series it arose from. In the world of sci-fi and stuff like ""Star Trek"" it's just a matter of throwing in a few space battles, but as far as shows like this are concerned, the difference between the TV series and the movie is much less noticeable.The biggest problem is probably the bum-numbing 2hours plus running time - and that's just the standard version, not the DVD extended edition (!) I put this in my DVD player at 8.30 at night. By 10pm with three quarters of an hour still to go, I'd had enough and switched off to watch the rest next day, and that really isn't a good sign - essentially its not good enough to watch in one viewing, but not bad enough that I would switch it off and give up altogether. At least I did watch the final 45minutes before sitting down to write this review. Apparently, this film is the fasting selling DVD so far of 2008 in the UK, due in no small part to a number of High Street retailers aggressive pricing policy on its release - retailing at as little as £8 in supermarkets like Tesco, it's no surprise this movie has shifted so many copies so quickly, but that doesn't really mean it's much good. Most of the budget almost certainly went on the costumes, and if ""Sex and the City"" is up for any Oscars or Emmys in the coming year, this is where they will be won - after all, there are four quite glamorous leading ladies in the cast, and Sarah Jessica Parker is something of a fashion icon. She wouldn't be my first-choice to date (that would be Kristin Davis, who I believe is the only cast member never to have actually won an Emmy during the shows original TV run), but I wouldn't say no if you get my drift. I suppose more than anything this is a chick flick, and as a male this film isn't really aimed at me either. I've seen only a handful of episodes from seasons one and two of the show, and I wouldn't go out of my way to watch this film again. I've seen it and now will probably sell the DVD on again next time there is a free listing day on eBay. It's not a keeper. Not for me at any rate - it's technically well made with good costume design, but severely overlong and not that different in scope or better than the TV series. I'm not sure why it did so well at the cinemas. Even the plot wasn't original and could be guessed at well in advance. I wasn't sure whether to give a 4 or a 5 out of 10 for this film. In the end, I gave a five. I can't help but feeling that is rather generous of me. Maybe my love for some of the female cast is clouding my judgement (!)",Sex and the City
132,amandagellar-31077,An OK Continuation of the Series,7,25 July 2019,"TV to film is a tough transition. With TV, you get much more time to develop characters and it relies much more on character interactions and situations to keep the viewer engaged. With film, it tends to be more plot driven and the episodic nature of TV doesn't always go well on a huge screen for some reason.Sex and the City's transition from TV to big screen is a little bit bumpy (as expected), but it's not the disaster it could (and maybe should) have been.It picks up where the series ended and sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw has finally nabbed her prince charming affectionately named Mr. Big. She finally decides to move into his place and sell her old brownstone as they prepare to get married. Disaster hits during the wedding and the rest of the film could be called ""How Carrie Got Her Groove Back.""Sex and the City is a bit overlong at well over two hours, but the cast is as committed as ever and they do still feel like the people we got to know and love over several seasons of the TV show. There are some good laughs and even some attempts at real drama. Some of these moments work better than others, but it's hard to say that Sex and the City is ever boring. It's lost a bit of its luster during the transition, but if we're being honest, the last few seasons of the show had lost a little of that luster, too.",Sex and the City
133,Unlimitedmovies,Entertaining Movie But Message Makes Women Look Cheap,4,30 May 2008,"I have only seen two episodes of Sex And The City in my life so I went into this movie not sure if I would like it. After seeing it last night,I have given it a four but I'm torn about my rating. I want to give it a higher number but I feel that it cheapens women so I am giving it a four.I'll start with the positives about the movie. The characters are interesting and funny. The clothes were fabulous(my husband hated them). The scenes held your interest. Now the negatives: Women who have sex outside of marriage are cheapening themselves. Women are sleeping around and saying it's acceptable and it's not. No matter how you justify it, it is wrong. I don't like the fact that this movie actually promotes women sleeping around. Even though Kim Catrell's character was funny, she acted like a slut. In some scenes they dress like hookers. I can't relate to the money these women seem to have available. I can't afford their clothes or $525 shoes. I can't afford to hire an assistant or spend money jetting off to Mexico on a whim to help out a close friend. I can't buy a Louis Vuitton handbag for me much less for a friend/employee. I doubt I will ever have front row seats at a fashion show. It looks to me that the characters are a little shallow. It seems to take an effort for them to have true feelings for other people. I couldn't believe that Kim Catrell dumped the man who stood by her side during her illness or complained because the man bought her a ring and she couldn't buy it for herself or got mad at him because he was working and she is lying on the table naked covered in sushi. Many women would LOVE to have a man who works hard.The movie is entertaining. But I hope that women, especially young women who watch this movie don't think that it's OK to have a lifestyle like this. Sleeping around, having a diva mentality, being impressed with material goods and labels, and not doing any community service but have lots of time to meet with the girls, hang out in bars and restaurants, and shop, is not the type of lifestyle that any young woman should be proud of. I wish a producer would come out with a movie about a woman who is independent but loving and compassionate, who is looking for a good man and won't sleep with them until marriage; who believes that education is important and giving back to society thru community service is the way to live. Who has an eye for style but will buy some nice pieces and mix them up with thrift store finds. Who is a loyal friend, but surrounds herself with women who won't compromise their values and will only date quality men; men with character, not based on looks or sex. A movie where character is more important than money. Wouldn't that be a novel idea?",Sex and the City
134,wondernat,Great closure for the fans!,8,15 June 2008,"As a FAN of SATC, I absolutely LOVED this movie. It was such a sweet ending to this modern-day middle-aged fairy tale ride that Carrie & Co. took us along on for nearly 10 years. I'm so glad they made this movie! However, since I like to think of myself as objective, I'll lay out the little things that threw me off. It should be noted that this movie was WAY sadder than I had expected; indeed, some plot twists I felt were thrown in just for the sake of cheap movie drama, i.e., Steve does something in the movie that made several fans in the audience gasp. My chin dropped in utter disbelief - surely, not Steve Brady! Also to note is Carrie's hideous outfits. As all SATC fans know, when she dresses cute, she's CUTE. When she's off, boy, are her outfits FUGLY! (Still wincing at the memory of some of her outfits.) Another thing I didn't like: Samantha didn't have ANY *hot* *hot* sex. :( So uncharacteristic. Plus, when she reveals a little tummy roll, everyone freaks out and calls it a gut. Hm, OK. Right. SOOOO FAT. How dare she have a tummy roll. *eye roll* Oh, and two whiny queens that you NEVER expect to HOOK UP. Another UHHHHHHHHH... Okay.... this is the movie.....Alrighty, so WOW. I absolutely loved this movie because despite these detours from the original material, it was still a great conclusion to 8 years of great programming. The movie, like each episode, was cheesy, emotional, hilarious, and to the point. It celebrates the power of sisterhood and reminds us all that being single and fabulous can sometimes be the best situation for a smart and strong woman because the relationship she has with herself is truly the most important one.The jokes were of SATC caliber (""Poo-keepsie-d"") and the ladies were at their best. Even Cynthia Nixon gets to show us a Miranda that's incredibly strong yet ridiculously vulnerable. I truly felt for her in many scenes. I have to say she and Carrie got the most love in the silver screen, while Samantha was almost all but excluded from the movie (not cool w/ me) and we finally get to see Charlotte's fairy tale life. (ooh, Charlotte fans: you will ADORE the little development they throw for us here!) If you're exclusively a Samantha fan you probably won't enjoy the movie too much, but rest assured that if you were unsatisfied when you watched Carrie pick up John's telephone call on her cell, you won't be disappointed.It was truly worthy of the television series we have all come to love.",Sex and the City
135,filmdolly,Don't believe the 4.6 rating or the negative comments. Loved it!,10,2 June 2008,"Honestly, I was appalled when I read the initial reviews on this film. I had been looking forward to finding out what happened to Carrie and Big, as well as Samantha and Smith, but I was nearly frightened away by the really undeserved negative reviews of this film. Thankfully, I had bought advanced tickets at a Luxe theater and was committed. This movie was completely true to the characters as any fan of Sex and the City, the TV series, will know. If you loved them then, you will love them now. Each character has new challenges or different problems to deal with, except Charlotte, who truly seems to be happy and grateful for what she has. I laughed out loud often and cried, just a little. The theater we went to served Cosmopolitans and made it the event it deserved to be. New York was a minor character in the film as were the shoes and bags and fashions. Anthony Marantino's wedding planner was great and not so nearly over the top as he can be. Finally seeing Stanford for the great guy he is, was just a perk. Many of the other series characters were still represented, but this movie was, a story about the relationship between four female friends, helping each other through life and love. IMHO, this is about characters as real and flawed as American Beauty ever thought of being, but no one had to die, nor did I want to kill myself for having wasted the time watching it. If I had one complaint it was that the nudity and sex scenes were a bit gratuitous and seemed easily cut out of the film when the time comes to put it on TV, but other than that I will see this film again. I am thrilled with how the director and the actors carried forth from the series end. It was hysterical to watch the monogamous Samantha eat her way through her lust for another. Not to mention, just the teeniest bit sad. There were so many moments of pure joy and disbelief, as well as bittersweet reality So, don't believe all the negative hoopla and the woefully low rating of 4.6! Why can't a ""chick flick"" ever get a decent score on this site? My 10/10 hopefully will start to balance this out. So, boys, take your girl, she may just thank you. And girls, let's get that rating up. The big box office this past weekend was because of us.",Sex and the City
136,WHYeat,The mother of all chick flicks,6,29 May 2010,"Sex and the City is about women, and in order to condense the essence of the female mind into a show or movie we are presented with 4 very different women. Charlotte is the good wholesome girl. Samantha is the promiscuous, independent, A-lister. Miranda is the logical workaholic, who's sometimes a party pooper. Carrie is the successful writer and fashionista who holds this group of girls together. Though fashion, sex, and glamor are central to the franchise, the conversation is what makes Sex and the City what it is. The topic of conversation? Sex and Love. It's the unadulterated thoughts of all women funneled into just 4. Guys, if this sounds horrible, then stop watching Entourage because it's the same damn thing.The movie picks up after the end of the TV series, so during the opening credits, a quick recap brings us clueless men up to speed. Charlotte is happily married with an adopted child. Samantha is in Los Angeles managing a celebrity who's also her boyfriend. Miranda is in Brooklyn with her husband and son. Last but not least, Carrie has written three successful books and is in a serious relationship with ""Mr. Big"". I get the impression that the movie is trying to tie up all the loose ends of the TV series. It's the big finale that 30 minutes couldn't provide. And like any proper finale to a show about love, Sex and the City is about marriage – that of Carrie and Big. Of course, their wedding has to be spectacular.Fashion and glamor. I can appreciate the fashion although I'd say Sex and the City is a hit and miss in this department. At times Carrie would have on the most dreadful clothes that supposedly passes for high fashion. But when she gets it right she's spot on. The wedding dresses she wears for the Vogue photo shoot are amazing: Vera Wang, Carolina Herrera, Christian Lacroix, Lanvin, Dior, Oscar de la Renta, and Vivienne Westwood. All were stunning. The white dress with the giant flower – no. The best fashion segment of the movie is when Carrie clears her closet of old clothes and models her 80's fashion faux pas. It's horrible and yet so funny how fashion can quickly go out of style.But love – love never goes out of style. And that's what the movie is about.Charlotte is perhaps the luckiest of the bunch as she proclaims that she is happy every single day. She has such good fortune that her contribution to the lessons learned at the end of the movie is minimal. The one thing her character brings to the table is that miracles do happen. Charlotte and her husband have tried numerous times and failed on every occasion to have a child the old fashion way. They resorted to adoption. However, during the movie she becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl.Against every fiber in her body, Samantha finds the strength to be faithful to her Hollywood boyfriend who's so busy he missed the chance to eat sushi off her naked body for Valentine's Day. Samantha is not the type to cook or wait around for all day for a man to come home. Even though he was there for her through chemo, she eventually had to leave him. She loved him, but she loved herself more, and the only way to be happy was to be free. She couldn't change who she was.Miranda, being a busy lawyer, said, ""let's get it over with"" during sex. Her marriage and sex life has always taken a back seat to work and that resulted in her husband cheating on her. Miranda had to learn forgiveness and make time for her husband. Call me old fashioned, but I can't stand adultery and forgiveness is out of the question. Maybe I need to get with the times.Finally, Carrie gets carried away with wedding plans and her small group of 75 guests grows larger than 200 when she scores a spot in Vogue magazine as the 40 year old bride. Carrie would be Big's 3rd wife, so he wants to keep the wedding simple and discrete, but all the attention gives him cold feet. He stands her up at their wedding. As a result, Carrie falls into a deep state of depression, which she overcomes with the aid of her good friends. Having parted ways, she returns to their vacant apartment to save a pair of her $500 shoes before the landlord changes the locks. She finds that Big has already beaten her to it. He had come to save her shoes and motivated by emotion rather than logic she throws her arms around him and kisses him. In the end, they get married, but without all the glamor. It's just Big and Carrie in a label-less dress. Reflecting, Carrie says, ""We were perfectly happy before we decided to live happily ever after."" It's strange that weddings get blown out of proportion. It's simply love uniting man and woman. All the hype, fancy clothes, and glamorous presentation that encompasses weddings don't change a thing. After the honeymoon, it's just man and woman. If you can't be happy without the wedding, then maybe you weren't truly happy to begin with.Watching this movie provides men with a glimpse into a woman's inner most thoughts. The inner sanctum of womankind. I suspect women and their friends look at Charlotte, Samantha, Miranda, and Carrie and they see a bit of themselves. They can relate. So if you're looking to understand women a little better, then give Sex and the City a shot. Otherwise, you can safely ignore it.Unequivocally, Rated Chick Read more chick flick reviews for men @ RatedChick.com",Sex and the City
137,Blueskies4020,WASTE OF TIME.,10,18 March 2018,"I'm sorry it just didn't work for me. I was on a Sex and the City marathon and watched all the episodes before watching this movie, and I regret to say that I was more than just disappointed. The characters weren't being played properly, it was way too extravagant, there seemed not much connection between the characters, and in some instances it just looked downright forced. There were some really gorgeous scenes in the movie though, and I would only recommend this movie for the fancy dresses and the fancy shoes. It all just looked too fake and unrealistic. The most annoying thing that I felt throughout this series was Chris Noth. Terrible acting, terrible scripts, childish and dumb decision making skills. You cannot understand where most of the main characters are coming from. To me it felt there was hardly any determination from the actors to really play their characters. The series was much better.",Sex and the City
138,whitakeroh,The End of Anything Honorable About Western Women,1,5 August 2008,"When I was a young boy I remember being around women like my mother, grandmother, sister, aunts, cousins, friends. I remembered that women were kind and generous and caring.As I got older (I am now 27) a peculiar shift in women occurred. For one I started to like them obviously but secondly I noticed that women started to become pompous arrogant divas. I was about 19 when I started to realize that the typical American woman is one of the most spoiled, arrogant, selfish people the world has ever really known. What was the reason for this I wondered.As I went through college I paid attention to women's behavior whom I went on dates with, whom I dated for long periods, and whom I worked with and was friends with. I notice that most young women are very, very similar and they incorrectly think their ""free spirits"" when, in fact, their hearts and souls are owned by industry and shallow trinkets. Why? One reason: Movies and TV shows like Sex and the City, People magazine, America's Next Top Model, All things MTV, Celebrities, etc. Suburban white girls who suffer from PPS (Pampered Princess Syndrome) This movie possibly represents all that is wrong with the woman America is producing. It also reflects the pathetic depths to which once proud American men have sank to in order to appease Ms. Princess. This movie celebrates being a high priced whore, what a great message for young women. I thought we were supposed to encourage, ""being yourself and having high self esteem"" funny really, that women create images for themselves that are the opposite of what they preach.Why was this movie made? The cast is awful, the plot is non-existent. The message is horrible and the reality is that shows and movies like SATC create a false sense of reality. Any men who are reading this must agree with me. In fact most men I know, that have not been conquered by SATC NYC princesses, decidedly are disappointed with the quality of American women. I must believe it is due to the filth which they idealize, such filth being espoused as the pinnacle of happiness for women in movies like SATC. Unbelievable. I despise this movie with intense passion.DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN FIRST AND FOREMOST AS A FATHER TO DISSUADE YOUR WIFE AND/OR DAUGHTER FROM SEEING THIS.How sad it is that American women inwardly wish they lived like the women in SATC. Pathetic.",Sex and the City

For those who liked the series, it will be like a long episode or an afternoon with a six-pack episode.It left a taste of wanting more. I was happy that the series ended without losing the quality of the script. And I am happy to she that this quality is still there.

140,laraemeadows,Anyone have a time machine so they can warn me about this movie?,2,29 May 2008,"The much loved HBO show characters Carrie, Charlotte, Samantha and Miranda come to the big screen in Sex and the City. A cheap, shallow, and annoying waste of film that made me shake my head so often, my neck needs chiropractic adjustment.This travesty of character and plot development obliterates any chance I would even call Sex and the City a film instead of a TV movie with really good distribution. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) spends the entire TV movie trying to get married to Big (Chris Noth). Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) spends the entire TV movie trying to stay married to Steve (David Eigenberg). Samantha (Kim Cattrall) spends the entire TV movie trying to get laid. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) spends the entire TV movie, er, uhm, hmm, well, with nice hair. All the designers of New York masturbate all over the audience.The writer and director, Michael Patrick King, didn't bother to make one plot that went smoothly through the entire movie. Instead, Michael Patrick King lumped four episodes together, but took out the theme song and credits. Even though there is a somewhat lengthy introduction at the beginning of the movie, this enhanced TV movie absolutely requires that the watcher has seen the HBO show Sex and the City, is familiar with the characters, and the events in their lives. The shoddy writing makes a synopsis nearly impossible.Sex and the City jumped the shark when a fart joke lasts a solid three minutes and eventually saves the day. Then it turned right around, lined back up and jumped it again when a character's weight causes an entire party to take notice. Who knew that slapstick humor had a place in a chick flick. The whirring and whizzing past my head deafened me as Sex and the City went through an entire tank of gas leaping over selected marine life.Now I like a pretty dress and shoes like the next girl but I would never consider spending millions of dollars on a movie slated to come out in the summer blockbuster season to try to get the audience to worship at the altar of designer shoes. As much as Michael Patrick King wants shoes to be a character or even a plot driver, they aren't. Am I the only person in the world who thinks a two foot flower on a five foot woman makes her look a little insane? It seems I am alone in the feeling that sleeves should not be wider than the woman. Is it possible that douche-baggery can be transferred to Sex and the City? I think so.Unless hair dye counts, there is no character development in Sex in the City. After spending two and a half hours of my life with these characters, I didn't gain a single insight into the girls I didn't already know because the point of the movie is nothing changes. The only character who does anything interesting is Steve, Miranda's husband. Too bad his screen time comes to a whopping 15 minutes all together.There is one cute scene where the girls start to talk about using the euphemism ""coloring."" The conversation goes on for some time and is the most entertaining part of the movie.I would give anything to get the two and a half hours back I wasted on this Sex in the City. I would actually have sex in a city. I might even buy some shoes. I am considering suing Michael Patrick King to make him build me a time machine, test it on monkeys and little furry bunnies, go back in time to May 28, 2008 at 6:45pm at the Kabuki Theater in San Francisco and prevent me from ever seeing Sex and the City.",Sex and the City

Or rather worrying. Do some people really want to live like this? Is this a model for someone? I can't believe it. I am still shocked. Did I write that already?

This movie plays like a parody of itself, which is unfortunate because that is usually when a series (or story) should come to it's timely end.

143,jhunt709,Glamour and Grit.,9,5 June 2010,"The movie adaptation of television series 'Sex And The City' progresses the New York lives of four women who balance labour and love alongside their close friendship. Despite the brand representing female empowerment, it also proves insightful and entertaining to some heterosexual males (such as myself) who are comfortable enough with our own sexuality to overlook its feminine image.The standard format of an episode of the hit show saw writer Carrie Bradshaw drawing from her experiences with friends to address the subject matter of her newspaper column. This winning formula guaranteed the achievement of both plot and character resolution while daringly sitting on the fence separating the views of men and women; 'Sex And The City' may have tarred all men with the same brush, but often the show invited viewers to consider how the ladies themselves were at fault in a given situation. This aspect is carried over well in the big screen transition, presenting itself as a bold staple of the overall plot. When Carrie and 'manfriend' Mr. Big decide to get married after he solely finances their new property, their love begins to strain under the pressure of organising the wedding service. Her faith in long-term partner John shattered, Carrie decides to attend to other affairs as she comes to terms with being jilted on the day of the ceremony. While the famous foursome all have rewarding character arcs that (in one case literally) explore the pros and cons of relationships, Carrie's challenges the resolve of women as much as it does men. This equal opportunity approach balances the feature throughout its sluggish running time, representing the battle of the sexes - that the franchise owes much of its appeal to - in a fair manner . The characters are not portrayed as the victims they consider themselves, leaving them vulnerable to criticism (note how they appear to be the main target of any external negativity), but ultimately this gives the film some vital weight. Dialogue is often rich and contested, whether it be friendly discussion or heated arguments. These displays of the human condition are particularly rewarding in light of the fact that 'Sex And The City' could easily have played it safe as a feel-good chick flick, but instead it refreshingly chooses to visit much darker emotions, and for this it must be applauded.Undebatably the film can be labelled as a glorified, extended episode (what more would the fans want?), and of course there's the product placement, fashion montages and endless wardrobe that pander to lovers of the liberating vibe; but beyond the shallow surface is a film that balances all of this glamour with some truly visceral conflict.9/10",Sex and the City
144,martin_g_karlsson,Contrived and Unsexy,4,13 January 2009,"While the TV-series, as Bushnells chronicles, was kind of shallow and well... stupid, in some respects, SATC did have a certain zing and friskiness, and it was entertaining and even at times exciting to take part of Carrie's and the others lives. It carried a slight feminist edge, as women had rarely been portrayed talking relationships and sex in a candid way, before. The film however has no emotional resonance above a typical half-assed rom-com. It seems that they only took the shallow and stupid stuff of the series, and created a rather contrived left-at-the-alter plot, far removed from the light touch, that was there, in the writing of the series. The characters only vaguely resemble human beings. Any feminist touch seems blown out the wind. I did find the film to have a certain entertainment value though, at times.",Sex and the City
145,foOki,A Good Way to Finish the Story,7,6 June 2008,"It's interesting reading the different reviews here. Everyone's entitled to an opinion of course, but I see a lot of people badgering this film for being, exactly, what the series was. When these very same people admit to liking/ loving the series.I've seen pretty much most episodes more than once either with girlfriends or... even when it was on, it was just me at home and I actually had a choice! I did find it a little sad that often, women would want to live their lives through the characters though (well, maybe being Charlotte isn't a bad thing), as the characters were tremendously flawed and shallow. I mean, I love Californication, but I don't want to be Hank. I just see bits of similarities in him (the good, bad, and the ugly).I was also bemused that so many women said it was a show for feminists. When deep down the show was about women aiming to be completed by men (or at least searching for this) and sadly, by also acting like, what actually would be considered bad masculine qualities. Have a perfect guy? Naa, too boring, go after the one who's still married... then complain that men are all the same. Even more interesting that most episodes were written by men... and directed by men... (yes, based on a novel by a woman, but still, you get my drift) but, I'm waffling. Point being, it was still a very well made series and deserved it's accolades. Well directed, edited and crafted.While through it all, the characters had a strong bond with each other, through thick and thin, and good and bad choices. So, onto the actual film... I think it went exactly where it had to. The characters learn't a little more about themselves, and actually, grew up a little. Yes, I know a lot of people have mentioned that they thought they were more immature than in the series, but, the difference is, before, everyone said one thing (eg; I'm strong, and don't need men to be a successful woman), and acted another (continuing to follow their men around). Where as now, they're actually doing what they're saying. They were actually mourning, angry, happy, etc, but acknowledging it. They may still make mistakes, but at least they're no longer pretending to be stronger than they really are. After all, being a strong woman doesn't mean one can't get upset or show 'weakness'. Whether you believe in their choices in the film is another matter though.Maybe the viewers are growing up and think that SATC isn't what they thought it was, or maybe there are a lot of jaded men out there who just wanted to give it low ratings out of resentment, but, I definitely don't think it deserves to be panned so much when absolute drivel like Transformers gets 7.5 (are you kidding me????).",Sex and the City
146,rich-228,A mixed bag,6,15 June 2008,"I'm a gay man, and I wonder what I would have thought of this movie if I hadn't seen it with a friend and spent a lot of time talking about the clothes, shoes, jewelry, etc.Without giving away the ending, I do give the writers and producers points from keeping that part of the plot from being predictable.The 4 main characters are pretty much themselves, and it was nice to see that, though they have aged well, they Have Aged. Interesting too, to see where their relationships have taken them.Unfortunately (for most), the entire production is full of lots and lots of clothes, shoes, etc. Does anyone really dress up that much? I don't think so, not unless they're making a movie. Seeing Cynthia Nixon (Miranda) so over-styled is particularly dismaying.There's also a problem with pacing. About 30 minutes in, things seem to slow down a bit - and they never really speed back up. I kept waiting for the ending. And waiting and waiting.Quite gimmicky to throw Jennifer Hudson in there to be Carrie's assistant. Is this to make up for the fact that the TV series almost never had any blacks? All that being said, die-hard fans are probably going to enjoy the film. There is a lot of loyalty to Carrie et soeurs. But if you're not a big fan of the series, you might want to wait for DVD.",Sex and the City
147,Jodelle,So-so in the City,6,7 June 2008,"Overall, worth seeing if you are a fan of the series. However, there are a lot of weaknesses in the movie.Mr. Big does something before the wedding, right before, that seems completely weak and out of character for Mr. Big. It seemed downright wimpy for any man! And much of the movie is based on his lack of judgment prior to the wedding, therefore, in my view the movie unravels right there.Moving forward, even if it was a plausible character action on his part, it seems evident to me that most of the other actors are rusty in their own characters. I think Miranda and Samantha still seemed in the zone, but Carrie, Charlotte, Steve, and even Anthony seemed to me to be slightly off. I kept trying to figure out if it was just seeing them on the big screen, but I think it was more than that; Charlotte seemed more outgoing and expressive than in the series, Carrie seemed to actually know herself less, Anthony wasn't as punchy, and Steve seemed to be sick. It just didn't feel right.Jennifer Hudson definitely feels token. But for a newly introduced character who had to make her mark in one fell swoop, I think it was the best she/they could do. I didn't feel the chemistry between her character and Carrie, however. The movie tries to make it an important piece of the pie in the plot but it felt devoid of depth.I like how they tie up the story lines and as a fan, I am glad they made this movie. It is hit and miss but worth viewing.",Sex and the City
148,thirteeninchwinch,A Long Episode,6,28 June 2012,"For the greater good of the plot, the first hour was dedicated to breaking down everything that had been so neatly wrapped up on the TV series. In the end this was forgivable as the back end was an enjoyable and redeeming experience, recapturing the wit and humour of the TV series. By the end of the movie 3/4 have refound their happy ever after, and while the end result was good, it just seemed, well, pointless. Samantha being left single again was almost too easy, as she was always the most happy single. Just as I was before viewing the film, I remain ambivalent towards the concept of a sex and the city movie.",Sex and the City
149,spacechick2003,"Plot disappoints, the frocks do not!",5,20 October 2008,"It has been four years since SATC left the small screen, so the question in my mind was would it live up to the hype on the big screen? I would answer yes and no (not because of an on-going argument between me and my imaginary friend) but because I am still undecided. I may yet remain undecided. In fact, re-reading this, I can see that I am in at least two minds about it.The women are four years older than when we last saw them in the series and without being unkind, they look it. Don't get me wrong, I am glad that the actresses are a bit more mature and that they don't look botoxed and pumped full of silicone. They all sported very thin figures for the movie, yet in both the TV show and the movie they are often seen eating. Mind you, plates of what looked leaves and grass and the dish de jour, sushi are all regularly featured. To my mind, diets like this would suit rabbits and cats, but regular women? I think I will pass on that.The women's stories have moved on a bit. Carrie (played by SJP) is happily living in unmarried bliss with Big (Chris Noth), whose real name happens to be John James Prescott. I don't think it takes much imagination to figure out where the name Big came from originally. (Big car, big bank account, big ego you dirty-minded people). If it was because he has a big penis, we never found out in this movie. Most of the sex and nudity is provided courtesy of Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) and her husband, Steve (David Eidenberg).Charlotte Yorke (Kristen Davis) and her balding, fat (but nonetheless rich and successful husband) Harry are living happily ever after adopting a little Chinese girl. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) has moved to LA to manage her lover Smith's (Jason Lewis) career as a movie star. She still finds the time to jet back and forth on a regular basis to New York to be with her friends.Without wanting to give too much of the plot away, did the idea translate well to the big screen? Yes, in that the gorgeous fashions can be drooled over in even greater detail. Yes, the soundtrack was pretty groovy too. Oh and Sam's new neighbour, Dante, showering in the buff looked, well, big on the big screen.I thought the movie was a bit lacking in the humour of the TV shows. Although the show was ground-breaking when it hit the airwaves, is there any so called sexually taboo topic that hasn't been discussed in great detail left? On the evidence of this movie, there is not. Or maybe it is because they are all in stable (more or less) relationships that the dirty, funny, sex talk is not the main topic up for discussion any more.Don't get me wrong, there is a very funny scene when Sam takes Miranda to task for letting her pubic hair grow wild and free. Au natural might be OK in colder climes like Britain when you are practically guaranteed that no-one (including your fella) will catch so much a glimpse of your naked body for nine months out the twelve. However, if you are sunbathing you really don't want to look like you sporting a fair bit of foliage down there.The movie probably ticked all the right boxes for SATC fans, break-ups and make-ups, some sex and nudity, high fashion, New York (only the nice places), shoes, fabulous apartments, women who have it all. So yes it worked in that sense. It did seem to drag a bit as a movie (and the main story of Big not turning up to him and Carrie's wedding was no big surprise). Never fear though, all turns out for the best in the end.So it is not exactly intellectually stimulating, but then nobody would expect it to be so. To me, the main theme of the movie should be the over-riding friendship between the four central characters. Which begs the question, why oh why was Jennifer Hudson introduced as Carrie's PA? She seemed totally out of place and I know I am not the only person to wonder what the hell her purpose in the movie was. Perhaps to illustrate that true happiness can only be acquired through the acquisition of your own Chanel/Fendi or whatever the label of the moment is.I must admit that although the conspicuous consumption did not really bother me in the series, it actually made me very uncomfortable in the movie. I can assure all you guys reading (if any) that not all women are satisfied with enormous wardrobes and a shoe collection to put Imelda Marcos to shame! We actually require some intelligent conversation (and it doesn't always have to revolve around feelings either).Oh and one final rant. Come on, the preparations for the wedding between Big and Carrie were outrageous. I especially hated the bit when SJP paraded around in white gowns. Call me old-fashioned (and I'm not) but is it not considered inappropriate to wear a white gown to your wedding if you a)are over a certain age b) you lost your virginity over two decades ago c)the fact that your husband to be is on his 3rd marriage? Having said all that, I couldn't help but wonder, should they consider making a SATC II? My answer would be a resounding no. I was pleased I have caught the movie so that I could catch up with the women. Now, with hindsight, I wish they had left us with the great memories of the series.(Oh but I was so pleased to hear that 50 is the new 40, I'll raise a cosmopolitan to that)!",Sex and the City
150,cybamuse,It's not THAT bad!,7,3 June 2008,"Goodness! I came away from the movie feeling like love can conquer all, even after 40 - which for the growing number of single women in their 30s and 40s is a pleasant feeling! And why is it so bad these women wanted/didn't want a man in their lives? None of these women sacrificed being the 'strong' women they were in the series, they were still just as happy being successful in their chosen life path as before they found their men.I admit, the premise for the 'gut wrenching' twist in the movie was very weak, but then, they always are in Hollywood. However, without whining about the other plot weaknesses, I'd still say I came away entertained and satisfied with the money spent. The moments where it felt like one big advert - well - they were trying to cram 13 episodes of fashion into 5 in a sense....And as to the ending, I don't think anyone would have wanted it any other way - they would have felt more betrayed than the ending that did happen! Any other ending couldn't have happened without several hours of plot development, which 2.5 hours does not allow.Just enjoy this movie for the frivilous fun it is! Sex in the City was never a deep metaphor for our lives today and neither is this film.",Sex and the City
151,nycmec,Eh.,5,17 June 2008,"I was underwhelmed. Most of the negative criticisms ring true to me--too long, too sophomoric, ridiculous plot. The Mr. Big jilts Carrie at the altar premise is soooo tired, and soooo predictable. Perhaps we have just had enough of these characters...But as fluffy candy, it largely works. For those who think that the product placement and label worship run contrary to the spirit of the show... please, spare me. Carrie was always a label queen, and the montage of wedding gowns is beautiful. The costume design by Patricia Field is the best thing about the movie. And the actresses all look great. Is this enough to ""carry"" a movie (insert lame pun per SATC writing handbook)? Eh. I saw it, because as a gay New Yorker I somehow felt obligated. Would I see it again? No. But there are worse ways to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon.",Sex and the City
152,sehyezelic,"Why, oh God why did I watch this",1,24 June 2020,"Why, why did they do this?
Total character development thrown out the window. Carrie being a desperate, all time forgiving, sucker for Mr Big idiot, after all these years is just insulting.
Samantha dumping the guy who she loves because she wants other men, Steve cheating on Miranda, and she forgiving him???
Only two gay guys ending up together even though they hated each other before.
Are you kidding me.
All of the main characters act like the shadow of themselves, the jokes are not witty and Carrie has gotten a lot dumber. The movie serves as a marketing for some brands, and in an too obvious way, it's ridiculous.
Her assistant Lousie has a personality of a closet hanger, what was the point of that character?
Horrible trash.I regret watching this.",Sex and the City
153,Ramalama_FFF,Just a big failure,4,14 December 2010,"It's unbelievable how royally they messed up this one. I wouldn't call myself a fan of the show, but by now I've seen every episode and there are some stuff you could criticize, but overall it was an entertaining show, funny, often witty and characters that were more or less appealing even if they were half caricature.No one expected a genius film here, but it turned out to be not even mediocre, but just plain bad. The writing is bad. The acting is bad (one wonders why). The stories are ridiculous and unnecessary. There is a lot predictable sap. Character development/writing, bad. The music arrangement is very bad and annoying.Then there's the consumerism. Which really was there in the series as well, but first of all it was a smaller scale, and there was a twist of humor about it. Here it just makes it obvious why this movie is as terrible as it is... Half of it is just commercial for brands.The messages are just dishonest and shallow. The film simply lacks substance in this department and tries to pass off stupid ideas as philosophical views on life. The ""I love me"" bits were just a joke.In a desperate attempt of explaining this failure, I would say the answer is just money. The whole purpose was probably to get the early teens hooked on all the products and the lifestyle that these products require. For them the sap isn't quite as predictable for obvious reasons. SATC is simply dumbed down here.",Sex and the City
154,jagaleigh,The 5 ladies return....,6,31 May 2008,"It's been said over & over that this movie was made for the fans of the SATC series. It has been called a love letter to those of us who fell in love with the story lines, the characters, the city, and of course...the clothes.This film is, if nothing else, that long-awaited love letter for which we fans have longed. It allows us to continue walking on the path beside the ladies we grew to know, love, and relate to. I must say, though, that the movie doesn't really move us along too much.Really, it feels a bit like catching up with an old friend after bumping into him/her at a diner. We ask them to sit with us and let us know what's been going on with them, and they fill us in. All in all, it was nice to get a glimpse into that world again.This film is not without it's flaws/shortcomings, however.The often quick-handed editing can make you feel a little dizzy, the silliness is heavier than the actual humor at times, and the length of it (while it kind of feels as though it moves quickly) may leave your butt a bit asleep by films' end. Something about this movie just left me feeling more...flat(?)...than I thought I would.Those issues aside, I was THRILLED to have finally seen this project on the big screen.I think most people will walk away from the experience feeling glad they viewed the film, as well...though I wonder how many will write reviews echoing my feelings on the editing.I give it a solid 6.5 out of 10 (only allowed to vote in whole numbers, heh.). It was a little like going home again. You know...you're happy to be there but then again, it's kinda crazy and you get a bit of a headache. (um, yeah.) Not award-worthy, honestly, but warm. There you have it.",Sex and the City

The film shifted focus between like seven different plot-lines (most of them better than the main story), The character's actions had NO motivation at all other than for convenient scenes and it was two and a half tedious hours of middle age women spending money frivolously and doing things that made no sense! Some of the laziest writing i've ever seen coupled with mediocre acting and melodrama at it's worst really paints a portrait of how women are perceived in pop culture today. Give them a man and a louis vuitton bag and they'll live happily ever after.

Put on your cruel shoes, big hat and stuff you cocktail money into your designer bag. It was clear from the loud screams during the opening credits that this was going to be a crowd pleaser. You got your four gals, their love interests, gay pals, and new for this film, the obligatory black side-kick girl friend. Jennifer Hudson, you rock girl.Two and a half hours didn't exactly fly by, rather it felt like blitzing an entire season on a great big screen.Highlights: Fully exposed male member,hot simulated sex, fashion, weddings, girl bonding, lots and lots of shoes, & Big's real name and email address (John@jjpny.com)Favorite Quotes: ""40 is the last year a woman can be photographed in a bridal dress without the unintended Diane Arbus reference"".""Why is it that we are willing to write our own vows, but not our own rules.""Personally i have a hard time with the well worn plot twists based on a misunderstanding. I spent a good 80% of the film with an anxious pit in my stomach wondering when the other shoe was going to drop. Oh why doesn't she just check her voice mail messages and see that her man was just working through his own issues. Ultimately these misunderstandings served as life lessons for our gals as they struggled with their relationship issues. Samantha ponders the loss of her identity as part of a ""we"". Miranda and Carrie turn their lives upside down before they come around to seeing their love interest's point of view. Growing up means realizing it's not all about you anymore. Unless of course that's the kind of life you choose. Without revealing the ending i will state that there were smiles all over the lobby, but by the time i got to the parking lot below i found myself front and center of a huge verbal girl fight over blocking the exit lane.

158,AgedInWood,Not even close to the original,5,26 November 2008,"I am a huge fan of the original series so no one was rooting for the movie more than I. Maybe I had my hopes up too high. Maybe the show's successful style didn't translate from small screen to big. Whatever the case, I was disappointed. The plot seemed completely contrived and with the exception of Charlotte, the writing went against everything these women portrayed for six years.Miranda and Steve had a great thing going at the end of the show  why make Steve have a fling to create conflict in their relationship? Why make Miranda colder than she's ever been by taking sex out of her life and then casting her as the bad wife for causing him to stray? Yuck, how very 1950s of the writers. More topical would have been a storyline about the stress of taking care of his mother with Ahlzheimer's and the toll it takes on a marriage.Samantha was shipped off the island, hardly to be seen again. If I never believed that SJP doesn't like Kim Cattrall, I believe it now. Not only did she trash the character by giving her nothing to do and having her put on weight, she had her dressed like Joan Collins circa 1982.As for Carrie Bradshaw, I thought Sarah Jessica Parker looked great (not a wrinkle to be found) and performed beautifully. But and it's a big but, why was the Carrie plot driven by Jennifer Hudson instead of by the cast regulars? Nothing against Jennifer Hudson, but the whole story line felt forced and completely unbelievable.Where was Stanford? Did he have any lines? How do you take the most adorable character seen on the very first episode of the series and give him nothing? Wouldn't it have been great to have a little sub-plot still showing him with Marcus after all the years? And where were Anthony, Harry, Smith and Steve? All were relegated to inconsequential parts that were poorly written, edited or both.What did I like? Big - Chris Noth continues to inhabit this role in the same cool albeit less prickish manner he always has. I liked the girls in Mexico  the old chemistry shined through. I loved the big closet instead of an engagement ring  how very Carrie. And the Vogue photo shoot was to die for  only SJP could pull off those beautiful gowns.I hear there's a trilogy planned. Let us hope they get back to the fabulous-ness that was the original show.",Sex and the City

While it's always been more of a comedy I find the drama is actually very realistic and makes you feel for the characters. The one complaint I have is that it was way too long. The entire story with Jennifer Hudson was completely useless and extremely cheesy. I wish they would have used that time to focus on the known side characters from the show instead.

What I'm saying is you're thinking that you thought that the movie sucked compared to the show. I, will have to respectfully disagree and say no, it did NOT suck. In fact, Sex and the City was a delightful movie, and it was a great pleasure seeing Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis back together. It's been three years since the hit show ended on HBO, and the ladies are back. Carrie has continued her fantastic relationship with Mr. Big, Miranda faces some bumps along the road in her marriage, Samantha has had some trouble staying monogamous, and well, I find it sad that the only thing the producers and writers thought to do with Charlotte was --BIG SHOCK-- have her get pregnant. The movie is good, but has some flaws. It REALLLLYYYYY needs editing, yes, it is possible for this movie to be shorter, and yes, it's possible that it could be rated PG-13, only IF they edited it. Also, the characters need to be a tad more interesting, so I don't fall asleep 3/4 through the movie. Overall, the Manolo Blahnik just fits the foot, and I enjoyed Sex and the City",Sex and the City
161,falconcitypaul,A Wondrous Look at Love and Mid-Life Womanhood,8,20 August 2008,"The ""Sex and the City"" movie introduced me to Carrie Bradshaw and her circle. I had never watched the series. I came to the film without preconceptions and enjoyed it thoroughly. After reading this site I began to doubt my own virgin perceptions. Had I ignorantly bought fool's gold when the real pay dirt payoff lay in the cable series? So I viewed the First Season of the HBO series, becoming utterly charmed by the four main women negotiating the singles dance in 1998 New York. The IMDb site for the show has a lot of savage reactions posted, most of which I have to reject. I found all dozen 1998 episodes quirky and clever and perky and groundbreaking and sharply written and slyly acted.I have known women of that born-in-the-Sixties generation and of my own (which came of age in the Sixties) who talk and act like these folks--though not as flamboyantly or consistently entertainingly. ""Sex"" trades in exaggeration for artistic effect, after all. Some caustic posters seem to confuse louder-than-life satire about Eros and New York with propaganda for la dolce vita in Manhattan.Forearmed with an appreciation of the series' birth year, I re-saw the film at a revival house. This time I came in warily, ready to judge ruthlessly. I liked it even more. I can understand the substantive criticisms on this site. The First Season had a chipper, often ironic tone, lively and saw-edged. Some posters missed enjoying that all over again.The motion picture offers a defiantly darker production. That includes visually darker. In both theaters the image on the screen was subdued, the colors more muted than ""Persuasion"" (1995). While the series had bright summery lighting favoring the fashions and skin tones, the big screen sequel seems seriously autumnal, far gone toward winter.The film definitely has a richer and more complex emotional range than the First Season. The blithe charm of the TV version has gained in wisdom, pain, regret, and savor. We're dealing with very bitter dark chocolate here, piquantly flavored and highly nutritious, but not always easy on a naïve tongue.Then again, three of the ladies have crossed into their 40's. These midlife years hold different dynamics for them than their end-of-youth 30's. Two married and have children. As Miranda tells her husband, she changed herself for him. She can't go back to living as a rapier-tongued mantrap, not with a child in tow and years of stability with Steve behind her. The fourth, Samantha, has gone through chemotherapy and fringes on 50. She actually thinks outside her personal hedonistic box, though not comfortably.The acting wondrously brings me closer to women I'd like to have in my life. Sarah Jessica Parker particularly offers an understated, nuanced, very complete portrayal of a 41-year-old career woman buoyed by her friends and adrift in her long-ripening romance. The First Season never presented Carrie at the fresh-into-town ""My Sister Eileen"" (1942/1955) stage. Interestingly, the movie brings in Jennifer Hudson to fill exactly that role of someone escaping the provinces for NYC. St. Louise from ""Trolley Song"" St. Louis shows us a phase of aware-yet-wide-eyed single womanhood we missed from the four friends.The series began 10 years into the women's association, though the curtain rose on them at a point where things had only started to gel in their lives. The misfires made for humor and heartache. A decade further down the road the challenges come differently, the missteps have major consequences. We're not talking flubbed dates ending in erotic disappointment; here miscues can shatter valued life partnerships and alter personal destinies.""Sex and the City"" has evolved from its cable roots in Noel Cowardly wit to a full-flowering Anton Chekhov-style comedy. Measure the film against the Louis Malle/Andre Gregory/David Mamet ""Vanya on 42nd Street"" (1994) or John Gielgud's ""The Cherry Orchard"" (1962). Seriously. The writing, the performances, and the deep undercurrents traveling through ""Sex"" will hold up under comparison. You will likely prefer the Chekhov, but this production prowls that uneasy landscape and provokes the same rueful laughter. Like single malt Scotch which has tamed its fire in wood, the subject matter, the characters, the approach have all matured from HBO days.I would unhesitatingly program the movie in a female ensemble festival alongside ""The Women"" (1939), ""All About Eve"" (1950), ""Interiors"" (1978), ""Little Women"" (1994), ""How to Make an American Quilt"" (1995), and ""The Hours"" (2002). It would double-bill very interestingly with ""The Jane Austen Book Club"" (2007). I'm hoping we can revisit Carrie, her girl friends, their mates, and all their associates in another decade, not as an exercise in nostalgia or to awaken a mummy-wrapped franchise, but as part of an ongoing look at female relationships gaining layers as time goes by.",Sex and the City

The film is ""abso-effing-lutely"" opposite to the series as to its spirits. In the show the characters could be silly and annoying but they at least had some guts and energy, some inspiration. In the film they just hide their pathetic nothingness under designer frocks. The frocks are fantastic, though, that's why I gave it 2 stars.The irony is replaced with stupid gags even as the heroines' self-consciousness is replaced by wearing a mask. Hell, they don't even discuss what's going on! Oh, of course they don't have time for that between shopping and trying-on scenes.It was a girls' night and after we finished watching, the mutual resume was: what is fun in 20s and early 30s, is pathetic in 40s!

163,imdb-5596,A disappointment to fans of the TV series and of no interest to fans of film,3,22 June 2008,"I approached Sex And The City as someone who liked, but was not an obsessive fan of, the TV series. I wasn't asking for high art, but I did expect a better-than-average episode of light entertainment.SATC is a romantic character comedy, and it lives or dies on the portrayal of the four primary characters. Unfortunately for me, the film died on at least three out of four.The biggest let down was Samantha. On TV, an inspiring, charismatic character with a pattern of comic turns. Here though, she was a one-dimensional figure of fun. I attribute this to the script, and possibly to direction - Cattrall is a star on TV so it can't be just down to her.This made me scrutinise the others. Miranda is a sour-faced, unlikeable grumpy mother. Charlotte is silly and giggling and lives in on a cloud - and she was the best character in the film for me. Both one-dimensional. The lead - Carrie - was never my favourite, but her shortcomings are laid bare here. She's so shallow I found it impossible to care about her, which pretty much busts the premise for the movie.The second hour dragged on, and I struggled to pay attention. I found myself wondering why I cared about this implausible, uber-upper-middle-class bunch. The poor one is a successful New York lawyer, remember. And by the time Carrie popped up to read her clichéd prose, it really grated.Excess use of make up and facial close-up, and of pathetic fallacy did nothing to redeem it. Some of the laughs, though, were instantaneous good ones. This for me elevates ""Sex And The City"" to 3 from 2 out of 10. I don't find myself looking back now at the gags and chuckling - I left them in the cinema.I felt this did no justice to the TV series. If you've seen only the film, don't let it put you off - the series is more subtle and it's structure around episode themes really works. It also certainly has nothing to offer the film fan.",Sex and the City

But I actually weirdly enjoyed it.Despite it's long run time I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and although predictable I enjoyed it and I laughed at the jokes in it as well.I must admit now that I have watched the series I can see why people were a bit let down but come on! How many films based on TV shows have you watched that truly live up to the title of the show?I gave it an 8 out of 10 as it was funny and I enjoyed it but 2 marks were knocked off as it wasn't as good as the TV series.,Sex and the City
165,jpatrick1967,May Have Hurt My Marriage,1,3 June 2008,"I will preface this comment by saying that my wife and I have been going through some rough patches in our marriage. So needless to say, we needed a night out with just each other. So we decided on dinner and a movie. The dinner was very nice. We had a great time and appeared to be headed toward a very ""exciting"" finish.With that said...guys, DO NOT TAKE YOU WIFE OR GIRLFRIEND TO THIS MOVIE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ARGUE!!! My wife was a huge fan of the series and I was only an occasional watcher. I really didn't follow it so I wasn't 100% familiar with all of the characters and recurring plot lines. So I just figured it would be a funny, romantic movie to go to and also to appease my wife...she isn't a big Indian Jones fan.20 minutes into this piece of garbage, I realized that this might have been a mistake...although you wouldn't have guessed it by my wife's reaction...she seemed to be thoroughly enjoying it. Even to the point of laughing...even though a lot of it seemed forced...at some of the worse jokes ever put on film. Seriously, the jokes in this film made Police Academy 6 seem like a Woody Allen movie.But the worst was yet to come. After almost 2 1/2 hours of watching four, emotionally and mostly physically UNattractive 40 somethings bitch about men and try on clothes that should not be purchased by anyone during our current state of economy, I had to face the inevitability of actually talking to my wife about this movie on our drive home.So now I had two choices: lie to her and tell her what a good movie it was...this would have made the movie drag on even further for me. Or, tell her the truth and hope that the conversation would stop there.Well, I chose the latter...and guess what...the conversation did NOT stop there.Apparently, men are not allowed to tell women that the characters in this farce are devoid of any heart, incapable of real love, and are just spoiled bratty wenches. And that any woman who watched this and thinks that their life can end up like this is in for a sad, demoralizing surprise.Needless to say, I ended up sleeping on the pull out bed that night.Men, please do yourself a favor...stay away from this piece a crap.",Sex and the City

As a happily married heterosexual man I don't get all the bashing that goes on in the media regarding this movie. Do most men really regard this movie as run-of-the-mill chick flick fare? This movie bares no resemblance to Steel Magnolias or Beaches. I personally love to see middle-aged women talking dirty and basically being sexy. I don't understand how any heterosexual man wouldn't. I was happy to take my wife to this movie, and to watch the series as well. Let's face it, this is not your typical chick flick. Loosen up guys! Middle aged women are sexy, and there's nothing wrong with admitting you like this movie. The comments regarding the ages of these women are mean-spirited and (for lack of a better word) ageist! Take your wife to see this film. She'll get choked up. You'll laugh, and you'll both appreciate each other more when it's over. P.S. Don't worry!

As a fan of the show i was disappointed to hear bad things about the movie but after seeing it well, it must just be down to taste. Of course it won't be as good as the TV show stop comparing it to be. The movie is over two hours long but frankly there isn't a moment of disappointment. The movie is hilarious, i found myself laughing with the rest of the audience and why not? It was funny, it was sad, and it was certainly satisfying. I don't think i'm jumping ahead by saying this is one of the greatest movies for 2008. The only letdown's were maybe the comic moments at times where it was seriously upsetting making it less effective for the sad tones.

I couldn't believe it was actually very good. The movie is more about love and the ups and downs of relationships rather then shallow sex and the trivialisation of men. It also has a dose of fun and humour on top of the drama. Maybe my expectations were too low, but even after several viewings I still love the movie. I enjoyed how the women banded together around Carrie in her time of sadness, with Carrie's heartbreak and her girlfriends' support portrayed perfectly.I find that the movie is far more realistic then the TV series and has much more depth and substance.Thanks to this movie I have gone back and watched the entire series and am now a fan of seasons 5 and 6 - the only ones which resemble the movie's style and depth.",Sex and the City

I considered whether the whole series is a satire - could be, interesting thought - It's sorta like watching these ladies riding a roundabout in slow motion - nothing much happening but the horses keep going round and round.

171,razzel,Great follow up to the show,8,31 May 2008,"I absolutely do not understand the ridiculously low ratings for this movie. I have to think that most of these people didn't even watch the series when it was on TV. I can even understand not enjoying it as much as you did the series, particularly with all the hype. The type of ratings this has gotten are generally only reserved for B movies or movies with Paris Hilton. As far as I'm concerned, they are skewed and pretty much meaningless.Now, on to the movie...I went with a girlfriend to the Friday opening and sat in a female only audience (plus 4 men who I have to believe were drug there by their wives/girlfriends). We both thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I watched the series from beginning to end and thought this movie was a great extension for the show and tied up a lot loose ends that needed tying.The characters have matured and evolved just enough to make them not boring. Let's face it, if they matured too much, there really wouldn't be anything to watch. It was fun and just downright hysterical in a few places.I will say that although I liked the idea of the character played by Jennifer Huston, I thought her acting was generally pretty bad. I have to think the only reason for that character was to explain the one part at the end of the film. The also should have done more with Stanford. He really didn't have much of a part at all.I would highly recommend this movie to any real fans of the TV show.",Sex and the City

How would ya'll have done things? For being of TV for six years, I think they did a damn good job! The script had a few holes, which I was almost expecting. Miranda not telling Carrie her secret till five months later- plot hole. Miranda is fairly straight-forward. I don't think she woulda kept that for that long, least of all from Carrie. Stanford and Anthony being friends (although that kiss was funny as hell!)- plot hole. And Steve's character during he and Miranda's separation?- he was just being kinda weak Lol :-P But that scene with him and Miranda on the Brooklyn Bridge? Holy Jeebus, I cried like an absolute baby! Sam and Smith breaking up?- I don't think they shoulda done that. So to me, that was kind of a plot hole. I mean, I knew they weren't gonna get married or anything, but still... He also did change, so I could see it was going to end eventually.Those scenes with Carrie when she was hitting Big with her flowers after the ""non-wedding"", Charlotte screaming ""No!"" at him and covering Carrie, when Carrie couldn't leave the hotel room for what was it- 2 days? She takes off her glasses, and she had bags under her eyes and no makeup? Wow, every woman has been there, with any type of emotional wreckage like that. And when Sam came in and spoon-fed her, Omg! I almost cried for that one. When anything happened to the ladies, I felt it all. I cried, laughed, and smiled through it all with them.Btw- I loooooved Jennifer Hudson! She was amazing! She was the icing on the cake for me! I'm glad they decided to add her in there. She was that little extra ""oomph"" the film needed! The chemistry between herself and Sarah J was perfect! I see many greater things for Jen on the horizon :-D! For me- this was just an extra long episode of SATC :-) I'll probably go see it again, and I'll most definitely be buying the DVD! I'm soooo glad I didn't let the bad ratings on this site stop me from going or delaying. I had such a great time!",Sex and the City

However take your boyfriend to watch this movie at your own risk. By the end of it, he'll either be dead, or brain damaged, or dump you, or discover that he's gay. There's nothing new to this movie if you have seen even a few episodes of the TV series. You see a lot of pretty dresses, lots of pretty shoes, lots of pretty but clearly ageing women, & lots of hunky men. The plot is so predictable that you can actually play a game of who can predict the next scene most accurately.

It's not as brilliant as the TV show, but it is amusing, easy to watch and quite entertaining. It was never going to win any Oscars, but the film makers know this and they don't take themselves too seriously, a good girls' night in film, you'll enjoy a giggle and a wee sob in some of the sadder scenes.For men however, I think a 1 might be more appropriate. There is nothing in this film for men. But then again, they aren't the target audience and so it isn't surprising.

Its funny and smart and they bring a really interesting perspective. They present a view point that is unique and not often heard. They have an intelligent conversation about why Sex and The City is a cultural phenomenon. They have an in-depth discussion about the characters and what they represent. They also look at the movie in regards to how far women have come along. They address the theme of the movie and give you all sorts of ideas and topics of conversation about the film--all the while making you laugh. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay_PvOXg9BQ,Sex and the City

Really funny in parts and SJP is the star and Kim Cattral is excellent as ever and is also the star of the film. Miranda (Cyntiha Nixon)she had the most sex scenes!! I bet there will be an English version TV, they show the early series, but always show the later ones! Is it because they are promoting the film? As I said before - its a film for girls - the men always pretend that they don't like Sex and the city - I've caught mine watching and laughing.Lovely outfits and the Vivienne Westwood wedding dress was fantastic!

177,michaeltaddonioa,A Movie Of Many Themes,7,7 June 2008,"I saw this movie on June 6, 2008. Of course, it picked up on the TV show. Of course, it was about the lives of 4 women, who are friends, and their lives.The first aspect is friendship. It is good to have friends to go out with and do things together. This is what the four women in the movie and TV series did. They shared each other's feelings and emotions. They were happy over the good things and not so happy over the bad things. They leaned on each other in both good and bad times. An example is on New Year's Eve after ""Mr. Big"" walked on Carrie on their wedding day, and Miranda and her man separated. Both of them didn't take part in holiday social functions. Each was set to spend New Year's Eve alone. So what happened? They ended up together and brought in the new year.Lost in the overall movie was weddings. It was obvious that Carrie and ""Mr. Big"" didn't want a big wedding. Society expects people who get married to have a big time. A wedding can be nice without being extravagant. Carrie and her man eventually got married in a small civil ceremony, and then had dinner, with their friends, in a restaurant. I am sure that it was more enjoyable than a society expected big time.The movie, as well as the TV series, showed that life has its ups and downs. All four women had their ups and downs, in their love lives and other aspects of their lives. All of us go through it. This is an inevitable thing.It must be realized that every woman can't be like the four main characters in the movie. But people have things going on in their lives, just like those women did. In this sense, the movie had its realistic side.The movie had its funny side. I felt that it was a bit too long.The men that were involved with the 4 main characters had similar things just like the four main women characters did.An aspect is emotions. People are feeling people, and the movie showed it.",Sex and the City
178,anna-39,what a waste,3,8 November 2008,"First we had the Sex and the City - series. It was witty, intelligent writing. It featured four women that were independent, strong, loving and loyal to their friends. For the first time really a series was concentrating on women and playing them as complex, interesting characters in -sometimes- equal relationships with men. So, when the movie came out the expectations were high. But - it lands so flat. From the movie we learn that how women really spend their lives is waiting for the prince to come and pick them up. All the rest of the time is just used chatting with girlfriends about the Mr Right. That women truly exist only when they are with some man. The movie is superficial, not believable (the scene with Miranda and Steve on the bridge is just plain pathetic), and boring. Not even the jokes work well. It's not a movie about (these) women and their (fabulous) life in their 40s but a weak plot build around photo shoots, clothes, shoes, fashion, design. It's the pages of Vogue or Metropolitan or whatever other fashion magazine made into a movie. It quite conservatively reminds us that women can be wild in their 20s, independent in their 30s and they need a man to give a meaning to their lives when they're 40. Quite sad.",Sex and the City

Well within the first 20 minutes I knew something was wrong. The characters don't bond like in the show, there is no natural cohesion among the characters, it is like they are trying too hard and you can see right through this false acting. The plot was woeful. Why did they have to continue the movie where the show left off? Why couldn't they make the movie entirely independent? Or even a prequel to show how the characters met in the first place? The product placement was embarrassing, the jokes were awful and the majority of the film someone was sulking. Also the token black person was embarrassing, why do movies do this???? I loved the Cosby show and Fresh prince I didn't want a white person thrown in to make me happy! It insults everyones intelligience that they do this! 1/10 this movie. The fact it has an average rating above 5 shows that some people really are dumb who watched it.",Sex and the City

Well, there's not much I can say, besides this - Cynthia Nixon and Cris Noth are too good actors to be in this trash. I can almost see how they struggle to dumb down to the level of the rest of the cast. There's no point of writing about anything else, the plot, the common sense - not exist in this movie. It's utterly artificial, ridiculous and weird. Perhaps I am too old, too drunk or just too different.

Big is some big ""financier"" but falls apart and chickens out because Carrie doesn't turn around and look at him? Okay.How much racism is in the movie? Plenty. Charlotte revives the tired trope that Mexican food is unsafe to eat. Miranda says ""follow the White Man with a baby!"" when house-hunting. And let's not forget the fat-shaming the women laid on Samantha.Carrie richly thinks that it was Miranda who ruined her wedding because Miranda told Big he was crazy to get married. Sis if your wedding becomes unmoored based on a simple comment, then there wasn't much to the relationship. Crazy terrible writing.All in all just a bunch of vacuous, boring, materialistic, selfish women with too much money. You will find no female empowerment here.",Sex and the City
182,erin_osullivan,Everyone is wayyy too critical of this movie,6,9 June 2008,"OK so people are completely analysing this movie inside out and not being able to see through ""plot holes"" and ""fake acting"" etc. Can't you guy realise that this is simply a movie made to be entertaining?? OK, so, the trick is, if you're a huge fan (like me, and i certainly was not disappointed) the trick is to not go in there with high expectations. Because, alright I have read a lot of the bad reviews and do agree with some of the technical criticisms. But saying that the movie storyline is unbelievable, well aren't MOST romantic comedy movies effing unbelievable these days? Seriously, they are. It starts off the boy and girl fall in love, then there's a conflict and then most of the time the ending is happy. While I walked out of that movie 110% satisfied, I still stick to my theory that a TV show made into a movie is never as good as the TV show. But this movie has so much to offer to fans. The fashion is amazing, sometimes i even question how much Carrie could REALLY afford all those things, but come on! Also, the performances may have seemed a little strained and tense. But if you can see past that fact maybe you critical people can see that this movie delivered what it was supposed to deliver. An ending to a blissful, witty and lovable cast of 4 women and their love lives.I admit that when Big calling and saying he ""can't do this"" was kinda expected, and the whole commotion of the whacking him with the bouquet was really OTT, I just didn't care. This movie satisfied me soo much. SJP has always been either beautiful or ugly to me. She isn't one of those women that is just naturally beautiful, which is unfortunate. Like how she looked with all her makeup on the wedding day, I think she looked awful (but how effing hot was the dress!?), and then she looked stunning in the opening scene of the film with her smoky eyes, wavy hair walking down the street in that white number with the huge gold flower. That is a more shallow note to add but still important to me. It shows that no matter who you are, there will always be times when you don't look so good and times when you look stunning.As for the character of Samantha, I agree that she did lack the same sharp wit of her character in the series. But she still managed to get a helluva lot of laughs out of me. Miranda was normal, looked a fair bit older though. Charlotte, still so naturally stunning and beautiful wasn't really a central character in the movie but still adorable.Overall, this movie was such a joy for me. If you don't go in there with high expectations, as in thinking ""i'm seeing this movie because I'm a fan but don't really expect much out of it"" THEN you'll be pleasantly surprised.Everyone knows that TV show movies are often really bad. But this one is just so lovely. I loved it and am seeing it again tomorrow night with my boyfriend, who also likes the show (not as much as me tho haha).If you're a fan, you'll love it, If you're not, who cares? Go and watch it and it then may inspire you to watch the show and fall in love with it.",Sex and the City

It was designed for those of us who enjoyed the TV show so I guess I can understand why people who weren't fans didn't like the movie.I do have a confession to make. It was inspired by some comments my husband made. I didn't expect him to enjoy the movie any more than he had enjoyed the series, but I've got to admit that his comments gave me something to think about. He indicated that the movie was like one long commercial. THere are plugs for designers, there clothing, and lots of companies who probably footed the bill for this big screen adaptation.He definitely had a poinnt. A good one. Now that I've watched the movie a second time, I've come to realize just how accurate this offhand remark was. I still like the movie though.

Two hour movie drags for too long, seems whiny and short on humor and quirky script. Fans can still appreciate the ladies friendship, fabulous outfits, but the movie is so short on substance. The acting is indulgent for the most part. It seems that many actors (especially Mr. Big) were dragged to the shoot and there only for the money. The Jennifer Hundson character  unnecessary. The movie is not without charm though, having sweet and subtle moments. One of those is when Carrie wears glasses at the end of the movie, reading her book on LOVE, while in the beginning with Mr. Big referring to not needing them.

186,katstar1982,Racist and Boring,1,13 June 2008,"I used to complain about Sex and the City during its original incarnation on HBO because it bored me to watch people spend unfathomable sums of money on shoes and unremittingly prattle about love-d*ck-and-shopping (and nothing else, ever). I irritated its disciples when I asked them how Samantha, though admittedly the most interesting character on the show, wasn't crawling with STDs. Or why all the women had to be filthy rich and emaciated. They'd always say the same thing: ""It's not supposed to be realistic. It's a fantasy."" Oh, okay, I get it. Sex and the City depicts the kind of fantasy world where no one has anything to worry about except for satisfying every possible selfish impulse because there are no poor (or even middle-class) people, virtually no brown people, and no 'uppity' gays who want more out of life than to be accessories on par with a pair of flamboyant Manolo Blahniks to straight girls. Still, despite my contempt for this bigoted fantasy, I was frequently, begrudgingly, seduced into watching and following most of its central story lines back in its HBO heyday. Truly, the show was that charming. The movie on the other hand, was like an episode on steroids, sans the charm. For example, its implicit racism, which was once marked by the flagrant whitewashing of New York City, was upgraded to the more overt variety. Here, Jennifer Hudson is Carrie's servant (i.e. personal assistant), a character that exists to do Carrie's every bidding, no matter how menial. Hmmm, did anyone among the cast or crew ever stop to think that this contrived relationship wreaked of a racist tradition in Hollywood, which relentlessly limited African American actors to images of servitude?Of course Carrie's 'happy slave girl' from St. Louis (they had to go all the way to St. Louis to find a Black girl by the way, because there aren't any in Carrie Bradshaw's New York) comprises only the tip of the Klan-hood shaped iceberg. There is also the scene where Miranda is apartment hunting in what is apparently too ethnic a neighborhood, so she opts to ""follow the white guy with the baby"" in order to find a suitable residence. And there was the bit about Charlotte accidentally drinking the water in 'savage' Mexico, which culminated in a brazenly unfunny crap-and-fart joke. All 76 racist moments aside, the movie just wasn't entertaining. It was extraordinarily predictable excluding the part when the poster-child for anorexia nervosa that is Carrie asks a healthy looking Samantha how she let herself get so fat. I'll admit that surprised me. But only because Kim Cattrall looks exactly the same as she ever did. Meanwhile, Sarah Jessica Parker starves to death, becoming more gaunt and skeletal by the minute. Other points of contention include but are not limited to: Carrie's post-jilt depression, which was tired, creepy and ego-maniacal. Samantha's out-of-character abstinence in face of the opportunity to hook up with her sexy manslut neighbor. The incredible amount of screen time that was wasted on advertising famous designers, including an awkwardly placed and paced fashion show. Etc. I suspect that the droves of women who liked this film (and thus, make me ashamed to call myself a woman) had decided they would like it before even seeing it. Because empirically, this film sucked.",Sex and the City
187,Half_the_Audience,Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,8,31 May 2008,"So why does it p*ss off the boys so much? The much-beloved HBO series hits the big screens with an elongated nostalgic trip through the boutiques, restaurants, clubs, parties, and closets of our favorite foursome: Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha with Sex and the City the Movie.Some say it's critic-proof, others laud it as an ""event"" picture that says nothing indicative about whether ""average"" movies with female leads or female-driven stories can make money. While men and boys seem to feed at the trough of ""average"" or recycled fodder, the other half of the planet is a bit choosier and tends to wait until something special comes along.Sex and the City: The Movie, is like the Sex and the City series on steroids. There's the fashion, the friendship, and most important, the emotional gravitas that the four main characters hooked us with so many years ago. For the uninitiated, there's a brief yet effective introductory montage which runs under the credits just enough to get you acquainted.Within minutes we're off and running through a veritable fantasy of the perfect man, the perfect dress, the perfect apartment all the commodities capitalist media has conditioned women to love and want! Massive, unbridled, look-Ma-no-hands consumer-porn there for the viewing. Lest we let our envy get the best of us, each character is spun off into her own life-altering drama interlaced themes of life underneath the labels eventually resolved by the mystical power of sisterhood.And it's more fun than you've had in years! Superficial? Only if YOU are. With a era-appropriate tinge of darkness, the R-rated film continues the daring investigation of female desire that the series began (a topic squeamishly avoided by most studios), and inventively juxtaposes it with a serious and mature debate on Romance vs. Practicality. There are some surprises, lots of laughs, and more than one occasion for tears. A little long at 148 minutes, we take journeys with all the characters as they negotiate expectations, desires, realities, and compromises. And aging. Oh yeah, and the dangers of the Cinderella Complex. Sex and the City is an ""E"" ticket ride through the grown-up girls' Gotham that does not disappoint especially if you ever got the magic of the TV show in the first place.Frankly, I can't wait 'til the senior installment! (Coming in 2028...)Men may not understand why women like SATC so much, and that's okay. It's possible they could try to wrap their heads around the concept and attempt to see it from another perspective. Women have, for decades, learned to appreciate the avalanche of boy-comes-of-age stories, male-hero-conquers-the-world-tales, or man-in-midlife-crisis laments. Heck they haven't been offered a choice of much else.So while many girls and women will put up with their brother's, boyfriend's, husband's, or dad's choice of film, and enjoy it for what she can get out of it, she deserves an opportunity to lavish in female fantasy once in a while, without resentment, hostility, or undeserved criticism.Perhaps if males were more discriminating, Hollywood would simply have to listen, and there would be an immediate improvement in the quality of films being made and distributed. But until that happens, occasional pleasures like Sex and the City, (movies about nice, normal, averagely-endowed women who permit themselves to do what they want, go where they want, and wear what they want, while enjoying their wildest fantasies), will come along and sweep the other half of the planet into the theaters. What a good time they'll have!",Sex and the City
188,lilgra1,A long alternate ending....,6,31 May 2008,"""Sex and the City"" is not meant to be a movie. It was a great TV series that I was addicted to...but as a movie,..it felt like a long long alternate ending to the last episode. Basically, the story revolves around Carrie finding love,..her ultimately marrying Big. A lot of the movie was very predictable if you have watched the trailer. There was a lot of scenes that didn't go anywhere which made the movie feel long. I was disappointed that the producers of the film did not take Sex and the City to another level...to make it bigger and better for a feature film. Most of the film was Carrie sulking, a lot of fighting with Miranda, and Charlotte very emotional. I guess Samantha was the most entertaining, very funny and strong as usual. I felt that the acting for the girls were a little too much, except for Samantha. Mr. Big and Steve was good and carried the same characters in the TV series. The extra assistant character for Carrie was not really necessary. I guess the writers did not know how to construct a 30 min TV show to a full length feature. The editing was also not as creative and fast as the TV show. All in all, because it was Sex and the City,..I still liked it,....I just wish it was better.",Sex and the City

I'm a writer who loves characters and that's what drew me to the show. When I learned the movie was going to be a reality after many false starts, I was excited to see what they could do with more screen time, a bigger budget, and more clothes. (I said to my ex-wife, a huge CSI fan, that with their built-in audience they could make a killing at the box office. I digress...) While I was glad to see my girls back on the screen, I was extremely disappointed in the movie. I've heard many people talk about the plot and how pointless it was. However, we all knew what we were getting into when we bought the ticket. Anyway, I am disappointed in the way that Carrie professed so much growth and maturity and fell back into her old ways; how self-absorbed they allowed her to be in the aftermath of her big disappointment; and how they should have gotten us ready for the next movie with a shocking, but needed dismissal of Big. Additionally, I was mad at how they treated Smith. It made me think that these characters, and women in general, do not know what they want if they can get the hot guy to commit but dump him for ""the relationship I've been having with myself for 49 years."" The reason I compared it to Michael Jordan's comeback with the Wizards was because when he made that final jumper against Utah, it was such a fitting end to a great career. The ending to the television series (Big coming to his senses and rescuing Carrie in Paris) was the equivalent of that jumper. While we saw that Jordan could still hang with the younger guys, we yearned for the original. I was left yearning for the vibe of the series and not this imitation. I told myself that Jordan's time in DC did not exist if I said it didn't. I will probably do the same with this movie. Won't even buy it when it comes out on DVD.My girlfriend thinks I'm too attached to the characters and didn't see it for what it was (entertainment). But isn't that what we watch great movies, TV, theater and read great books for? We want to own these characters and protect them from others who don't share our passion. I didn't feel like protecting these women. I felt like punching them (figuratively speaking ladies!!!) for being so annoying and selfish.

Big and Carrie's problem felt real and anxious especially for Big. Carrie's overreaction is also very real.There is a huge part where Carrie goes into a deep depression that I felt was very accurate behavior with what she went through. Typical Carrie from the series reacts horribly to Miranda in a Valentine's Day scene but she goes back to that better character later.Miranda and Steve's problem is realistic and getting help in figuring out if they can (and are willing) to move on was one one of the most beautiful scenes.Samantha's problems with Smith was so tragically beautiful because she goes through her own mild depression and is loyal to Smith even when temptation occurs. She is also feels like she'd make a great mother when she cared for Carrie.Overall I really enjoy this film and love rewatching it.

I'm ashamed that I watched the series with the loyalty that I did, being a New Yorker and feminist. Was it always thus? Do I have a selective memory? Charlotte eating nothing but pudding in Mexico was offensive and racist, and I cringed every time she opened her mouth.

The most fun I've had at the movies in years. I really just had a great time being manipulated and entertained. Bravos or Bravas to all concerned! Simply put.",Sex and the City
196,janevigor,almost loved it,8,9 June 2008,"Let me start out by saying that I love the T.V. show, so I had pretty high expectations for this movie.........and I was very pleased! This is a great movie for girl friends to watch together, I don't recommend it for men. That being said, if you can get over the fact that the characters spend money on $300 pillows and $400 shoes while you could use that money to buy health insurance, the movie is pretty good. It was more drama than comedy, which was a bit disappointing. I felt all the old characters were true to their former T.V. selves. Really the only problem I had with this film (aside from wanting a little more comedy) was Jennifer Hudson. She is such a horrible actress, I had to make a conscience effort while watching the film to not let her performance ruin the whole movie. I took off a whole point in my overall rating just for her acting.",Sex and the City

198,ange_rankin,"Hmmmm I think male votes are bringing ave. down on purpose, this movie was exactly what it was meant to be: FABULOUS!",10,4 June 2008,"I have to admit I felt a tinge of apprehension right before entering the movie theater because I realized that all my zealousness and excitement may have resulted in shear disappointment.Fortunately it wasn't! What was I hoping for going in? I was hoping the movie to be one long-extended episode with more fashion and more witty social commentary.What I got? Just that! I loved that the movie was true to the show's form and nothing was over-exaggerated (like the girls flying to Dubai or something). The characters were their real and lovable selves that made us fall in love with them during the seasons.What I did not expect was the moments of seriousness and tear-retching drama. Steve's announcement that he cheated and Charolette's ferocious protection of Carry back to the limo caused tears to stream down my face (and I think all of the girls in the theater).I knew that I would most likely love the movie but am very happy it surpassed my expectations.Side note: this was probably the most fun I had going to the theater! My girlfriends and I dressed up in our dresses and heels and I loved the fact that the rest of the lady movie goers were dressed up as well. It was like one big party in the theater! With the laughing and clapping and picture taking you would've thought we were at a concert And when we headed to the lounge down the street afterward we could not stop laughing at the many women there that, like us, were drinking cosmos!Side note 2: I wonder how well the movies that previewed before this movie will do?",Sex and the City
199,Utlkn2me,"Very, very disappointing",3,27 September 2008,"I'm a great female fan of the HBO series, but this film is not in the same league. I am so disappointed. I just saw it when the DVD came out, and had intentionally avoided reading reviews here, but totally agree with many that I'm now reading.It looks like the producers just wanted to make quick money, decided what they thought would appeal to the movie-going public, and said to heck with the loyal series fans. The movie characters mostly do not resemble nor act like those from HBO, and the storyline was just plain stupid and kept going for cheap humor. These women act even more immature than they did when the series ended, and the Carrie/Big storyline made no sense. OK, he didn't have her new phone number, but did he not know where she lived? Come on - a whole year would pass, and he wouldn't make a single attempt to see her. (He went to Paris to get her in the last series episode, but couldn't have his limo driver take him over to her apartment?) How many times during the series did they show his sitting in the limo waiting for her outside her building.The actors in general had no passion, and it looked like they were phoning in their lines. It could have been so good - just have picked up where the series left off and go from there.Things they shouldn't have done (IMHO): 1 - Sent the girls to Mexico; 2 - Had Samantha get that dog; 3 - Have Samantha's and Smith's relationship end that way; 4 - Have Charlotte get pregnant; 5 - Had Carrie treat Big the way she did, and his staying away from her for a year; 6 - Have the male characters barely participate in the movie; 7 - Left out ""The City"" - Where was New York? I did not get the feel for NYC like I did in the series.I could go on and on and on. I just wished that they'd done justice to the series",Sex and the City
200,booey-2,I loved it,10,3 October 2008,"Huge fan of the show - I may be the only one who has been watching an episode or 2 before going to be every night for the last 4 years - I feel like I'm living in a SATC world! Anyway, I loved the movie and saw it twice in the theater - it was just so good to see them all together again. I loved it for what it was - not for what others seem to think it was missing. It was a movie - not really a continuation of the TV series so of course it won't be just like more episodes. It was on a more serious note than the series, but I was OK with that because you knew they wanted to grow up the characters. I cried more than laughed, but again, I was OK with that - probably my biggest laugh was when Smith walked up to Samantha with his ""gift"" while she was on the phone, lol, that was too funny! Will always love ANYTHING the girls do together! Seeing it on Blu-Ray cannot be missed!! It looks so much better than it did in the theater!! Just wish they'd release the series on Blu-Ray - it really needs a video face lift.",Sex and the City
201,sherif_mohsen,A guy's perspective....,9,31 May 2008,"Well before giving my review, I just want to say that I'm straight! And I do like romantic comedies (as long as they're not excessively girly e.g. 13 going on 30!). So this is a straight guy's perspective and not a gay one who went to see the ""fabulous"" designs!As a SATC fan, I really loved the movie, and I thought it DELIVERED! The acting was superb, the 4 main stories (each character having one) were very unique but yet very harmonious and WELL resolved. SJP's narration was  as always  v. deep and witty, Samantha remains to be the life of the party (by far the funniest and uninhibited), Charlotte: living in lala land but deadly sweet; and Miranda (my favorite) the most human and the warmest.The movie can be described as a light hearted romantic comedy, with some ""intense"" scenes . I don't want to spoil the movie, but seriously guys or gals SJP's and Charlotte's performance in those ""dramatic"" scenes were Oscar worthy, dare I say! The only 2 things I didn't care for in the movie were a certain comment/joke about Mexico that I felt was borderline offensive (even though I'm not Latino or Mexican) and unnecessary (even though kinda funny); and the other thing was Samantha's fiancé. He was totally totally different from SATC the series, and his issue with Samantha was not very well resolved.I thought the love scenes were too much and too crude! (They actually showed a guy's full frontal!!!). So if anyone's conservative well you may want to watch the cut version! The movie deserves a solid 8.5/10, and is definitely worth the time and money! Oh and speaking about time, try not to over hydrate urselves cuz the movie is toooo long (2 h 15 m). You wouldn't want to miss a minute to go pee!",Sex and the City
202,verdadero2006,Prove your a real man,10,31 May 2008,"I find it mildly amusing to read the ""this is a woman's movie blah, blah blah..."" comments here. Obviously there are many action film fans who have not matured enough to realize that all genres of movies can be enjoyable and entertaining. First I want to make clear that this is not solely a ""woman's"" movie. It is a story about four woman who have struggled with living alone in a large and occasionally threatening city. Their adaptation to this situation is to form a common bond with each other that transcends all other factors in their lives. Sure they have romances that range from blissfully domestic to chaotic. Look closely at your friends and you will see the same kinds of families. What you will not find for the most part in our society is people forming friendships like theirs that help them work through the rough spots in their lives.If you enjoy great cinematography, adult dialog, stunning fashions, and amusing repartee, you will enjoy this film. One of the big surprises is that the stars were willing to go the extra mile and allow themselves to be shown in less than appealing makeup and situations. This certainly added to the film's believability.A great film that ""real men"" will not feel threatened to see.",Sex and the City
203,STAYHIGH007,A nice transition from the small to big screen for this story!,7,3 June 2008,"First and foremost, I must let it be known that I am not your typical fan of the show. I have not seen one episode of the show, but I knew months before it debuted that it would a success! This movie evidently completes what the television show failed to do! I believe the title has psychologically taken away what the story is ultimately about, LOVE, told from women's perspective(I'm a man by the way). Which is the reason why I believe that most of the people going to see this movie are women. The movie does have a television feel to it, minus the commercials, but tends to convey the attitudes of the two cities that make up its location, New York and Los Angeles! If you've never been to either one of these cities, then this movie may have felt a bit too indulgent to you. Being a New Yorker, you do get to experience people(especially women) living these type of lifestyles or at least trying to. In a nut shell, the movie is about a successful woman who is telling the story of how she and her girlfriends deal with relationships that they have made for themselves. It's funny and sad at times, but it does deal with the more important things that most of us tend to forget make up a relationship like commitment, honesty, love, and loyalty! Hollywood hasn't been too successful with a lot of their small to big screen projects but I believe they have a winner in this one! I know that this movie has made me want to get the whole series to exactly what made this such a hot and successful story.",Sex and the City
204,giren-ismaya,Just relax and leave your critically mind behind,4,27 July 2008,"I was watching Sex And The City (SATC) on a midnight viewing. The theater surprisingly packed with bunch of teen girls who looked like the fan of the series. Being 24 year old male, I didn't really interested on this movie. Since I predicted the movie won't be as witty and clever like the series.I watched the long movie, and this is my opinion:SATC didn't even try to be smart. The movie just a parade of the chic clothes, purses, bags, notebooks. It was too long with nothing really happened there. I found the Carrie character seems to be exaggerating. But then I realized that maybe Carrie symbolize all women in the world. Maybe there was nothing really wrong with Carrie and the way Sarah Jessica Parker picturing her. Carrie was just a normal woman who turned to be upset when her groom backed up. Who wouldn't upset? Although the 'street scene' was kind of hyperbolic and too corny.Yes, I know for the guys SATC was something not worth to watch. And I don't recommend it too, unless you have a girlfriend or sister you need to accompanied. But hey, I actually had some fun and laugh although it was not really fun laugh. SATC is not a brilliant movie, not a very good movie if you have a high taste and expectation on the movie. But on some level, it fun and nice to look at. If you really want to watch this, just stop being too critical, loose some of your nerve and sit down, watch the cute colors coming and the mainstream music playing.",Sex and the City
205,MurphAndTheMagicTones,Was disappointed----SPOILERS AHEAD,5,5 June 2008,"Before I get slammed and accused of being a troll and can't handle a show about empowered women, I watched the entire series on HBO and enjoyed it. I thought the show's finale was very good. (not Newhart or Cheers finale good, but good nonetheless) That said, I was let down by the movie. It played out like a so-so long episode of the show.SPOILERS AHEAD - Turn away now if you don't want to know.Each of the three main subplots involving Carrie, Miranda, and Samantha seemed to reveal that they had regressed from the ending of the original series. Carrie tried to make the wedding bigger than her and Big, and one would think she's learned enough about him to just make the wedding nice and simple, and only about them. It takes most of the movie for her to figure this out, and this doesn't bode well for someone who supposedly had been with Big for the 4 years since the show ended. As a result, the plot line was easily predictable right from the moment she walked into Enid's office. This is not to say Big did the right thing at the wedding, but when she finally comes to the realization of that, the audience was way ahead of her.Clearly Miranda has eschewed her ""you know love"" epiphany at the end of the series by regressing back to her old ways of disregarding Steve as generally beneath her contempt. When she said in the movie ""I changed for you!"" to Steve, I wanted to shout bull**** at the screen. She changed addresses for him, for crying out loud. It's not like she had to be a tough, loving wife while he was off fighting in Iraq or something. Of course, this sets up her big hypocrisy in the movie, about asking forgiveness of Carrie when she won't forgive Steve.Samantha is a New Yorker and this has been covered many times before. She doomed her relationship with Smith when she went to California with him. She's way too smart to let herself get caught like she did. This is minor compared to the Carrie and Miranda crises, but it's another example of acting against character that the movie has.Other quick nitpicks: Harry, Stanford, and Antony are basically wallpaper in this movie for what they have to do, the acting was not up to par with the show, and I think they overloaded early with the ""labels"" motif, leading us to correctly guess Carrie's final narration at the end.Overall, it was not a good follow-up to the show. Granted, it wasn't as bad of a TV-to-movie adaptation as ""Charlie's Angels,"" or ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" but for all the hype it got, I was left disappointed.",Sex and the City
206,xylokopos,brutally uncompromising psychological thriller,8,13 October 2008,"The last film I saw that offered an equally dark and twisted view of the human psyche, was Pasolini's Salo: a glimpse of something truly dehumanizing and a portrayal of the triumph of evil. SATC works along the same lines, establishing characters without any redeeming qualities, absolutely devoid of decency and empathy. At a certain level, one can see the film as some sort of uber-feminist dystopia, replete with scenes of symbolic castration; or maybe some sort of super-consumerist manifesto, where existence is distilled as lifestyle and an hymn to superficiality; or maybe as a nihilistic social commentary, where self-centeredness and egotism are systematically rewarded.One thing is for sure: it is a deeply disturbing experience for the male viewer. The male characters in this film are gay, sex toys or rich daddy figures. The 4 females leads are predatory, utterly self-absorbed, devoid of any moral compass, guilt-infusing middle aged ""professionals"" - exaggerated caricatures of an equal-rights fantasy gone terribly wrong. It is a combination of American Psycho, In the Company of Men and Fight Club from a female viewpoint - an immature and violent wet dream that is justified based on the "" I am being me"" and ""I love me"" principles. I challenge any man to check out the scene where Kim Katrall's character dumps her boyfriend of 5 years ( that stuck with her through chemotherapy to boot) because she ""loves herself more"" and not get enraged and scared at the vision offered.Of course, a lot of suspension of disbelief is required, since at the same time, the film borders science fiction - it is hard to digest that these women, manipulative as the may be, can actually transform successful and emotionally stable men into pathetic, apologetic train wrecks.If you watched this with your wife and girlfriend and she didn't spot anything reprehensible in the main characters' behaviour, you, my friend, are in deep, deep, deep trouble.",Sex and the City
207,deli584876,garbage!!!!,1,29 March 2009,"This movie should be a lesson for all of us as far as movies are concerned. When something like the Sex and the City series becomes a huge success and gains millions of loyal fans worldwide, the directors see dollar signs in their eyes and easy ones at that.They know they can just throw together any old cheaply made replica of it with little to no thought or effort put into it. Why? Because all they needed was that first week after it's release. After depriving the fans of Sex and the City for four years, the directors knew that they would come flocking the day of it's release in hopes of recapturing the old charm of the series.But before the word-of-mouth had a chance to announce that the movie stinks, the directors already received their tidal wave of money from it's first week and couldn't care less about it afterward.Now that that's out of the way, if you are an avid Sex and the City fan hoping this movie will recapture the charm and wit of the series, you're in for a big disappointment.The only similarities this movie had with the series is the name of the movie and the characters. Other than that, it bares no resemblance at all.Gone are the days of Samantha hounding after hot young guys and having a sexual romp every 5 minutes as well as her open discussions about her sexual prowess. Gone are the days of Miranda's failed dates and witty cynical one liners about men. Gone is Charlotte's dream of finding the perfect man and having the perfect family. Gone is Carrie's funny narrations and column writing and meeting guys who never compare to Mr. Big. And most of all, gone are the girls usual getting together for lunch and discussions.Instead we get a very long tedious depressing drama that drags on and on and on. I kept saying to myself that it will get better but it never did.Save your money and spare yourself the agony of this 2 and a half hour pickle.",Sex and the City

Is it as witty as the show? no, but it has its moments and the humour is definitely there. Is it the same as the show was? in some ways, but then again, it's not the show, its the movie and movies follow a different format then a TV show does. Is this film work seeing? depends. are you a die hard fan? are you looking for a continuation on the Big and Carrie story? are you wondering if Samantha really could settle down and be with Smith? If yes to the above three questions (or any one out of three,) then go see it. I found it to be enjoyable. I went in with low expectations, and came out happy. If you liked the show at all, i feel seeing this film is vital and pivotal, its almost like i owed it to those four amazing women who definitely helped me through a bad day or break up or what ever. In any event, the movie is 2.5 hours long and follows the women through one year of their life, around 5 years after the series ended. they have ups, they have downs and of course, the heart of the movie is the friendship of our four fabulous women. grab ur best friends, have a cosmo, sit down, and just get lost in Sex and the City. <3",Sex and the City

The Hours!? Anywaaaay!!! For anyone who enjoyed the TV show this is a great finish and I can say for myself that I was really eager to see whats gonna happen to the girls, and I wasn't disappointed at ALL!!! The director thought that a modern funny New York Cinderella story, is a good sum up of a 6 years of work for one of the greatest TV shows ever made, and I agree! It's romantic and funny all the way! The costumes are just DIVINE!!!! I would just be happy to see all clothes that I saw even if nothing happened in the movie! There is no real big point in the film, but who cares? Its cute romantic comedy, but far far better then the most that I have seen in my life! Movies like The Notebook have 8.0 rating on this site, so give me a brake!

This movie just meanders along until you feel like crying. Not because you care about any of the characters (they just love to shop and eat at great restaurants...don't they?), because the movie just won't end. I was hoping for some drama or excitement.

So how could you not identify with the movie? The negative reviews and ratings for this movie are all by men. Men, WHAT are you doing watching this movie? This movie is not for you. This movie is for US. This is what we can identify with and what we understand. It's not SUPPOSED to have a story or be SERIOUS. It's supposed to be a feel good, fun movie for women - which is exactly what it is. It doesn't pretend to be anything more or anything less. And even with the frivolity of it all, it still has a basic theme - friendship is everything.Because we would do ANYTHING for our friends, like run across New York on New Years Eve just so that you wont be alone or fly back and forth just to be with you on a tough day. This movie is less about love and sex, and more about friendship.The characters we know and love are just the same, and you feel so good while and after seeing the movie, especially if you see it with close girl friends who you KNOW will do the same things that the characters do for each other in the movie.Pretty much everyone in my movie theater seemed to agree with me that the movie was fabulous - They were all cheering, clapping and laughing at the fabulous moments.If your a woman, of any age, and you love the series, you should love the movie.",Sex and the City

It had a bit of everything and 3 or 4 times through the movie I involuntarily felt totally choked up and had tears welling in my eyes. I also laughed out loud with the rest of the cinema and observed the smiles, laughter and cuddles people shared on the way out.SATC the movie had the same fun, cheeky and sophisticated story telling that the series delivered week in week out. It had a bit of everything for true fans and picked up on each characters life nicely. After watching I was eager to see how high the film had rated on IMDb and thought for sure it had cracked the top #250 list. To have a rating of 5.2/10 at the time of writing was a bit of a shock to say the least.

Eventually one realizes that no, it's only a chronicle of the senseless, empty life of people who live in adoration of the superfluous products of Louis Vutton, Cartier, and Vogue magazine. Whose maximum objective is to have the rich and famous type lifestyle the media has made every effort to promote in the last decades, as if it weren't nothing more than a bottomless pit where real satisfaction is never attained. But no again. This movie, this story is not even that. It really is just a girly movie about love, luxury, living life being what you are not, glitter, appearance, sex, bullshit.

I was so afraid that there was going to be overblown characterizations, but they were TRUE to Sex and the City! I loved the entire movie! And I think its not surprising that it is as big as it is! I want to see it again and again! My daughter, 22, has already seen it twice! Its interesting to see some of these comments on here, women are NOT supposed to like fashion...they are NOT supposed to be bitter about being left at the alter...they are supposed to what????

It's a fun brain candy, not a Kafkian masterpiece, and one has to be really full of oneself to expect more than that. The most important lesson there - women, wrapped up in our sense of righteousness and victimhood, don't listen to what men are saying, frequently ignoring a clear message of distress, and that was a realization that the two lead characters, Miranda and Carrie, had to develop. And they did. Samantha, true to her character, remains loyal to herself and refuses to become secondary to any male, while most people would expect her to be grateful to have any man at the age of 50. Charlote is the cute comic relief, nothing more, really.Kudos to writers for being loyal to the show fans, unapologetically honest, and sometimes crass, and for not forgetting to add on some of that fabulous Park Avenue/Vogue magazine fluff.I managed to get together 10 married working moms and we all had a blast.

219,mlopezib8,Not the TV series,5,4 August 2008,"Until now, there are several examples which confirm that adapting a TV series to the cinema is not a good idea: The Simpsons, South Park, X-Files... and Sex and the City. I'm not saying that these are extremely bad movies. Simply, that they are not the TV series, especially if you've been fond of them. The girls have grown up and now they are supposedly mature women who care about other things. All that stuff that made us laugh on TV is not here anymore: no clubbing, no drugs and... no sex! How comes that a movie called Sex and the City has so little sexual content. Carrie has become so demure that she even dismisses the idea of telling her friends how often she has sex with Big. I suggest another title for the movie: Sex and Samantha. Somebody told me: ""that's the logical evolution, they are not going to stay like that forever"". Perhaps, but we, as viewers, may not be prepared for this change. The movie has some good points, though, in the effort of Parker to seem a good actress and not only a glam queen: the scene where she's left by the groom just before the wedding is probably the most powerful feature in the film. On the other hand, Samantha still makes us laugh with her usual games and attitude towards life. In conclusion, this movie would have perfectly worked as a romantic story but not as a reminiscence of the greatness of Carrie's, Samantha's, Charlotte's and Miranda's adventures.",Sex and the City

Was it perfect? No. But my overall feeling when I left was that it made me laugh and cry, and it was very nice catching up with the 4 friends. Also, I will miss them. I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoyed the series. I felt they stayed true to each of the 4's personalities. I would of liked to see more of Anthony, Harry, and Stanford, but let's face it, the gals had to be the focus.

The movie, however, was as flaccid as Spam; it was entirely unsuccessful in its attempt to achieve thorough character development/portrayal in a couple of hours.Think of it this way, if you cringe at the thought of FRIENDS coming together to make a movie, SATC is exactly the same. There's simply too much history within the series that can be sufficiently revisited/covered in the movie.We get it, you have a lot of clothes, SJP and minions. But then again, even those Blahniks couldn't save you from being convincingly labelled as the world's unsexiest woman, could they?

It was like being in the theater without the darkness, popcorn, and a significant other to hold the drinks.I would give this movie (going on not seeing every single shoot) ~ 1 Thumbs up ... just for me there was really no big difference of them putting it on the big screen versus just having HBO produce and run it as a TV movie.",Sex and the City

I had seen episodes when I was younger, but in the last years with Samantha & Smith, and Miranda & Steve, I really loved it. So, seeing the movie was a big thing for me, and I can say that it wasn't disappointing at all! The movie is set a couple of years after the series ended, with each of the the girls still friends, but in different places of their life. Miranda with Steve and her son, Samantha with Smith in LA, Charlotte with Harry and their daughter Lily, and a successful Carrie with Big.Each character is still the same as they once were, but just a bit different. Every moment was wonderful, and the whole theatre laughed, cried, and gasped for the bigger moments.This movie really is amazing, and if you were a fan of Sex before, you won't regret seeing the movie.

Need I go on and prolong the agony? It begs the question as to why Hollywood must continually flood us with these shallow, insipid characters, these egotistical women who are so far from reality and who have sex confused with love (as does Hollywood).

226,Dangb81,A good way to satisfy SATC fans!,7,12 March 2016,"I have probably seen this movie more times than I can count. I have it on DVD and I still watch it when it is on T.V. I watched all of the SATC episodes as they aired, just as a true fan would. When the series ended, I felt there could have been so much more and this movie finally provided it. On occasion, my girlfriends and I still gather with snacks and wine to watch this. The best thing about SATC is that they understand what a normal woman goes through. This movie will make you laugh, cry and feel all other kinds of emotions. The soundtrack is great and the outfits, as always, are amazing. You can tell that the great Patricia Field designed these ladies outfits to reflect how much they have grown. My only critique on this film is Jennifer Hudson. I feel her part in this movie was not a good fit. Her acting was blah and over done. She tried too hard and it backfired. Obviously she went on to win an Oscar because she is a good actress, but in this movie, she wasn't. Maybe she received training after this film, but they missed the mark with her here. Other than that, it's a great movie that provides the missing dose of SATC fans were waiting for.",Sex and the City

I thought the movie was just OK to me but I give it a real high rating from how much my wife and the audience seemed to like the movie. I heard a lot of cheers and reactions from the crowd in the theater and heard tears. Any movie with that kind of reaction should get a good vote.The story was well done, with good acting. The movie didn't change the characters from the way they acted during the show. They all should real emotion during their parts. There was some good humor that helped me sit through a very long movie. It started at 10:30 and wasn't over till after 1:00 AM, thats why I say it was just OK, very long and I was getting tired. But during the long 2hrs and 25minutes the movie didn't drag out and the length of the movie is great for the true fans.I'm very happy that after the movie I didn't feel that I wasted a lot of money ($19.50 tickets, $20.50 popcorn candy drink, $8 in gas) My wife loved the movie and that made me real happy.",Sex and the City
229,Robertdeluca,"Too Much Product Placement, Not Enough Sex",4,31 May 2008,"I played hooky from work to catch a Friday matinée of this movie. The last time I blew off work to see a movie was in 2000 when I saw ""Gladiator,"" so this is not something I make a habit of doing.Anyway, I was a big fan of the show, and in a 30-minute format the show had pacing, snap and an edge that regrettably could not be replicated for two-hours plus on the big screen. In small doses the series made light of the fact that these four women are shallow, whiny, self-centered, materialistic, and annoying. If Carrie Bradshaw really had as many clothes as she wore in the series/movie, she would need a closet the size of Shea Stadium. Only Samantha Jones is totally aware of her vacuousness, and brazenly admits the she comes first. The other three lamely pretend that's it's the men that have their heads up their collective rectums. Many times they do, but a normal man would rather head for the hills than submit themselves to these women's pettiness.Jennifer Hudson, Academy Award winner Jennifer Hudson, was wasting her time in this movie, playing second banana to Whiner #1. The low ratings that this movie has been accumulating on this website are definitely justified. At first I thought it was just some bitter idiots trying to be gratuitously scathing. Having seen the movie with my own two eyes, I join them in my trashing of this two-hour fashion show/product placement fest.What would have been cool is if they brought back some of the more memorable one-shot characters from the TV show like Mr. Pussy. After all the title of movie is ""Sex in the City,"" not ""Lame Love with a Predictable Happy Ending in the City."" Major Major Complaint: Too many Sarah Jessica Parker closeups. They were almost as scary as tight shots of Keith Richards in IMAX.",Sex and the City
230,charne99,"Critics will always be critics, look at the word itself",9,6 June 2008,"There are always going to be those who criticize a movie for the sake of criticizing it - that is what they do. They are called movie critics. Then there are those who just simply loved or hated something because it didn't fit into what they were either expecting or the high standard they held it. Then lastly there are those who just go to a movie to enjoy it and they either do or they don't. Unfortunately, often times people take critics opinions as sound judgment - and I feel they forget one thing - they are doing their job and that is to dissect a movie. Personally I loved SITC. I felt that it picked up very close to where the characters left off in the series and it had many emotionally charged scenes that were very true to the ladies of the show. They kept everything intact, including all of the characters and stayed true to their personalities. It was over two hours of total chaos and fun and lots of treats for those fashion lovers (and lets face it - doesn't that kind of gratuity help a movie??!) and even gave a recap of the characters for those who hadn't seen the series (and there will be some). Although it was long I felt that was another little treat for the viewers because they shoved as much Sex in the City as possible into a movie so that those who miss the series could enjoy watching their favorite characters lament over men, enjoy fashion and friendships as long as possible! Were there things that could have been changed? Well sure, as in every movie but IMO it doesn't ruin the overall effect.

232,majorfilmlover,Just what I expected.,7,16 June 2008,"This was an entertaining movie and true to the story line of the series. It was very lighthearted and completely girly at times, but also had some more poignant moments.First, the fun and silly: All the characters are true to form from the series. Charlotte is still a little walking Mrs. Manners, always trying to do things properly. Miranda is still a no nonsense hard-nosed workaholic. Carrie is still stuck in relationship limbo. Samantha is still a sex vixen cougar. Sushi anyone? Don't think the irony of that is lost on that scene since there was that infamous episode in the series when her previous lover cheated on her by eating someone else's ""sushi"". The beginning was a quick catch-up with what the ladies are all up to now that a few years have passed. Everybody is essentially on the same exact track as the series left off so it's very familiar ground here for die hard fans. There is also the fashion focus as always with what the girls wear, official fashion shows in Bryant Park, and a Carrie show as she is doing some difficult wardrobe thinning. The ladies share a very funny scene when they are an audience to a not so Mrs. Manners moment from Charlotte. Sure it's silly, but really funny and well-timed with the mood of the movie at that point.Poignant moments: This is where some people may have felt cheated since pre-release interviews seemed to indicate/hint that there might be a death or ""great loss"" that the girls have to deal with. Although no one died, it definitely feels like a death when something like this happens to you. Big makes a fool out of Carrie in a very public way. Even though he tries to quickly undo this situation she'll have none of it. She's burnt. She's been through this before. She feels like a complete ass for ever trusting the man she'd broken up with so many times before for the same reason. It's hard and it's real if you've ever had the displeasure of going through it in real life. Miranda was a sort of catalyst to the situation since she was dumping on life at that moment and decided to pass on the doom and gloom. Carrie finds out about her role in this debacle, but only after a long time has passed and so she feels ultimately betrayed by one of her best friends and now has her and Big on her crap list. The two try to work it out but it wasn't so easy. After all, Carrie had to literally drag herself up from the depths of despair and depression after the Big incident. It's refreshing that they show Carrie's character without makeup, swollen eyes, disconnected from time  just like how it would be in real life.Ending: How easily would you forgive a broken heart and broken ego? Carrie eventually does and everything is wrapped up all hunky dory, as if they knew they ran out of screen time and had to close the movie in 2 minutes. This was disappointing to me so it's good that it was at the end and that I enjoyed the rest of the movie so much. I suppose they didn't want to end it on a sad note, but it could have played off a bit more realistic since they devoted so much time on showing her gut wrenching heartache throughout most of the movie. Overall, it was exactly what I was expecting, and a fun experience to go see with one of my girlfriends. If you are not a die hard SATC fan than this just won't work for you. You have to be already invested in the movie and its characters before you even see it because it will seem too fluffy at parts. If you are a die hard fan, then you'll have a great time with your friends. I recommend it.",Sex and the City
233,movie454545,I Tried This On But It Made My Legs Look Fat,5,14 July 2008,"I saw this movie because I wanted to see what women were absorbing en masse. I had always figured the show was written by gay males using women as safe cover for their takes on life in the city. I must be wrong because because the few gay characters in this are so cliché and one dimensional that someone very out of touch, that never lived NYC may have written the script. In fact, most of the main characters are one dimensional. The only real character with real issues in this film is Miranda (yes, I know over-sexed Samantha had a cancer scare on the show). Her character made this film tolerable. Outside of Miranda, the superficiality these women crave if vile and repellent. Yes, Kim Cattrall is still looks great but that's not nearly enough to save this. I know I wasn't the planned demographic and, truth be told, I had to fast-forward the wedding dress shopping bits. Of course, this is escapism. Most of us, I imagine, don't have friends this wealthy so I guess it's fun for some to see people buy such & such bag for 2k or such & such necklace for 40k just as one likes James Bond & his toys but they never ask truly important questions of life: Is Vera Wang stuff made at the same factory as crappy Old Navy stuff? I never liked the show because it seemed to equate sleeping around with being a mature and independent human being. YIKES. There's not much of a story here. The redeeming aspect of the show and the movie is the focus on friendship. However, you do get the feeling they all hate each other on some level. Maybe that's a girl thing; maybe that's a New York thing.",Sex and the City
234,Sarah22222222,Not quite as sharp as the TV series but still a lot of fun! You'll love the familiarity if you're a fan!,5,29 May 2008,"I'VE TICKED THE BOX BUT JUST IN CASE YOU DIDN'T READ THAT LITTLE BIT AT THE TOP - THIS DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!I couldn't quite believe my eyes when I arrived at the cinema - I've never seen it so busy, not even for Spiderman 3 - which was a massive box office hit. The 9.15pm showing was sold out the day before and people were queued to the doors of the cinema just waiting to get into the film screen. It was so packed they had to separate the ""Sex and the City"" fans from those heading to ""Indiana Jones"". The crowd was buzzing with excitement which I had to love, to the point where they cheered when the lights went down in the screen. The opening was excellent, sensational, just perfect - as they recapped the most important points of the series with Carrie's narration and sleek shots of New York intertwined. I was bubbling with excitement when the sparkling letters of the title hit the black screen - ""Sex and the City: The Movie"" had finally arrived!The audience responded enthusiastically throughout - laughing whole heartily at every gag - however I have to admit that some of the humour was not quite as sharp as in the series and the one slightly more intellectual line seemed lost to the majority of the audience - Samantha facing hell when she met ""Dante"". However I'll admit to laughing along a lot too - this film is a lot of fun and definitely re-watchable. Some of the romance orientated scenes turned a little weedy and saccharine and I had to admit I was disappointed not to hear Big utter his immortal - catchphrase if you will - ""absofuckinglutely"". Saccharine romance was something the series had always avoided. It had always exuded class and usually sparkled with the same sweet feeling that Meg Ryan's older romances had - say ""French Kiss"" along side Kevin Kline. I had to also wonder, although I don't like myself for doing it, the point of the film. Nothing really changed apart from Smith and Sam's break-up, and did we really need a whole film for that? In saying that I definitely do not regret it being made - I enjoyed revisiting New York through the girls eyes, it was simply good to see them again, great to giggle guiltily at Samantha's escapades, to drool at couture with Carrie, to smile at Charlotte's innocent optimism and to then laugh when Miranda shoots her down with scathing sarcasm. As per usual Samantha got the best lines, everything else was also ""as per usual"" - Carrie in turmoil over Big, Miranda relationship-less and Charlotte taken with her young daughter and baby on the way. While the familiarity was extremely charming, I would have liked a few more nods to the old series - in particular Big's ""catchphrase"". I liked the addition of Jennifer Hudson as Carrie's assistant but unfortunately it was Carrie's exchanges with her that were often too sickly sweet. It felt as though the film was too much about ""love"" - when the series had never got caught up in awing over that one word. I'm also under the impression that it was toned down for the big screen - in some ways it wasn't - there were the sex scenes but I noticed one four letter word replaced by a phrase with Samantha - which was a little out of character. However, toned down is perhaps not quite the right word because the audience were certainly shocked to see some of what they did on the cinema screen! Count on ""Sex and the City"" to make even full grown women blush. I did enjoy this film, it was a lot of fun and I wasn't urging it to end by any means. It did however lose a little bit of what made the television series so brilliant. Some instances however felt as if they were there just for the fans - take Charlotte telling the entire restaurant about Big and Carrie's engagement - I almost wanted to applaud with the diners because it felt as though Charlotte was saying it to us - it's been six years of Big and Carrie back and forth and finally, ahhh. There are teary moments - ones which I will embrace a little better re-watching the movie curled up in bed! There are laugh out loud and feel good moments and moments when you can just admire the fashion. I need to emphasise once more how much I loved the opening and fans absolutely will!!Ignore the 3.5 rating on the IMDb because it's way off - certainly many of you will also rate the film much higher than I have - but then I'm pretty critical (and this is coming from a major fan of the series). It's more than worth a watch, go see it, have a girly night out - I had to love the feeling that all the women in the country flocked to cinemas on the 28th! And a quick comment on the music - some of it wasn't quite my taste but it certainly fitted the film, I wasn't overly keen on the use of ""Auld Lang Syne"" but it was rather poignantly used. India Arie's ""The Heart of the Matter"" could have been more heavily used but I'll let that one go... Well, that's all from me - a rather disjointed piece! Just my comment on seeing the film last night. Go out. Go see. Go enjoy!",Sex and the City

236,devilmademedoit,A New-to-SATC Viewer's Perspective,1,25 October 2008,"I am not really an SATC fan as I have seen maybe 2 TV episodes, but I decided to give this movie a shot given the fanfare. I thought I would be watching a witty-bantered reflection of modern women on the cutting edge female sensibilities, but what I realized as the credits rolled while that horrific song by Jennifer Hudson blared from my speakers is that I felt disgusted rather than inspired. Why? I thought about it. I have nothing against fans of this show. Like what you want. I also was not offended like the feminists who feel these women set their movement back to the stone ages. I could go on and on about the many character flaws and appalling behavior each one does but that is not it either. No, I hated this movie because these women are represented as heroes living ideal fantasy lives yet they are some of the worst people imaginable. They seem to have carte blanche in life to do whatever they want without concern for time, money, or health. What do they do with this golden opportunity? Do they do volunteer work and help others? Do they travel the world and experience other cultures? Do they donate to charities? No. They shop for shoes and spend gobs of money on designer-line clothing. They talk about their small problems and share their experiences in this movie like their lives are more important than everyone elses. And they have reckless, meaningless sex without concern for real-world risks. These are the behaviors of good people? With all that carte blanche freedom this is all they have learned about life? Examples...Carrie's boyfriend drops an insane amount of cash on a new apartment for her and what does she do? Thank him? Conserve her own money to help contribute? No, she complains about the closet, selects the wedding spot without his input, and bumps their wedding guest list from 75 to 200 without his knowledge. So, he decides to surprise her by redoing this offensive closet into a palace. What does she do as her surprise? She buys a gift. A gift for herselfnew $550 shoes to put in her new closet. How thoughtful. And then there is Samantha, who dates a guy who obviously has nothing in common with her. Why do you not like relationships? B/c you choose the worst people on earth who have nothing to offer you or anyone else with any integrity. She breaks up with him after 5 ½ years by suddenly telling him she is leaving as he walks in the door from work. This, after she stops by her neighbor's house while he showers nude outside and basically offers sex upon first site of her. This guy had no idea if she was married and she knows he has a girlfriend (she voyeurs their sexual exploits from her bay window). What is her reaction to his rude innuendos? She is charmed. So, Samantha the reason you hate relationships is not that they are evil but b/c you are evil and no good guy would want to spend ten minutes with you. So you get the jackholes of the world. And, you bring it on yourself by being an arrogant slut who likes when manwhore neighbors come onto you without any conversation or understanding of who you are. When you did break up, you talked about all the sacrifices you made over the 5 ½ years and that you just love yourself too much. How thoughtful. Like this guy did not sacrifice for 5 ½ years? Springing a breakup on him without any concern or thought for how it affects him. You just suck, period and I wish you the worst forms of hell for your future. Back to Carrie, the worst of them all. My last example that really irritated me is when she got mad at Miranda for telling Big the night before the wedding that he should not get married. Carrie was genuinely mad with her friend of 20 years for this. I mean, sure it was a rude thing to say. But come on! Miranda had just a drop of crap going on herself with the cheating husband thing and god forbid she express her own issues!! No, it is all about Carrie all the time. And also, Carrielisten. If this guy had doubts, Miranda's comment did not change anything. Miranda actually saved you a lifetime of misery b/c if that comment could sway him then he was not right anyway. I had hoped Carrie would realize that. I had hoped that just as Carrie started to realize he left her b/c maybe she was the problem, that when Miranda threw her the lifeline ""no it is not you, it is b/c I said something!' that Carrie would be a good enough person to say, ""That comment was not nice, but come onBig and I have dated 10 years so that one comment did nothing. He was going to leave regardless. In fact I want to hug you b/c if this makes you feel this bad still after 5 months I realize how much you actually care about me."" I could go on and on with endless examples, like at the end when the women say they love cosmopolitans and wonder aloud why they stopped drinking them (Carrie says, ""Because everyone else started""). What a meaningful reason. Let's stop doing what we like not because we do not like it anymore, but because it became popular and therefore it is immediately below us. Anyway, in conclusion SATC (Self Absorbed Tarts Complaining) is the most despicable misrepresentation of what good people do with their time. I suspect people that hate the USA across the world could use this as a recruiting video.",Sex and the City
237,andglasgo,Highly disappointing...don't waste your money,2,6 June 2008,"I distinctly recall an episode in Season 2 (I believe it was) of the series when Big takes Carrie to a swanky party at some apt on Park Ave/Upper East Side and she says Big really has no idea who I am. She questions being in the presence of all these uppity rich types.The later part of the series and the movie within itself essentially turned Carrie and all of the girls into caricatures of themselves. In the early seasons they actually hang out in typically low key clothing to watch a movie with your girlfriends on Friday nights, but in the movie they are helping Carrie pack up her apt. in their designer, couture dresses. It all feels so forced and is very disappointing. What made the series so good was the naturalness, the witty dialouge, and the friendships between the girls. Carrie spends the whole film whining about everything, and of course she ends up with Big. Its a series of episodes forced into a disjointed movie where Big appears at the end to of course magically end up with Carrie. The whole part about the girls going to Mexico was so stupid and really had nothing to do with the story line at all. For a show with such great writing and scripts, its obvious they wanted to make some extra bucks by creating a movie and losing all sense of creative direction. What was the point of Jennifer Hudson's role? To add some diversity??

Sounds a bit lame, I can understand, but there's nothing wrong with feeling bliss when picking up a gown by Vivienne Westwood or getting a Louis Vuitton bag. It's just a way of life. For me it was exactly like the TV show - the acting, the vibe. I didn't want to ask anything more or receive less from the actors. You have to admit, it could've been a whole lot worse in the sense that it could've a)turned out to be overoverover the top, filled with even more drama and loads of unnecessary/sappy garbage; b)ended up like an awkward episode of the show - not a very good one. The drama was appropriate, I think, and it was odd and very pleasant to finally see Carrie's attitude towards Big's attitude. A wonderful finale. With a cheesy topping, of course, but i don't think it's that important. I left the cinema happy with the choice to see it, happy with the fact that we won't have to see sex from Samantha, Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte in their sixties. Oh boy.Um, but the Miranda sex was a bit too much. Yep. Too much.",Sex and the City
240,boony123,thoroughly enjoyable film,8,2 June 2008,"OK,i don't know how in the world this movie only got 4.3 stars but i absolutely loved it. I have been a fan for ages, even though I'm a guy, and i thought the movie lived up to its expectations. I was smiling the whole time...it made me so happy. Sarah Jessica Parker was great an i thought Kristin Davis had a surprisingly great role. Cattrall was as usual a standout and Nixon was good. They all worked together really well. King really moved form the episode to the movie really nicely. The movie was like one really long episode with movie like attributes. It is definitely a film for sex and the city fans but i reckon other people will enjoy it as well.Don't listen to some of the stupid voters of IMDb, listen to me!Great, great, great film that kept me smiling for days. Must see for fans.8 out of 10!",Sex and the City
241,lucky_a41,big disappointment,5,17 June 2008,"I've watched the movie hoping to capture some of the moments form the series.But there weren't any.It really made me sad watching 4 girls who can't find their identity although they've reached a certain age. The plot is very weak, and the jokes don't even exist.Sometimes I was under the impression that I was watching a Fashion channel instead of a movie. I didn't expect to watch an Oscar movie, but on the topic of fashion+friendship I can find at least 3 movies better than this one (one would be 'The Devil wears Prada'. The only character from the TV show that keeps its personality is Samantha(it was a bit unbelievable that she would end up being faithful and committed to one man for the rest of her life).Her break up from Smith was necessary. Miranda's character doesn't follow the line of the series(she was very upfront, and now she waits for 5 months to tell Carrie that Big's indecision was her fault. Her character wasn't the one of a woman who can't cope through life, and now she seems to neglect Steve until he cheats on her. Charlotte is unnecessary in this movie,she doesn't have any role in it(she doesn't have any problems, she is there to remind us that life is like a fairy tale when you marry a rich person and all you have to do all day is going jogging and watching fashion shows) And Carrie's behavior doesn't make any sense(instead of talking to Big in the night before the wedding she tells him to go to sleep, because everything will be fine in the morning).She's very self-centered but she was like this in the series also. And the movie is way to long for this type of a plot(not to mention that their trip to Mexico doesn't have any relevance). Except for the costumes, sometimes during the movie I got the impression that it was made to show off clothes instead of showing a plot.",Sex and the City

And for ""Quite gimmicky to throw Jennifer Hudson in there to be Carrie's assistant. Is this to make up for the fact that the TV series almost never had any blacks? "" here we go again with the black/white debate..oh come on rich-228 from Houston, don't be ridiculous; amazing that a simple sweet nice romcom could bring in this debate again! Jennifer Hudson played the part perfectly but would have she been yellow, green or red, wouldn't have mattered to me and no colour of skin debate should be brought into the discussion! why look for silly reasons... I am a true fan, loved the series which I saw several times and loved the movie, it is funny and emotional, brilliant; made me cry, made me laugh so much at certain times,great entertainment...cant wait for the next chapter....",Sex and the City
243,julialuvsmovies-2,Loved it!,10,1 June 2008,"I loved seeing Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha again! The girls are getting older and so are we. As an avid fan of the series (I've seen every episode a minimum of 4 times), I think the movie picked up right where the series left off.Even with the introduction of all the characters, I feel like it would be tough to ""get"" this film if you had not seen the episodes.I got choked up when Miranda met Steve on the Brooklyn Bridge and I got choked up again when Big got on one knee to propose to Carrie. It's been a long time since a movie did that, but we all identify with these characters so much that only this movie could do that.",Sex and the City
244,kathe-1,A Delightful Romp in the City!!,9,1 June 2008,"My hubby and I couldn't WAIT to see SATC and weren't disappointed! It was great to see all of our old friends (we've watched the entire series, episode by episode, on DVD at least 4 times through). It was terrific that so many of the original actors were on board (even little Brady! Yup, same little guy played him in the TV show). The character development was fun to watch, and the wardrobes were fabulous. And the soundtrack was great, too. There were so many funny lines that we were often still laughing and missed the NEXT line. There were MANY more men in the audience at the theater than we'd expected. We'll definitely pick up this DVD when it becomes available. ENJOY!",Sex and the City
245,TS_Green,Princesses and Drama Queens,3,26 August 2021,"To my surprise, I've had this DVD!I liked the original HBO series because the women were ""independent"" and not afraid to speak up. But I didn't like Carrie and Big because they were both ""drama queen""!This movie centered their relationship, so it's unavoidable to be melodramatic.Carrie and Big decided to get married, but it's not because they want to, but because Carrie is worried about losing everything if they split up without marriage.When Big didn't show up to the wedding, Carrie overreacted and left. Why don't they talk? In this movie, no women talk. Miranda and Samantha are the smart ones, but they even become drama queens like Carrie.Then the girls go to Mexico to cheer up Carrie, but she is such a ""princess""!!Plus it's kinda irritating how easy for Carrie to buy back her apartment, or for Miranda to move out to have her own place. Yes, it depicts women's issues with marriage, but they are so rich, I can't relate to it.Charlotte is the only one who has no problem with her marriage, and I think it's because she prioritizes it.Anyway, Carrie, Miranda and Samantha have to face the music and make decision about their relationship, but ""not by logic, but by emotion""!!I understand Miranda and Steve get back together because they seem conformable with each other. And Samantha realizes she's not made for settling down. Fine.But Carrie, she didn't even think about marrying Big in the first place. And I'm personally offended that Carrie and Big would have a ""life-size"" wedding at the city hall among people like me because they are obscenely rich!! Oh, I almost forgot, Jennifer Hudson is in this movie as Carrie's assistant. Carrie buys her Louis Vuitton bag which ""young, black girl can't afford"".And why does Carrie and Big never have a sex scene? Their relationship is the center of the story, why didn't they show themselves intimate in the big f- - kin closet?! Rather, Miranda and Steve have to play an obscene sex scene. I don't like that Sarah Jessica Parker is protected from sex and nudity, while other actresses have to be bold about it.I wonder if I still like the original series if I re-watch them now. I have no interest in the reboot. I don't know if anybody would be interested in the story of white privileged old women in current political climate.....",Sex and the City
246,Monkey594,Just okay,6,31 May 2008,"I'll keep this short, kind of. If you watched the series, of course you'll watch the movie but be prepared to be a tab bit disappointed. The beginning and end were good, it was not so good in the middle. If it had been an hour long movie it would have been perfect. I couldn't have cared less about Samantha's story line. Miranda and Carrie's story was nothing new but still interesting. Charlotte was probably the most true to the series. Nothing involving her story or character seemed forced or over the top. I think the movie definitely could have done without the Jennifer Hudson character (can't even remember her name even though I just saw the movie). Her and Carrie's story was cheesy and unnecessary. After watching some of the episodes after seeing the movie, I realized what was missing; Carrie's narration. Without it, writers were forced to set up scenes with bad dialogue and it really took away from some of the humor and heart I was used to in the series.",Sex and the City
247,matt75-1,One,1,2 June 2008,"This movie was such a disappointment: so disrespectful to the series, the characters' original complexity, and women's complexity!I was particularly let down by the script. First of all, the jokes were not funny. From the 'Saint Louise from St Louis' to Charlotte's Mexican incident, everything was so unlike Michael P King's style. Then the plot: predictable (Samantha's ring/ Smith being the guy getting it to her; the password of Carrie's email folder being 'love' like on the key chain...) but most of all characters were out of their 'tv series' parts. Especially Carrie: hitting Big with the wedding bouquet and screaming at him in the middle of 5th ave, really?!? Planning a honeymoon in Mexico, really (btw, the guy greets them with 'welcome to Mexico', that's 'broad' and silly)?!? Telling Miranda 'you ruined my wedding', really? That dinner scene seemed like out of an episode of The Hills.I personally also found Jennifer Hudson terrible: she already won the 2008 Razzie to me (altough I should check if Sharon Stone is coming out with a new movie...).In general, if you think of what you saw in this movie without the affection you have for these characters, you must admit this is a terribly corny romantic comedy.Think of how wonderfully touching and poignant some episodes were. Like the one when Miranda finally took the courage to tell her feelings to Steve... It was titled 'One', and it was indeed a fully satisfying, beautiful episode.This movie is just a 1/10...",Sex and the City
248,bigwhiskers-12170,Mostly fodder for the diehards.,4,5 February 2020,"I can only see diehards of the TV show liking this movie. It plods too much and a lot of the situations are bad cliches. I mean I got sick of the whole Carrie ,Mr Big storyline from the Tv show that I skipped the episodes with him in it. Chris Noth is so unattractive and such a boring actor that I can't understand his appeal and for goodness sake ,why did they call him Mr Big incessantly for years?,doesnt the guy have a name ? enough already. Also in the unappealing unbelievable category Miranda and Steve , horseface and stone face, two such ugly irritating people.
I wanted to see them die in a plane crash. Boring Samantha as usual the sex starved slut and her boy toy , can you say snoozefest , she phoned it in .And of course wrapping it all up to make everyone happy. In reality she would have kicked big to the curb with his stupid emails copying lover letters . What girl would have fallen for that bs? he was a waste of space. and charlotte could give you diabetes ,yuck. The only thing amusing was Jennifer Hudsons character which is why I dont rate the movie any lower. Oh and Stanford the stereotypical queen trying to be more masculine played by a straight guy - ho hum . 4/10",Sex and the City
249,melovemax,"The best ""left at the alter"" scene ever",10,13 September 2008,"Now i know i'm female, and yes i did enjoy the series, but i wasn't by any means an addicted viewer, i simply watched it when there was nothing else on or when i remembered it was on. However i was reluctant to watch the movie, i knew it would be probably be cheesy like all the other movies that have been made from series'. I was pleasantly surprised though, the leaving at the alter scene was brilliant, not the actually scene but the acting, it was spot on, shocking and completely devastating. I would have to say it was this that me over, the rest of the film was just your average love story. It also didn't have the same magic as the SATC series.",Sex and the City
250,Manda-13,A disappointed longtime fan of the series,3,8 March 2009,"Let me preface this by saying that I am a straight female who has been a fan of the SATC series since its second season. I have every episode on DVD and have honestly seen every episode at least 5 times, including the commentaries by Michael Patrick King. That said, I could not be more disappointed in the film. To say that this movie was for fans of the series is insulting in my opinion because where the series had heart, depth and some intelligence, the movie had labels, poop jokes and lame choices by the characters.First of all, yes, Carrie Bradshaw is the main character, but could the other 3 women have been treating any more cavalierly? The ""plot lines"", if you can call them that, for the other characters seemed to be thrown into the mix just to give them something to do while Carrie ran around town, changing outfits and hair colors to the delighted shrieks of 15 year old fans. I can only imagine that was the audience the film wanted to capture because expecting grown women to follow this crap is insanity.Secondly, the ending of the film made me completely lose respect for Carrie. I cannot imagine an emotionally healthy 41 year old woman making the same choice she made. I think she needs intensive therapy because she is obviously a masochist who values the ability to purchase brand name couture more than her own happiness. And if the ability to buy couture is what makes her really happy, well, then, the 15 year old target audience should be thrilled.That said, I probably will see the sequel. I'm hoping they bring in more writers from the series to add some of the emotional oomph that this movie painfully lacked. *sigh* I just can't seem to quit SATC.",Sex and the City
251,lommetennis,Shows how far prime time TV and Hollywood has grown apart,3,5 June 2008,"I had been looking forward to seeing this move for a long time, but already when I saw the trailer I got a bad feeling for what was to come. ""SATC, the movie"" does top the series in the number of haute couture dresses and the sheer size of the format that we see in those all too long two hours, but in every other conceivable way almost any fan is in for a big letdown.What was a show filled with snappy wits and sex appeal is now a tear filled drama of four forty-something year olds trying desperately to find the way back to their fastpased Manhattan days of old. It doesn't look pretty.Where's the irony, where's the lust of life? In the end, the 80-something dresses Carry puts on just turs into a parody meant for the young shopaholic. Gone is everything that made the show so contemporary, up-to-date and successful.Order yourself the DVD set (like you haven't already!), a lot of Haagen Daaz, and do yourself the favor of not letting this movie ruin Sex and City for you.",Sex and the City

After watching 50 minutes I had to put a stop to it. I knew it was a waste of time.I guess this film might appeal to some people, but I find that it contains everything I dislike in films;Very shallow characters that are rich, compulsively spending money and highly materialistic.Almost exclusively Caucasian cast (except a few tokens here and there)Extremely bad acting (I guess Sarah JessicaParker wasn't actually so bad, she did what she could with the kind of role she was given)Very boring plot about people getting married / breaking up and whatever.Stupid jokes about crapping into pants etc.Not a single funny moment.I beg you, do not watch this film, it sucks.Why I gave it 3/10: 1 point that is given automatically to all films 1 point because there was audio 1 points because there were visuals",Sex and the City
253,vickypollardsbestmat-1,Pleasantly Surprised,7,3 June 2008,"As a film student I should really abhor a movie like this, and usually do, but you know what? I'm a woman first. I went in to this film with my friends with low expectations and came out taking stock of my own life and relationships. The women in this film are set up at the start to have gloriously perfect lives, only to be knocked down and made to realise that they are human and make mistakes no matter how old they are.So what if some of the humour is base and childish? If you can't be childish and laugh at stupid, everyday things then what is the point of being alive? And some viewers have had problems with the amount of moping going on in the film - this is conventionally what happens when you lose the love of your life. It is an important part of the healing process, because you are not just mourning the loss of a relationship, you are trying to come to terms with how stupid you were to let it happen to you in the first place! OK, fair enough, the goal of the producers here is to squeeze as much money out of idiots like me, but if you look hard enough there are lessons, not only to be learned, but shared. This film underneath all the glitz and glamour is about real people, real relationships, real problems, and as with real life, it throws humour into the tragedies.I wouldn't go out of my way to watch this again, but I'm glad I did see it, because as a woman with bad relationship experiences it spoke to me and made me feel a bit better. I still prefer Hitchcock, but there's nothing wrong with enjoying what isn't.",Sex and the City
254,pinkchi,This one is for the fans!,6,2 June 2008,"I was disappointed with this movie, maybe because the series had set such a high standard. No doubt the series is a masterpiece by itself, it's witty, funny and sexy. However, this movie is lacking in those areas.What happened to some of the characters? The male characters seem to be too passive. They seem to have no personality at all.I missed the conversations the girls had in the series, conversations that are filled with witty comebacks, puns and clever analogies, sometimes playfully crude.Jennifer Hudson's role seemed redundant. Instead of attempting to create some kind of character development for her in such a short span of time, there should be more focus on the other characters, like Stanford, who seemed to disappear in the most important parts.Sex and the City has avoided the clichés of a typical chick flick, but for me it borders on being a stereotypical chick flick at certain points. It did redeem itself eventually.Although this movie didn't live up to my expectations, it was entertaining, and nostalgic. There is double the glamour, and the soundtrack added to the overall enjoyment.And judging from the amount of attention this movie received from disgruntled men on the board, whether negative or positive, all these just shows that Sex and the City has achieved its recognition as the modern woman's fix. Sex and the City will become a classic in years to come, it is ageless.",Sex and the City
255,nitingrenu,@renukantam @KRAYNU @NITINGOVIND,10,6 January 2020,"When SATC ended in 2004, I, like everyone else felt the insane need for a little more Carrie, a little more Samantha, a little more Charlotte and a little more Miranda. 2008, Michael Patrick King and the cast and crew of and the City delivered a film that not only filled in the gap of four years away from our screens, they told us the story of what came next.The film itself is LONG, surprisingly long, and with this extended edition we're talking about an extra 10-15 minutes of unseen footage. The additional footage makes perfect sense for hardcore fans, these additional scenes are not only at times funny but they extend an offering of extra ""hope"" and sometimes ""explanation"" of scenes that were previously concluded.The TWO disc special edition is a perfect trade in for anyone who rushed out to purchase the film when it released in stores. On your second disc you will find an amazing conversation between show Creator Michael Patrick King and Executive producer / Star, Sarah Jessica Parker. Together they discuss everything from the process of character development - to fashion decisions with Pat Field. You will also find three additional scenes that did NOT make it into the extended cut of the film which are alternate takes on what you DID see make the final cut.Overall I rated this product ***** stars because it is a collector's DREAM to carry this film as a personal memento of appreciation, fandom and hope. Without plot give away - I will simply say this .... Once you find love, and once you think you've settled your dreams, does the ""dream"" always amount to reality? and when challenges arise in our personal lives, are we truly willing to accept what has been handed to us through circumstance, choice and history?.",Sex and the City

It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have heard that some people thought it was to long of a movie, I totally disagree with that.

259,bluelightningboom,Three reasons why I watched it despite the low weighted average rating,10,13 May 2010,"I don't want to waste time watching unsatisfactory films, even if its for free, so I consulted IMDb. This movie has a very low weighted average of 5.4 which means many were not satisfied with it. That is a signal that I should not watch, but there are inconsistencies which made me watch it on May 13, 2010 which is the last day of the showing of ""Sex and the City"" in a cinema here that shows ""not so old movies"" for only one week at a price of only around 11% the ticket price of a new movie. This movie was a new movie on June, 2008.Three reasons why I watched it despite the low weighted average rating:#1) It had a high US Gross box office sales of $152,647,258 (and worldwide gross of $415,252,786) which means many watched it. Maybe some who watched it recommended it to others or several people watched it more than once or some were forced to watch it with a fan. #2) ""10"" had the highest number of votes, among the 10 possible vote choices. 8,255 18.9% for ""10"" votes 3,175 7.3% 9 4,802 11.0% 8 5,644 12.9% 7 4,788 11.0% 6 3,617 8.3% 5 2,146 4.9% 4 1,734 4.0% 3 1,659 3.8% 2 7,877 18.0% 1 #3) I read the comments of those who voted ""10"". Most were written by fans, but I found 2 (there might be more but I'm already convinced with those 2) who were not able to watch the TV series (like me) and yet liked the movie very much so they rated it 10. Here is My 100% Honest Recommendation:Please watch it. You'll probably like it like me and its not a waste of time. As a bonus, you'll also learn a little something worthwhile. I rate it a 9 but rated it 10 here in IMDb so people who read only comments of those who vote ""10"" can also read it.",Sex and the City

And on a cold winter night you watched 5 episodes, because you couldn't get enough? Well, I did and I had the same experience watching the movie. So when you are going to this movie.

262,veryequipped,Were Helper Monkey's hired to hold the microphones?,3,9 June 2008,"Though I've never once seen the TV show, I watched this movie because I wanted to treat my girl, who does like the TV show.She didn't like it, but let me tell you why I did. It was funny for all the wrong reasons.70% of the movie had a mic hovering above the actor's heads, seriously. I thought had the actors physically responded by trying to dodge the microphones, this movie's value would have shot up sky high, but sadly the mics weren't meant to be there.Lots of sex and nudity. Had I dragged my girl to a guy flick with this much sex, nudity and dirty talk, I would be labeled a pervert. Lots of zoom ups on male nakedness, proving without a doubt, women are the perverts and us men are the peeped victims. Fortunately its OK for women's movies to make some women look like insatiable whores. I think one of those mics I mentioned earlier smacked someone in the head during sex. Which i'm sure it later regretted it when Kim Catrall's character had her way with it. A man was blamed for a woman gaining 15 pounds. Ya like a guy said, ""Honey why don't you go stuff yourself""Because Sarah J Parker's character had so little self respect that a break up by a dude who even acted too old to be fun, (and was clearly unstable himself) destroyed her and degraded her into the ""why-does-life-suck-only-for-me"" friend we love to babysit . Yah for grade 6!!! With the exception of Kim Catrall's character (whom I would be afraid to touch with less than three condoms on), every one of the main 4 characters (one husband included), inevitably demonstrated themselves to be odd, creepy, weird and just plain psycho.I did enjoy the 75 to 1 female to male ratio in the seats until 30 minutes into the movie, when the demonizing of men was well underway, and being 1 of 4 men in a packed theatre of 300 women, I slumpt low into my seat and plotted my escape before I was slaughtered for the demonic, evil masculine half of the species that I am.Unfortunately i made it through the movie alive, because even Death had the good sense not to be caught dead in front of this flick.",Sex and the City

Of course the characters are going to change in three years time; people seem to be forgetting that we haven't been shown the time between series-movie. The casting can't be faulted. All of the old, classic characters are as charming as ever and the new characters such as Louise, bring a little bit more joy to the heartfelt plot.The scripting in the film is very clever, and the balance between drama/comedy is as perfect as it was during every episode of the show. It doesn't seem to last over 2 hours, as I am so engrossed in the storyline, time after time watching it. The direction is similar to that of the series; Michael-Patrick King did an amazing job. A very worthwhile, interesting film. Can't wait till SATC2 :)",Sex and the City
265,clairemader,Sudden urge to buy a handbag,4,13 March 2009,"Films made from TV shows often suffer from the problem that the same writers are used for both formats and the writers are used to writing for 30 minute sitcoms. What they try to do is stretch the same writing style to a two hour film and it falls flat.It has happened so many times that producers must know this pitfall, so you would think. With shows like 'Sex and the City' the problem is solved by that the program length is already an hour and there are 2 part-specials as well. So writing a movie script should be straight forward. What will not happen is that a script will feel like it has an added hour bolted on or the writers were clueless and threw some old ideas from the show together to keep the producers happy who saw the cash tills registering.That's what's happened with this film! Taking the themes that everyone knows from he end of the last episode of the last series: Carrie's back with Big, marriages, adoption, splitting up; each character conforming to what their characters were last doing. There's no new ideas in the script to justify this film. The better option would be to make a TV special which would have been far funnier.This film is no more than an advertising dream for handbag manufacturers. Being bludgeoned by images like an excess of the 1950's subliminal messages in movie theatres.",Sex and the City

I went to see this movie with a gf of mine and we loved it. I had never seen a sex and the city episode before and after i saw the movie, i went and bought all the seasons. This might sound pathetic, but i honestly found the movie so entertaining and light hearted that i wanted to see more. I'm guessing those that are already Sex and the City fans have seen the movie, so for those women out there that have not seen the TV show, see this movie. It may not be for you, but if you DO like it, you won't know what you did without it.",Sex and the City
267,housesm,don't listen to the trolls,10,22 February 2009,"OK, I admit it...my wife and I refrained from watching this movie due to the negative user comments. Then we started thinking about it and decided to watch it to find out if this movie is as bad as these comments say it is.Well, at then end of the movie we were pleasantly surprised. We own the series and have watched it more than once. When we found out a movie was being made we were pretty excited, but then these negative comments came out and we were disappointed.After watching the movie last night we were in shock that IMDb users were so far off--this movie rocked. It stayed in line with the series and reflected everything one would expect. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks and I said to my wife, ""I bet these negative comments are coming from all the religious freaks out there!"" After doing a little research on the IMDb forum I found out that this was true. Apparently, those individuals are called ""trolls"" and they use sites like IMDb to further their evangelical goals. In other words, if something does not conform to THEIR beliefs, or goes against THEIR beliefs they get on IMDb and slam the movie so others won't watch it; then VOILA! we're all automatically saved! And they wonder why more and more people are pulling away from their organized religious cults. The only reason these people do this is to make themselves feel better than other people. Then at the same time they'll gladly run cyclist off the road on their way home from church while at the same time flip fellow church members off as they pull into the liquor store to buy their five bottles of booze and cartons of cigarettes. When they get home what do they watch while doing shots: caged men beating each other senseless abusing each other's bodies and promoting violence in our society. BUT if somebody wants to realistically discuss sex in our society they get all pious and holier-than-thou and act like they don't do anything wrong, or God forbid admit they have sex (and sexual desires for others) like everyone else. BUT hold on--the violence is OK because...there are rules! What a load of crap. So do you think that God would agree that watching two people make love is better than watching two people make violence, hate and discontent? What is most frustrating these people try to keep others from doing things they don't believe in using a great service like IMDb. I say they keep all this to themselves and stay out of our world.Watch and enjoy this movie. You'll be thankful you did.",Sex and the City

What I got instead was sappy, uninspired writing; I actually rolled my eyes a couple of times, and I love chick flicks! These characters would never utter some of those lines. After developing such strong characters over the course of the series, someone fell asleep behind the wheel and completely short changed the viewers. Also, the movie is messy, trying to cram way too much into the alloted time, ending up with shallow plots all the way through. The only character plot line I believed was Samantha's. I missed the men in this movie, someone sucked the very life out of them. And finally, Jennifer Hudson's role could be neatly snipped out of the movie without it making a difference. I love her, but the role as written is way too cliché'd for even a fine actor like herself to make any sense out of.Saving graces: Kim Cattrall's performance and delivery, the fashion and the moments between the girls.",Sex and the City

I feel pretty slick! The fashion just wasn't there for me. I did like the wedding dresses in the photo shoot and the fabulous teal dress with the sheer sleeves that Sarah's character wore near the end. Everything else was crapola, especially Kim's character's 1980's dynasty zoot-suits. I didn't have the loyalty to the characters like some of my movie buddies who watched it with me, so I would have kicked Mr. Big to the proverbial curb. I was told that Sarah's character did the right thing -- again, I was not invested in any of the characters.Would not go back and watch the episodes for a pile of good chocolate, but I recommend the movie!",Sex and the City

Seen the whole series from beginning to end many times... and I could tell how the magic of the show got lost in the translation from the small screen to the big screen... First of all, the film makers somehow decided that it was best to flood the film with tons of product placement, expensive jewelry, cars, locations and clothes... the whole film seemed like a fashion show, with a little thin plot attached to it... A plethora of consumerism... How can anyone care for this characters in this film when they are flooded with all this garbage? I've seen single episodes in the series that have more depth, invoke greater feeling and get across more meaningful messages in less than thirty minutes than this extravagant, consumerism obsessed film did in more than two hours... Sure, it's nice to see it on the big screen, but it doesn't mean that it's not what it is... a bastardization of the original product; a product that has been bought by companies to parade their product on these mannequins (characters if you can call them that anymore) that are parodies of their former selves... And the whole plot is just plain ludicrous... This Big character comes across as a wimp that gets scared at the last minute... that's so out of character and so childish.... and then adding characters that practically do nothing for the film, like Jennifer Hudson's Louise.... A waste of time and waste of space that could have been given to a recurring character from the series.. Maybe it would have helped if more writers had been attached to it, rather than leaving only MPK to embark on a huge film like this on his own..",Sex and the City

Nevertheless, I had my doubts whether they could pull it off especially after reading reviews like what was in the New York Times.I saw it Friday night in a packed auditorium and all I can say is WOW! I loved this movie as seemed to be the consensus of the crowd. It is a wonderful movie and kept with the spirit of the series perfectly. Michael Patrick King can be proud. The Samantha and Charlotte characters made the movie fun. It by far exceeded my expectations. In the beginning I worried about it being too long, but in the end, I still didn't want it to be over after its 2 hr. 15 min. running time.Other reviewers have summed up the movie better than I can. I might have been bothered a little bit about the opulent lifestyles these women live. But then I realized, this is what makes the series so appealing...it is a fantasy. Yet the message isn't that we need the ""things"" in our lives, but we all hope to ""live happily ever after."" My last comment is to all of the immature men who comment negatively about this movie and they haven't even seen it. Well, this is another reason why women are flocking to SATC.

Somehow on my screen instead of seeing the girl's and the men that they love the way I had come to love them over the years, I found on the cinema screen in front of me a bunch of screaming idiots wearing expensive clothing and carrying around over the top accessories... nothing at all as they used to be. In the end I blame the writing because the script was the movie's biggest down fall and has let us all down.

From the ""girly"" side of things, yea it's a chick flick but an awful one at that. The acting was rubbish, I didn't believe for once that Carrie and Big wanted to be together,. It just didn't seem real and the acting of Miranda and Samantha was just as bad. As for Charlotte, the only good thing to come out of that is, the fact that it highlighted a strong issue of woman having children later on in life and how she had over come the fact that she couldn't bare children then to be able to bear one and how she was very careful that she didn't miscarry the child was good and while Samathan highlighted the issue of cancer in woman but still the acting was bad. The only thing I enjoyed was the fact that Carrie got stood up at her first attempt to ""make an honest man"" out big. The dress was fabulous, the same with the bridesmaids one but I will was not convinced. I'm not even sure if the film deserves on point but I will give it one for the simple fact that big got some thing that he deserved, however I feel that they should have let Carrie get on with her life and not marry big at the end.",Sex and the City

I am so pleased that they ended it with Carrie and Big finally getting married. It would have been a huge downer for everyone if it ended unhappily ever after!

The only disappointment that I had was the fact that there were 15 minutes of commercials followed by 15 minutes of previews. I loved the fact that once again their flaws were displayed in High def! The jilted wedding scene was classic. Wedding invitations for 200, $15,000. Wedding rings, $100,000. Reservations at library for wedding, $50,000. Jilting the bride and getting your ass beat with a bouquet in the middle of a busy New York street, priceless. I would have like to have seen more lines from Anthony and Stanford. I did not particularly like Jennifer Hudson's role. It's like she tried too hard. It wasn't natural. The biggest shock for me was Candice Bergman...she not only got old but fat as well.

Did you notice the tie in to the last narration given about 4 women in Manhattan???? There was plenty of depth...and plenty of laughter....just like I would expect from these 4 and their friends. I felt like it was a huge family reunion...and my only complaint is I will have to wait 4 more years for another SATC movie.My take is....4 women being strong...not following their assigned rolls....will always make sexist...be they males sexist pigs or sexist feminist pigs scream out in fear.

278,angel119,A dumbed down studio disaster,2,1 June 2008,"What a mess and what a disappointment. Everything was a caricature. As a fan of the show, watching the movie was much like watching a Saturday Night Live sketch. Full of one liners that fall flat and adolescent comedy, the movie bears little to no resemblance to the Sex And The City that created such a sensation.The heart of the original show was the writing. With its quick intelligent humor, witty puns and frequent pop culture references it was the glue that held the fantasy world of Carrie Bradshaw together. In the movie, it's poop jokes and humping dogs. Instead of frequenting indie coffee shops, low budget diners and vintage stores...the girls go to Louis Vuitton, Starbucks, Christian Louboutin, New York magazine and Vogue to name a mere few. The product placement and high production budget is undermined by the frequent large black boom mikes hovering in at least 8 scenes. It would have been more at home if there was a large Prada tag on it.Michael Patrick King, in the 30 minute format of TV, made every scene count, every line of dialog had a point. However given the chance to write a movie, he seemed at a loss for what to do with all the time. Long rambling montages with no point, set to, and I wish I was kidding, ""Walk This Way."" Entire scenes that didn't move the story forward. At all. The worst part is, everyone is to blame. Far too many hands in this pot and a cast that seemed miserable having to go through with it creates a cringe worthy experience for everyone.

(made me think what exactly chicks really do think about...)

The transition is seamless and you did not have to see the HBO series to ""get"" the movie. New York City is the fifth main character in this well written, well acted and beautifully filmed movie. The costumes are stupendous, by Patricia Field, another contributor from the HBO series. The movie picks up a few years after the series ended. We learn what has been keeping the girls busy and what lies ahead. Carrie is to marry Big. That is NOT a spoiler if you have watched the previews on any TV in the land. Samantha is preoccupied with Smith and LA life. Once again, NOT a spoiler if you have seen the previews. Miranda, Steve, Brady and Magda are in Brooklyn. Charlotte and Harry have Lily. And from there, the plot thickens, twists, turns and it is all about finding love in the City. At 148 minutes it is a bit long. The R rating is terrific. I am tired of the vanilla rerun versions on regular TV. Give me the R stuff. Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie has a few very ""brave"" scenes, sans makeup and with bad lighting. Parker can open a film and does this one proud. Kim Cattrall is Samantha Jones, in all of her perverse glory. Kristin Davis as Charlotte York is charming as always. Cynthia Nixon as Miranda Hobbes (the character I most identify with) is terrific. The supporting cast includes most of the regulars, Chris Noth as Big, Evan Handler as Harry,m David Eigenberg as Steve, Jason Lewis as Smith, Willie Garson as Stanford, Mario Cantone as Anthony, and Candice Bergen as Enid. Added to the cast is Jenifer Hudson as Carrie's assistant Louise from St. Louis. She comes to NYC to find love. The audience was screaming Carrie's name as the lights dimmed. They cheered as the movie started. They cried and laughed at all the right moments. SJP had 85+ costume changes. I want to know the story behind her pearls. The movie is a chick flick deluxe.

Unfortunately, it wasn't the movie I was hoping to see.It's great to hear Carrie's voice again, talking about her and her friends little dramas. But even SATC got 'carried away' with that Hollywood cheesiness. Where the show was spicy and provocative, the movie was too long and moralizing. Though some of the dialogs where pretty good, a lot of others weren't. The half of the time I felt like I was watching 4 totally different people than I saw and the show 4 years ago. Also, the story was pitiful (Carrie marries Big - oh no, she doesn't! - wait, she does!), they just tried to squeeze every possible scenario in 144 minutes (alot of breaking up and getting back together). And even my two favorite gay men had like two lines in the whole movie! The only great thing in the movie was the wardrobe. Compliment to Patricia Field, she has done it again! (Though the designer logos were shooting of the screen). But when the critics said this movie was made 'just for the fans', they were wrong. This movie was made for people who have no clue of what Sex And The City is, and just want a fun girls night out. The fans however, will be disappointed.I'm sorry. I wanted to like it so much (I rate it '10' just on my personal account, so it wouldn't be suck on a 3,5, cause it doesn't deserve that either), but Sex and the City is just a mess of very very good fashion, and bad fart jokes.

This was one of my worst decisions...The female stars are plain ugly, it is a real torture to see these burn-out faces on the big screen just in front of you.The plot is plain bad. No, I was mistaken, there is no plot. The cast was just f*king around in the city, while the old ugly stupid women were doing random things, and the cameramen made some shots. At a later point, the cutting must have been quite difficult to build up a somewhat linear story from all these messy random shots. So there is no sense to talk about character development. Actually, I didn't see any characters - as a ""character"" is something related to a human being, but the colorful spots appearing on the screen were only random samples of mind washed consumers.If you think farting and sh*tting your pants is funny, then there are some jokes in this film. I was frightening to see, that some people in the cinema found something funny in this movie...All the male characters are retarded losers, they are all gay, wimpy, infantile, or just big-d*ck f*ck machines.The movie suggests, that as a women, the meaning of life is gathering bags, shoes, and other useless sh*t, to the extent where you need a separate room - actually the biggest room of your apartment - to store all these sh*t. There is no point to build up a relationship with the opposite sex, as they are all retarded. There is no point to build up a family, because it sucks and it is only a source of torture and pain. Instead of all these you should spend hundreds and thousands of dollars to buy a pillow, so your mindless puppy can hump it. And if your neighbor has bigger d*ck, than your current boyfriend/husband/etc., then don't be afraid to fire him promptly and as rude as possible. And if you get a bag written Gucci or Louis Vitton or whatsoever on it, then you will be happy in the rest of your life, you will never die and Jesus will love you more.This movie a great representation of how rotten and sick some people are.

I was not surprised by any of the actions of any of the characters in this movie as others have pointed out. Samantha was always selfish, Charlotte was always protective, Miranda was always a workaholic AND Carrie has always been melodramatic. I agree that this movie does revolve around forgiveness, and that's always a difficult one. Miranda did change her life for Steve, but he ends up cheating on her (anyone remember that she moved out of a city that she loved and MORE IMPORTANTLY helped Steve take care of his mother when she had that stroke and then was never the same) To say she was ""overreacting"" when he tells her he cheats on her and she walks out? Give her a f#*king break!I always had the feeling in the show that Carrie/Miranda had a certain bond that they did not share in the same way with the other women. Anyone ever notice who she always argued with in the show more that the other women? They tell each other what they think more than they would ever tell anyone else and of course when you do that, you are not always going to agree...hence the arguments they have always had. I think the friendship they have is great in the movie and the show...I am pretty certain that it is 90% men giving this movie a bad review. I am married and my husband and I always watched the show together, he didn't see the movie with me but i'm curious now to know what he would think of it. I think he would be smarter than all the other men who saw dresses/shoes/women ""bitching"" and then just switched off mentally.It does not take a genius to figure out that the essence of this story was forgiveness and how important relationships are with your friends or your partner...You should see this movie if you were a fan of the show and you have a decent IQ.",Sex and the City

I thought showed a good light on women growing older and learning what they really wanted from life. I loved the assistant of Carrie's, an addition to the usual cast. It is really quite a bit longer than I thought going in, so be warned you are in for about 2 hours...also your guy probably won't like it much.",Sex and the City

I have read a lot of comments on this site and others that say men can't appreciate a film like this. The truth of the matter is I am very much a male and enjoyed the film tremendously. I do think in the movie producers tried way to hard to win over knew fans and still remain true to the new ones.I wanted to give this movie a ten just to boost its rating which is dismal. One complaint I had about the film was the fact that they always showed new groups of four girls showing the new woman who make up Sex and the City. But where was the modern group 3 girls and 1 gay man. Or maybe four gay men who exit out of a bar and resemble the personalities America has come to love. I can appreciate the fact that all the woman have definitely matured in their own way.I felt as though the movie should earn a great rating because if your single it teaches you to be true to yourself. If your dating it teaches you to trust your heart. Also if your with someone cherish that relationship only if its the right one for you.The movie does follow all four womens relationships. It does a nice job interweaving all the womens faults, and even rewards of friendship. Even though the men do tend to fall under the microscope by the women. If this were a guy dominated film then of course it would be the opposite way around. One of the classic moments the film gives us, are the traditional ""happy endings"" that are right for everyone. I don't want to give too much away so go to the theater yourself and see it. But word to the wise go soon, since the showing I went to was sold out.",Sex and the City

The actors and actresses did a very good job of portraying their original characters. I would have been disappointed if they had changed too much so this was very nice.

However, if you look carefully at the top of the screen, you are able to see the microphone in some of the scenes. I was surprised about that and there was even some difficulty with the picture itself. The movie was a little more serious and did not have as many humorous parts compared to the series. The fashion was greatly enhanced with lots of wild outfits. However, there seemed to be a bit of a commercial in the movie promoting purse rentals. (It is a great idea but I did not feel it should have been brought into the movie.) The ladies played their parts perfectly and each character seemed to have matured.

Don't mean to be misogynistic, but women have a habit of soaking this crap right up, and it will damage their lives.

When we sat down there was about 45 minutes of commercials, then another 15 minutes of previews for movies that are targeted for this audience thenit begins. In all fairness and objectivity, the first half of this movie was a train wreck, one of the most poorly executed romantic comedies ever, however in the second half it reclaimed some of the intelligence and sincerity that made the show watchable. And before this review is dismissed as just another cynical dude ranting about how annoying his girlfriend's friends are, I want to say that I actually thought the show was pretty good and this movie in general does a great disservice to its memory. It was nothing more than a long commercial for the corporate sponsors; they broke the characters down to inaccurate caricatures of their former selves; the plot was forced and confused and even the sex scenes seemed to be out of place and unnecessary (except for the ones with Samantha's neighbor, which were pretty entertaining). In general, one comes away with the impression that this was a very rushed production that put little thought into honoring what was good about the show and was just trying to cash in on its superficial popularity.

In fact, it made me realize I need smarter friends.This movie turned my brain into a puree. In short, it was over 2 hours of meaningless plot and ignorant characters who worship a superfluous and shallow life. The series at least have some fun episodes. This movie, however, is nothing but propaganda for big fashion labels (vogue, gucci, iphone, louis vuitton, etc). I condenm this increasing Hollywood trend of inserting commercials in the movies. Yes, commercials. Not the implicit type of advertisement we hardly notice, but blunt and crude ""buy-it-now"" commercials that you see on regular TV, and charging movigoers to watch them. Be advised: if you have the slightest amount of intelligence, you WILL feel like this movie is just an attempt to squeeze a few more pennies out of the TV series, making no efforts whatsoever to deliver quality film time to fans or first-timers.

It was kept true to the series, the characters were still the same ones we fell in love with 10 years ago and new character 'Saint Louise' played by Jennifer Hudson was also great! OK so it was more designer labels but it was a movie! It has to be big and boy was it glam! There were some stunning scenes, the clothes were all so beautiful, I loved the scene where she was trying on all the wedding dresses for the vogue shoot. I loved the series so much that all of the scenes nearly had me in tears, like the closet scene and when she gets a delivery from Viviene Westwood! Yes the plot is eventful but i think it is very fitting. I just love the writing the whole Cinderella theme running through it was so cute! But it was also sooo funny iv really never laughed AND cried so much at a film! Samanthat steals the show on the comedy front although Charlotte has her cute funny moments too. The outcomes of the film have you smiling which is what you want from a film where you want all the characters happy!

Of course I had been brainwashed into it by my wife who loves the show. Over time (on the TV series) I developed a healthy respect for the writers here as the plots and dialogue always continued to amuse and keep my attention... then came the movie. Don't get me wrong here, I understood what was trying to be achieved here, the sad part is, for 90% of it, you are with them on it. (Ok it was never going to be the TV series) but those involved are a fairly talented bunch and the acting is well within acceptable standards. (Jessica Parker after her big letdown is worth a mention here). What I can't understand then, is after the time, effort and work put in to take you on this journey.. why did the writers sell it out for a quick ending? Having been taken on highs vs lows trip and being drawn into the despair of the wedding disaster, why did you let your audience down with a ""oh it's OK really, I guess I'll just get married then"" ending. If you want to write this kind of conclusion, stick to daytime soaps. I'm wondering if perhaps the writers were under some running time pressure to end the film? Carrie throwing all of her morals to the wind and finally doing the deed just seems implausible and worse.. disappointing. Needless to say, I didn't watch to the end, I felt rather betrayed at the emotional investment I had given, only to have it devalued by the shocking ending.

Yes... You heard me, the only acting performed in this movie that is even remotely worth mentioning is from the mole. I can't stress enough how offensive this movie is, and just how unrealistic it is. This is especially towards the male viewers out there who can see just how sexist this movie really is. There is no reason for what happened to the men in this movie to have ever been treated as repulsively as they were.

There was noting of such kind in Sarah's acting...you could feel her pain, and really get into movie. The rest of the crew was good and stood in their characters all the time. I actually cried in the end when they still got married. Also another very effective motive is friendship.

I'll admit it, while I watched the series, I could never identify with any of the women in it. All I ever saw were 4 stereotypical mannequins, dressed in designer clothes, bitching about man problems that didn't seem like such a big deal in real life. I had no sympathy for any of the characters in the series. But the movie, oh the movie. I was in tears for so much of it. Finally, the characters were real! Carrie actually had emotion towards Big, Miranda and Steve have real problems. Samantha wasn't happily ever after as the series lead us to believe. Even Charlotte wasn't perfect (and seriously, that was the only part of the movie I didn't like, you all know what I'm talking about if you've seen it).

I bought tickets on Tuesday and I'll have you know - they were already sold out for Friday's show-times at a lot of places! Got our tickets and went there with some coworkers after work. There was a line, as expected. The show was completely sold out.The movie was wonderful. It was two and a half hours long and totally didn't feel like it. You never got bored, tired or uninterested. It was just like watching an extended episode of the show. It stayed true to it's roots. All characters stayed true to their roots. Yet, it still added the moments and shocks. Maybe you're thinking, ""how can you be shocked if everything and everyone stayed true to their roots?"" Well, we are all human. And it is normal to make mistakes. It is normal to do things we did not want to do, or we did not plan to do. We cheat, we lie, we misconceive. Even the people you'd never expect it from. It's a part of life, and it DOES happen. So I personally resent the reviews and comments from fans such as ""that was totally out-of-character, _____ would NEVER do that."" The fact of the matter is, sometimes we all step out-of-character. I like that the movie made everyone HUMAN. The show has always been very realistic. Many have argued over the years that the women on the show are sluts. Why? Because they are adults that have healthy and natural sexual urges? Or because women are not expected to actually act on those urges, and be aggressive and get what THEY want. And people also argue that women are not aggressive by nature, so the show is false. Well, most of these people commenting are not from New York, and don't know New York women. No, I have not led my life like any of these women. However, I have pursued MANY men. I have no problem letting someone know I have a thing for them. And it is expected of women to sit back and wait for the man to come to you. Well, it's not like that anymore. And if women want to do that, that is fine, but it should not be expected. It's great to be a strong, intelligent and aggressive woman. And men should not be intimidated by that, they should embrace it! Back to the movie, sorry. Throughout the series, I have loved all of the 4 main girls. But Charlotte (Kristin Davis ""the brunette"") has always been my least favorite. She was always annoying with the goody-two-shoes attitude. I just never cared for her. Well, I appreciate her a lot more after this movie, and she definitely played a huge role in it. She was way more likable. Still herself, still forever optimistic and cheerful. Yet she seemed more mature. She was funnier, and less dopey. I have watched that show from the first episode, to the last. And I still watch the reruns practically every night. I honestly have changed all of my feelings on Charlotte, just from this movie.It definitely tugs at your heart. Whether personally or not. We are all humans and we all have emotions. The movie deals with several different emotional struggles. It was heart-warming, it was painful, it was exciting, it was scary. I honestly don't think it is just for women. I don't think it is just for fans of the show. I went with someone whom has never even watched one episode, and she loved the movie and wants to see it again. I think it's for anyone that has ever lived through love. That has ever been heartbroken, or happy. Married or divorced. Counseled or in turmoil. It is just for any REAL adult person that lives. And through all of the reality of the movie, it still managed to keep it's infamous dirty puns. The double entendres. The witty quips.It was long-awaited, and well worth it.

303,ithinkimdeck,Sex and the City film adaptation insults HBO series of same name,4,19 December 2013,"'Sex and the City,' based on the hilarious, poignant HBO comedy series of the same name, is grossly insulting. In a strong divorce from the series, the movie picks up five years after the series finale - where we find out that each one of the characters have become vapid, soulless versions of their former selves. Now, writer Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), and her friends Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), and Charlotte Goldenblatt (Kristen Davis) walk around New York obsessing over shoes, handbags, and love. Carrie Bradshaw was, at the end of the show, an independent woman - not the needy girl she started out as. The movie turns it's back on Carrie's development as a character, shaping her into the stock romcom lead. Think Katherine Heigl with no charm. She is now painfully unfunny, shallow, and quite possibly retarded. She spends the first half the film setting herself up to have the man whom supposedly loves her jilt her - which he does. The second half of the film, Carrie spends complaining about literally everything, dying her hair brown, and discussing bags and love with a painfully useless, annoying Jennifer Hudson, as Carrie's new assistant Louise from Saint Louis.CARRIE: ""Louise from Saint Louis. Oh you brought me back to life."" LOUISE: ""And you gave me, Louise Vuitton."" Yes the writer of ""The Real Me"" and ""A Woman's Right To Shoes"" actually wrote this garbage.Lawyer Miranda is now a frigid shrew who swats her deadbeat husband away like a fly every time he tries to get near her - and spends the entire 2.5 hours complaining about how marriage changed her, it made her move to Brooklyn. She is no longer likable, funny, or smart.Meanwhile, housewife Charlotte spends the 2.5 hours prancing around like a little girl, screaming at the top of her lungs, and carrying her confused, Asian daughter around like a dog in a handbag. The problem with continuing Charlotte's storyline on the show is her storyline came to the only logical conclusion it could have had at the end of the show. Now, it' just a retread through old territory. Davis is ultimately given a thankless role in this film. However, it is Samantha who is given the most honest adaptation. While certainly a cartoon version of her former self, Samantha's story revolves around her inability to maintain a monogamous relationship - despite being very much in love. However the payoff is ultimately ruined as Samantha is no longer human. This incarnation of 'Sex' is so incredibly shallow - it basically acts a prop to advertise luxury goods. The most obvious scenes to illustrate this are when Carrie tries on designer wedding dresses for a Vogue shoot, which goes on for an excruciating 10 minutes, followed closely by Carrie and co. going through her closet trying to decide what to take to her new apartment with husband-to-be Big (Chris Noth). The scene is ultimately pointless as she is moving to a closet that is 10 times to the size - which, if you can imagine it - is actually a plot point in a film that will make you feel compelled to throw out every designer label you own. The show was about the importance of following your own trajectory, and self actualization. The film abandons this concept.",Sex and the City

Don't be scared by the 3.8 user rating. Look closely and you'll see that almost 3 men have rated it for every one woman, and that men are rating it super low while women are rating it high. Apparently men aggressively hate any movie directed at women and have to try to bring it low, even though we women endure the reality that almost every movie in the world is directed at 14 year old boys and we don't get all hysterical like these male critics are doing. I am a woman over 30 who loves all the Apatow movies like Knocked Up, etc, even though I am not supposed to be their primary audience. I think it's sad that men seem to be so threatened by the existence of one movie that does not show women over 30 as mothers dying of cancer or crazed career women!

I was surprised with just how... normal it is. If you're a watcher of romcom movies, this is actually quite the same ol same ol. Nothing special. If anything's different, it's that all the characters are much above average in wealth, that's all. But then again, the age of the people are above average. You don't see too many films of women almost 40 looking for love. I'm just a bit put off by the other reviews. You don't see women going to sexist films (a.k.a. 90% of all movies) ranting how underdeveloped the female character is and blahblahblah. If it's not your cup of tea, don't watch it. I'm pretty sure you KNEW it's not your cup of tea before watching it. That's why your girlfriends had to force you to watch it. Anyway, something light and nice to watch on a night in, cozy in your bed. However, nothing seems to justify the hype.

307,jonny-thompson11,A nostalgic film for the fans,10,22 September 2013,"If you loved the TV series, you will adore this film. Where others believe this film does not do the show justice, i fully disagree. Any loose ends which were left at the end of Season 6 are tied up over the course of the movie such as Harry & Charlotte's adopted baby, Where Mr Big and Carrie's relationship will lead, What happened to Samantha after cancer and How does Miranda cope with raising a child, and keeping her marriage on track. The brand new story lines that follow in this film are outstanding. The film takes us back to the days where the four girls were single, and walking around town in their line of four , which brings the film such a nostalgic feel. A cameo from the original dress which appeared in the opening titles of the series reinstates just how much this film is for the fans. The opening sequence begins with a short snippet of the original theme, before blasting us off into a brand new version with lyrics by Fergie (Of Black Eyed Peas origin) which drags this film right up to date. The only let down however is the introduction of Jennifer Hudson's character in the film, however this is totally overshadowed by brilliant acting from the ladies, the men and a wonderful script. With a wonderful soundtrack to accompany it, this film certainly takes you right back to the series, and gives you many unexpected surprises, ones which you never thought would happen to the main characters. The film follows an entire year of the women and their lives in New York City (and Los Angeles for Samantha), and just proves throughout that friendship is the one label that never goes out of style.",Sex and the City

Even so, I still watch the reruns, and I was really looking forward to the movie.So, it is really upsetting that I have to give it such a bad review. I went to see it with the best of intentions. I really wanted to love it. Unfortunately the movie has nothing to do with the wittiness and character of the series. Even putting aside the wooden and/or exaggerated acting, you fail to recognize the characters who where transformed into caricatures, pathetic versions of themselves.There were very very few lines that gave a glimpse of the old clever dialog, and they all got lost in a mass of cheesy lines about love and friendship that you even rarely anymore encounter in the corniest of Hollywood's chick flicks, and toiler humor that you only expect from movies like Harold and Kumar. OK, maybe the comparison to Harold and Kumar is a little unfair, but really I had never expected Sex and the City to rely on fart jokes for comic relief.People comment that those who rate this movie badly are either men, or just not fans of the show. From my perspective the fans of the show should be the ones most disappointed by the travesty that was this film.We grew to love the show because of its honesty towards sexual issues, its shocking but clever dialog, and its characters who, however unreal with their designer obsessions, uncontrollable spending and lack of real jobs, remained true to their personas regarding sex, relationships, commitment, independence.The show was about sex. The movie is about love, and treats the subject from the weakest, corniest and most disappointing standpoint.This movie is a fake Fendi.

If you have not seen the series this is a movie you can still enjoy, it has a great story, the fashion, New York and everything. If you happen to be a fan of The Devil Wears Prada this is definitely a movie that you will be able to enjoy. I enjoyed the arc that the movie went through and the fact that it went through the motions as you would in real life, it can teach the lesson that although you may have had the happy ending in the series, the aftermath of that can sometimes not be all that it is cracked up to be. This is a movie that I feel is a must see for the ladies and he fellas out there if you are confident in yourself and your sexuality. Forget all the BS about that only gay men and women will see this. In my opinion this is a movie that any adult with an open mind will be able to enjoy......Great job to Michael Patrick King for a scrip picking up with our favorite girls and yet making it able to relate to anyone that may not be familiar with the series.

310,chachination,Not at all the same as the show,2,6 July 2008,"I actually like the show itself. Enough to give it a 7 out of 10. I am not really a follower but when it's on, and I watch it, I find it pretty clever and quite witty. I give ""Sex And The City"" it's due. It deserves what it does for its subject matter, I'm just not all enthralled with the subject matter... if so, the show would get a 10 for very good writing and great character portrayal plus wonderful plots (that's the only place I find myself disinterested)... so with that I will continue with why I'm giving the movie a 2. Though lots of guys who have never watched the show or given it a chance would say that Sex & the City is cheesy girly crap or something to that effect. A smart show is a smart show and I don't feel the need to be a woman facing sex and relationship issues to relate. The movie, is not that at all. The writing is very much by the numbers, causing the characters to be caricatures of the characters they already are. I do understand that the nuances of a show that runs so many seasons is hard to squeeze into a movie. So yes, the movie had the characters written like it's the pilot episode of a show (almost always terrible), trying to point out all the things we are supposed to get about the character as this 2 dimensional being. The movie should have continued on tweaking the characters but not feel the need to outright bring them out for everything we've learned about them watching the show. Another thing is just the dialogue in the movie. The whole point of it as being about love is what a woman wants and needs... that's not what the episodes were about. They beautifully laid out all of the complexities with love and sex while this movie was more like a Hallmark card about what men think women really want. I thought the show was at least written from a better point of view than the show. The music was horribly chosen. It all seemed like cliché bells going on when women think about romance. The show never did that either. Me and my girlfriend went to the movie, she being a slightly bigger fan than I, and we found ourselves laughing at inappropriate parts... like the ""love"" bracelet being passed back to Carrie near the end by her assistant. Also the end where they wind up doing the wedding like Big would like to... how's that even fair or nice? Is the message... the point of a woman is to please her man? I just don't think that's what Sex & the City is all about. That's not even saying compromise is important or she'd never have gone back to him.",Sex and the City

312,tunafishdebate,Better than what others are giving it credit for.,8,31 May 2008,"I must say that while this movie certainly was not perfect (what movie really is?) it was enjoyable and much better than what other reviews have stated.Sex and the City lived up the story lines and characters set forth in the during the entire 6 seasons of the show. The storyline is simply asking the question: what happens once you get your ever after? The answer is simply there really isn't a set ever after for everyone and the path to ever after may have a few bumps along the way.Carrie spends the entire movie doing what she did over a span of 6 seasons...chase after Big and deal with his flighty nature. I am surprised that people are annoyed that this is the case since so many were willing to watch this before.Charlotte continues to live out the life that she dreamed of for herself. I know that some say Charlotte is missing in the film, but I found her to be ever present. Her story may not contain that much drama but her part never had that many dramatic moments in the t.v. show.Miranda deals with the fact that she made a choice to change her life for Steve and that he makes a mistake by cheating. I know some people were taken aback that she was put in a bad light for not easily forgiving him. However, I think the idea behind the plot line is that sometimes we have to take the good with the bad and realize that forgiveness doesn't come with a debt.Samantha comes to the realization that she isn't a relationship person. Samantha never was a relationship person and I think that the writers did the character justice by removing her from something that never fit right on the show.The movie could have used some much needed editing to decrease the length of the show. Also, there was too much product placement in the movie but lets be real, there had to be some because that was something that was directly tied to the show.There is a plot to the movie. The movie is simply an extenuation of the show which is Big and Carrie's love story and the bond of the four gal pals. Anyone expecting anything else must have not watched the show that carefully. This is not a movie for people who didn't watch the show but what else would you expect? If someone were to create a movie about ""Grey's Anatomy"" you wouldn't expect the movie to start from the beginning, because movies about television shows are for the fans of the show not a new audience.Overall, I liked the film and thought it was a better and more realistic end to the series than the series finale from t.v. If you are a fan then go see it, if not stay away, but do not expect the film to be anything more than it is...which is a tale about women trying to find love and themselves in New York.",Sex and the City
313,lostatredrock,Disappointing as a movie and TV Show as Movie,4,30 May 2008,"I took my girlfriend to see this movie last night at the 12:01 showing. She is a huge fan of the show, has every season on DVD, and has seen all the episodes multiple times. I have watched 30-40 episodes I would guess and I would not say that I love the show, but I do find it entertaining and never dreaded my girlfriend pulling out the DVDs to pop them in. So going into it I was there 75% for her and 25% because I genuinely thought it would be an entertaining movie even though it would never make it into my top anything.So with the set-up in place, the movie itself was very disappointing for both my-self and my girlfriend.First looking at the movie in comparison to the show itself, the movie simply felt flat by comparison. The show is full of frank and snappy discussion which manages to come across as both very real and hilarious at the same time. Really the show was built on the interactions of those four girls and those interactions simply fell flat in the movie in a way I never saw them fall flat in the show. Like I said I am only a casual fan of the show and this was apparent to me, it was even more apparent to my girlfriend who is an extreme fan of the show who also found it lacking.Second looking at the movie as a movie independent of the show, this is where the movie really fails. Rather than feeling like a movie which typically has a cohesive plot which spans the breadth of the film with smaller sub-plots which spring up along the way, the movie felt like a series of a TV show in which there is an overarching story arc, but the action is based around the individual episode plots. The latter works in a TV show because episodes by their nature are disjointed, you need to be able to make the individual episode plots stand well on their own or the show will fail. In a movie the result of the latter is very disjointed storyline and plot.Third the ""secrecy"" surrounding this movie really led to big disappointments for both of us. Given all ""secrecy"" one would have assumed that a cursory knowledge of the show and a simple watching of the trailer would not be enough to grasp the entire plot of the movie. Unfortunately such an assumption would be wrong. There were a number of plot twists which would have been great were they actually twists, sadly the producers decided that releasing ALL of them in the trailer would make for a better movie, it didn't. The only rational I can see for stupidly releasing such information while you build levels of pretend security is to drive up ticket sales with the reasonable thought: ""if this is what they are showing us in the trailer who knows what will be in the movie!"" Fourth, did the producers decide that strong powerful women would be a threat to the movie going public or something? With the possible exception of Charlotte (although she showed it at times too) these women are all strong, powerful and independent. In the movie Carrie spends the majority of her time first planning her wedding like a giddy school girl and then mopping around for the rest of the movie. Who is this woman because she is not Carrie Bradshaw. Samantha has gone from a strong sexual figure who may have finally found love to someone so whiny and needy you don't recognize her at all. Miranda remains a strong figure but rather than it being portrayed in a good way, it comes across more as her just being a bitch.Fifth some random complaints This movie felt way too much like an ad at way too many points. I know that fashion and all that is supposed to be a part of the story of these women, but was there any need of a 5 minute Mercedes-Bens ad aka ""Fashion Week"" right smack in the middle of the movie? What the hell happened to Stamford? The banter between he and Carrie is one of my favorite parts of the show I don't know that he said more than two words to her the entire movie.Why was Charlotte even in the movie? It felt like they made it most of the way through filming and then realized they had forgotten all about her so they threw her in got her pregnant and hoped no one would notice she really didn't have much of a part since a pregnancy is so big for her. It might have worked to only as I said above as something that might have constituted a surprise to the movie going public is had to be disclosed in the trailer.On the subject of characters who really served no purpose why was Jennifer Hudson in this movie? She was amazing in Dreamgirls so I don't blame her for the one dimensional token character, but somebody deserves some blame. I can only guess that she was there in response to criticism of the series as being too white, but is the best response to such criticism really inserting a character who is so obviously a token it's painful? Again on the subject of pointless and forgettable characters, I know this movie should be primarily about the female leads, but that does not mean that all the male characters should be so flat that cardboard cutouts would perform just as well in their place.",Sex and the City

(7.5 would probably be more accurate). I understand that this movie might not be very appealing for non Sex and the City fans, but that's not the movie's target audience. It is a movie made for the fans of this iconic series. For the most part, it captures the spirit of the show very well.",Sex and the City
315,bsnmsn,"Too Much Content, Not Enough Time",6,15 June 2008,"Just saw SATC : The Movie. I thought it was too plot heavy without enough character and the characters we learned to love were given very little screen / dialogue time, such as Anthony, Stanford, Steve, Harry and even Big. The whole thing seemed rushed. The naked male neighbor seemed more of an obligatory and unnecessary mini-plot. The best part was the end scene, where it all seemed very real and more down to earth, as well joyful. It didn't come off as seamless or that there was a flow to the storyline. I hope the next time out, if there is another, they decide to do it as a six episode series and keep it more true to the characters and situations.",Sex and the City
316,marlee-6,"fun, the more women the merrier!",8,18 June 2008,"I did not want to see the movie at first, not being an avid follower of the series, but two of my girlfriends convinced me to go see it. I did not regret it. We went to see it with about 150 other women on a weeknight at the local theater- only about 10 men had dared to intrude - and the atmosphere was a bit like a women's beer hall meeting, everyone had lots of fun and there was loud laughter, especially about the sex references and then applause in the end, most of the audience shed a tear in between. All in all, much more fun than I had expected with my low expectations because of the so and so reviews I had read. At times it drags a bit but never really starts to annoy, my friends even commented in the end that it was way too short!!! All in all a great example of how much it counts in what surroundings one watches a movie - if I had seen it alone at home I don't know if I would have laughed that much. The more women to watch this with, the merrier! :-)",Sex and the City

I'm not a woman, but I would understand any lady getting out of the cinema saying: ""I wanna be Carrie Bradshaw""! All in all the movie disappointed me. I did not expect something better than the series, cause it has nothing to do with it. It's a completely different style of play and the only connection between the 1998 series and this, is the fact that it's a sequel. Kim Katrall still manages to look sensational. The movie lasted 2,5 hours which practically kills you if there is no break but you can handle it if you have enough muffins and no water (too much bathroom, you lose the movie). It's worth the money, just for the plot thing.",Sex and the City

For starters, no plot, bad dialogue, everyone looking a little ""tired."" There was no recognition of the characters that we thought we knew. Where were the minor characters? There, but invisible. I should have waited for video, then I could have fast forwarded thru some of the poorly done sex scenes or the dragged out filler scenes. Some of the dialogue was ""plagiared"" directly from prior seasons. Some of it was downright dumb, and the rest was pretty disappointing. As a die-hard fan, I am sorry the writing was not better.",Sex and the City
319,cameroncrazy_2000,I adored this movie,7,7 June 2008,"I thought this movie was, in a word, fantastic. I was initially concerned about the run time of more than 2 hours, but I didn't even feel the time go by. My only real issues with the film were the underuse or misuse (take your pick) of Jennifer Hudson. I think we could have ultimately done without her (thank goodness she didn't sing). I was also hoping that Miranda would have grown out of whining about everything in her life. Alas, I was disappointed. Other than that, I found the film to be wonderful. I especially loved the opening sequence of flashbacks that brought us right up to what we would be seeing in the movie. I laughed. I cried. I wanted it to go on and on.",Sex and the City

321,sislauchris,"Bad, But Not that much!",7,18 June 2009,"I think this is not such a bad film as many people say, OK let's be honest, a movie made out of a TV show, will never be as good as the show, cause they were meant to be on the small screen, but producers can do their best to make a good film. In SACT the movie, producers, writers and directors did not, they really could have done better, The movie feels so long!!!! For real i felt i was watching a 3 hour movie. Carrie's depression is very exhausting 4 the viewers, the performances were not the best, but we gotta understand that 5 years went by since the show was over, characters are not supposed to be the same. Charlotte is more annoying in the movie than in the show, and Miranda....she is just weird on the movie. I did not feel her. There were great things, Like Clothes! Patricia field made so much better than Devil wears Prada, The clothes are exquisite, there are some jokes that are good, Samantha is the queen of the movie, she is just excellent! I was disappointed, but i'm still in love with Sex and the City, they did not do their best, but they did not do their worst either! BTW, Jennifer Hudson....Keep singing!",Sex and the City
322,Cch11,Overall it was great!,8,2 June 2008,"I loved the show and the movie and it did not disappoint me. It's not for guys (unless they love the show) - I think there were 3 men in the theater. True fans of the show will catch the little sayings and whatnot that were in the 30 minute show. Yes, the movie was long, but I really didn't notice. Charlotte and Samantha (of course) were the comedic relief. I loved how they combined some very sad/sentimental moments with a touch of humor so that while I was on the verge of tears, I started laughing. Jennifer Hudsons part was a tad pointless but she did good none-the-less. I think people need to get over their hate of the show/movie and respect it for what it is - a great girls night out flick.",Sex and the City
323,hanpor,underrated movie,8,25 June 2008,"This movie is underrated, you shouldn't rate a movie based on what You Expect to see. If the cast was left on a place in the end of the series that they are all settled down, you can't expect that they live the same kind of life of singles in the future. I think the movie was even more realistic than the series. Who doesn't look for love and happiness with a life-partner, and who isn't hurt by heart-aches. And with those who doesn't look for it it is more unlike to happen.And I think the movie was actually quite funny all the way. And it was beautiful and still realistic how it all ended up. And those feelings they went through were realistic. I don't think that this movie shouldn't even been so unpredictable, because it wouldn't been so realistic then. And there were beautiful clothes and the strong friendship relationship between the women still. I think it contained very important topics and very close to many people lives.It was funny, beautiful, realistic and dealt with important issues.",Sex and the City

It was a fabulous cherry to one of my favorite show-sundaes!If you like the show, go see the movie. If you've never seen the show, go see the movie. It stands very strong on its own and I think that fans both new and old alike will enjoy it. They did a good job of re-introducing the characters without boring all of us die-hard fans. And the kids all grown up? How cute were they!? Bottom line, go see it.",Sex and the City
325,gserrado,Great Movie!,8,30 May 2008,"I don't understand why people have given SATC poor reviews. I have been a fan of the TV show since it started and I thought the movie ended the show the way fans wanted it to end.The movie doesn't have a movie feel... it is an expansion of the TV show, just like most TV-to-big screen movies are. It is not suppose to feel like a movie... its suppose to feel like the TV show. SJP narrates the whole movie, just like the show. The difference is that we get to see in one shoot what happen to the girls after they got their 'happy endings'.I was expecting exactly that. I don't get why people were expecting something else? The movie was surrounded by designer names, clothes, places, etc because that's what the TV show was about! I liked the script. Most of the girls got a nice ending, except Samantha. I think her personality could have brought out a lot more (the sexiness, her clothes, her attitude, and her sexual being). I related to all the characters (specially Charlotte) and I did feel Carrie's pain.The one thing I did not liked was how the plugged in other brands (Sprint, Mercedes, that water bottle, etc). I am used to SATC plugging designer names but not cellphone carriers.Overall the whole movie was done well and I would go see it again.",Sex and the City

My sister actually cried when Big almost left her at at the alter, and we laughed like crazy when Charlotte hit him with her bag and then went into labor!! I couldn't BELIEVE what Samantha did leaving Smith, but then that's EXACTLY who she is, and I was but wasn't surprised at Miranda...it was a little hairy there at the end, (no pun intended) but it ended just as it should have, just like the movie.I really don't know what you uber fans were waiting for, or hoping for, but I enjoyed it a great deal.",Sex and the City

If you're the occasional watcher, make sure you watch (or re-watch) the last two episodes of the TV show before you go. This movie was everything I wanted out of the film. Insight, heartbreaking moments that make you call your friend after the movie and tell them how much you love them, moments that rekindle lost hope for the hopeless romantic. There was a lot of brand pimping and had I not read about it in the reviews here I would have never even noticed it. Ignore the bad reviews. If you love the girls from SATC, you will love the girls in the movie. Obviously, most of us know what happens. We've seen it in the previous that we've obsessively looked up on the internet. But they're so well executed, you relate so well to the characters, that it still hits you just as hard.

This movie was fun, it was light and most importantly it was fabulous. Women will love it, men will laugh with embarrassment and secretly enjoy it. The fashion is amazing, and the biggest question of all (will Carrie marry Big!?) is answered. The theme of this movie, forgiveness, is one that wasn't touched on enough in the show, and the movie did a good job of still keeping Carrie and the girls fabulous with this new topic.With the same writers and cast members (and same costume person who dressed the girls in the show) the movie is true to the show; it is smart and witty, sexy and bold, and overall just fabulous.",Sex and the City

The other reviewer complained that if you hadn't watched the show, you wouldn't know what was going on.Well ... it's a movie, that is a continuation of a TV show. I don't think there are many people who expect to have 6 years worth of background forced down our throats for the few people going to the movie who didn't watch the show. You don't need to know that much about the characters, just the basics (ie, Carrie and Big have been dating for years and years, Charlotte is big on family, Samantha likes sex, etc).I thought the movie was excellent. The characters were honest, and very real. It's exactly what I expected from a SATC movie - fun, sexy, real, with lots of fabulous clothing. It was a great time to revisit these characters.

330,nouveauzenboho,Sex and the City: The Movie: The Review,10,7 June 2008,"I would be lying if I said I wasn't looking forward to this film for four years. I would also be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed--Just a little. The movie itself was good. Nothing extraordinary, but enough to garner a B, B+ rating. The high points were the costume design, production design, and acting (for the most part). The low points were the writing and directing (unfortunately), although considering it was Michael Patrick King's first movie, we should cut him some slack.Even though it was a slight step above your standard cookie-cutter Romantic Comedy, the plot was extremely weak at some points. It's obvious that you can't have a ""funky spunk"" kind of story line in a movie, because it would simply get drowned out, so Michael Patrick King went for the biggies: Pregnancy, Infidelity, and Self-Discovery. I of course leave out the main plot, Carrie, simply because you can't put a label on that. The girls' story lines were general to the point of bland. Aside from Samantha, they ended up more or less in the same place that they started. Charlotte's a mother, Miranda's with Steve, despite his flaws. At least Samantha realized she could not be in a relationship and, true to character, became a single woman again. For what it's worth, the acting was believable, but that's t be expected when you have been with these characters for ten years. It's really just the writing that gave them nothing to do. The only interesting part of Charlotte's story line was the ""I'm so happy I'm scared"", but that was glazed over in one scene. It's disappointing. He should have done something more challenging and more creative, and, most of all, more unique. It's no surprise most of his effort was put into Carrie, which is to be expected, but the three second bananas were shuffled so far off to the side wit was almost embarrassing. The main plot, riddled with comedy, drama and romance, was the only thing that saved this movie. Carrie had a clear arc, her experiences (and Big's) stayed so true to character, and even though I wasn't fond of the ending, it did have that ""love is not rational"" thing that saved it. And even though the Cinderella motif wasn't that original, and did get tiring at some points (like when Carrie is coloring with Lily and uses the blue crayon on Cinderella's slipper, foreshadowing the shoe Big proposes to her with) it was cute...enough. I mean it wasn't something standard, it was driven by the characters, and they came out as different people in the end, and for that, it was a decent plot.The character of Louise was a dismal addition. I love my J Hud, but she just couldn't carry the role very well, and Michael's addition of a ""youth perspective"" was severely wasted. When she rekindled with her boyfriend and got married at the end, it was obvious that MPK just has a lot of troubling juggling so many characters. It's just disappointing that, in a show where the single person was celebrated and the bounds of society were broken on a regular basis, three out of the four ladies get married. But, what irked me most of all, was that Carrie and Big discussed how they were perfectly happy before they decided to get married, and yet they went ahead and did it anyway. The movie could have been saved if they just led an unconventional relationship like they did before. Of particular mention are the wedding scenes, most of the scenes in Mexico, and the New Year's Eve scenes. These showed the depth, beauty and bittersweet touches the movie has, all the while developing the characters and showcasing them. Of dishonorable mention are Samantha's raunchy dog, Charlotte's illness, and the clothing montage as Carrie cleaned out her closet: they were overused, not funny, and slowed the pace of the film, respectively. These were the main scenes that showed how immature and downright lousy the movie could be in some places. What was also disconcerting were the numerous jokes seemingly ""borrowed"" from the series: Carrie remarks how she ""Keeps Sweaters in the stove"", similar to how she said she uses her oven for storage in ""Attack of the Five Foot Ten Woman""; Candace Bergen tells her to ""Just Say Yes"" like in....""Just Say Yes""; the ""Coloring"" scene mirrors the ""Sushi"" scene in ""Anchors Away""; Samantha remarks to Smith ""I love you, but I love me more"" like she did to Richard in ""Luck Be an Old Lady""; they were all just too unoriginal to be considered homages.In the end, while it was nice to see the four girls together again, with all the high points and lows, I have to ask: was it such a good idea to make this movie in the first place? And, what more, would it be a good idea to make a sequel? That we'll just have to wait and see.",Sex and the City

I don't think I could pick a serious fault with this film... The cast are on top form and Sarah Jessica Parker really does steal the show, much to my dismay. Cynthia Nixon (Miranda) has a fair amount of story lines and plays a huge role in this film, enducing laughter and tears (literally) It's nice to see some of the supporting characters from the TV show return, also.(Stanford, Smith, Anthony and Magda to name some!) Although the first 10 minutes of the film fills in the blanks of the last four years, it did seem to go a bit too slowly but it certainly draws you in.

334,neutrinox-1,an awesome movie!,8,7 June 2008,"OK, well, the visitors of IMDb.com only gave SATC 4.3 stars out of 10. Usually their rating is a good indicator of whether I will like a movie, because it is not rated by pro reviewers, but by normal people visiting the site and clicking on a movie rating. This time, though, it was totally wrong! I would give this movie more like 8.5 out of 10.I think the people who gave it a low rating were not paying attention enough to actual plot and events of the movie, and instead were just concentrating on the fashion or whatever. I don't know Gucci from Loui Vatton, though, so the fashion aspects didn't mean anything to me.Basically the movie is about major relationship issues faced by 3 of the main characters, especially Sarah Jessica Parker's character. They all have things they learn about life from these experiences. The real message of the movie is that the girls remain friends through all these problems, so it is really about the value of friendship.There are several EXTREMELY funny scenes in this movie! I don't really want to give them away but they are hilarious...for example there is the one seen in the trailer where they are using coloring with crayons as a metaphor to discuss sex in front of a toddler! lol.Plus, you see about 90% of Kim Catrall's body, and she is 50 years old, but looks maybe 33. There is also a threesome with two hot chicks. And lots of good glimpses of women's feet.So there are lots of good reasons to watch it, and I recommend it!

I'm a huge fan of the show (which some might find useful for the movie, but it's not necessary to have seen the show before), and I really, really liked it. Maybe it's just because I went in with low expectations - a lot of people I spoke to had seen it and not loved it, but I would go see it again.The thing to remember, is that it is what it is. Clearly this is not a psychological thriller (except for those of us who have been in torturous in love/out of love relationships...I guess for us it's a little thrilling), it is not asking you to dig deep into your mind for meaning. If you like fashion, and chick flicks, and the girls from Sex and the City, duh, you'll like the movie.The acting was not extraordinary save a few key scenes, but it's good. Nixon is always a good actor, Noth too. SJP, her wonderful self, very Carrie; Kristin Davis is charming, and, although I had the urge to shout at the screen when Kim Catrall was on screen (since there was so much controversy surrounding her and her willingness to do the movie), she did a great job. All the men, gay and straight, were fabulous. Clearly there's no Oscar here (except costumes maybe?) but there's mtv/people's choice potential. And the kids? Adorable.It's pretty moving, and provides closure without making it feel like the ends were tied too conveniently together. A lot of people have said it's too long (like 2.5 hrs?) but it felt right to me. In my opinion it's exactly as the movie should be, a good mix of sex, fashion, and love; as the show was. Plus, I thought there were some pretty hilarious moments, unexpected since the previews were kind of evasive.People will probably say this review was shoddy and too long also, but... what can you do, a critic is a critic.I couldn't help but wonder, isn't this what we wanted?",Sex and the City

So many people are disappointed both because the characters aren't the way they used to be and also because they haven't evolved enough...that's a bit contradictory to be a valid criticism. The movie captures the wonderful, charming essence of what sex and the city is: four best friends growing up. The characters are still as charming as they ever were, yet they find their lives in a difference place. This is what I loved about the movie: the same women, the same men, but they are in different situations and naturally going through the different stages in their lives.The writing is witty, the women are lovely, and the movie was wonderful!!

338,delilah293014,Well done and just like the show!,10,30 May 2008,"I just saw the premiere of this movie in my city and I absolutely loved it. I honestly don't know how people are giving it such low ratings. To me it felt just like the series except a longer episode. And I think they did a really good job of keeping the same feeling of the TV series. The only thing that was annoying was the scene where Carrie and Big are having a serious conversation and the bloody set microphones were showing. I don't know how they missed that in the editing room and it was super distracting. I don't even really know what Big and Carrie were talking about in the scene because the microphones were so distracting and everyone in the theater was laughing at the major goof.But storyline wise, the characters, and the actors, the film was great. I mean what are people expecting? A life altering experience? It's a film for god's sake and in my opinion they did a great job.",Sex and the City
339,tatenym,Absolutely Fabulous,10,31 May 2008,"The movie remained true to the TV show, picking up reasonably after where the show left off. Yet, if one has never watched the show, there is plenty of back-story dropped in to give the full picture. The movie flowed just like the show, and did not feel like it was 2.5 hours long. Plenty of humor, witty one-liners, and naturally, lots of sex. It was fantastic to see all of the original cast and their respective partners/families and how their lives have progressed -- and the additions (Jennifer Hudson) fit in perfectly with the established crew. I spent much of the movie on the edge of my seat with my heart in my throat, but as always, left extremely satisfied.",Sex and the City

I guess those people have never watched 5 episodes of the show in a row. I won't reveal any details but the movie has everything we love the show for. The theater was raving, because the film lived up to all expectations, and more than that. Even straight men, who said they were forced to see the movie, enjoyed it. So, if you're a SatC-devotee, you will more than love these 140 minutes of pleasure. And you might consider going there again, just because you got carried away...",Sex and the City
341,boque-sy,Absolutely breath-taking and a true sequel to the series!!,10,7 June 2008,"I've seen that many people have been extremely disappointed with the movie, but I have to disagree. From the minute it began, I felt the thrill that I felt when watching the series. From the theme song, to the glamorous clothing and shoes - to Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha. The movie took you through the gap between the series and the present and it made me, a true Sex & the City fan, very proud.Carrie's emotional roller coaster with Big still had not ended, Charlotte receives the pregnancy she always wished for, Miranda tests the boundaries of her relationship, and Samantha identifies with her old self.I loved every minute of it - from the heart-wrenching moments. I cried at least ten times throughout the whole film. From watching the series, I felt what the girls felt and know their characters inside out, so it was almost like being reintroduced to them. When Carrie revealed how she looked after her huge humiliation with Big, you saw that the film had no boundaries. It truly showed how emotionally crippled all women are after such ordeals.It was a true homage to the series and I'm sure I'll be watching the film over and over again!",Sex and the City
342,pingpong4523,Television is completely different than Cinema,1,12 October 2008,"Besides the fact that the name Carrie Bradshaw is completely unoriginal, Sex and the City: The Movie brings absolutely nothing new to the series and lack understanding on how a movie should be developed. The movie is completely predictable and, even though you never hear his name in the television series, decided to mention Mr. Bigs real name on numerous occasions. Periodically you see a different storyline show up with one of the girls, then another scene about that storyline wont pop up for another 30 minutes or so. The middle of the movie completely lacked any direction and lost focus of whatever they were trying to do. The girls have numerous scenes where they just do the same garbage chick flick scenes like the television series, only they're more terrible since they've put it on the big screen and left it the same. Don't see this movie. It's pathetic and a complete waste of Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis' hotness.",Sex and the City
343,dech3740,Great Sex and the City,10,30 October 2008,"After having been addicted to the show for years now and still watching it everyday (reruns), I was so excited when they finally decided to make the movie! Although I couldn't see it in the theater, my husband and son each bought me a copy of the DVD the day it came out! So for my review : it's everything I wanted in a movie, love, lust, sex, crying, drama, etc. It begins the way it should have, 3 years or 5 years later where the woman are in their lives now. It's great to see Carry and Big together again, but in a much more comfortable and cozy place in their lives. All the other couples are where they should be as well, you know, working, raising their child, still going out, or whatever they are supposed to be doing. The amount of fashion that fills the screen in unbelievable! It's a wow, oh my god I want those shoes, that bag, just drooling all over myself. Just what I wanted in a movie, not too this and not too that. Entertaining, without having to use my brain (like the one I just watched - There will be blood, which I also loved). I know all these couples, they are my friends, one of them had breast cancer (like Samantha) and loves and talks about sex all the time, I have a Miranda friend (Helene), who is in law as well and has the same character as Miranda, and I have a Charlotte friend as well! Everything that happened in the movie has happened to me or my friends, and we are all over 40 now. So for the first user comments, I don't know what you were expecting, but for me, this movie is real, as real as me and my friends lives. I love this movie, have one copy at home and have watched it over 10-15 times and one at the cottage which i've watched many times as well. Hope this helps!",Sex and the City

I was pleasantly surprised. It had some very funny, sad, and touching moments. The movie was a little long, but I liked the way it was done and how things wrapped up in the end.I did feel it lacked a little of the ""magic"" the series always had. However, I really did enjoy it. It was great to see the girls again and I thought that Sarah Jessica Parker did an outstanding job. There were times I was crying and then laughing. Overall, the cast was great and I even enjoyed Jennifer Hudson's role. It was a fun, entertaining movie and I am glad I didn't let the bad reviews keep me from seeing it!",Sex and the City

Watching T.V. was never the same since SATC dared to say what no one had ever said before. I curled up by the tube religiously on Friday nights with friends and giggled and cried. It was only this evening when I went the feature, did I realize just how much I missed these wonderful characters. In fact these characters felt like my friends too. I had so much fun seeing how their lives had changed in the last 4 years. Great catching up on their news! I will see it again. I missed those girls and only wish that the show would never end.

346,simonayonkov,contrary to the anticipated disappointment it brought pleasure,10,17 June 2008,"I went to see it with my daughter, aware that this was an important sacrifice to make for her sake. My low expectations proved wrong. I was engaged and entertained. The characters were vulnerable and humane despite the expensive wrapping they were delivered in. Quite earthy, quite moving. I remember watching Bridget Jones Diary and feeling that this was not quite what I imagined while reading Helen Fielding's book, and the whole Reneé-gaining pounds and faking English accent was disheartening. It is a difficult task to translate a successful and fan-beloved piece into a different media. However, the authors of the Sex and The city movie did it. And did it well. Fair play!",Sex and the City
347,zafulotus,please tell me it was a bad dream,1,1 June 2008,"It was so awful it defies description. If you are really a ""true fan""... you will leave quite bitter and feeling used. The movie literally contains plot lines that revolve around poop and fat jokes. Literally. Poop jokes and fat jokes. Oh, and a petulant 40 year old who responds to being disappointed by/in her partner by cutting him out of her life for a year and looking to her friends to be her mommies. Mature.SATC was on my last year in high school through my college years and into my mid-20s. Needless to say, the show meant a lot to me in those formative years. I've since grown up to be a feminist and professional and look back fondly on the revolutionary nature of the series. Even in its moments of fluff and vanity, there were redeeming aspects to the self-reflection and (sometimes reluctant) self-reliance of these women. No, it's not perfect... but it was challenging and eye-opening in its milieu. To then go see this movie is an insult. Much like as I did in my late teens and early-to-mid 20's, I expected a mature movie that examined the lives of these 40-somethings in a way that would offer some insight (and wit) into what I might come to expect in the years to come as I get older, live with my partner, maybe get married, maybe have babies, maybe adopt, maybe leave a partner, maybe face infidelity, etc... something that honored the promise that it was a smart movie that gave these mature women something to sink their acting chops into...Instead I got a wedding farce; a humping dog; stock black, Jewish and gay characters that literally made me feel ill; 4 women who don't know themselves any better than they did 4 years ago, 10 years ago; and, oh yeah, POOP JOKES AND FAT JOKES.SATC the TV series WAS a cultural icon, a touchstone, a movement.SATC the movie promotes itself as a vehicle for creating another socio-cultural rupture. Instead its witless.",Sex and the City

It's a fun movie that is in keeping with the TV show with a little more ""over the top"" for decoration, which is exactly what I expected. I went to be entertained, and I was. That's more than enough to make me happy. Witty dialog, great locations, and a minimal nod to life in the ""real world"". I'll see it again when it comes out on DVD. Can't wait to dish with my sisters and fashionista mom after they've seen it. The ending, although I wouldn't in a million years call it the ""surprise ending"" that's been touted in the promo, was perfectly okay. I'm sure pulling together the entire original cast was no picnic.

As someone who identifies with Carrie more than the rest of the gals, you can't blame me for loving the fact that she gets her happy ending (whatever that may be)! I'm really surprised at all the bad reviews of this movie that are on here. It's as if none of you really ever wanted the characters to live their lives, but to go on having more and more trouble as single women in New York. I, for one, was floored by the movie and will be the first in line to buy it when it comes out on DVD! It was funny, heartbreaking, and beautiful. Sex and the City wins as a movie and as a series.

To me it seemed that Carrie wasn't Carrie, and since we're on the topic, Miranda's character wasn't as I remembered it. Maybe it was the years and they went through some changes but I missed Miranda's snappy retorts and Carrie's word-plays. Samantha's story-line was the best - as far as character portrayal and evolution of a character goes, but all in all the stories were believable (well, maybe not the ending - come on, a year of heartbreak and then a gaze in the eyes fixes everything?). I won't comment on the fashion - it's not my place, and I've chosen to believe that the girls really can afford all these ridiculously expensive get-ups and accessories. Although I don't like them stuffing Miranda in the fancy outfits and stilettos (the huge hoop earrings I can live with) - the part where she storms out on Steve is fit for a giggle, since she looks so unnatural stomping out of the kitchen in high heels. The movie does actually provide a lot of laughs - especially Samantha. Jennifer Hudson's role was unnecessary (her acting wasn't all that great either) and maybe at the expense of her screen time the could have cut some minutes of the movie (it's loooong).The side of me that is obsessed with knowing what every single characters life would be like after a series wraps was delighted with this movie and wants some more. The side of me that applies some critical view was not so delighted and would like Miranda and Carrie's quirkiness back in case of a sequel. Still, the first side of me prevails and I will definitely get a DVD and pop it in every once in a while, for nostalgic reasons, or just to see Carrie's renovated apartment one more time.",Sex and the City

Although I could have do with out some of the nudity, for anyone that has seen the show it did not come as a surprise.Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, and Cynthia Nixon do a phenomenal job reprising their roles as Carrie Bradshaw, Samantha Jone, Charlotte York and Miranda Hobbes. It seems as if no time has past sense the series ended in 2004.Also reprising their roles as the women's love interests are Chris Noth (Mr. Big),Jason Lewis (Jerry 'Smith' Jerrod), David Eigenberg (Steve Brady),and Evan Handler (Harry Goldenblatt).This story takes you though life's of the characters and is filled with enough surprises, love, sadness, and laughter to make you wish the story would never end",Sex and the City

Nope. There I was, on my 31st minute, realizing that this movie is going to be one unbelievable waste of time. Did they all need to milk the Sex and the City cash cow so desperately, that nobody invested in the script? Did they not sit down and re-watch all the funny and witty episodes? Why did the actresses agree to saying the lines that nobody would have ever imagined them to say? Why..... It wasn't just disappointing. It was simply boring. Too much make up, too much stale jokes (farts, dogs, kids),too much labels, too much immaturity. The characters were just people who stepped out of some girlie magazine. Boy problems at 40? Oh my God, the shoes! The bikini wax! The wedding! And Carrie gets a PA to sort out her boxes and to open her mail? What?! She changes her hair colour, which is supposed to be a plot twist?!

It had just the right amount of tears, laughs and heartwarming tales that one needs in a movie experience. No true Sex and the City fan will leave the theater feeling disappointed.

All of the ladies LOOKED GREAT! Eee gads, a respite has been good for them! Smith had lost BIT of his hottiness, but his ""competition"" sure made up for that! I was even more impressed with the fashion than I expected to be, and the wedding shoot...ah...SJP was astonishingly radiant. Big was true to his nature, and closets versus diamonds are surely the way to Carrie's heart. Go Big! Sweet CHARLOTTE was amazing when she was defending Carrie after the church scene. And the Morticia walk throughout the movie was cute, as well. Lily's bedroom is to die for, and having her hang out as one of the girls while they discussed ""coloring "" was appreciated. Instead of dumping her with a sitter, they included her, and I liked that. Miranda was beautiful. And Brady...too cute.

I am sorry I do not agree with that at all. Character development?? Are you serious this is Sex and the City, how much character development do you want?? This isn't the Godfather people its SATC, come on. This movie is suppose to be fun, not once was this movie promoted as a drama, because it's not. What it is, is a movie that stayed to true to what it is, a story about 4 friends who remained strong for each other during their toughest times in life. So I am not sure what character development people where expecting in this film, maybe you just had unrealistic expectations for this film.Now someone mentioned them focusing a bit too much on Carrie, which I do agree with but come on, they did the same thing in the series. Carrie was the main character in the series how could you not expect her to be the main character in the movie; once again unrealistic expectations. I do agree that Charlotte's pregnancy was a bit abrupt and seemed a bit rushed but what did you expect here? Do you want them to go over each prenatal visit, her decorating her room? Please we went through this with Miranda.And how can anyone say these characters weren't true to the characters in the series. I challenge anyone to find something that one character did that was out of the norm for them. Miranda promptly left Steve when she found out about him cheating, which is exactly what she would do. Charlotte was incredibly cute in her anger at Big as only Charlotte could do. And Samantha was Samantha, she tried to do the relationship thing but she couldn't.This film is by no means a ten but there is no way its below a 5 or 6. It was a glimpse into the life of the girls 4 years after the end of the series. It delivered what I expected and I think for that reason I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Sex and the City

Sorry! Nope, not here it's like a continuous commercial ad for A-List brands, thus making it the ultimate portrayal of modern-day urban shallowness summarized as a continuous ""shiny trinket with a label"" chase...It does try to make up by allowing the real wedding to be a label-less one, but the effort is only describable as ""too little too late"".",Sex and the City

The fashion was of course a treat to watch, with some bizarre and inspiring outfits, shoes, bags & wardrobes! I don't think it quite reached the outrageousness of classic SATC, and it didn't really come up with new ideas as far as romantic-comedies go; it went for the typical 'it-was-all-going-so-well-then-ooops' scenario. I thought that some of the main events in the film weren't loyal to the characters from the series. Instead it made up unrealistic and perhaps predictable stories to create an easier and more accessible script for wider audiences. My friends who didn't know SATC as a series pointed out the lack of a strong story-line (unless you count the Big/Carrie theme, even though it takes a back seat for part of the film).A major plus is it made wonderfully-cute references to the TV-series that I'm sure all long-term SATC fans will appreciate and find satisfying. Plus it gave satisfying answers to unanswered questions from the series - including who is Carrie's best friend out of the girls.The film is so long that the moments of brilliance get forgotten by the end. The way the film finished just wasn't as good as the series ending which was so perfect. It is more of a decent episode rather than an outstanding blockbuster. Saying this, I did enjoy it and I will watch it again and again and again when it's out on DVD!",Sex and the City

For the first 35 minutes, it was moving along nicely. I was laughing and enjoying myself. Then all of a sudden, we could see the microphones above the actors head during the movie. I was totally disappointed in the movies quality. With an estimated 65 million dollar budget, there shouldn't be mistakes like that!!! It was completely distracting. There was a scene with Big and Carrie that I completely missed all the dialogue do to the microphones over there heads as a distraction! Now, I didn't let that spoil my time, I still laughed. It was a shocking and funny movie... just like the HBO version. Although, on the big screen, some of the characters don't look as good.Enjoy the movie, after all its just entertainment.",Sex and the City
370,nishael,"Woe, I was shocked",3,28 May 2008,"This movie did a great job of showing the bond between female friends. I absolutely loved the integration of the high fashion these sophisticated New York ladies portrayed. With this, they did a great job. On the other hand, I was appalled with the extreme sexual graphics and nudity that was on the screen. There were so many alternative sexual lifestyles that were thrown at the audience that I felt bombarded with pornography. I had never in my life scene people having blatant obvious sex on the movie screen like that before, this movie was completely low on character and morals. I was concerned with moms taking there young teenagers to this movie for a girls night and being outraged by what they were being exposed to. Other than this shocking experience, the movie was well done and creative about these 4 ladies and how they experienced love in the Big city, for that I give it a 7 and for the rest, I give it a 2",Sex and the City
371,sarahleadbetter1,Excellent!,10,28 May 2008,"I absolutely loved this film! After waiting 4 years, there was a big hype to live up to but it certainly did. It was romantic, but realistic and was definitely true to the series. I cried for about 50% of the movie. I felt like I knew the characters (as we all do) so it was just so romantic to watch their happy endings. I didn't find it predictable and had that edge on regular RomComs. It expanded on the series as well bringing new problems for the girls and their friendships were stronger than ever. I disagree with all that say it was a 'fan service', I felt it was loyal to the characters we know and love. It wasn't just your gushy happy unrealistic RomCom. I saw it this morning and am seeing it tonight. Definitely go and see it!",Sex and the City
372,iknowcarly,Exactly what I hoped for,10,28 May 2008,"Was so nice to see the Sex And The City girls back on the screen in a film that reminded me why i watched the show religiously. Just like the series it flaunted clothes to die for, shoes that would cost more than a monthly paycheck and more designer handbags than you could find on Ebay. The film had me laughing and crying and concluded with all loose ends tied. What some people accused of having an ever so predictable plot was only the ending we would all hope for. Understandably those of you who weren't fans of the show may not be glued to the screen. However avid fans like my friends and I were overly content with the two and a half hours of indulgence and reminiscence of the show we grew to love.",Sex and the City
373,hazelmoore2003,The missing character?,9,29 May 2008,"I cannot deny i loved this film. It was laugh out loud funny and didn't disappoint. The audience were positively chomping at the bit and cheered when a clip of the film was shown during a trailer before the film had started and when certain ""objects of love"" clothes, shoes, children were shown in the film the audience could be heard gasping or aaahhhhing all in solidarity! I have never experienced that during a film before! The storyline did not dismay there were highs and lows cleverly interspersed with moments of absolute hilarity! The themes of the film are love, forgiveness and fabulousness (as ever!) But enough of me gushing about it! I have given this film 9/10 but I want to see if anyone agrees with why it didn't get a big fat 10! The first 10 minutes felt way wrong, SJP wasn't playing Carrie she was playing a exaggerated version of Carrie, it worried me for a minute, I thought maybe they had changed the characters for the movie but it settled down after a while. Maybe after watching it again I will discover that this was a new ""confident"" Carrie who had changed because of her stable relationship with Big, but I just wanted neurotic Carrie back!The 5th character was sadly missing from this film replaced by Jennifer Hudson who did a damn good job, but where was New York? I love the feel of the shows as they really portray the city but I didn't get that from the film.Also the time line is very flimsy. One minute something is months away and you think you will see a big lead up but then it is upon us. I guess as a viewer of the programme I expect a realistic time line that wouldn't be possible in film!Product placement was another problem in the film it is so transparent! My last comment on the film is not about something that is in the film but something I would of liked to see in the film, guest appearances, as the girls are all turning fab forties or fifties in the film I think it would of been nice to see some guest appearances form some strong forty to fifty year old women like Kylie Minogue (is she big in the US?)",Sex and the City
374,tubbyching27,"Love, Love, Love",10,29 May 2008,"Warning: This comment may contain spoilers.What can I say, the movie CARRIEd me away in its truest form.Back from its television series, the film's exposition presents with a montage of past events for each of the characters, showing them again on the screen but giving the chicks snippets from the finale of its last season. This was done so as to direct the audience from where it left off to the present. And how it was done was quick but simply flawless...to the tune of Fergie's Labels or Love.Seeing the trailer a while back, one would think that the wedding of Carrie and Big would be the denouement, rather it was the rising action of the story. The writers perhaps thought it best to bring such a hard conflict on the script and that they would think of something more fabulous in the end. The kind of acting that the girls put out there never changed from how they were years ago. It is the same foxy and sexy Samantha Jones, the fierce and charming Charlotte York, the spunky and ferocious Miranda Hobbes, and of course it is the same old passionate and fashionable Carrie Bradshaw we loved then but love a hundred times more now.In the movie you may have found colorful prints, beautiful flowers, pink mobile phones, flowing white gowns by Chanel, Lanvin, Vera Wang and Vivienne Westwood, blue bird feathers, tons of jewelry, studded black belts, boot sandals, long and big pearl necklaces, rental bags, bottles and bottles of wine, runway-size closets, penthouse apartments, Manolo Blahniks, Pradas, Versaces, and Louis Vuittons. However, only one label goes beyond Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, Samantha, and their friendship that has bound them through the years from their 20s, 30s, 40s and up till they turn golden girls. That label is LOVE. Every time. All the time. The last song till the credits may have said it all, as Jennifer Hudson sings All Dressed Up In Love. ""We wear what we want to feel, we're all dressed up in love."" After all, what we need is love, right? As far as Carrie's and Big's relationship is concerned, we know they have been dating for 10 years. We remember Big rescuing Carrie from Paris and that's how we saw them till the curtains rolled down on us in its finale. So it comes as an astounding news for Charlotte to jump for utter joy when she finds out Carrie and Big are getting married! Although this may not be the feeling we get from Big, or should we say John now that we know his real name is John James Preston, because as he says he's done this twice now and unsure that this is really what he and Carrie needs to forever seal their relationship. That scene in the middle of the street where Big and Carrie get off their cars was emotional you can feel that it was rough on both of them. But now we know how the resolution comes surprisingly sweet and how Carrie and Big lived happily ever after. In the end, Carrie wore what she felt, she was dressed in a plain white dress with no label. She wore love in its pure extravagance, accessorized by her beloved friends. Ah, we could only hope for a sequel.To motion picture soundtrack followers, the compilation includes Jem, Bliss, Kaskade, India Arie, among others mentioned. A new version of the inimitable theme of the movie was done by The Pfeifer Broz. Orchestra.And to fanatics of chick flicks, this is the movie of the decade! After all is said and done anyway, everybody needs the cheese in life, everybody needs love, love, love.Sex And The City The Movie stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Chris Noth.

375,brisw28,A younger fan who enjoyed the movie.,9,6 June 2008,"A lot of fans have commented that they were extremely disappointed. I am a rather young viewer, considering the show started airing when I was way too young to be watching it. I got into the show after it stopped. Although I will admit that things were different in the movie (like the sitcom like humor and more dramatic segments), I think it was a way to satisfy audiences that like the cheesy chick flick moments. I like a variety of kinds of movies and I really enjoyed the movie. Characters keep their personality, even if it isn't as blunt, like in the show, it was funny and in the end was a feel-good yet satisfying movie. I personally enjoyed the movie and, perhaps if age the concern, would recommend it to younger adult fans (perhaps ages 18-25?), like myself.",Sex and the City

After all, many fans watched the series for 6 or so years... but the movie was great in that it lived up to the expectations of the original series and did not pretend to be something it is not. Also, for all of you who say there is no plot, you are clearly blind and short sighted as it has one of the most important plots in the world, human emotions and how they change as a result of the experiences we go through. This is exactly what made the series so great, because beneath the sex, the labels, and fancy drinks are real people going through real problems that you and I face on a day to day basis. In the end, if you are a fan of the series you will understand what makes the TV show so great and therefore the movie. However, if you did not ""get"" the show, then you definitely wont get the movie.

They should have just made it a TV special. The story line is stretched out and ridiculous. They had to find fillers like unnecessary nudity and useless jokes to make a full length movie. Second, this is a good date movie. Men might like it just for bits of naked ladies and what women are like. I sat with women in the theater who were die hard fans and you could tell. They were the only ones gasping, laughing or awing. But I loved the fashion, New York sights and the continuation of what the T.V. show left behind.

They don't try to just pick up where the series left off. The ladies are older and wiser now, just like most women of that age, and how refreshing to see older women as the primary cast of a big movie. It was fun AND funny! I go to the movies to be entertained for the most part, and it certainly was entertaining. I'm not sure what people were expecting who gave all the negative reviews, but I've watched the entire series countless of times, and felt the movie stayed true to the format, tone, and characterization.

381,liznieve,disappointingly cloying,4,30 May 2008,"I wanted to like it. I really did. Like every other (even passive) fan of the show, I knew going in that the movie would be an orgy of everything sex and the city represented - fashion, sex, platonic female love.but I still expected it to retain the quality of the show that endeared countless fans, both female and male - that underneath the veneer of labels and superficiality there was a heart. That there were moments when it all became down-to-earth, real, and relatable.Nope, never happened.What we get instead is a glossy, cheesy, clichéd version of what we had hoped for. I think that the renovation of Carrie's apartment is emblematic... whereas it used to be good-looking, and certainly an apartment that in real estate terms her character could never afford, it was still slightly dingy, worn, lived in. It retained the touches of personality that made it look like a home. Instead, we get a brand new overly-decorated set, all of her personal effects tucked away in new white and shiny cabinets.The whole film is one giant set of white-and-shiny cabinetry, concealing anything that means anything in order to make the film aesthetically pleasing.Also, I also found the movie slightly racist, and i'm not overly-PC. Louise's friends are only black, Carrie's friends are only white. When Miranda is in Chinatown, she declares to ""follow the white man!"" in order to find the desirable part.The whole film just seemed over-decorated, -styled, -handled, -edited, -polished. The only thing that wasn't was the acne on the ass of Samantha's lust-object-next-door. Refreshing, but not enough to balance the rest of the film's saccarinity.",Sex and the City
382,emmapeebles,If you expected anything else you are crazy!,9,31 May 2008,"Saw SATC movie last night and it was fab! It actually did feel more like a stand alone movie than I expected, a fact that was confirmed by my film fan husband who also loved it! It had all the right components of a SATC episode, like funky musical takes on the theme tune, designer labels, and the Carrie voice-over! All this movie was ever supposed to be was a conclusion to the story. This was delivered in a realistic way which was both gut wrenching and heartfelt. Obviously the biggest portion of the story had to go to Carrie! Despite the amazing contribution of the other ladies over the years, this is still Carrie's story. SJP's work was amazing and anyone who says otherwise must have been in the wrong cinema. The aftermath of the wedding, especially the flower bashing, were so emotional. Chris Noth was fab as the in love but panicking Big! We felt for him as much as for Carrie. Happily we did get our happy ending and this is what any fan would have wanted. If she had checked her phone/emails after the wedding then this really would have become an episode as there would have been nowhere to go. Carrie & Big aside, the conclusions of the other girls' story's were also satisfying. The Miranda & Steve plot line shows that your happy ever after does not always run smoothly and the Charlotte & Harry storyline confirms that miracles can happen! How cute is Lily!! I would have liked to see Samantha break up with Smith a little earlier so that some of her antics could have made the movie. It was great to see her try a relationship and decide that it wasn't really for her! Kristen Davies, Cynthia Nixon & Kim Catrall gave great performances with humour and emotion! I would have like to have seen more of the boys but then we would have had a 3 hour movie! Jennifer Hudson wasn't really required but it was good to have another dimension that was exclusive from the series. Her first Louis Vuitton touched me as I remember the moment I unwrapped mine! All in all, I laughed and I cried and at the end I was satisfied, non fans may not like it but I loved it! Might go again! Can't wait for the DVD! Good job guys! Sceptics need to see it again with an open mind! Appreciate the movie for being the conclusion that we needed. Empire Magazine got it spot on 3 star movie but 4 stars for fans!",Sex and the City

I truly loved this movie. My emotions were like a roller coaster (up and down, side to side). I laughed, I cried, I was mad. WOW, this was a great film. In the funny scenes (there were A LOT), I laughed so hard my stomach was hurting, in the sad scenes I cried my eyes off. Let me tell you it was a little weird hearing Carrie call Mr. Big by his name (LOL). After having waiting for 4 years for this film, I can honestly say...GREAT THINGS COME FOR THOSE WHO WAIT!!!

Is this what longtime fans deserve? Charlotte is reduced to a screaming idiot,with a husband who says ten words the whole movie. Samantha was a pathetic drag who couldn't spice up her own sex life? Why couldn't Samantha and Smith remained happy and sexual? Miranda was such a bore,and very stubborn, although her ending was the best. Why put in Jennefer Hudson? What was the point?

By the end of it, i ended up meeting all my girl friends for..of course..cosmopolitans, just to get a taste of the glamorous lifestyle of the sex and the city girls. It's obviously a ladies film, but unless you actually followed the series you won't appreciate the context that much.The fashion of the girls was obviously more over-the-top than in the actual series, but this can make one want to pamper herself after watching 148 minutes of a lifestyle one might only wish to have.

389,Forked427,So disappointing. I owe my husband dinner for taking me...,5,1 June 2008,"I'll give it a middle-of-the-road rating, but honestly I was disappointed in the film and, after the hype, had expected more.SJP no longer has that flair she once had, her battles with Cattral over money and then her outing this info in People a few weeks ago show her more snarkly side. The fact that she produced and had an in on the writing speaks poorly of her choices, this script and film would be dead in the water but for the celebrity status of it's top player.There is no plot, it's just a long version of the show, as if it's off cable now and on real TV. It's lost it's racy edge, and the extended male shower shots etc were added time-filler's when we weren't yawning through at least 75 clothing changes. If you take all of that out, you're left with time that could have used better, in a script that was better, in utilizing actors better. As was expected, Nixon's character had the only developed plot line, a nod to her as she was by far the best actress on the show. Still and all she came off like a bitch, and seemed to have no concept of marriage and it's give-and-take requirements. Davis's character, Charlotte, was simply eye candy. Honestly, I think they forgot about her until half way through the writing, and then threw her a bone with a story line and a Happy Ending moment with Big. SJP's Carrie is shallow as ever, and spends most of the movie either being the bridezilla or feeling sorry for herself. Her assistant, Hudson, is a useless waste of money, tho I give props to her for doing the movie, knowing as she must have that her role was to darken up the frowned upon white only cast. The ending is horrible, and not at all believable. Sadly the banter between the women was lost as SJP tried to make the women less dicey. No more pot smoking, or heavy drinking, or sex scenes that reminded one why the show was on cable. They're generally PG-13, and SJP is now too hoity-toity to even engage in one. A few boobie shots, but not any of our girl Samantha, who was the one we mostly saw in the show. Cattral's character is as stagnant as Davis's, tho she gets a few good lines in. Unfortunately, they were so few and fleeting, I can't recall a single one. She's more a good girl now, got a dog and got fat instead of having sex. What kind of Samantha is that??? Noth doesn't say enough to make it worth it, and all though he is handsome as ever, his very big nose was more evident in the movie. Too many close-ups of him and his cohorts just showed how they have all aged, and they gave him poorly colored sideburns, I kept wanting to tell him he should have dyed them better, or waited till the dye in them fully grew out.The product endorsement was as shameful as Star Jones's wedding. One has to wonder how broke SJP is, or how stingy? I do know now that the E series Benz looks like a sweet ride, and iced coffee from either Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks are good to drink. The Iphone makes an appearance, as do a number of other phones, laptops, grocery items, designers, shoes, handbags, and Oodles of Noodles........SJP truly does look like a horse. She's way too thin and looked worse than a starving model in the high shoes. The others had bad makeup jobs too, one would think there was enough money to do a better job with covering up their obvious flaws.It's a chick flick, and will do well, tho no one will ever buy the DVD. Silly, stupid, undeveloped plot lines, the only reason to see this film is the hope of seeing the girls in their symbiotic relationship. Forget it, it's not there.",Sex and the City

The only thing that surprised me was that Samantha left Smith (though it didn't surprise me she left L.A.). The clothes and shoes did not disappoint. This movie ties up all loose ends from the series and it should satisfy. There's not as much narrating from Carrie, but I think it's partly b/c she isn't writing an article, which she did each episode. It's definitely worth seeing. Everyone was great. SJP brought tears to my eyes, Kristin made me feel pain, Kim was flawless & Cynthia made me thankful for my relationship.

Well, maybe not a true fan, but then why bother to watch the movie anyway? For those who say this movie is geared only to women and gay men, trust me--There were PLENTY of men with their ladies at the theater laughing and cheering along, and they didn't look even a little anxious about how long they were sitting there.The fashion was to die for. The music was amazing. The scenery was gorgeous. My favorite has always been Charlotte, and I loved how funny she was in this movie. I loved the progression of Samantha.

392,ksweetie94,Very good with a few flaws,8,1 June 2008,"I went into this movie having read mixed reviews, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. As a huge fan of Sex and the City, I was hoping the movie wouldn't ruin my love for the show. After watching it, I'd have to say that though the movie certainly had its flaws (as all movies do), it didn't let me down.My biggest criticism of the movie is pretty much the same as what I had read in the negative reviews: the outfits and accessories were over the top. Now, one of the fun things about the original show was their fantastic clothes and accessories, but it just seemed as if the stylists in the movie were trying too hard to fit an extra pair of Manolos into the movie's ""closet"". Another flaw of the movie was its length- a few of the scenes seemed to be space-fillers and could have been left out.Besides a few flaws, the movie overall was very enjoyable. The script was smart and witty as always, and the characters were lovable. Sarah Jessica Parker, as usual, played Carrie Bradshaw beautifully. Kim Cattrall as Samantha Jones was hilarious, and at times I felt she stole the show. Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis as Miranda and Charlotte were wonderful as well. Chris Noth shined as the stubborn but lovable Mr. Big, and Jennifer Hudson did an excellent job as Louise, Carrie Bradshaw's assistant. Though David Eigenberg (Steve), Evan Handler (Harry), and Jason Lewis (Smith) did not get much screen time, they were great as well. Another thing I liked was how Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte seemed to have matured a lot, which made the five-year time span between the show and the movie more realistic. The introduction was fantastic, because it helped viewers who hadn't seen much of the show an idea of what was going on. Finally, I found the ending a perfect one for the story of these four women and the men they love.Overall, I think the movie was a perfect conclusion to the 10 year saga of Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha. I'll be buying it when it comes out on DVD to add to my Sex and the City collection.",Sex and the City
393,kare_bear102,Love Letter of Great Men,10,1 June 2008,"In the movie, Carrie was reading a book ""Love Letter of Great Men"" while she was w/ Mr. Big, and it seem like a great literature to read for some of dedicated viewer; however, we are not having much luck locating this book except for a book called ""Love Letter of Great Men and Women in the 18th Century"". I'm not certain if this is the same book as in the movie but it seemed an amazing book to read, and it made us all think about how we define and write about ""Love"". This movie deserves a two thumbs up, and it was very touching to see the emotional roller coaster these characters goes through...I LOVE IT. I cried and cried at the end but ""fairy tales do come true"" as long as you believe it. Hopefully a sequel will follow.",Sex and the City
394,orphanannie077,I cant believe that so many people wrote bad reviews about this movie,10,2 June 2008,"I thought that the SATC movie was awesome. I cannot even begin to understand why people didn't like this movie, maybe they just aren't true fans.I've heard that the main characters were whiny and not as strong as they used to be. Completely wrong. In fact the whole movie is basically about how they weren't going to take any crap from the men they were in relationships with. Samantha actually ends up leaving Smith, and both Carrie and Miranda stood up for themselves when they experienced some problems in their relationships. I've also heard that its not as witty and funny. I don't even know were someone would get that from. Even after Carrie got stood up at her wedding she was making jokes at the restaurant in Mexico a few days later.The movie did have a plot, and It was never uninteresting through the entire 2 hours and a half that I watched it. I also don't understand why everyone is complaining about the advertising. First of all every movie or TV show advertises some product. Second its SATC, I didn't even know about Manolo's until I watched the show. Of course they are going to add in shoe brands and wedding gown designers. Cmon thats inevitable, the show had a good deal to do with fashion.I think the only thing I didn't like about this movie is that stupid little girl that Charlotte adopted... And the sex scenes with Harry",Sex and the City
395,plexus-7,Entertaining and deeper than I thought it would be,7,2 June 2008,"First you should know about me so my review is in context: male, heterosexual, not a fan of the TV show, have seen maybe 2 episodes, prefer deeper/darker type films, tending to the left, appreciate fashion as an art form.I wasn't going to go see this film based on the poor reviews. I thought it would be as some have stated: women wandering around in designer clothes with a poor script and plot. But I decided to go on a night when I would be fine just relaxing in a theatre. In my opinion, this film is way better than that! So here is my review without spoilers.First on the humour front, i thought it was pretty funny. There were some really witty adult jokes and perspectives in the film that made me laugh. I found myself really enjoying the personalities and the different perspectives they bring. I thought the characters were pretty robust and diverse and that really made it interesting. I assumed that these roles had been honed through the TV series. Also their interpersonal relationships differed depending on who they were talking to etc which was pretty cool.I thought the plot was interesting enough. Its not unlike many straight up romantic comedies. But with the lives of the 4 main characters, plus some others such as Big and Loise, it kept enough pace to make the film interesting, coupled with the character development. The plot coupled with the fine editing left me interested and the 145 mins went by without me thinking it was slow in any places. in fact i was totally open to walking out if i found it was going to be a total waste of time. before i knew it the film was over.On the fashion front, i appreciate fashion as an art form. And so I was blown away by some of the fashion in the movie. To be honest i was moved to tears with the shoot for vogue. There was some incredibly beautiful pieces in that segment that balanced elegance, classic and contemporary design and the sets and posing were amazing. The other fashion content was also interesting. I can totally see how if you could care less about fashion or even have disdain for it, you'd take that as a strike against this film. But if you like/love/live fashion, there is a lot here to keep your interest.At first I was pretty disgusted with the film in terms of the way the women were acting. Although I am well aware of the selfish self-centered nature that women can tend to have, I was thinking a lot about a review here that dis-waded people from bringing their young daughters to see it. What got me was that ultimately these people (the characters) that were totally entrenched in their selfish behavior, had the self-awareness to realize what they were doing and ultimately made amens for it. This to me in my experience is the biggest weakness of people in general: the ability to be self aware enough to rise above fear to embrace love. And that is really what this movie is about.So with all that, I have to give it a decent rating, much to my surprise. But its not for everyone. If you aren't a fan of the show but you enjoy the quirks and diversity of the way people act and react, you have a romantic perspective and enjoy fashion i think you'll like Sex and the City.",Sex and the City
396,sunshine811,"OK, but boom mic?",5,2 June 2008,"I don't know if it was just the theater that I went to, but throughout the whole movie we had perfect view of the Boom overhead. At some points it seemed like the mic was going to hit the cast in the head. I mean SJP is only so tall and if I would have been standing by her the mic would have been hitting me in the head. The blur at the top of the screen to try and hide it was useless. It was very distracting!!! I didn't watch the show religiously every week, but I have watched the DVD's so I was familiar with how everything was coming together. To me the only storyline within the movie that wasn't dragged along with the boom over head was Charlotte's. The story was OK, but They really should have just done another half a season if they wanted 2 hours of footage.",Sex and the City
397,masterdinadan-1,Better than the others would have had me believe,7,2 June 2008,"I've seen a lot of negative comments about this movie, although many do not make sense to me.There have been complaints about ""product placement."" Yes, Carrie and the rest do make a big deal out of designer clothes, purses, and what-not, but I don't find this inappropriate in the least. This is entirely in-character for them, and none of it seemed the least bit out of place to me.There's the ""race"" issue, many statements that Jennifer Hudson's role in the movie were attempts at ""political correctness,"" as well as complaints about gay characters or Charlotte's Asian daughter. Most of these claims are ridiculous considering nearly all of these characters were included in the television series. Their presence in the movie is not the least bit unusual or inappropriate.On the subject of Hudson, whose character is in fact new to Sex and the City -- I find it offensive that people would even suggest that having a Black character is somehow a flaw in this movie. Doesn't that attitude strike you as a little bit racist?I will say this. It is absolutely true that you will not enjoy the movie if you did not like the television series. This should not be surprising. Were you expecting something different? It's still Sex and the City, and if you loved the television series, you are likely to get more of what you loved. I cannot emphasize this point enough. If you have never had any interest in the television show, or simply don't like it, there is no reason at all for you to go see this movie.",Sex and the City
398,saralain83,Perfection!,10,3 June 2008,"This movie was a wonderful way to bring the girls back! I felt everything picked back up as it should and I was please to see it all be tied up at the end with a pretty bow. I most defiantly think they've left room for a sequel and truly hope they make one soon....four years was too long to wait! Also I have to say I really enjoyed seeing all the latest fashions on the big screen. All in all I think this movie was great! I laughed, I cried, I didn't want it to end!

399,elizabdg,Sex and the City movie disappointing,2,3 June 2008,"The Sex and the City movie was disappointing. It's worth it only to see the clothes and most of them are shown so briefly I could barely take them in. The movie isn't funny. The content that is meant to be funny is either vulgar and/or juvenile. Most of it better suited for ""Dumb and Dumber"" type movies. (Actually, ""Dumb and Dumber"" is a much better movie.) The movie was too long, dull and predictable. Making the movie seems only to have allowed the producers to put in nude scenes that couldn't be done for TV. The story falls flat. The character played by Jennifer Hudson is simply unnecessary. I thought that Carrie struggled for money. How could she afford an assistant and why would she want one? One of her three friends could have stepped in to help her. The movie didn't peak my emotions, except for Miranda and Steve. I'm glad that I saw the movie right away and satisfied my curiosity. Otherwise, I would have felt that I was missing something. All the best parts have already been shown in trailers on TV. Don't waste your money.",Sex and the City
400,coda_queen,Eating as a Substitution for Sex?,6,3 June 2008,"I loved the fashion but thought they could have cut out 45 minutes of pain and anguish. We all knew what was coming and the heartache that would ensue... but the best part of the TV show was the picking ones self up by her Manolos and figuring out how to find happiness and forgiveness once more, not so much self loathing and agony. Now I know it did happen eventually, but c'mon - there could have been far juicier stuff to fill up the time with (Samantha getting to appreciate her Sushi adventure, planning the details of the wedding, a bigger bachelorette party, a bachelor party, etc...). Everything going into the wedding was so rushed. Everything on the other side was too disjointed. They used all the wrong moments to fill time. I was a little disappointed to see the characters change too... Eating as a substitute for one's other fabulous addictions? Samantha never would have leveled for that. Ultimately I'm glad I saw it, but what a bummer that they spent so much time on what they did.",Sex and the City

It gives women hope that somewhere out there...there is a gentleman who will treat a woman with respect and dignity. You speak of the characters on ""Sex and the City"" so poorly, but have you taken the time to evaluate yourself in this process. Obviously you have no clue what women want or else you wouldn't be making such crass comments or having marital issues yourself. Your wife has every reason to be upset with you and I am glad that she put your butt on the couch. How would you like it if she spoke so ignorantly and crudely about something that you liked and enjoyed. Think about how you would want her to treat you if you were excited about something. This is a huge event for ""Sex and the City"" fans across the globe. First and foremost, think of this...Why do you think that there are so many women that adore ""Sex and the City?"" Probably the same reason men like to watch ESPN. Most men understand sports better than most women...and can probably relate to it. I hope the light bulb is finally going off in your head! Women can relate to the characters in this film because we have to deal with ignorant men like yourself nearly every day. Don't be so critical of something that your wife enjoys, you should be supporting her. Don't blame a film on your ""hurt marriage,"" the problem starts at home...not in Hollywood.",Sex and the City
402,catapult-cat,Why do we have angry men writing about this awesome chick flick?,10,5 June 2008,"I think its hilarious that some guy in the midst of marital problems chose to blame this movie for continuing arguments with his wife.I wonder why this showed up as the review of a movie, when he wrote nothing about the movie itself, but instead chose to grace us with some trivia from his own flawed marriage.On the other hand, the bitter tone of it, and the amazing conclusion where he gets to sleep on the couch, were hilarious.To this guy's wife, I'd suggest taking a page from the strong women in Sex and the City and moving on to a more open minded and less misogynist partner.And to the disgruntled husband, quite honestly...ha ha ha.",Sex and the City
403,mesincity,Actually...,9,6 June 2008,"My rating may be high, but it's primarily based on the fact that I didn't expect that much from the film and it delivered in abundance.First off, I was not caught up in all of the hype of the premiere and the events surrounding it. Secondly, I am not a die-hard follower of Sex & The City.The last time I watched a complete episode was at least 6 years ago when I was still renting a room from someone who was paying to receive HBO at their house. To further the lack of a connection to the Sex & The City premise/storyline/history, I was with my wife, who has never at all watched one episode, or for that matter, most likely never even seen part of one.The movie (probably due in part to its length) in my opinion went so much deeper than any of the episodes I'd seen ever did. Though mostly somewhat predictable, there were enough twists and additions to the standard cast that (again, in my opinion) this is truly solid as a movie. Is it art? Perhaps to some. However, as a ""regular"" movie...an escape through a good story, I feel it's extremely successful. It certainly runs the spectrum of emotions. My wife required quite a few tissues at times...and yes, she's a pretty emotional person in the first place.I'm not going to go on here. The only other substantial point I can make here (without hashing over the storyline) is that it holds together extremely well as a stand-alone film (read: it works for people who know almost nothing about the Sex & The City series itself). Will you get more of the jokes or understand the characters better if you're a follower of the HBO/television series...of course. Can you walk into this somewhat blindly and enjoy it as well? You certainly can...and should. I really felt this went beyond the level of my expectations from what little I'd seen in the past.",Sex and the City
404,Jenniferkinchla,Awesome. Amazing. Sexy. Done.,10,6 June 2008,"This film was amazing whether you jumped on the Sex and the City bandwagon just for being a girl, or if you have been watching the show from day 1. The characters of the show and their friendship make the movie worth watching alone. This is disregarding all of the drama they threw together in a 2 1/2 hours of pure female entertainment. I can't express this enough, don't even try to drag your boyfriend, manfriend, significant other, husband, or a male in general to this film. Unless he's batting for our team, 2.5 hours of Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, Charlotte, and all of the female perspectives on sex and life, will give him full privileges to never let you choose what movie you're going to see for the rest of your lives. Other than that, have a glass of wine, bring your girlfriends to the movies, and enjoy a great movie which ties up a series that has impacted an entire generation of women.

For one, it is refreshing to see a light hearted girly movie about friends and relationships... true we don't see a huge development in character but hey what were you expecting? Some independent thought provoking realization about life??

I cried with the girls, was angry with them, and almost died laughing in spots. It did seem like the movie was dragging on in the middle but soon picked up. I must say it is pretty unnecessarily pornographic in spots. They could have left a lot of it out and still had a fabulous movie.

Honestly, I don't think anyone who has rated this movie other than a 10 is a true Sex and the City fan. It was everything I could have hoped for and more. I was in complete bliss throughout this entire movie. It had the perfect mixture of comedy, romance, drama, and suspense. I could not have asked for more. I am so excited for this movie to come out on DVD so I can see the special features. It seems to me that most of these people who are commenting on this movie haven't seen the show, considering the movie is ""cleaner"" than the show was. So, if you are thinking about seeing the movie and have never seen the television show, you might want to rent a couple seasons (probably the last few seasons) and then go see the movie. Then you will have an educated decision weather this movie is good or not. Otherwise don't even bother rating this movie unless it's a good rating:)",Sex and the City

I never did get to even chat to him about this wonderful city. I still feel sad about my ending and still love NY.Seeing NY again on the big screen was fantastic and sad at the same time. Brooklyn bridge, with the café underneath, fast moving yellow cabs and the beautiful Central Park. Those amazing buildings and lights from the Empire State Building. WOW, WOW and more WOWIt is a gorgeous and exciting city. I loved the fashion, the fun, the chatter between girlfriends. This is a movie I will get on DVD and watch again and again. When I am older I will still enjoy it.

I was kind of disgusted by that.It Doesn't matter how much of a b**ch she was. Maybe they should have received counseling or something (or better yet, not have gotten married)...but having Miranda take him back and then making the story line seem heartwarming... as if her final decision was the RIGHT thing to do or something. I can't get over that. Her decision seemed quite ridiculous to me. A celebration of his deceit. Overall, I loved the movie. I just can't really get over Miranda and her issue.

If this flick could draw the attention from a guy like me, then you know there's something special about this movie.Yeah, I was dragged into it by my girl/date (it's complicated) and yeah, I was worried that she dragged me there because she wanted to me to learn a message or get into girlie stuff... who knows? BUT, the movie was funny enough (Charlotte especially) for me to realize that she dragged me there just because she wanted to have a good time with me.I still prefer my boy Will Ferrell film over Carrie and her gang, but I have to give them props.

412,amadiyah-smooth,Such a disappointment,4,14 June 2008,"Being a huge fan of the show, I must say this movie was literally bad from the beginning to the very end. Full of clichés, weak characters, embarrassing lines topped with a terrible plot. I personally grew up watching these four women who were strong, independent, witty and always there for each other. The movie shows them as weak and desperate (mostly Carrie). That isn't what the original show was about. Maybe it would have been better if they hadn't made this film since it has absolutely nothing to give us viewers, except a headache following the constant and blatant promotion of certain labels. Also, what exactly did Jennifer Hudson's character do besides read Carrie's emails when Miss Bradshaw was once again so caught up in her own ego? Nothing. Yet she seemed to be a relatively big part of the whole freak show while Stamford barely spoke a word despite supposedly being a good friend of Carrie's. Nothing really made any sense in one way or another. All in all, the movie is completely shallow and empty and it never manages to take off. It's a true shame since the characters and actors have so much potential. Best: Kim Cattral and Samantha Worst: the humping dog, Carrie's whining, label-wh*ring",Sex and the City

I will see it again, I think, to get some perspective.Some bits that annoyed me were:From a dramatic perspective, I thought Big got off WAY to easily. He let Carrie down so badly - again - & yet all he had to do was to re-appear & she ran into his arms. And the message was that she had caused the problems. For a show with such an emphasis on fashion & image, SJP's make-up was incredibly harsh & ageing. Why was this necessary? And that wedding head-piece/make-up get-up was hideous and I love Samantha, but was her costuming really fashionable? It looked almost 80/90's to me.There was a strong sub-text of women being told what to do & it being unchallenged. From Miranda being told to wax, to Charlotte being told to run when she was pregnant, to Carrie being told & telling herself that she was wrong to want the big wedding and that she had driven Big to his appalling behaviour.How did Stanford & Anthony change from antagonists to friends?I enjoy reading everyone's comments.

Yes, female Harvard-educated Manhattan lawyers certainly end up alone and crying in dingy closet-like apartments in a bad area of Chinatown like some hapless graduate students, the moment they dare to leave their adulterous waiter husbands.

I thought the beginning of the movie contained a lot of for-fans-only stuff, but it kept improving towards the end, until eventually I didn't want it to end. I laughed and I cried throughout the movie, and so did the rest of the auditorium. What more can you ask? I'm only sorry that Carrie and Big got married in the end, because that makes it unlikely that there will be a sequel.I love Samantha so I'm hoping to see more of her in the future..at least she was left still single in the end, so there just might be more to the story.",Sex and the City

This review comes from the both of us.The movie left both of us with a bad taste in our mouths. When Big left Carrie in the altar, that was so unforgivable that it completely changed the course of the movie. Carrie's reaction afterwards was completely understood and the trip to Mexico that followed was also in line with the story. What we didn't like was the happy ""Brady Bunch"" ending that after less than a year Carrie runs back to Big, simply because he copied and e-mailed her other people's love poems.We both agreed there are somethings in life that we should forgive, and there are some things we simply cannot. If someone does something so awful to you on what is supposed to be the happiest day of your life, the relationship cannot be the same ever again.There will be those of you who will say, this is just a movie, not real life.

I think the movie was supposed to have a different effect then the show did. The dialoge was just as funny as the show, if not more touching and the acting was fantastic. I didn't feel the characters ""lost"" themselves and the transition from TV to Big Screen was not a failure. If you didn't like the movie I don't really get how you're a true fan. I waited a long time for this movie to come out and it was worth the wait and now I can't wait to buy it on DVD when it comes out this fall.",Sex and the City
421,l_t_87,A No- No,3,17 August 2008,"As a huge fan of SATC, i was dying to watch the movie, i was shocked of how boring this movie was. The characters did not act themselves like they did in the show, they were different. Its basically a repetition with an extra sort of happy ending. This movie is a marketing movie for clothes, bags and shoes thats it! Carrie was desperate, charlote was acting all cute ( she didn't show it) and airheady, samantha lost her touch, miranda was silly and she wasn't full of life like she used to be. The movie was so predictable. U already knew what is gonna happen next. Whats with Jennifer Hudson? She was basically there to promote bags borrow and steal and louis vitton. THATS IT! It wasn't all that special. Very disappointing!",Sex and the City
422,tapio-seppala,Nothing spectacular but entertaining,5,19 August 2008,"I have watched the original series for roughly 30-40 episodes and I don't think it's too bad. Shallow maybe but entertaining. I was expecting the movie being basically like a stretched episode.And that's what I got, kind of. Some of the jokes were just really dumb. I can't believe that they actually had to rely on fart humour -- really bad fart humour. The plot was predictable but I wasn't expecting much either. It could have been a bit less sugar-coated tho. It felt bit like a fairy tale.Overall the movie was nothing really spectacular but I still found myself entertained. But is it better than watching the actual show? Worth paying a movie ticket? Not in my opinion.",Sex and the City
423,skattikat-1,It's still Sex and the City and that's enough for me!,6,27 September 2008,"Having just watched the Sex and the City movie for a second time, this time on DVD I felt the need to share my opinion about the film. When I watched the movie in the cinema I initially felt disappointed. I love the show and have watched the episodes hundreds of times over and having been deprived of it for four years I couldn't wait to be reunited with those four girls again. The problem with a movie vs a TV is it only has two hours to cram everything in where as TV can spread it out over a whole series. A film is therefore mainly about plot and that doesn't leave much time for anything else. The best thing about the TV series for me was the lunch scenes with the girls when they would get together and discuss all the things that me and my own girlfriends would talk about, it was both hilarious and reassuring. The film didn't really allow much room for that but the few scenes between the girls were easily the most enjoyable of the film. The part of the film that lead up to the jilting felt extremely rushed which was obviously because the wedding was not going to be the main focus of the film. It left Carrie free and single again to be with her friends and to do more soul searching which is essentially the reason behind Steve cheating on Miranda. Despite the fact that Big has shown commitment issues during the series the finale of the show showed that he had overcome this and the film then just undermined this purely because people would not have been satisfied with watching a happily functioning couple for 2 hours? Steve's mistake however seemed totally out of character and I felt a little bit cheated as their relationship was one that I'd always been a fan of. I guess the main problem is that the movie didn't really need to be made. The series ended in a really satisfying way and so this was never going to live up to our expectations. However, as I stated at the beginning I still wanted more and as I awaited the DVD release for a second viewing I felt more optimistic. The clothes (which were always an important part of Sex and the City viewing)were amazing and the girls all look fantastic. This may be a superficial point but I think part of the show's appeal is this type of guilty pleasure viewing. In response to all the comments about cheap fart and fat jokes I think that's a little harsh. The gag with Charlotte was simply a way of providing light relief for Carrie to lift her out of her depression and I defy anyone not to laugh if their friend just crapped themselves. I'm not a fan of toilet humour but myself and everyone else in the cinema laughed at this point. Charlotte's character was somewhat sidelined but I'm glad they chose not to break up every relationship in the series in order to create more dramatic tension. It was nice to see her living her happy ending. Samantha was still on top form for me despite the complaints and I'm glad in a way that they chose to end the series with her on her own. It is less conventional and more true to her character throughout the series. The film was full of corny moments and soppy lines about love (and I'm sure it could have survived without Jennifer Hudson's addition) but the series often used cringe-worthy dialogue so that to me was to be expected. Despite feeling that it wasn't a necessary movie to make in terms of the character's story lines I'm glad they did because I love the show and the characters so much that I would take an average film about them over no film at all.",Sex and the City
424,the_american_girl,What a disaster!!!!!!,1,20 October 2008,"What a disappointment!!!!!!! I am coming from a big city myself( Paris, France), and watching the series was a total delight. It remembered me the ""city girl atmosphere"" I was used to. This movie is a terrible mistake! I was so bored the whole time. This Sex and the City is all about superficial things : clothing, shoes and fashion. The story is so cheesy!!! It's ridiculous. None of the characters reflect any aspects of the real life. More than anything else, what a disrespect towards the association preventing animal cruelty when they appear on the big screen. They look like some ""crazy, annoying"" people protesting for reasons that don't concern any of Carrie or her friends. All these actress wearing those fur coat!!! That's all there is to see in that movie!!!! What a SHAME!!!!!!!!!!",Sex and the City
425,conanismyluvr,Mood Swings and Shallowness in the City,2,20 October 2008,"I must admit that although I've watched every episode at least 10 times, I can't say I'm a HUGE fan. I always felt the women were a little too emotional and label-conscious for my liking, but the intriguing story lines and witty dialog have kept me hooked. Assured that watching the movie would be like watching a two-hour long episode, I was excited and hopeful the movie would not disappoint...boy was I wrong.Where do I begin...I suppose the moment I knew something was awry was when Charlotte pooped her pants. SATC, although quite brazen with the sex, never had to lower to that kind of crassness. And, yes, Carrie is supposed to be obsessed with fashion and designer clothes, but while it was just a side note in the series, the movie made it almost the focal point. It's almost disheartening when the ""major"" moments in the movie came when Carrie was trying on wedding dresses, when she saw her new walk-in closet, and when she gave her assistant a Louis Vuitton bag. Jennifer Hudson's character was also unnecessary and her story dragged the movie. (Her unenthusiastic, horrible acting didn't help either.) I was hoping to see more evolution with the four relationships, but instead the theme of each one stayed disappointingly constant: Charlotte and Harry were content, Samantha was growing distant from Smith, Miranda and Steve had one big fight, and Big was having trouble committing. And speaking of Big and Carrie's relationship, what happened? First, I thought it was out of line for Carrie to not talk to Big for a whole year just because of his one moment of hesitation (which should be expected of him). Then all of a sudden at the end, she decides out of the blue that she'll forgive him. Huh? This movie works if you just want a mind-dulling, guilty pleasure with your girlfriends, but all in all, I felt this movie was stupid and not at all did the series justice. I don't want to go so far as to say that anyone who liked it probably isn't a true fan of the series, but I will say that if you admired the wit and character development in the original series and that's what drew you in, you'd be quite dissatisfied with the movie. On the other hand, if you just liked the fashion and/or liked living vicariously through the characters (who do not represent real life!) then by all means, enjoy yourself.There was no central theme in the movie, and even though SATC prides itself in representing strong, independent women, all I saw were stereotypical, moody, self-absorbed, shallow 40-year-olds who act like they're in their 20s.This was just one a young person's (I'm 19) opinion of the movie.",Sex and the City
426,s2423123,I like to be them!!,8,17 December 2008,"This movie is very funny! ""Sex and the city"" is one of my favorite films I have ever seen. Four characters are individual and their conversation is very interesting. So I laughed a lot while watching this movie. And there was a scene that was impressive and I cried a lot. I realized importance of the friendship by this movie and I hope to want to do life like them in the future. And I was made to think about the love a lot. ""Sex and the city"" is televised in a drama in Japan at midnight; I want to watch this drama from now on. I wanted to live in New York very much and I want to enjoy shopping and fashion like them. I will watch this movie once again. I can recommend this movie to everyone. I want everybody to watch.",Sex and the City

The series was flagging in the last season or two, but mercifully they stopped it before flogging it to death - a sensible decision. This movie is the horse they came back to flog - and they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. The horse is dead, Dave, dead.There were only three points in the entire two hours+ I laughed. OK, it's not really a 'comedy' movie, but it is billed as being 'Comedy, Drama, Romance', so I expected some of the wit of the original series to shine through. The laughs, such as they were, came from two sex scenes and toilet humour. Honestly, for the scriptwriters to resort to a shitty pants scene to raise a laugh was worthy of the 'Carry On' series and no higher.In short - devoid of wit, humour, pace, grace and real style.

For most women when this happens it's hard to get the old feelings back. Big was only about himself. He only came to Carrie when he wanted her never when she waned him. I was happy when he back out of the wedding, hoping that they wouldn't get back together, since Big has never been good at marriage.

The film is touching, and witty and remains true to the show...only now the characters have matured (as we have) and begin experiencing life on a level which we didn't get to see on the show. The television show transitioned seamlessly onto the big screen, never missing a cord or ever leaving the audience bored.The clothes are better and the friendship is stronger than ever.It was a beautiful ending to the story of the 4 women in NYC who found one another while in search for that special something that lead them here...and in the end, they did all while never compromising their friendship.I love-love-loved it, and I plan on seeing it again.If you are not a fan of the show, I still recommend the film, it will surprise you.",Sex and the City

I thought they did a great job at the start of the movie by giving you a quick summary of each of the girls' lives leading up to the movie. I really don't think it was necessary to have seen the entire series to enjoy or understand this movie. I thought the movie kept with the feel of the series in every way (even providing the explicit scenes we've all become accustomed to from the series!). All in all a great movie.

431,rsittler-727-386199,Worst Movie ever made by far,1,1 May 2010,"I am actually having my assistant start drafting a letter to IMDb as I write this review complaining that each movie HAS to receive at least a score of ONE. This movie was a zero. This movie was so cliché, so little effort, so little anything, it was just unwatchable. There was a time when I was actually a fan of this TV Series. It was fresh, funny, with interesting characters that I enjoyed watching develop each week. I thought the series got a little over the top and commercial towards the end, but that is not uncommon, and I am happy to give the producers and writers a pass. But, this movie was an absolute embarrassment. I can not believe that someone with a brain actually read this script and thought more than $.50 should be invested in making this horrible film. The plot is absolutely unbelievable. Since the movie has been out for over two years, I feel like I am at liberty to discuss what happened in the film. If you have not seen it, you might want to stop reading. However, whether or not you stop reading, the more important thing is that you don't waste one second of your life watching this film. It is a poor excuse for a big budget US picture. This could actually be one of the worst scripts ever written.So back to the plot. So after ""BIG"" has been together with Carrie for years, saved her life, and is currently living with her, telling her during the movie as they lay in bed, how happy she makes him, etc. --- I am supposed to believe that despite all of that, BIG does something to Carrie, (no show at their highly publicized wedding with hundreds of people in the Church waiting), that is 100 times worse than what Jesse James did to Sandra Bullock. Are you kidding me? I don't think Jeffrey Dahmer would have the heart to no show and leave his best friend standing alone at the alter. And, why did this happen? Because Carrie misplaced her cell phone and BIG could not call her to say, ""Hey Carrie, it is still just me and you right?"" BIG would have showed up at the wedding, but he was parked outside trying to get Carrie's attention, but she did not see him. BIG would have gone through with the wedding and wanted to talk to Carrie, but Mirandoa stopped him????? Finally, my favorite part, when Carrie finds out BIG has left the wedding, he says ""I am not coming"" and then, as she passes out from the embarrassment in her beautiful dress, but BIG keeps talking, ""Carrie, Carrie, are you there""??????????????? Are you there? Hey, I am not coming to the wedding, but do you want to go to Time Square later? Did you see the Yankee game? Jeter was 4 for 5.This movie is totally unbelievable. It is 100% cliché, and adds nothing to a single character. Charlotte is still conservative. Miranda is up tight. The blonde girl likes to have lots and lots of sex.

Carrie I was OK with - I probably would have reacted worse if that had happened to me.But what REALLY got me is how they made Big into a big, whining cry- baby. ""Turn around, baby, let me see your face...."" ""I NEED to talk to you..."" ""It's just you and me, right?"" COME ON!!!! For me anyway, part of his charm was that extreme confidence he exuded!

Commenting on their looks just seems irrelevant since the series was based around them and they'd hardly be replaced for the film. As for why HBO decided to make the film at all thats a no brainer, SATC was a pretty safe bet for making money. As for the film itself, half the fun is seeing the clothes and accessories the girls get to wear, the fact that you're invested in how their lives are going (from watching the series presumably) is also a large factor in how much you're gonna enjoy the film. Sounds like you prolly didn't watch/hated the series and you just wanted to drag down the film for the sake of it. Seems your grapes are sour lol",Sex and the City
439,pendleton070109,I just did not really care for the movie,4,23 November 2011,"First of all I love the series, i own the series, and i have seen all of the episodes at least 10 times a piece. The movie had me on the edge of my seat..but sometimes not in a good way. The male characters, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? I love these characters and I personally didn't like how they were played out in the movie. The big plot of the movie is with Big feeling like Carrie's wants and needs with the wedding feels like a circus because he has already been married twice before and blah blah, well the whole time i was thinking ""umm oh well?"" If he really loved her like he said he did at the end of the series and it is 3 years later, and he still loves her...then why can he not just let her have the wedding of her dreams? She has never been married before so why can she not have the wedding of her dreams? And the way it ended with Big and her just going to the courthouse because that is something ""he wanted"" because oh goodness it would make him look bad if there was a big hoopla wedding again for him...how selfish. Why did Carrie even take him back anyway? After he embarrassed her like that? I know you can really love and be consumed by someone but damn...Here is my breakdown of the characters: Carrie- i can somewhat believe her performance even if it was kinda over-dramatic because of all she had been through with the Big character.Big- is the most selfish moron of the series, he says he only wants to be with Carrie and doesn't want to do the circus wedding, but he doesn't even think about what Carrie might want he cares more about his image apparently.Miranda- still the same character for the most part, but Carrie was right in the movie when Miranda had almost a whole year to tell her about what she told Big? She knew how much it meant to Carrie to know that piece of info I am sure.Steve- they wanted to throw the audience for a loop i guess making Steve the character to cheat. No one would have guessed his character would do anything like that, but what an asshole after everything they had been through together, like with his mom and the baby. I sort of hate in the movie they made his character have the affair.Charlotte- I don't think they really knew where to take her character since they knew realistically Harry would never leave her they just made her life seem perfect, and she was the ""mommy"" character to Carrie after everything.Harry- really didn't even have a character, just scenes with him having sex with Charlotte, and him talking to Carrie for one scene at the hospital, thats about it.Samantha- still the same character, thank god, she is conflicted with being a girlfriend opposed to her sleeping with random men, but doesn't she just eats to curve her cheating.Smith- WHAT THE HECK..is that the same actor? It has only been three years but that dude looks like he aged 20 years? He doesn't really have much of a part either.And OK i have to comment on Anthony and Stanford? They hated each other the series and now they are somewhat ""together"" or something? I was confused with that.All in all when the movie starts out it starts out perfect with the girls, then the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotion, then you end up exactly where you start again...",Sex and the City
440,Blondie13,Was Anticipating Way More,7,1 June 2008,"I am a huge fan of SATC and I have been since it came out. I have been waiting and waiting for the movie and I finally went and saw it last night! First off, I was pleased by the dialogue in the movie because I laughed quite a lot which is unusual for SATC because although I laughed some in the series it was never this comical which I enjoyed. Secondly, and most importantly, the part I was disappointed by: the whole mood of the movie!! If you are going to take a series such as SATC with such a HUGE fan base, the last thing they want to see for the last time is heartbreak the entire movie! Now, I realize they couldn't make it all hearts and flowers, but {SPOILER} having Steve cheat on Miranda {which I'm appalled by}, and Big not coming to the wedding are just HEART-WRENCHING!!!! And also, having Samantha leave Smith after all those years really sucked, I was hoping for a big finale change in Samantha!! One thing I was SO happy to see was Charlotte and Harry. They are just so perfect and having Charlotte get pregnant was such a perfect touch!! I am very pleased that they did not break up that happy family!IN CONCLUSION, since I am such a HUGE SATC fan, I am going to purchase the movie when it comes out and I don't think it was a huge let down because I did enjoy myself watching the movie, I just wished that when I was seeing Carrie,Samantha,Charlotte,and Miranda for the last time, it would have been a happier note through out. I did like the ending though because of course it was all happy love and hearts type of thing. It's just this movie made men look like they were destined to fail their women at some time, and that wasn't the message I was hoping to get :(",Sex and the City
441,ajspadafore,I was not disappointed,10,1 June 2008,"Until the opening credits rolled, I had no idea how much I missed Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, Samantha and New York. I felt the movie stayed very true to the characters, their words, actions, responses and continuing love and devotion to each other.I didn't care about the product placement. Or the gratuitous fashion show. Forget the money, fashion, shoes and handbags - yes, 99% of us couldn't come close to having all this - but how many of us have spent time in a coffee-shop holding a hand, offering a tissue and just being there for a friend? How many of us haven't been there ourselves? There isn't a woman alive who hasn't felt what these women feel, and so aptly bring to the screen. I laughed, I cried (a lot), and I saw what forgiveness can do for people who genuinely love each other. THAT was what this movie was about - and I loved it! I don't need to write a synopsis. If you're reading this, you've probably already seen the movie and have your own opinion. If you haven't gone yet, you deserve to enjoy every moment of it as the stories unravel. Yes, it was over two hours in length, and yes, it could have been longer. I missed seeing more of Harry (who still remains the Perfect Man) and Stanford, sadly under-utilized due to the storyline. And don't discount Jennifer Hudson's ""everywoman"" here.

They expected it to be something that S&TC never was. The movie was very loyal to the type of writing, character development, and (even yes) placement of fashion. Nothing was out of the ordinary that the HBO show didn't include in episodes.I read a review that someone said the writing wasn't well penned. Their biggest complaint was ""Charlotte had the line 'thanks for watching Lily while I was at my doctor's appointment'"". These ladies are real ladies, and I doubt most people would make a superfluous statement if they could say something simply.Simply put, fans of the show who are not expecting some grand, remade, completely different movie will appreciate this.

It takes a mature view in that not everyone is supposed to have the fairy tale wedding (Carrie), not every career woman is going to balance work, family, husband, and PTA meetings effortlessly (Miranda), not every glamorous relationship is all glitter all the time (Samantha).

For people who have been with the show since the first episode premiered on HBO, this movie is a must see! All of the characters are back, full of sass and, if you can imagine it, with some outfits that raise the level of Feld's fashion eccentricity.One thing is definitely clear - SJP says it every time, the clothes and the city are are as much characters in the show as any of the actresses are - this is exactly true for the film as well.

The movie is a great follow up to the series. It clues us in on the evolution of our four favorite NYC gals and helps to shed light upon the fact that life does not end after 40. The group mentality of thought that you're destined to put on weight, become unattractive, lose your flair for style and become depressed after turning 40, can finally be put to rest with this movie. The women who are now coming into their 40's and 50's are a new generation of super spirited women who are defining a new way of being. I loved watching every second of those 40 something faces on the big screen...so much beauty that goes beyond the physical...inner lights that transcend the physical. I'm excited to go to the movies again.",Sex and the City
448,donnapaz,Ugh. What a shipwreck.,1,2 June 2008,"Like many of the others, I am a huge fan of the series (I own all the DVDs and have watched each episode multiple times).The translation to big screen just.doesn't.work.There was so much melodrama and fake crises! The male characters were like shadows of themselves. Big was like an avuncular sugar-daddy at the beginning and devolved into a limp-wristed dweeb by the time he thwarted Carrie.And Carrie was a shrill, melodramatic idiot who ultimately gets what she deserves. What intelligent, independent woman in her right mind would go back to the jackass who screwed you over multiple times? Why can't she just be independent? That always bothered me about the series finale.Miranda seems melodramatic and overreacts to Steve's indiscretion -- which comes out of nowhere and feels like a poorly timed plot device.Smith, who is starting to weather like Clint Eastwood, came off as way-too-casual when Samantha gave him her decision. He acted like such an airhead surfer-dude, which was never apparent in the series.Stanford and Anthony were like caricatures of themselves. Oh, we have a wedding, let's work in the flaming wedding planner! And didn't he and Stanford dislike each other? Why were they palling around like best girlfriends?I thought it was curious that Carrie's friends all showed up to help her pack her apartment, but they were nowhere to be found when the unpacking was being done. What kind of friends are those?The only redeeming acting came from Kim Catrall and Kristen Davis. They are totally comic pros and I enjoyed their schtick, even if it was silly. They at least pulled it off. As for Parker and Nixon, they acted like a couple of shrill witches when scorned. Ugh.",Sex and the City
449,b_hennessy,A Hopeful Romantic Comedy with Morals,10,4 June 2008,"Watching this movie made me both laugh and cry, and it even made me ponder the inner-fabric of all types of relationships: sexual, friendships, and much more. The characters worked through their problems in such a way that it gives me hope for myself and the relationships I have with my friends! At the end of the trailer, you hear ""You need friends to help you get through it all!"" That is so true! I have seen a few snippets of the TV show, but not enough to get an idea for the movie! Since the movie was awesome, I have reason to believe the show is also awesome, which I'm dying to watch! I found that every character was interesting. Carrie is just your average glamor girl, showing off her fashionable attire, who wishes to do everything with herself in mind. Samantha loves to color...uh...I mean have sex, and secretly watches the guys she finds attractive. She tries to find the meaning of love, but never actually finds it! Charlotte is happily married to Harry, and has a child and runs and enjoys her life. Charlotte is the girl who tries to keep a positive outlook on the situation at hand. And finally Miranda is the troubled working mom who's married to Steve. Miranda must go to extreme lengths to find her lost love for her husband after he cheats on her due to feeling neglected. Mr. Big is the guy in the back of the room surveying the land, having doubts, and gets worried he's making the wrong decision. The characters represent the people of today, holding friendship like glue.Some of the material might offend some, but the messages offered throughout the movie are quite worthy of watching. The biggest message talked about and seen is that we should forgive others. In almost every bad relationship throughout the movie, we see the characters having to forgive their significant other. The other meaningful message I picked up on is the use of labels and the idea of labeling throughout the movie. In the beginning of the movie, we hear Carrie mention that people come to New York for the fashion and the labels. In the end of the movie, she states that labels aren't important, and that you should be more interested in the person rather than their label. Forget the labels, and be friends with everyone you possibly can. The world would be a lot more united that way, wars would end, and the world would improve, and not suck.I hope the show, which I am now dying to watch, has more valuable worthy messages to offer!",Sex and the City

I loved seeing the girls back together.Yes, I agree there were some sappy moments, but after all that's what women want. Good movie, made me feel! Happy, sad, mad, surprised, shocked......!!!!! Wow, what a ride. Definitely worth going to the movies. I usually wait for DVD to be released, but this was nice in the theater, especially when we all screamed together!!! Connection.....Ahhhh.

I was apprehensive about it, but essentially the movie is like one long episode which I didn't have a problem with. I thought the ending was anti-climactic but that was okay since the rest of the movie was really good. Also I think that leaves it open ended for another movie perhaps.I do wish that Samantha's story line would've been expanded on a little more because i liked it but at times it fell short.All in all I liked in and don't understand why it got such a low rating. The only think I can think is that the people reviewing it had never seen the show before.",Sex and the City
452,chelseas_bunz,The ultimate chick-flick,7,31 May 2008,"After hearing the complaints of so many fans that this movie was a real disappointment, I must say I disagree. Sure it was a frivolous, fashion-filled fantasy picture, but I can't remember the last time I saw a chick flick that I actually enjoyed. It was so great to see Samantha, Miranda, Carrie and Charlotte all get their happy endings, even if it seemed a little far fetched (though it didn't to me). I would have hated the movie if I had to watch them all toast to their singlehood, yet again, as they push 50. If the story was just an indulgence, who cares? Indulge! The whole show is an indulgence really.Thats what made it so much fun to watch. I wish I was a fashionable New York socialite who gets to marry the love of her life in the end. But then again, I watched the show as much for the shoes as I did for the stories. Despite the rampant product placement (though the fashion ones have been there all along you know!), I still loved it. Though maybe its because I have a Mr.Big of my own to contend with. Hopefully my ending will be as happy as Carrie's. Oh yeah, and their clothes were AMAZING.",Sex and the City

I was expecting the worst after the saw all the reviews for the movie, but was not deterred and went to see the movie anyway. Definitely did not regret that decision!! My only negative is that the movie is not long enough! Its such a funny movie with so many great one liners throughout. The characters handle their dramas so admirably and their friendship is inspiring. If your a fashion buff you will not be disappointed with the crazy amount of wardrobe changes in this movie! Fall in love with your favorite SATC characters all over again in this movie. And watch out for Samanthas neighbor.. i wont say too much more but H.O.T!! Go see this movie with your closest girl friends! You wont regret it!! 10/10!",Sex and the City
454,carolynfrmich,Underrated,7,30 June 2014,"After seeing this several times I still liked it. The plot is a logical extension from where the series left off for each woman and quite humorous, The characters are true and I liked Carrie's assistant as played by Jennifer Hudson. The dialogue is often very clever-funny, i.e. Mexicoma and Pokipsied (sp?) in her pants; the clothes are great except for the bridal bird in her hair, the scenery is fabulous and it all wraps up nicely. So why do so many rate it lower? In my opinion it's dismissed because it is a Chick Flick. Just as I don't enjoy films with people beating each other up or fake monsters, I get why some guys don't enjoy this movie that much but that does not negate its quality. Most people don't like foreign movies just because they are foreign. Doesn't mean they aren't good. So if you liked the series, fashion, clever dialogue, beautiful scenery and/or tidy ends then this is a good movie to watch.",Sex and the City
455,willowsong3,Good closure for SATC fans,6,30 May 2008,"OK. So maybe it's not necessarily Oscar-worthy. And men would probably rather attend a book club meeting with their significant others and discuss Shakespeare than see this movie. That does not mean this movie is crap. As a die-hard fan of SATC, I was satisfied with the effort. I can say that the movie was NOT as good as the show itself was. Some of the acting really did seem a bit half-hearted and the whole thing looked like it was thrown together pretty fast (which is was) BUT... for a true fan, it brought closure to the series. The fashions were (in my opinion) fabulous as they always were, and I must applaud Jennifer Hudson for being a very convincing and kind character. Personally, I would not suggest a sequel movie. I think that this was enough. The ending was good, the girls were all still best friends, and everyone seemed to have grown into themselves a little. Let's leave it at that. This movie is NOT something that someone who has never seen SATC should see. It is a MUST for anyone who truly loved the series. As for anyone who is curious to see it, I'd really suggest familiarizing yourself with the characters before venturing to the theater or even before renting it in a few months.",Sex and the City

It's an amazing movie, and you will NOT be disappointed!

Fans of the non-butchered, original versions of the smash HBO series will be delighted with this film - which seems like an entire new season all wrapped into 2 hours and 15 minutes. Though the first 20 minutes is full of moments with ""idiot dialog"" (in order to fill in the clueless who aren't aware of certain character dynamics (like who Magda is, etc.)), the pace quickens and the ride is both fun and touching. Lots of laughs, lots of tears, lots of good shoes. Bravo! Just what I needed! With winks and nods to loyal fans throughout the entire film (cameos, costume pieces, lines of dialog, etc.), the movie almost plays like a love note to its loyal admirers. That said, I think new viewers will be able to jump right in and enjoy the ride. In addition to great performances by all four ladies, Jennifer Hudson is wonderful and fresh as Carrie's personal assistant.

And of course they are each others' support through it all.My girlfriends and I love love loved it.

I'd go see another one, too. The characters are so beloved by the fans at this point that a new movie should do equally as well.Acting: Cynthia Nixon was superb.

Sure, no one dies, no one is a ghost, no one does anything extraordinary. So what!? It's a pleasant movie that contains shoes, clothes, drinks and naked men. Have we forgot how to enjoy simple things? Not all movies need the shock factor à la Sixth Sense and such. It's there, 4 girls, their love lies, their disappointments, their joy. I don't really get what everyone was expecting? The film is hilarious yet manages to handle delicate problems (because love CAN be a problem, is not all about death and diseases, you know?) in a humorous and emotional way. Sure, no aliens involved, but what the hell!? Ten stars for the entertainment value. Which was its purpose, in the end. Go see it!!!",Sex and the City

462,sarahjessicaparkeractress,10/10,10,2 October 2016,"Fans of ""Sex and the City"" will love the movie version. Like the HBO series that gave birth to it, the movie is lots of fun, but it's no frivolous romp. The show's great ambition, always present, becomes even more pronounced in the movie - to document the emotional life and values of cosmopolitan women of a particular generation. It's as if its creators realized the series' significance over the course of its run, and that shift in the direction of importance - subtle, but definite - continues with this movie. Under the levity, there's a core seriousness about presenting these women's lives, one emphasized by the willingness of ""Sex and the City"" to grow and mature along with its characters. Those who know these characters will, of course, pick up on nuances and associations that novices will miss. Yet even viewers coming in cold will appreciate ""Sex and the City"" as the best American movie about women so far this year, and probably the best that will be made this year. Indeed, at the rate Hollywood has been going, it may stand as the best women's movie until ""Sex and the City II,"" if that ever comes along. Coming in, Michael Patrick King, the movie's writer-director, had two difficult tasks: He had to introduce the characters to a new audience without irritating fans of the show, and he had to take a series that ended perfectly and un-end it, without seeming arbitrary. He knocks off the first task easily, (re-)introducing the principals during a credits sequence narrated by the main character, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), a best-selling author in New York City. There's Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), a successful publicist with a ravenous sexual appetite. There's Charlotte York (Kristin Davis), a gentle, princess-like wife and mother. And there's Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), a lawyer and buttoned-down cynic, living in Brooklyn with her husband and son.Un-ending the perfectly ended series takes a little more time. For the first 10 minutes or so, the movie hovers in place, emphasizing (and, for first-timers, introducing) the status quot. But then, the gears gradually move into place. Four years have passed. Carrie is still seeing ""Mr. Big"" - whose name is now revealed to be John James Preston (Chris Noth) - and the two decide to get married. This soon turns into plans for the fashion marriage of the century, with a guest list of 200 and a gown by Vivienne Westwood. But, of course, things can't happen too smoothly. Meanwhile, Samantha is dissatisfied with her life in Los Angeles, even though she is still in love with her much-younger boyfriend, Smith (Jason Lewis), and Miranda and her impossibly sweet husband, Steve (David Eigenberg), are having marriage trouble. Though the laughs are frequent and the movie sparkles with glitz and fashion, an air of middle-aged disappointment is sometimes present, a realization of limits, of having to choose between imperfect options. Suddenly, the women are most definitely in their 40s, and so their interaction with younger women is different, sometimes long-suffering, sometimes almost motherly. Carrie takes on a personal assistant (Jennifer Hudson, who's charming) and gives her sisterly advice, the hard- earned wisdom of 20 years in the New York trenches. The mature vibe shows that ""Sex and the City"" is elastic and capable of bringing in new elements of women's experience. It clocks in at a hefty 145 minutes, but all that means is that it's like watching five episodes of the TV show in succession. Think of it not as a long movie but as the equivalent of an entire TV season muscled into one big mega dose. The allotment of screen time never seems obviously apportioned, but each actress gets a chance to shine. Charlotte's life is the most stable in this installment, but Davis has some of the best comic moments, and Cattrall shows a slight mellowing (and a definite deepening) in Samantha. As Miranda, Nixon is just brilliant, presenting her as someone increasingly locked into the patterns of her own personality, less hopeful and verging on bitterness. At the same time, underneath it, she's painfully sensitive. Parker is lovely, alive to every nuance of feeling, her face the film's locus of meaning. Her lack of vanity is becoming. When Carrie gets beaten up emotionally, Parker allows herself to look beat up. In one's 40s, a person doesn't take an emotional beating and wake up the next morning looking as fresh as a 20-year-old. Parker lets us see Carrie's, and her own, true face. There's something alive here. There's a feeling about this movie, that it's not some perfunctory cinematic appendix to a popular series, but the beginning of a whole new string of films. There's certainly no artistic reason ""Sex and the City"" can't be the women's equivalent of ""Star Trek,"" with human emotion being the final frontier. Like outer space, that frontier is infinite.",Sex and the City

Then I laughed some more until I cried again. Anyone who felt a kinship to any one of the characters on the show will love this movie. You remember how liberating it felt to watch SATC on HBO for the first time? You saw a little of yourself in one or more of the characters. It's okay to admit it to yourself. No one has to know. Let the SJP-hating men write all the horrible reviews they want.

I never watched the television program myself but felt connected to the characters and became hooked to the story. Many people who have seen the film or the t.v series have said that the S.A.T.C four feel like friends to them, this must say something about the writers and actors of this film if people are feeling personally connected to the characters in this film.Over all a fantastic effort and i am off to see it again this weekend.",Sex and the City

I didn't want the movie to be exactly like the show. It has been four years since the end of the series and, like my life, the lives of the characters have changed. Four years in the life of an adult is a long time and lots of things change. I thought the way the relationships developed and the way things were tied up were not only intelligent, but appropriate in the context of how these people live their lives. The quit wit, sexiness, sassiness and glamour were all still present, but so was a sense of urgency among the characters of how their lives were going to go next.

The story was pointless even for this genre and wouldn't have taken more than an hour to write. The unique feeling in the series was not even close to appear in the movie. I hope that I will be able to keep watching the series after this. The horrible music and all the product placement of various brands, with tedious and flat-minded scenes thrown in the mix made it almost impossible to sustain throughout the entire movie.

469,egakli,My opinion after just seeing the film,7,28 May 2008,"i've just seen the film i've been waiting 4 whole years to see and what can i say? When you'e built something up SO much u have to expect to be let down a little bit. First of all the film was VERY long!! i actually felt myself wondering when it was going to end. And secondly from the press reviews, although they didn't give much away in content, they did say expect some big surprises. i don't think that Carrie loving Big and expecting a big fancy wedding with him, only for him to let her down AGAIN is much of a surprise. Plus haven't we already seen the bit where he realises his faults and goes to find her in the last episode of series six?? How many times can he crush her for her to say ""enough is enough!!"". Like Miranda does to Steve i am going to write a list of pros and cons about the film. PROS: a) the clothes!! b) the fab four back on screen c) Jenifer Hudson was pretty fab as the assistant d)the gorgeous wedding dresses Carrie wore on the vogue shoot e) Samantha's wit f) little Lily and as ever Anthony Marintino (sic) g)the music especially Old Lang Syne CONS: a)I wish something really heart-wrenching had happened , perhaps Big dying or being in an accident? b) Miranda doesn't smile hardly at all c) Why does Carrie really need an assistant, how lazy is she? d)Stanford has hardly any lines e) Smith looks old and not as hot f) Big just seems a bit dull g) There are no really hilarious sex scenes, or hilarious sex talk and Samantha never has sex!!!! h)Carrie looks really bad with dark hair (i know the darkness of the hair is mimicking the darkness of her mood but it looks bad!!) i)Nothing remotely bad happens to Charlotte, and I just didn't find it funny when she shat herself. All in all i would say it was good but by no where near as good as the series (although maybe better than series five).

471,everteden,The first chick flick with serious themes,9,4 June 2008,"This is the first out-and-out frothy chick flick I've seen that actually attends to serious issues.Not that you'd know this from any of the reviews. Not a single review of this movie actually reviews the movie. They review the phenomenon instead.This ultimate chick flick takes on an ultimate human theme: forgiveness.It is about how horrible men can be, and that it is up to women to learn to forgive them, instead of being horrible right back -- in order to give the woman-man thing a chance to work. The horribleness and weakness and brutal blindness of men have placed women in charge of the tenor and texture of all relationships: so how should they act out this responsibility, which is universally shirked by men? This is the theme of the Carrie and Miranda stories. Both women come in for shabby treatment from their men, and both learn to forgive for the sake of continuing a loving relationship.The Samantha story has a theme as substantial as the forgiveness theme: self-sacrifice. Is it right for one partner in a relationship to submerge an independent self to the needs of the other, so much so as to obliterate that self? In this case, it's specifically about whether a woman should invest herself so much in a man's success, that she cannot live out her own life as demanded by her own nature. It's totally ironic that the self-centered sexual predator Samantha struggles with self-sacrifice this time around; she's the last person from the TV series you'd expect to be in such a quandary.These subjects  forgiveness and self-sacrifice -- are big and serious. Yes, under the enjoyably shallow, shiny, sparkly surface of ""Sex and the City: The Movie"" beats a deeply serious commitment to tackle fundamental gender issues. But the surface is so successfully shiny -- what with fashion shows and a Mexican outing and parades of wedding dresses and nifty repartee -- that all the reviewers have looked no further than that surface.Why? Quite frankly, it's yet another telling sign of the abiding misogyny in our culture. Hey, chick flicks are about women, so they can't be serious, or deserving of serious discussion. Our misogyny is so deeply ingrained, even female reviewers  even the highly intelligent Manola Darghis of the New York Times -- exemplify this besetting affliction, and fail to recognize the point of the movie.Here we have a narrative in which the two main plots are about two women who have been mortally wounded by the actions of their lovers and reject them for it, but learn to come to terms with the fact that they love their fellows despite their guy-typical crappiness, and would rather forgive them than punish them  and our movie pundits ignore the whole story, idea and meaning of the film. It's as if Moby Dick was reviewed without mentioning the whale. It reminds one of the sexist misogyny that dogged Hillary's presidential campaign.The point of the movie is encapsulated most powerfully in a super-hot, very explicit sex scene. In the conclusion to the Miranda story, we see a sexual position in which the flawed man does everything humanly possible to give his woman satisfaction -- he screws her and manipulates her clitoris and nipples all at the same time. The man who done her wrong is now doing everything he can to do her right.If I were Michael Patrick King, the brilliant writer-director (is he gay or straight? my guess is gay; no straight man could be this perceptive), I would be incensed by the reviews, which have totally ignored the blatantly obvious point of the movie's very existence. Shame on you, reviewers.",Sex and the City
472,liisatherockstar,"Difficult to pull off TV move to big screen, but translation handled well by SATC.",10,27 May 2008,"Being a fan of the series for years, I had pretty high expectations for this film. I was not disappointed by what I saw, and most other SATC fans I've talked to agree with me. The film jumps ahead 3 years in the characters' lives, and then intertwines the stories of the four women throughout the course of a year, as they each come to terms with the ending they found at the series' completion. I liked this approach, because it demonstrated the longevity (or lack thereof) of the happy endings the characters attained. The girls are translated well into film--I didn't feel like any of the 4 was rewritten or misrepresented from her role on the show. The male counterparts were all present--Big, Steve, Harry, Smith, Stanford, etc. The movie doesn't spend as much time on them as they do the trials of the female characters, naturally, and no relationship is depicted as closely as Carrie and Big's. I found the plot to be compelling and heartfelt and the female characters just as flawed and human and funny as they'd always been. And, of course, it wouldn't be SATC without the staples of designer bags and shoes, classic cocktails, and of course, a splash of nudity.",Sex and the City
473,e_763,See it with your girlfriends...,8,27 May 2008,There's tons of laughs.. As for the fashion....Patricia Fields did a great job as always with mixing colors and styles together... The movie is about forgiveness.. having friends helping you move forward.. In order to really enjoy this movie.. I recommend going with your girlfriends and make it a girls' night out... with all those guy flicks coming out.. this is much needed for us.... but I do advice that the movie did feel long and there's a lot of scenes that were cut out.. Stanford wasn't present as much... I really wish they gave him more... I know my guy friends will love the Sushi scene with Samantha... I don't get what was going on with the pudding scenes... How could one go to Mexico and only survive by eating pudding... I think that's what really gave Charlotte the diarrhea and not the water...lol... in the end.. there's a happily ever after with Big and Carrie being together... the series was better though.. but the movie is a great addition... perhaps you could add another sequel to this movie... but I think they should leave it how it is now...,Sex and the City
474,stykerforce,I loved it!!!,10,1 September 2008,"It was fun, flirty and fabulous! I watched every episode and the movie topped it off just right! I went on the Sex and the City tour and I have tons of SATC nostalgia including several autographs from seeing them during the filming of the movie in NYC!!! The ladies make everything just so in your face and funny and light hearted. I used to live in NYC and watching the show and the movie just makes me smile because I have so many memories of so many places that are in the movie and the show... it was very comforting to me :) The outfits were great, the punchlines were even greater and of course you can't get better actresses!",Sex and the City
475,tootiebean,A wonderful catch up with the girls,10,4 June 2008,"I love that males get so heated up about a movie that isn't even aimed at them. This was a great movie for women to shine and revel in all that is girlie. Even at 24 years of age, I connect to these women and the happenings in their lives. For those who LOVED SATC as a show, this is a wonderful catch up with those ladies that made it OK to be girlie AND powerful. For those just stopping in for the first time, it is still a beautiful story and may make you want to go back to watch the series on DVD. It is about darn time that women get a chance in the spotlight and one's that aren't airbrushed, augmented, and ditsy (another reason this isn't sitting to well with the male population, perhaps?) As an avid SATC fan for years, this movie was everything I hoped it could be and more. I laughed, I cried, and then I did it all over again.",Sex and the City
