0,bkoganbing,The 10 Day Time Limit,6,20 March 2010,"How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days is both the film title and what Kate Hudson has pledged to do as research for an article for a women's magazine she works for. Not that she wants to write this tripe, but it's what is expected of her at the magazine she works for. Their readers don't want serious political stuff like what she wants to do.She picks as the object of her love 'em and lose 'em experiment, one Matthew McConaughey who is an advertising writer and quite the player. And wouldn't you know it, he's got a bet on with his alpha male pals that he can keep a woman on a string for 10 days.But as films like these inevitably go, the two actually fall for each other, unexpected consequences for the leads, but hardly for the movie-going public.McConaughey and Hudson register well as the leads and their scenes do have some tenderness and some bite when it's appropriate. But when she's on the screen, Kate's boss Bebe Neuwirth steals the film. If you thought Meryl Streep was a tough woman to work for in The Devil Wears Prada, check Neuwirth out here.Best scenes in the film for the leads are Hudson and McConaughey at a Knicks game and later at his apartment where he's prepared a sumptuous meal. She does some really great stuff to turn him off.How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days is a pleasant romantic comedy, nothing terribly special about it, but fans of the leads won't be disappointed.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
1,SnoopyStyle,attempt at a rom-farce,5,6 September 2014,Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) writes fluff for Composure magazine and longs for more substantive articles. She has a work friend Jeannie (Annie Parisse). Her other flustered friend Michelle Rueben (Kathryn Hahn) is the inspiration for a new article for her boss Lana Jong (Bebe Neuwirth) 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'. Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) is an advertising executive competing with co-workers Judy Spears (Michael Michele) and Judy Green (Shalom Harlow) for the right to pitch the biggest diamond merchant. Spears and Green know about the article. They come up with a contest to have Benjamin seduce Andie in 10 days for the right from their boss Phillip Warren (Robert Klein) to do the pitch.The problem for this rom-com is that both parties are faking it. It makes it hard to decipher any real chemistry in the relationship. It's not until Andie meets the family does the romance starts. It's a very late start. They are good at their jobs and pull it off. However there is a real need for both of them to sacrifice something to push the romance over the top. The comedy part has some good points. The problem there is that it feels very one directional. It's all about Andie annoying Ben. It would be better if Ben actually had a deeper game. He's very superficial. He needs the girl but it seems like he's just not bringing the whole playbook. He needs to show that he's really trying rather than passively taking it from Andie. It's an attempt at something different than the traditional rom-com but it's not all together successful.,How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
2,claudio_carvalho,A Very Funny Romantic Comedy,7,7 December 2003,"Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) writes a column in a female magazine about shallow subjects. She indeed was a great student of journalism and wants to have a chance of writing serious matters about politics, environment and economics. Her editor promises her that if she writes a successful article about how to lose a guy in ten days, she would write about whatever she wants. Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughey) is an advertising executive who wants to get the account of a huge diamond company, but two other  colleagues (and beautiful) women are disputing this account with him. He offers a bet to his chief and two colleagues competitors: he would conquest any woman and after ten days, she would fall in love and go with him to the initial campaign party for the client. The two girls had been introduced to Andie a few moments ago and knew about her article, so they suggest Andie to Ben. Ben accepts and dates with Andie. From this moment on, there are many funny situations with them. Andie does anything possible and impossible  to imagine to make Ben give-up on her. And Ben supports all those evil and humiliates situations, because he needs the presence of Andie in the party with him. Obviously, the rest of the plot is very predictable, and Andie and Ben fall in love for each other. The screenplay of this movie is really funny and this movie is a good entertainment. My vote is seven.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
3,kosmasp,Gain and lose,8,25 May 2021,"I might get weak when it comes to romantic comedies lately ... but then again, I do like to believe this is a good one! Like some other really good romantic comedies this tells a neat little story. It may be filled with cliches and it may be predictable (I mean, if you don't know where this will end up - not just by looking at the poster, then I don't know what to tell you) ... but it is quite fun! And one of the aspects that is helping a lot - the actors! Really well cast, not just our two main characters but those around them.And the movie does not take itself too seriously, making fun of both genders and their ""tropes"". Also some inside jokes that you may get (Goldie Hawn is the mother of Kate Hudson - so the joke in the cinema is actually quite hillarious - but it doesn't matter if you get it or not - it's still a great little comedy you are about to watch) ... So if you don't hate romantic comedies, you will enjoy this a lot! Hopefully you don't see yourself in one of the characters in their worst moment(s)",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
4,jboothmillard,How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,3,31 May 2009,"From director Donald Petrie (Grumpy Old Men, Richie Rich, My Favourite Martian, Miss Congeniality), I had idea of what to expect in this romantic comedy, so I tried it. Basically advertising executive Benjamin 'Ben' Barry (Matthew McConaughey) makes a bet with two female co-workers at the diamond company he works for, that he can make a woman fall in love with him within ten days, and he is thinking of diamond promotion in the process. Fashion magazine journalist Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) also has a bet on that she can meet a guy, and get rid of him within ten days, and she gets to write about whatever she wants if successful. So Ben is trying to make her love him, and Andie is doing everything possible to get him to dump her. To be honest, I think the one making the most effort is Andie, being the most bitchy, irritating and over emotional girlfriend possible, and Ben is struggling to put up with it for his bet. Of course, eventually they both find out each others bets, and split, with Andie getting to write what she wants, about fashion, which she refuses, and Ben realises she is making a mistake moving away, and of course they love each other, so all is settled in the end. Also starring Adam Goldberg as Tony, Michael Michele as Spears, Shalom Harlow as Green, Bebe Neuwirth as Lana Jong, Robert Klein as Phillip Warren and Kathryn Hahn as Michelle. Hudson does well as the deliberately irritating girlfriend, and McConaughey is alright playing his usual ""Mr. Nice Guy"" character, but I can agree they don't have much chemistry, and it does lose its humour in parts.

5,paul_haakonsen,And that's how it is done...,6,23 December 2015,"Is this one of those stereotypical romantic comedies that basically follow every single point of the 'how-to-make-a-romcom'? You bet it is. Did it work? Sure it did, especially if you enjoy the sappy romantic comedies.And oddly enough, this is the second movie with Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles. Could it be because of their on-screen chemistry? Because there is no denying it that they really do compliment one another on the screen.The story is about Andie and Ben who start a relationship under very different pretenses. Ben is a ladies' man who makes a bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in just ten days, while Andie is a writer for a magazine on an assignment to come up with a way of how to lose a guy in just ten days.This is the classic tale of opposites attract and the stereotypical attract, push away and come to realize that what was supposed to be a non-romantic and emotionally committing turn out to be the one and only thing.Much can be said about the genre, but every now and then a movie does turn out to be watchable without sugar-coating everything in its path.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
6,michaelRokeefe,What would you do for love?,3,8 October 2004,"Here is a romantic comedy that drips with silliness. Andie Anderson(Kate Hudson)is the ""How To"" columnist for Composure Magazine and her 'ice queen' boss(Bebe Neuwirth)assigns her to write an article about how to hook a guy and then lose him in ten days. It so happens that the seemingly gullible fellow turns out to be Benjamin Barry(Matthew McConaughey), an egotistical advertising exec trying to land a big money ad campaign for diamonds. In order to get the chance to pitch his ideas, he makes a bet with his boss(Robert Klein)that he can find a girl and have her fall in love with him in ten days and will prove it by bringing her to a swanky dinner party. Both feel they have accomplished using the other; but the ten whirlwind days of quirky romance has the two falling in love for real. If you are not in the right mood this movie will drive you nuts. One thing for sure...cutie pie Hudson can wrap you around her little finger. Also in the cast are: Michael Michele, Kathryn Hahn and Adam Goldberg.

7,sunwarrior13,How To Lose A Movie In 100 Minutes,6,14 September 2012,"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a romantic comedy film that stars Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. It is loosely based on the self-help book of the same name (subtitled The Universal Don't of Dating) written by Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long.The movie was directed by Donald Petrie.Andie (Hudson) is a young journalist who longs to cover political stories, but in the meantime she finds herself writing for a women's magazine called Composure, where her editor Lana Jong has her writing a fluffy advice column. After hearing of the latest dating laments of her relationship-challenged friend Michelle, Andie sells Lana on the idea of writing a piece on the things women do to alienate the men they love, which she'll demonstrate by winning and then driving away a man in a mere ten days. Meanwhile, Ben (McConaughey) is an advertising man who wants to land a prestige diamond account at his firm. Ben is competing with his pals, Spears and Green, for the assignment, so Ben tells his boss Phillip Warren that he's the man for the job because he understands the fair sex so well he can make any woman fall for him in less than two weeks. As fate would have it, Andie and Ben end up choosing one another for their mutual assignments, with neither knowing about each other's secret agenda as Ben strives to hold on to Andie while she does everything in her power to annoy him.The bad thing about this movie is that it is far from realistic.Both Ben and Andie tried to be awful with one another and yet they fall for each other.Why?What's the reason for them to fall for each other when they were certainly creeps with one another for most part - 100 minutes - of the film? The only reason I could think of is the requirements of the plot especially for a chick flick and a romantic comedy at that.Also,the premise looks good on the screenplay but it was poorly executed in the movie as it looks absolutely implausible.Also,there was an apparent lack of chemistry between the lead stars - Hudson and McConaughey.The only good thing about them is that they are pleasing to the eye and good to look at in the entire movie.And most of all,it relied heavily on clichés and contrivances that are preeminent on romantic comedies.It should have relied on jokes and laughs for it to be more effective instead of the reason stated in the previous sentence.Finally,the game of ""Bullsh*t"" was played towards the end of the movie.Instead of that crude humor being used for them to get together,the writers should have been a little more creative than that.The conclusion just looked empty and fabricated in the end.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
8,preppy-3,Has its moments,6,24 February 2003,"Andy (Kate Hudson) is a columnist for a woman's magazine--to cheer up a depressed, jilted girlfriend she proposes an article on getting a guy to love her--and then do everything wrong to get him to dump her in 10 days. Ben (Matthew McConaughey) is an ad executive who wants to do a campaign for diamonds. His boss says no--what does a man know about love and diamonds? Ben says he will get a woman to fall in love with him--in 10 days. Guess what happens.There are two problems with this movie--the script and McConaughey. The script isn't believable for one second and it has such unpleasant characters--are we supposed to feel sympathetic to Andy and Ben who would stoop to manipulating an innocent person for their jobs? Also it does have some very funny lines but has even more unfunny, labored ones. McConaughey is all wrong for a romantic comedy--he is very handsome and has a great body but he seems very ill at ease with the material. He both overacts and underacts and has no sense of comic timing. And him and Hudson have about as much chemistry as Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis had in ""Top Gun""--meaning no chemistry at all. Their kisses looked painful.The real reason to see this is Hudson. She's beautiful, bright, energetic and one hell of an actress and comedian. She's absolutely hysterical when she tries to drive McConaughey crazy. Also when she begins to fall in love (I don't think I'm giving anything away) she's totally believable.Worth seeing for Hudson and some great lines. Otherwise--routine.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
9,Uriah43,A Decent but Predictable Rom-Com,5,26 April 2017,"""Andie Anderson"" (Kate Hudson) is a journalist for a magazine that basically caters to a female audience. One day while helping her friend overcome a recent breakup she comes up with the idea for an article that focuses on certain mistakes some women make while dating that effectively destroy intimacy. To that end, she proposes to begin dating a complete stranger and in the process use certain tactics which are sure to cause the man to abruptly end their relationship within 10 days-and then write an article detailing everything. However, as luck would have it, she selects a man named ""Ben Barry"" (Matthew McConaughey) who just happens to have a bet with his boss that he can pick up a woman at random and in 10 days have her fall madly in love with him. The end result is that no matter how hard she tries he resists all of her efforts to get him to break up with her. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, despite a decent effort by everyone involved, the film itself ultimately ended up as a routine and predictable rom-com and I have rated it accordingly.

10,mm-39,Entertaining comedy,8,13 July 2003,Spoiler!I didn't know what to expect from this film.  It was great.  Matthew should do more comedies.  They had a card game in this film which based itself on being able to read people.  Sometimes people portray what they are really not.  It takes a talented person to be able to see through all that hoopla. Many of the things the woman did in the film were annoying and psychotic. They were using each other and in the end it worked against them for the one thing that was unexpected.8/10,How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

The games that Kate Hudson,(Kate Anderson) played with this guy in order to simply win his heart and at the same time, do everything she could to make him completely hate her and leave. However, the guy wanted basically to do the same thing, however, I don't know how he could have kept his patience with all the things that Kate Anderson did to him. Kate even gave his Private Member a name and had him go get a soda during a Nets game and missed out on all the action plays. This is a great comedy and all the actors gave great supporting roles.

My step mom loves chick flicks, so if she wants to watch a movie, I have to watch her type of flick. Well, I had the gracious pleasure of watching ""How to loose a guy in 10 days"". While the movie has more than a few cute moments, it was a little too bubbley for me. I did laugh in some moments, but the movie was just not for me. The ending was predictable, you have to admit. But Kate Hudson is adorable and Matthew is wonderful to watch. For chick flick fans, I highly recommend. Even if you are not one, I'd still recommend a peek. It's not that bad to watch.

13,=G=,Romcom by rote,5,3 July 2003,"""How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" is a little bit of contempo fluff for the 13-24 demographic which bets heavily on the popularity of the two protags, Hudson and McConaughey. The flick's premise has a built in problem as it requires both protags to act uncharacteristically during most of the run thereby making the superficial character development even more superficial. Sorely lacking the creative department and with nothing going for it save Hudson's over-worked smile and McConaughey's overworked suavity, there's little to praise in this very average romcom which is sure to make broadcast in a heartbeat.

14,disdressed12,two likable leads overcome lack of originality,7,7 June 2007,"first let me say that there is not too much in the way of originality in this film.however,instead of being targeted to the teen crowd,this one has a more mature demographic,which is refreshing if nothing else.i won't bore you with the details,since i'm sure you can figure it out pretty easy.normally,i'd say this is a typical movie in the rom/com genre.except for one thing.the twp leads (Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey)are very likable.of course,Kate Hudson's always great,in my opinion.there is some great chemistry between her and McConaughey,so you can't help but root for them.the ending of course,is predictable,but it is fun getting there.everything considered,""How to Lose a Guy in 10 days"" rates a 7/10 from me.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
15,sddavis63,Predictable With A Few Laughs Throw In Along The Way,6,10 August 2003,"I had heard good things about this movie. ""Hilarious,"" I was told. Well, not quite. It has a few chuckles along the way but for the most part I thought this was a pretty routine account of two people having to overcome obstacles to fall in love, etc., etc. Nothing really unique in the premise, in other words. Kate Hudson plays ""Andie,"" a woman's magazine columnist who is writing a column about the mistakes women make in dating and is getting her material by picking out a guy, getting him to fall for her and then making all the mistakes to drive him away. Unknown to her, though, the guy she meets - ""Ben,"" played by Matthew McConaughey - also has an agenda. He's an ad executive who makes a bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days, and if he does, he gains a huge advertising contract. (Is it believable that an ad agency of any credibility would assign a contract that way?) So you have Ben and Andie working at cross-purposes. She's falling for him but has to drive him away; he's being driven nuts by her but can't let her go. And so it goes.It is amusing at times (sometimes downright funny, in fact.) But the whole premise of two people lying to each other had a rather nasty, mean-spirited feeling to it, which really comes out at the party when everything is discovered. Surprisingly, I found it a little bit dark as comedies go and just wasn't able to let myself enjoy it perhaps as much as some others have. That having been said, Hudson and McConaughey were absolutely perfectly cast for their roles. They were believable, and there was a real chemistry between the two of them which gave the movie a more realistic feel. But it really didn't leap out at me as I know it has some others. And with an ending that you see coming before you even start watching the movie (is there anyone who doesn't know how these funny romantic movies are going to turn out?) there really isn't any fun in the end; the only fun is the road you take to get there and that, I thought, had a few potholes along the way.Largely on the strength of Hudson and McConaughey, this movie gets a 6/10.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
16,cherold,"Half quite good, half truly awful",5,1 June 2004,"This movie is based on a book you can read in about 15 minutes that is simply a funny list of things women can do to alienate guys.  That's not a lot to base a movie on, and I thought the movie's central idea - a woman writing an article on how to lose a guy dating a man with a bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him - was fairly clever, although more clever in the telling than the execution.  The first half hour of this movie is quite dull, as the wheels are awkwardly set in motion.  Then the movie becomes very funny as Andie drags Benjamin to a Chick Flick marathon and destroys his poker game.  The getting-a-woman-to-fall-for-a-guy part is pretty much dropped; it seems to have just been there to give a reason for a guy to stay with a psycho chick other than the usual reason: sex.  The movie is funny for a good hour, until the movie decides it has to resolve its clunky set up.  The last half hour is truly, utterly painful: the ""You're So Vain"" is possibly the most poorly conceived and badly executed thing to ever appear in any romantic movie in the last hundred years.  While most of the movie's failings can be laid at the feet of the writers and directors, it should be noted that, for all their efforts, Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey fail to manage anything more than a sort of lukewarm chemistry.  Which would be fine in another sort of movie, but in something that wants to be a sparkling romantic comedy, chemistry is key.  Because an absurd romance only makes sense if the principals seem perfect together, which they don't.I would probably give the funny hour of this movie a 7, and the bad part a 2.  I'll give the overall effect a 5/10.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

I could see the ending from miles away but it's how the movie plays to the ending that affects whether this film is watchable or not. For the most part, it does work thanks to the charming leads of Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.Donald Petrie's film is basically a film about the battle of the sexes. The girl works for Cosmopolitan magazine and the guy works at a sports agency and they both hook up with each other despite each person is lying to the other.The acting is pretty good especially with the kind of script they have been given. McConaughey is always charming and does a good job while Hudson is actually likable for once and is remotely interesting.Overall, this is a good but very predictable rom com.

At the ensuing staff meeting, Andie's boss (Bebe Neuwirth) asks Andie about her next column. Having no concrete ideas, Andie decides to take up her fellow worker's dilemma that, perhaps, she drove her boyfriend away. How about a column called ""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days""?

Later, at a couples bar, Andie sets her eyes on ad agent Ben (Matthew McConaghay). But, unknown to her, he has just taken a bet from his staff that he can make any woman fall for him in a week's time. As they draw each other in, the stage is set for an epic battle of affection between Andie and Ben. Who will win? This is a very cute movie with great-looking stars in Kate and Matthew. Supporting them is a nice cast, also, including a most funny combination of Adam Goldberg and Thomas Lennon as Ben's best friends. Lennon, especially, is a most underrated performer, for his dry wit is terrific and steals scenes easily. Neuwirth is always a hoot, too, with Robert Klein on hand to please the audience as well. As for the costumes, they are especially lovely, and the NY setting, production values, script, and direction are above average, also.

Kate Hudson is just like her famous mother Goldie Hawn as they both have the same sarcastic dry humour which makes Hudson likeable. Matthew McConaghet used to be the king of romantic comedies before he ditched them for good in 2009 with Ghost Of Girlfriend Past and also would team up with Kate Hudson in the 2008 flick Fools Gold. Here in How to lose a guy in 10 Days he was charismatic and just dreamy.The chemistry between Hudson and McConnaghey was very good and the plot of the film was great.

The name of that piece is `How To Lose A Guy In 10 Seconds'. `How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days' is a giddy but formulaic romantic comedy starring Hollywood vanities Matthew Mcconaughey & Kate Hudson. Mcconaughey plays a cocky advertiser named Ben Barry. Big Ben places a wager that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. Hudson plays Andie Anderson, a fem-themed magazine scriber who writes a weekly `How To Lose.' articles. Her next reality assignment is = How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days. Now these two self-agenda dating gamers are off to the races. Andie does everything irritable imaginable to make the male species quiver with fear: furnishing Ben's apartment as a bunny festival, filling the bathroom with vaginal products , nicknaming Ben's penile instrument with a female name, and interrupting a guy's night out by actually showing up. Yes! Guys! This is one of the scariest films I have ever seen. Poor Ben has to undertake this torture so he could win his bet and make Andie fall in love with him in 10 days. Mcconaughey & Hudson did demonstrate screen chemistry. Hudson, who is strikingly beautiful, will make many male fans wish they can take a ride in that Hudson River. I did find the charm in `How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days' but I also found that it lost its luster. ***Average",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
30,Chris_Docker,Light hearted chick flick,7,5 May 2003,"I found this light-hearted romp reminiscent of situational comedies but Shakespeare or Oscar Wilde, although it lacked the depth of, say, My Best Friend's Wedding. But as a Saturday night low-brainer you could do a lot worse. Gorgeous bubbly blonde women's magazine writer gets off with successful advertising hunk. That's the slightly cheesy ending, but you've been entertained thoroughly by the time it gets to the predictable bit, so why not just gulp down the standard fruit-and-ice-cream finale as you move on to the nightclub after the cinema or whatever you're doing next. The bubbly blonde is Kate Hudson (from Almost Famous) and the hunk is Matthew McConaughey (from Wedding Planner). Watching her friend and colleague lose every date by doing all the wrong things, she offers to help out by writing a column on all the wrong things to do when dating a guy - things guaranteed to put him off. McConaughey, meanwhile, is pitching for a lucrative deal with a diamonds firm and boasts he can advertise anything, just like he can make 'any woman fall in love with him'. They call his bluff and offer him the contract if he can make any woman fall in love with him by the time of the presentation (his competitors subtly nudging him towards Hudson, who they know is writing the 'How to Get Dumped' article. The two devote themselves to each other for purely financial reasons but (surprise, surprise lol) fall in love anyway.

Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaghey have two different agendas about what to do in ten days-Hudson to drive a guy away and McConaghey to get a girl to fall madly in love with him. Of course, their plans go awry and chaos ensues. I liked it. The two stars had definite chemistry, and it was a likable chemistry. It was well written. I think there were many memorable scenes, such as the Knicks games and the black tie party. Hudson especially gave a terrific turn as the magazine writer who does her 10 day thing for a magazine article she is working on, and gives a good over-the-top performance. You might like it if you like the stars and this type of movie. See it for those.** 1/2 out of ****",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

In my opinion, Andie (Kate Hudson) and Ben (Matthew McConaughey) made a cute couple. When they kissed and embraced each other, I got all warm and tingly inside. To me, Lana (Bebe Neuwirth) was a funny lady. The moment I found out she was in this, I was very surprised. I just wish that the role she was cast in had been a more major one. If you ask me, David Sheehan was right. This is the ultimate chick flick for guys! Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good romantic comedy that will make you laugh and feel good to any Kate Hudson or Matthew McConaughey fan who hasn't seen it.

Then again, this film is so lame and predictable, the grinding of millions of males teeth could be heard in the theater like a sonic boom. Hollywood's excuse for putting out inoffensive tripe like this is yet another pathetic cry for help, one where the rehashing of ideas and plots and almost banal dialogue makes one wonder if the sanctity of foreign films without the subtitles will be the respective norm of escaping such garbage. This film also continues the rather lousy trend of trite chick-flick movies (I'm talking about Two Weeks Notice, Just Married, Deliver Us From Eva, and Maid in Manhattan) that mysteriously lead the box office. Perhaps the foreign film goers are right: American films are becoming a dull collection of clones and remakes. Here's an idea, instead of torturing captives and putting killers to death, make these individuals watch this film around the clock. Such inflicted pain will reform someone quickly and make any future terrorist squeal like a dirty pig.The only one being honest about the rehashing trend seems to be George Lucas, who knows his Star Wars saga is retreading familiar ground, and does little to dispel such ideas.

(spoilers),3,20 July 2005,"This movie, save one too many sexual innuendos, could just as well have been made in the bland 1950s era. Hollywood has churned out yet another boilerplate romance comedy with the leads playing their usual charming, but secretly altruistic (at least a secret to each other) characters who make a wager with friends that they, the self-appointed Casanovas, will be able to lure the other into a false relationship and get what they want out of it. And oh! What a coincidence, they actually wind up finding out that they're perfect together and fall in love, immediately torn apart when each discovers the other's initially fraudulent motives, before dismissing that for the sake of their love for each other. **Yawn!**Unfortunate for the viewers, not only does Hollywood (who keeps scratching their heads at plummeting box office figures) never get tired of making these movies (which do date back to the cinematic age of our grandparents who might've only enjoyed it then for the sake of the novelty of seeing movies), they also never add much of anything new. If you're in the mood for your standard romantic comedy gender war, then this one will probably suit you. If you've seen one, however, you've probably seen them all (at least within the mainstream).",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
38,triple8,light bubbly comedy,6,30 April 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: OK-I am the first to admit this movie had flaws. It was quite ridiculous in some areas and many scenes aren't as funny as they should be. It still warrants an above average rating though. This is mainly because of Kate Hudson. I doubt that had anybody else played this role I'd have tuned into this movie for more then 10 minutes. But she plays this role very well. Hudson has a naturally mischievous quality that lends itself well to a movie such as this and makes one want to watch. So I did.I think there were a few problems with this movie, one being some of the jokes become a little more obnoxious then funny and come very close to wearing out their welcome. There's also the problem that no matter which way you look at it, and no matter how unbelievable many romantic comedies are, these two people BOTH having bets going on simultaneously, is almost just to much. I think it would have maybe been better to just have Hudson involved in the whole bet thing and concentrate more on the wit factor.The other problem I had with 10 days, is the ending. I'm SO tired of all these romantic comedies ending the same way. One's about to leave town(usually the female) and then the male lead goes racing after her....I wish this movie hadn't done that, it's getting SO overdone, we get the same ending almost every time. The movie was somewhat creative, so I ask, couldn't a more creative, WITTY ending been used? They still could have wound up together just not in the same standard bland way!The movie's main positive was Hudson who made this occasionally laugh out loud hysterical. Some things WERE very funny and the wit came not just from the stunts Hudson pulled but from Hudson herself. Like her mother, Kate Hudson has a wonderful sense of comedic timing, great facial expressions and she had me roaring in some places. I loved the line where she says something similar to: ""I love you but I don't like you right now"", turns away and then mouths what she just said with an expression of utter befuddlement. That's just one example but the fact is, though this movie had some problems the movie makers hired the right leading lady and that's the main reason I'm giving this a 6 of 10. This is not going to go down as one of the greatest romantic comedies ever made (though I think it really could have been even funnier.) But for what it is it's not a bad way to spend some time. My vote is 6 of 10.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

My concepts of comedy obviously differ from the scriptwriters by a big margin. If you like cringing in your seat at truly awful dialogue and scenes then I suppose it is funny. But I just found it boring and tedious.The basic premise that a person would go out with someone only to try and lose them in short order was highly obnoxious. (Yes I know, its a comedy, but I still found this objectionable in the extreme.)In the end, I only watched the first half. I couldn't stomach any more. It was just too stomach-churningly dire.

She can't seem to play a three-dimensional character so she resorts to pretty much mugging for the camera - watch me make funny faces as I eat a hamburger, watch me giggle just like my Mom did thirty years ago. I'm sorry - but if Goldie Hawn wasn't her mom - she'd be lucky to get a dinner theatre part. Bebe Neuwirth and Adam Goldberg try their hardest but seem embarrassed to be in the movie.

60,Cedric_Catsuits,Hard to hate,3,7 May 2006,"I really thought I was going to hate this, and I tried hard to - unsuccessfully. The problem is the characters are so obnoxious you feel bad things should be happening to them. Instead it develops into a slushy, happy romance. McConaughey comes across as utterly arrogant and self-centred - impossible to like. Hudson just cannot convince as the manipulative columnist, or as a glamour girl. I loved her in 'Almost Famous', where her 'Penny Lane' was one of the most memorable characters of any movie I've ever seen. But I can't help feeling this needed a more extrovert player - someone like Brittany Murphy perhaps, who can tell a story just through facial expressions! Unfortunately I found myself being drawn into - and gradually developing an affection for this story. I still think it could have been done better, but after all's said and done I was quite impressed. Hudson definitely looks better - and more convincing - with curls and 'hippy' styling, so I'll forgive the occasional straight-hair and glamour relapses here. McConaughey however, always comes across as a bit too cocky to be likable, despite his accomplished performance.The 'hard-to-like' feeling spreads through the supporting cast, with a host of unpleasant characters on show. The overall, uncomfortable effect is to repel the viewer, which can't be good! Yet somehow it doesn't seem to matter. Maybe it's Hudson's ability to light up the screen with her big smile and golden hair, or maybe it's just very clever directing. There are a few touching moments, even with McConaughey's character - maybe just enough to tip the scales in their favour.I still can't quite make up my mind about this. The characters are all shallow, egotistical, and aloof. Yet I don't hate them as much as I feel I should. I won't be rushing to see it again, but I wouldn't avoid it if it were on TV. I do want to see more of Hudson and McConaughey, but in roles that exploit their strengths not their weaknesses.

Not great but good.Not a great deal to say on it. Excellent idea for a basis of a romantic plot, some of it works very well, some is pretty run-of-the-mill clichéd stuff. But it does have some funny scenes which most recent romantic so called comedies have neglected and keeps you guessing right until the end.Any one with a hint of a brain cell can work out they'll end up together but you never know exactly how it will come about without one of them breaking their agreement.When it arrives the end is in truth a let down & could have been executed with the two plots coming together better.

Yeah, it's a chick flick and the film develops more or less as you'd expect, but as long as you recognize those two factors (not crimes in and of themselves), the dance is fun. It's an entertaining film and I guess disposable candy entertainment, but all the same, both characters remain honest to the objectives their characters have and they handle their feelings for one another in attractive ways. However the film doesn't seem to be manipulating the viewer's feelings which is always a deal-breaker for me. Charisma of Hudson and McConaughey and a clever comedic/romantic hook keep this movie ticking along nicely.

When I saw Kate from the first minute, I noticed she has learned a lot from her famous mom. She steals the show practically during the movie...As for the movie itself, okay the end is predictable, but I was laughing and had a good time throughout the movie.

Both are doing it for their job, but their goals are the opposite. And it's hilarious for the viewer to watch them struggling with what they got themselves into. Andie's driving Ben crazy, but Ben doesn't want to give up on the bet, so he tries to hold on to Andie, which frustrates her. The tension is amazing.A lot of things in this film were pretty generic. The soundtrack is generic, so are the characters and the structure. But then again, in romantic comedies it's kind of good we can trust the structure to be similar. We don't watch romantic comedies to see an amazing art film, it's for fun and crying your eyes out if you need to. (This one didn't make that happen though.) The dialogue is also very generic, but! There was one specific piece of Dialogue I really enjoyed. It was when Andie and Ben first met. They mostly used one word lines, like ""Unattached?"" ""Currently."" ""Likewise."" ""Surprising."" I love that dialogue! It's so simplified! And that's what makes it amusing. It's also a kind of smart way to show how they are testing the waters. Neither of them is actually looking for serious relationship. Andie is looking for a normal guy she can hook and then destroy. Ben is looking for someone he can make fall in love with him. So why use long sentences when just trying to check if the other one seems alright for the ""mission""?But How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days is an amusing film. It's entertaining and kind of cute.

The scene where he takes her to meet his family, and she stops (temporarilY) acting like a little jerk, were actually the best in the movie.  The climactic scene at the diamond party resembled the worst of the Jerry Springer (et al) show where people hurt each other in public.  YUCK.

Unknown to Anderson, Barry has bet co- workers that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days.his film, based on a pair of books by Michele Alexander and Jeanne Long, just doesn't possess the substance to actually admit to being inspired by two different books. I can't believe that it took 2 books to come up with an uninspired comedy that comes off as a tired retread of the Doris Day Rock Hudson comedies of the 60's.Donald Petrie's direction is a little on the pedestrian side, but the leads are attractive and there are effective supporting bits offered along the way by Bebe Neuwirth, Robert Klein, Adam Goldberg, Kathryn Hahn, and Celia Weston, but I guess your appreciation of the film depends on how much you love Hudson and McConaughey, whose obvious on screen chemistry just wasn't enough to make this film work.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

I'm glad that audiences can see what's it's like for two totally selfish people try and pretend that love can be played around for the sake of their careers. OK enough of that...This movie is a typical romance film with the cliché curveballs and the overwhelming plot of ""how is this going to end up."" How quickly we forget how evil both of them are and how manipulating they were. Ah, romance movies. For those who do not know, Kate Hudson plays a writer for a ""Cosmopolitan""-like magazine and Matthew McConaughey plays an advertising exec. They are both put to the challenge to fall in love, but the circumstances differ for each person. McConaughey has to keep a girl in love with him (for the sake of his confidence going to his head, and proclaiming that he can make any woman LOVE him), and Hudson has to write about how exactly to lose a man in 10 days (from the start of their relationship until it ends...it was more of a ""what NOT to do"" story).To break it to audiences everywhere who like this film, it was OK. That's all. All the music was pretty standard, the shots were all pretty standard, and although Kate did a pretty good switch of character in the middle of the film, the acting was pretty bland and boring.

Nice setup.  So, why aren't I laughing?This is a classic battle of the sexes, mistaken identity comedy, the kind audiences have been entertained by for centuries.  I kept thinking this was a 60's movie, that Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant or even Doris Day and Rock Hudson would have taken the premise and made into a classic out of it.  Was it just the actors?Matthew McConaughey is a very handsome man, but he's not a very good actor. He delivers his lines in a steady monotone, as he does in pretty much every movie I've ever seen him in.  There's no inflection in his voice, and he doesn't know how to milk a scene, which is necessary in comedy.  He may be eye candy for the ladies, but the movie flatlines every time he's on the screen.Kate Hudson is a pretty good actress - you can really see her mother's influnce on her comedy skills in this movie - but she can't carry this film. For one, her character lacks a foil to work off of - McConaughey is much too serious.  Plus the script has her being a bit too obnoxious for my liking.  There's a nasty edge to the plot to dump her guy, and that just doesn't work in a comedy.If this were a 60's movie, you'd have an entire ensemble of comedians playing secondary roles, like Paul Lynde or Thelma Diamond, to keep the laughter going.  But here, the supporting cast draws a blank.  Hudson's boss at the magazine should have been played for humor, but instead she's mean-spirited and controlling.  The two female rivals at McConaughey's advertising firm are conniving and hard.  The only bit players who understand this is a comedy are Robert Klein and Liliane Montevecchi (the jeweler's wife).As a love story, it doesn't really work either because you're left wondering at the final scene where they reconcile on the Brooklyn Bridge whether these two really know each other.  I mean, they've been role playing the entire movie, and except for a brief moment at his parent's house, they really never let their guards down.  They look good together, and I guess in this modern era of movie making, that's supposed to be enough.Mildly entertaining and funny at times, but you'd have to consider this movie a failure.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

Well, actually, many have. Like the original Rocky, this movie appears to have many imitators and for good reason.The movie has the following keys to success:1) A thought provoking subject for sparing between the sexes, 2) A likable cast & very likable characters, 3) Good comic interludes,4) A decent musically assisted ending with some minor action, 5) Subplots that tie well to the plot.6) Some potentially useful advice about relationships: it's not about looks; other things cause women to drive men away (insecurity, self absorption). As I see it, you could say the same things about men who drive women away.7) Many good ironies relating to the plot.Despite the predictable and standard romantic comedy ending, I recommend this for anyone that wants to see a romantic comedy. It's that good. They also manage a few surprises prior to that predictable ending, that make this movie worth it. Many critique it, in suggesting it has a standard romantic comedy movie ending that has been seen many times before, but that is romantic comedy. This is the general ending for this type of romantic comedy movie, and at least the song was good (Follow You Down - Gin Blossoms). Aside from that issue with the ending, you missing a lot if you don't see the subplot/irony of the card game at the parents house.

78,FeverDog,FUNNY ABOUT LOVE V2.0,3,23 April 2004,"HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS threw out all credibility when it was revealed that Kate Hudson has a Masters from Columbia.  Granted, suspension of disbelief is required throughout the movie's interminable two hour running time, but, please, Hudson looks and acts way too young to make this believable.And the details of her job are both unethical and (to quote the script's recurring expletive) bullsh*t.  It's common knowledge that Cosmo articles about men are routinely written by men and are therefore predicated on a lie.  There's nothing stopping Kate from fudging the details in her piece or even making up the entire story.  She could have simply written one thing and done another, sparing the viewer the string of clichés that the movie hangs from.  We've seen other movies.  We know they're gonna find each other out, and break up, and miss each other, and one is gonna move away and be pursued by the other, and they're gonna kiss and make up, and the credits will roll.  Why the obvious takes so long to happen I don't know.  Two hours of this creepy story?  Agony.This is billed as a comedy, but the motivations of these two dullards stretch beyond credulity.  We're supposed to believe these two college-educated urbanites are so blind to the ways of the world that neither can intuit that something strange is going on between them.  That their oh-so-shocked reactions when the jig is up don't reek of hypocrisy. That two high-profile New York companies encourage petty bets for the benefit of their bottom lines.  That two yuppies-to-be are so cynical to go through with their bets but so idealistic to really fall in love after a week and a half of mind games.  Whatever.  Like the equally clueless and annoying couple in FUNNY ABOUT LOVE, perhaps these two dimwits belong together, if just to spare other New Yorkers their stunted mental capacities.There's only one scene that works:  The afternoon at Matthew's parent's home.  No lies, or psychotic behavior, or general stupidity.  (I could have done without the farting uncle, though.)  The screenwriters should have dumped all the crap before and after this scene and constructed an interesting courtship between these two and simply allow their relationship to develop with some semblance of reality.  Instead, we get dogs peeing on pool tables and a truly embarrassing singing duet with Marvin Hamlisch on piano.  (I wonder how Carly Simon felt when she realized how bad ""You're So Vain"" was disgraced?)So, we have one believable scene between the two stars, and a couple nice shots of Matt's waxed chest.  And I enjoyed seeing Matt and Adam Goldberg together again after DAZED AND CONFUSED.  And I'm pleased that Lieutenant Dangle from ""Reno 911"" is getting some big-screen work.  But that's about it for the plusses.Other things I questioned:  How did a low-level Cosmo girl score tickets to the NBA finals?  How does Matt get into Kate's office when she, in an earlier scene, had to swipe an ID card to enter the building?  And a cab pulls over to a construction site?  On a bridge?  In the middle of the day? And there's not a huge traffic jam?  And the cabbie is a native New Yorker? Who speaks clear English?  And a NYC rep house is running SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE and MYSTIC PIZZA?  Uh huh.So we've got a movie with only a tenuous connection to any known reality, featuring characters who are supposed to be smart but display little intelligence, in a script with numerous scenes cribbed from countless other movies.  And this latest example of Hollywood idiocy grossed over $100M. Go figure.  Why?  What American female can possibly relate to anything depicted in this movie?  I believe that SECRETARY, despite its kinkiness, is an infinitely more honest, funny, and revealing portrait of the modern mating dance.

This film is somewhere in between. It is a fine line. This film manages to get dreamy without being overly cringy. And for that, it is done beautifully with the stellar acting by Matthew and Kate.

80,bburns,It sure lost this guy.,6,19 June 2003,"The trouble with being a single guy at my age (32) is that typically, all your male friends are either married or living with someone.  So if you want to go to the movies with your friends, you typically wind up watching what their wives want to see.  This is how I was roped into seeing ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"".This film has one thing going for it (and only one thing):  Kate Hudson is hilarious playing the psycho girlfriend (and I've had a couple). Unfortunately, that might be enough for a 5-minute SNL skit or a guest appearance on a show like ""Friends"", but it's not enough to carry a 2-hour movie.Everything else in the film comes from the sitcom ""Just Shoot Me"":  Kate Hudson's character is a serious journalist ""trapped"" working at a shallow fashion magazine, and the characters played by Bebe Neuwirth & Robert Klein are carbon copies of Wendie Malick & George Segal respectively in the aforementioned TV show.The ""plot""--so to speak--is that Hudson's character is going to pick a guy to clamp on to, then drive him away with all the stuff that women do when they feel more needy than desirable, after which she will write an article called ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"".  Meanwhile an ad exec (Matthew McConaughey, who I met a couple of times when we were in college together) bets his co-workers he can get anyone to fall in love with him.  They pick each other for their respective projects and the bad chick-flick comedy cliches ensue.Another big problem I have with the movie is that it has nothing to do with the real world.  Since when are the Knicks in the NBA finals each year? That hasn't happened since Jeff Van Gundy left.  Also, as a Texan, I have come to accept that my accent is used for all sorts of rural types (Ohio in ""Heathers"", Alaska in ""Northern Exposure"", Minnesota in ""A Simple Plan""); and I realize that in the movies, everywhere outside of New York City proper is supposed to be the sticks.  But surely even the most elitist Manhattanite must realize that people from Staten Island do *not* speak with an exaggerated Southern drawl.For a single heterosexual male, watching this movie is like waiting for your sister to finish trying on outfits at a department store when you were a kid.  You just wanted her to hurry up so you could go home and play video games.  After watching this movie, I pulled ""Tetris"" out of the mothballs (OK it's on a hard drive, but you get the point) and found it immensely more entertaining than this film.

As far as chick flicks go, this is a movie that you can take guys too without having them puke, which might be the highest compliment for this movie you can give.The idea behind the story was sound, however it may not have had the best treatment of it in this film. A woman (Hudson) watches as various of her girlfriends make the classic relationship mistakes that drive boyfriends away. So she decides to write an article on how avoid the classic mistakes by setting up an experiment that will commit those very mistakes and drive a guy away in 10 days. The unbelievability of this story is that why it would take 10 days to drive a guy away, it should be much easier and faster than that if you're in a brand new relationship. If this were an established relationship of a few months or a few years old, then this would be a real challenge. At the same time, the other party in this relationship (McConaughey) has made a bet that he could get a woman to fall in love with him within 10 days. And if this happens, then he will win a big advertising contract worth millions. So he has a vested interest in making sure the relationship works out. The sad thing about this is that why it would take a multi-million dollar contract to make you want to make a relationship work out, and not just for the sake of the relationship itself?

I love Matthew in this movie, he's great, he looks so sexy, and trust me he's looked great in a lot of movies, but this one is the cutest Matt movie ever. Also, Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn's daughter) is perfect, not only does she look like her mother, she also does a really good job at playing a ditz and making it hilarious. I got to tell you, when this movie came out, I just wanted to see it because Matt was in it, but after I saw the movie, I loved it. The story is about a girl, Andie Anderson (Kate), who works for an all-woman's magazine, and she's writing an article, ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days"" and she picks a guy, Ben (Matt), but wait a sec, Ben is doing a project at his work, and two girls pick Andie, the girl that Ben has to fall in love with in 10 days. It's great, it's got lot's of laughs. There's a lot of hilarious scenes especially with Kate, as she tries everything there is in and out of the book to try and lose Ben, and Matt has lot of awwww moments when her tries to get Kate to fall in love with him. Will Andie fall in love with Ben? Will Andie lose Ben in 10 days? Find out for yourself as you watch this hilarious, brilliant, romantic comedy/chick flick. I'm giving the movie a 10, because the acting is incredible, the stars irresistible, the story phenomenal, and movie, TERRIFIC!",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

Even the cuddle/kiss scenes aren't overly pushing but slowly developed to let the viewer actually keep like they are really passionate about each other but don't have to display it to everyone.Now the funny things weren't the jokes the developed over the movie, but they were the small reactions that character goes through against other actions.As kate's character tries makes him leave her, most men can put themselves in his shoes and totally go nuts over this, however for him with big plans on the line, he has to take it all in, but can he?Cheers!",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

The fact that we don't see anything the matter with it's principles, its presuppositions on which it builds in order to make us laugh and feel. These people are living ""the good life,"" wouldn't you say? A young, healthy advertising agent and a columnist in the fabulous New York City. They make two simultaneous immoral, crusty bets and don't suffer for it. Instead, it is presented as a comedy. I laughed too.

It's romantic, heartwarming, sappy, and has a happy ending! What more does a girl want? Oh, and it's also funny like I actually laughed at certain parts, not just a chuckle. While Kate Hudson is a darling, I kept swooning over young Mathew McConaughey, they just fit their roles perfectly and the chemistry, you can definitely feel it. That trailer does no justice to what's in store. Obviously, it is predictable, it's a chick-flick, but it's a swoop me off my feet and let me fall in love with them kind of movie! (Why don't they make them like this anymore?) And never did I imagine anybody could pull off a yellow dress this well. To so many bad reviews, I'd use the movie's dialogue - Bulls**t.This is the Rom-Com you deserve, it's got great acting, slapstick comedy and 18 years later is still worth every minute.I don't want to keep you long, trust me, go watch it.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

98,blackberrybabe,How to lose your money in two hours,2,9 October 2009,"This movie was ridiculous. The plot is completely unbelievable. A woman bets her boss that she can 'lose a guy in ten days.' A man bets that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days. What can go wrong? Too much. The movie was not funny. It showed women as catty and men as stupid. There is no reason why he would 'want to keep her' and there is no reason that she 'would fall in love with him.' Granted, they are doing stupid and idiotic things on purpose, but after finding out that they were lying to each other, all is forgiven! And of course the climax is played out in public. Typical Hollywood. In reality, they would be so upset that they lied to each other that they would never see each other again. And any talking would be out of the line of curious ears. But of course, movies are not based on reality.Kate Hudson is very pretty and Matthew McConaughey is quite handsome. The costumes, especially the yellow dress that Hudson wears at the end, are gorgeous. I do think that Hudson as Andie Anderson and McConaughey as Benjamin Barry did well with their talents, but the movie itself stinks. No matter how talented you are, you cannot save a sinking ship.I'm sure several people will like this movie and that is fine, everyone has different tastes. I am a romantic, but I pride myself on being a sensible romantic. Movies of this kind are not romantic to me, just wastes of time. If you want a quality love story, go with something else.

But right there is one of the problems. Having been turning herself into an increasingly girlfriend-from-hell character, suddenly Andie blends right in, does not show herself irritating in any way, and proves sharp as a pin in playing the family card game, beating Ben. Doesn't Ben notice the inconsistency? Another that has been noted, that she claims to be a vegetarian after having eaten lobster, is explicable, maybe, in that not all vegetarians avoid fish and seafood, but might at least give him pause for thought. Can't remember what she is shown eating at the family occasion.And then there are the hackneyed features, especially the chase at the end to catch her before she leaves for ever. And for them each to have two 'best friends' might fit reality but seemed a wearisomely familiar plot device.So, I have to say, I have seen rom-coms that hung together better and that I therefore remember with greater pleasure.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

The part where Ben proposes couple counselling with Andie's colleague posing as the therapist was just hilarious! It was also quite heartwarming to see her melting upon being welcomed so warmly into his family. The blow-up at the end was pretty funny, where they sang 'You're Vain' as a duet and tried to get back at each other. I don't think it was very believable that they'd behave in such a manner given that the dinner was in a professional setting, but it wasn't too much of a stretch.

Everything in this movie is tried to be made so perfect that its perfection is what kills me. The irritating behavior of the girl increases so much, that 40 min into the movie, my digestive system gives up. I literally had cramps in my stomach. Her insensitiveness increases exponentially upto the three-fourths of the movie, and then suddenly she gives up to the love of the boy, even when there were two more days to the judgment day (thats because the directors need an emotional scene and a bed scene; and both those requirements are fulfilled by that change of heart, even if it not fits in the storyline).

116,bkam,I laughed a very few times in spite of myself,5,5 July 2003,"Having seen the previews, I thought this movie would pretty much be How to Lose a Guy Viewer in 10 Minutes.  To my credit, I saw it on an airplane to Hawaii and paid nothing extra to see it.  To the film's credit, it managed to keep me staring at it for its duration.  Plot-wise, there is nothing to say.  Everything you need to know is explained in the previews.  There is not a split second of suspense throughout the entire film.  Yet this is entirely expected and to hope for a complex storyline is to be sitting through the wrong film.  The acting was exactly what was expected, the cinematography wholly unremarkable, the realism unsurprisingly lacking, and the score unmemorable.  Realistically, the only elements that have a chance of redeeming the film are the romance and the comedy.  Considering the nature of the film, the romance is, like all else, as predictable and superficial as the rest of the film, although not as annoying as it might have been.  So we come to the aspect of humor.  I must say, that despite all of these markedly low expectations and the desire not to laugh at such a tragic example of the flaws of American culture, the film was overall fairly amusing.  I found myself smiling or laughing enough to keep me from unplugging the headphones from the armrest and unplugging my mind from its consciousness.  Kate Hudson, whose acting in Almost Famous was good if memory serves, pulled off the role as reasonably as can be expected for a film with such low potential.  McConaughey was also occasionally funny, although perhaps his friends were the most humorous.  Overall, while I couldn't recommend it to anyone, I know those who like this sort of drivel will see it anyway, and for its genre it's slightly more bearable than similar films.

The plot is simple and the juxtaposition maybe even a little weary, but the actors bring a great deal to their respective parts.

My only complaint is that this movie could easily have been called ""Sex In The City: The Movie"" and you can easily hang names on the primary characters.

And then when psycho and bizarre doesn't work, she ends up going to meet his folks on Staten island.

Nor does he seem to notice this difference. 
  Actually the whole Staten island sequence was excellent: funny, real, sweet, sincere... it just totally didn't fit the rest of the movie.  It's as if the writers came up with that really great scene and then tried to find a totally bland hollywood movie to stick it in, where it vaguely makes sense.

124,jessied,How to Lose an Audience in 10 Minutes,3,6 February 2003,"Women repeat the phrase `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' over and over again as if it's a brilliant concept in the film of the same name directed by Donald Petrie.  Screenwriters Kristen Buckley, Brian Regan, and Burr Steers' unimaginative choice for the title is indicative of their collective writing ability, but one exits the theater wishing they had more appropriately dubbed this comedic disaster `How to Lose an Audience in 10 Minutes.'  The story is expectedly built on clichés, not a criticism as it is inherent to the subject matter and a truth that applies to many films in this genre, but the writers rarely discover creative ways to turn hackneyed ideas into humorous situations.  The dialogue often lacks ingenuity, the scenarios are much too familiar, and the script is nearly void of an honesty that makes people want to believe in predictably trite romantic comedies.	Headlines that lure women to purchase fashion and beauty magazines fall off the covers and slide across the screen as morning activity ensues at Composure, the fastest growing women's magazine in the country.  Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) finishes a political masterpiece at her computer, and her colleague commends the article but reminds Anderson that she works for a publication that prefers articles about fitness, cosmetic surgery, and shoes.  The clientele just isn't interested in poverty, religion or the environment.  Poor Anderson.  Straight out of Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism with a column of her own and a schedule and salary that affords her plenty of free time both during the day and at night, a 5th Avenue apartment in Manhattan, and extra cash to spend on Knicks playoff tickets. Perhaps taking a more typical beginning journalism job covering the crime beat and town meeting after town meeting would have satisfied her desire to write about things that matter.  The staff meeting at Composure provides a bit of enjoyable light humor and a peek into an exaggerated display of new-age office tactics, but introducing Anderson in this context with her firm agenda in such a flimsy atmosphere is awkward and unbelievable.Single-life lover Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey), how cute--two A's for Andie and two B's for Ben, accepts a bet offered by his boss and associates at the advertising agency, which pairs him with Anderson.  The couple plunges into a romantic relationship, and both characters conceal their real objective after agreeing that all is fair in love and war.  The conversation that takes Anderson and Barry out of the bar and into the restaurant where they feast on lobster and get to know one another is the first glimpse of a witty and refreshing exchange; enjoy these fleeting moments as they are the exceptions rather than the rule.  Laughable moments do return, however, in full force during late-middle scenes in this nearly two hour film.  The first dinner date at Barry's apartment, the boys' night poker scene, and the couple's therapy session all rescue the drowning viewer from the depths of ennui.But even these rare moments cannot save How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Nevertheless, the film does find some redemption in its two lead actors. Individually, Hudson and McConaughey add spark to dull words and circumstances.  Together they are dynamite, and one laments the fact that they were not endowed with a script that matches their talent.  Hopefully they will reunite at another time--after both actors prove themselves in other roles that better display their abilities.  In this film, though, both performances are expressive, intelligent, and warrant acclaim for adding something laudatory to a film that should have been canned and hidden away forever out of public sight or left on the cutting room floor.One does not learn anything from the `how to girl' in this film except that love ferns die just like relationships if they are not properly nurtured. Diamond companies do not pay advertising companies great sums of money to come up with a slogan like `Frost Yourself'; one can only hope this was a failed parody attempt.  Men do not come back carrying flowers and missing the smell of perfume on pillows to women who are prone to dating faux pas. No man should tolerate ten days of Andie's erratic behavior, and no woman should want a sports-fanatic boyfriend who skips game seven of his team's playoff series to go to a Celine Dion concert.  Andie is annoying but occasionally endearing and the gestures by Barry are valiant, but none if it is real.

Kate carries the day only when she can show her unique mixture of vulnerability and worldly sophistication, which amounts to mere seconds of screen time in this film.

128,matpinckney,Mature Chick Flick,8,28 May 2007,"Considering I watched this straight after 'A Cinderella Story', some of my opinions may be slightly biased, but I'll continue none the less.From the outset, this film is obviously based at a more mature audience. The characters are more complex, as is the writing and comedy.Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughy fill the leading roles perfectly. Their characters are three dimensional and well observed, and are both performed with honesty, and brilliant comic timing. Even away from the humour, dramatic scenes surprisingly pack a punch. It is the relationship between the actors on which the whole film rests.Supporting characters, such as Michelle and Jeanie, and Tony and Thayer, add a real level of comedy that I thoroughly enjoyed, and lent a 'Boys Vs Girl' mentality early on. In general, the acting was very good indeed.The writing was brilliant, as was Donald Petrie's directing, which kept the film going along at a great pace.Once the credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel I had really enjoyed the film. Chick-flick, yes, but a very well-written, adult one.8/10",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
129,desire_911,One of best Romantic comedy films of all time !,9,2 August 2008,"how to lose a guy is an original story, which is well-acted, very smart and very very funny. i found myself laughing out loud many many times. I think its one of the best romantic comedies of all time. I would encourage buying the movie: great for parties or anytime you want to good laugh. I quite enjoyed this movie actually. I didn't intend to see it but i'm not sorry i did. I like romantic comedies but the past couple of years they've been pretty disappointing & plain stupid + i'm not big on Matthew McConaughey. The main reason why i liked the movie is definitely Kate Hudson! She's so adorable & hilariously funny in the movie. Definitely the star. Matthew did a good job i guess, but i still don't particularly like him a lot. The story is original, the jokes are really funny & there's real chemistry between the main characters! Unfortunately it's just a chick-flick that will be forgotten pretty soon. But at least it's a romantic comedy with a real heart!Entertainment Score: 9.9/10Overall: 9.85/10",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

Although somewhat predictable, a lot of situations made me really laugh, particularly where Andie leaves and Ben goes after her, suggesting the couples therapy. I enjoyed the movie, surprisingly.

How to lose a guy in 10 days is a typical example of cinema in which it is far too clear that it is adjusted to some target group.The acting, for that matter, is not particularly bad. Everybody gets the job done. It is the story itself however that ruins it all. How can anybody write such a simple and predictable plot with the idea of actually realizing it into a movie?!

The boys party was hilarious, I still smile when recollect those guys' faces. McConaughey is very good in the part of a vain ad producer being at the same time a nice simple guy. Hudson could be less overactig but fits the general concept of a movie-cartoon and is very pretty, too. The yellow dress is fabulous. Overall it is quite OK as a comedy though romantic is somewhat unbelievable.PS One thing that I find annoying - not only in this film - is that at least one time in a movie they would speak with their mouth full. Food dropping down usually included. I don't get it, what that's supposed to show, a down-to-earth character? easiness of atmosphere?

So far in 2003, it is my favorite movie. I'll give it an A-. This might go down as one of my all-time favorites! Gwyneth Paltrow was offered the part first and turned it down.

140,puckbond007,How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days-6/10 is just another so-so silly romantic comedy,6,14 March 2003,"Possible SpoilersHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is just another so-so silly romantic comedy that tries to be charming and fun. I have just about hit the wall with these type of films...for the most part they are silly, formulaic, predictable and their only saving grace is maybe two decent leads who have some form of chemistry and maybe the movie is filled with some witty and fun dialogue. I am not a fan of these type of movies, but if you are I'm sure you will enjoy this one too. The lovely Kate Hudson is quite fun and charming as Holly, the ""How to"" girl of Composure Magazine (the fastest growing women's magazine in the country). Call it what you want...its Cosmo, Vogue, Elle etc. a trashy women's magazine about beauty, fashion, cosmetics, health, gossip and realtionships etc. Anyway Holly's newest assignment is to get with a guy and then get him to leave her within 10 days by doing all the annoying things that women do in relationships and guys hate. Matthew McConaughey plays Ben, a hot young advertising executive who pitches sports equipment, alcohol etc. He is gunning for the account of a major diamond company and is competing with two other ladies. They strike up a side bet where Ben must make a woman fall in love with him within 10 days...and if he succeeds he gets the diamond account. Naturally of course the two of them wind up meeting each other in a bar just after the assignment and bets have been made. That is really my major problem with films like these. There has to be some sort of cute, stupid way,to get the two leads together,which of course leads to somebody finding out about a bet at the end and getting mad...only to realize they really are in love. Please! It's enough wih these moronic ""meeting ideas""...what happend to just two people meeting under normal circumstances and things not working out. Anyway as I said Hudson and McConaughey are qute good together, with Hudson doing every imaginable annoying thing to drive a guy away including redecorating his bathroom, keeping him away from sporting events and ruining his guys night poker game and McConughey still never takes the bait. You can figure out the rest fom there. Overall, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is not a terrible movie by any means...its just another silly romantic comedy that puts two young leads in a silly formulaic plot and has a little fun and not much else.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

In some places, you have to work hard to suspend your disbelief, because the characters' actions didn't always make sense based on their circumstances. (Wouldn't either of them have become even a little suspicious of the bizarre behavior of the other?)  Also, I thought that Andie and the other female characters were written largely with stereotypes of women in mind.In spite of these shortcomings, after accepting that it was more a ""light"" comedy than a well-written movie, I found myself frequently laughing out loud: the saving grace of the movie is the humor, which works well in most places.The movie's not excellent, but its' not atrocious, either.

But Kate Hudson is absolutely stunning. She's radiant and beautiful, just like her mom Goldie Hawn was at her age. She brings this movie so much spice and liveliness, it's hard to imagine anyone but her in the role--Gwynnie's got nothing on her!

If you want a drama, you should expect to be touched.  If you want a comedy, you should expect to laugh.  Whenever you read a comment on the movie from a critic that is negative, the reason is they are crtiqueing it for something it is not. Just go to this movie and you will laugh,  I did for almost an hour straight.  It is a good time, relax.  If you are a guy, even though it is a chick flick, you will enjoy this.  The movie is a parody of sorts because it portrays the way that girls treat guys sometimes.  If you are a girl, well, you will like it too, because it is a chick flick.  I saw Kate Hudson in Four Feathers and was not at all impressed with her, or the movie, so when I came to see this my expectations were not that high.  Folks, both she and Mathew McConaghey were great.  M. McConaghey has really mastered that masculine and funny dialogue much like Luke Wilson or Ben Stiller.  Sure the movie is predictable in parts, and it does follow the typical romantic film recipe towards the end, but who cares.  We don't go to movies to pick them apart.

Yes, this movie is predictable and unoriginal, but it works. I watched this movie mainly because of Kate Hudson; she's one of my favorite actors because she has such a great personality and really brings her characters to life - and she's done it again in this film. How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is filled with a lot of funny moments mainly due to (Hudson) and her crazy antics to accomplish her goal of getting Ben (McConaughey) to dump her. The things (that actually do drive most men crazy - and not in a good way) she does are so funny and out there; mixed with her facial expressions and energetic acting, it really makes the film memorable. The things she does, along with knowing how Ben would react - as would any man - really made me laugh out loud because it's so ridiculously funny, especially how well Hudson plays her role.Also, an important factor, Matthew and Kate's chemistry is strong throughout and that really helps the movie tie together and stand out from it's typical plot.

158,Agent__Smith,"More ""chick-flick"" than date movie...",3,11 February 2003,"I got dragged to this one by my better half and -- what a yawner! First of all, this is THE ""chick flick"" of all ""chick flicks."" I read a poster for this movie somewhere which had a tagline stating something to the effect that it was a ""chick flick for guys."" What a load of crap! Although this film boasts two stars, a guy (McCaughnahey) and a girl (Hudson), approximately 85 percent of the story is told from the perspective of the girl. Now, normally, I wouldn't mind sitting through one of these rom-coms as long as I enjoy watching the female lead. But as much as I liked Hudson's multi-dimentional performance in ""Almost Famous,"" she's stiff as cardboard in this one -- although, luckily I don't mean that in a physical sense. In fact, guys, perhaps the best part of this movie is the dress she wears in the next-to-last scene (the one in the movie poster) -- there's lots of ""moving parts"" to that dress, if you know what I mean. *wink* Another thing -- this is a technical point -- what's with all the ""twos"" in this flick? McCaughnahey has two best friends giving him advice, Hudson has two best friends giving her advice, and the plot's main antagonists -- are TWO FEMALE sales reps. What is this, was SAG giving out a two-for-one deal to the casting director? All these characters only serve to unnecessarily complicate the dialogue and flow of the movie. Finally, I'm not so shallow as to paint all rom-coms with the same brush -- there are some good ones out there if you look hard enough -- but this one is slow-moving, and LONG, coming in at 2 hours and 15 minutes! I mean, what is this, Lawrence of Arabia? Sheesh! In fact you could easily cut 30 minutes from this film and it might be just long enough. (I should note that I NEVER complain about the length of movies...usually.)So, guys, don't say I didn't warn you! If your female counterpart is pressuring you to see a chick flick this weekend, steer her to ANY of the other nameless rom-coms out there -- by all means necessary!

164,harpoonz37,Superb Acting.,8,17 February 2003,"I totally agree with other user's reviews.  This is a generic romantic comedy, which follows the formula to a T.  The directing is nothing noteworthy (including the now-standard body-shots of Matthew to titilate the younger female audience - a very powerful buying crowd).  Plot is again standard romantic comedy fare.I also agree that what sets this movie apart is not the plot...it is the actor's interaction with each other.  Having seen this gem, I would not hesitate to go to another movie with these two.

While Benjamin does his ""crime"" in the form of a somewhat less than private bet, Andy is about to publicly humiliate him. First of all, Benjamin's plot is less than original as everyone appears to have a friend who has made a bet on such a subject. Secondly, (and this is where my gender may get blended into it) his crime is PETTY compared to hers. So I simply fail to see her indignation when she learns the truth. And as her part of the plot is highly original, it brings a further lack of balance to the whole story. I did enjoy seeing ""Lilith"" back in peak condition, and the acting is plausible, but there are more embarrasing scenes than genuinely funny scenes, thus this is just another mediocre rom-com with a predictable ending and a few good laughs.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

Matthew McConaughey is her ""honey"", and I figured I could stand to look at Kate Hudson for two hours, so it was worth the risk.I was quite pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable the movie turned out to be.  Easy to predict, perhaps not very original in plot, but the chemistry between McConaughey and Hudson was really nice.  Hudson in particular showed some great comedic talent, far surpassing her mother at the same stage in her career.What made the movie for me, though, was the ""Bull****"" scene with ""Ben's"" parents.  I really had to laugh... that game was a favorite of my parent's, and we used to play all the time.  Seeing it in the movie, and the underlying meaning of it in the whole movie, was nice.8 out of 10... would have been higher but Ben's two friends really bugged me, as did the friend of Andie's whose relationship problems started the whole thing rolling.

Sue me.""How To"" is above-average for the genre.  It's formulaic in many ways -- right down to the final rush to the airport (gosh, I hope no spoilers there... ) -- but it does a good job with the formula.Kate Hudson, in particular, is wonderfully funny As Andie Anderson.  (And she's as beutiful as ever.)  I laughed out loud many, many times at her ""girlfriend from hell"" antics.  Matt MCConnacoughcough does funny fairly well ... he's certainly better here than he was in ""The Wedding Planner."" Finally, Andie's friend Michelle (Kathryn Hahn) is hilarious in a supporting role ... during one very funny scene, she fakes being a couples therapist.There were a number of subtle touches, such as the main characters noticing their alliterative names (Andie Anderson and Ben Barry) with amusement, but not pointing it out in neon letters for the audience.As I said, it's above average.

Then things start picking up until the end which is so predictable it's unpredictable! It seems like they got this ending out of ""A Director's Guide for Chick Flicks"".

Two of Ben's female colleagues, who happened to have been at the Cosmo-clone's offices when the story was pitched, make it a condition they get to pick the loudmouth's target, so maximum hilarity ensues.There are some pretty awful reviews on IMDB of this movie from people who find this plot cliched and predictable.

Maybe I am to much of a romantic but there are really so very few movies made that are both romantic and hilarious. I have to say this movie really does it for me. Not only is Matthew the ultimate hottie, but Kate Hudson makes me proud of my small chest. She is so sexy and comfortable with herself. Their chemistry is amazing. The script is great and there comedic talent was exceptional. I hate movies based on lies, where one person lies about being something they are not to win over the other person, and then it starts a horrible cycle, which is the basis of most romantic comedies. But here it is something fresh, they are both out for themselves, not out for love at all and watching it backfire is hilarious. Andy Anderson (Kate Hudson) is writing an article on How to lose a guy in 10 days and has to date a guy and try to get him to dump her. Benjamin Berry has made a bet with some work mates saying he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. Unfortunately for both of them they end up with each other, and all hell breaks lose because it just isn't as easy as they thought it would be. Now of course there are a couple of holes in the plot. But honestly there are not that many, and every movie has them. But the truth of the matter is if it had been cast differently it just wouldn't be half as good. They should really only ever make romantic comedies with these two from know on. I mean, Pretty women is romantic and it is funny and there is good chemistry between Julia Roberts and Richard Gere and I love it but neither of them are naturally that funny especially Gere. Kate Hudson has the genes for comedy and McConaughey: well it is surprising how funny he is here. With Kate he is great, with Jennifer Lopez he is not so good.

The premise doesn't exactly feel logical (woman wants to become a respectable journalist, therefore writes article on deliberately sabotaging a relationship) or natural (mans accepts bet to make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days because...the plot demands it, I guess!), and to be honest, this is the films biggest failing. Any chemistry between the two leads is completely worthless, because the audience knows the entire thing is a sham. That said, there are a few laughs to be had here, and the adequate performances all round mean this isn't awful viewing by any means. Matthew McConaughey doesn't exactly break any new ground here, playing a smug, well-off everyman, but he does serve as a good foil for Kate Hudson, who delivers a performance that really tests the viewers patience. Yes, I realise the point is to be annoying to try and drive off the guy, but it doesn't exactly make for good viewing!The supporting cast is what you'd expect, an array of mildly entertaining but decidedly two-dimensional characters whose sole purpose in life is to gravitate around the leads. The film-making and plot of the film are passable, nothing special but nothing awful either. All in all, I would say this is by no means an awful film, and if it happens to be on and you've no other choice, it's worth wasting a couple of hours on.

The focus wasn't on romance throughout- while it was the central theme, it really showed more of the comedy side of things and we both shared a good few laughs.Both leads were excellent and the chemistry between them was fantastic. Kate Hudson played the comedy role well, and she had me slapping my knees and giggling out loud on more than a few occasions.I would definitely recommend this movie for most people who like a good laugh, and don't want to watch anything too heavy. It's not a lovey-dovey film and although it's fluffy, it's cool.I've watched it more than a few times, and still enjoy it.

I saw this movie on a date and about fifteen minutes into it I realized that I was going to be stuck for another hour or so in one of the more painful situations in my life.

I decided that the power tool would be the way to go.  Unfortunately the movie was still playing when I arrived at this epiphany and my attention was diverted back to the atrocities on the screen.  Basically these were very shallow, annoying people doing very shallow, annoying things.

Yes this is a boy meets girl film and we all know what the ending will be but this is quite a funny film!The film stars Kate Hudson as the lovely Angie and her co- star, Matthew McConaughey as Ben who as you can guess fall madly in love with each other, but again as always there is one simple twist that makes the whole film stand out!that they are both using each other but for very different reasons. Angie is using Ben for an article as she is a journalist for a woman's magazine and she proposes to her boss that she will write an unpredictable article about ""How to lose a guy in ten days"" and she uses her man repelling friend, Michelle played by Kathryn Hahn as her case study. Meanwile Ben ""crashes"" a business meeting with his boss and his two female colleagues as he wants to prove to his boss that he can pitch an idea for diamond jewellery better than his two female colleagues, pretty quickly his two colleagues come to the conclusion that he doesn't know anything about how women feel and he ends up making a bet with them that he has to make a girl fall in love with him before the diamond ball, and guess who they choose to be his victim, Angie knowing full well what her agenda is, To lose the guy in ten days. So as the beautiful Angie and the gorgeous Ben start to date,Angie is trying to put him off her by making photo albums of their future children and putting cuddly toys around his apartment. She does anything she can to try and put him off her she even makes her friend Michelle dress up as a funny looking psychiatrist so they can have ""couple therapy"" so that it will pt him off her. Although poor Ben sticks with it like no other man would. It is only when they go to Ben's parents house that they start to fall for each other, and start to get too involved with each other on their romantic break away. When they get back, Angie still hasn't managed to finish with him but does she want to?

215,rab62442,Controversial - possible spoilers,9,9 February 2003,"In my own opinion, I LOVED this movie. It was funny and very cute.  Kate Hudson did an excellent job.  The thing is, it was a chick flick.  For my own rating, as in what I thought of it, I gave it a 9.  Because it was a chick flick, obviously all of the world wouldn't enjoy it like me.  BUT, for a chick flick, it was awesome and I still think everyone should give it a chance.Kate Hudson did an awesome job. I Loved her role in the film because you saw two sides of her, which she pulled off really well. One side being herself, and then the other, the girl trying to get rid of McConaughey's character. On the other hand, Matthew McConaughey did an equally impressive job for the same reason. He had to be two different characters too.I loved in the movie when it's towards the end and you see Andie (Hudson) starting to act like herself around Ben (McConaughey) when they're at his parents house. I was personally really happy because it was like 'oooh the characters are starting to realize they do have feelings for each other blah blah blah'.  I thought it was great when Andie made Ben go up to the stage and sing and then Ben made Andie come up too and they were singing together.McConaughey has been in a couple chick flicks. For instance, he's been in The Wedding Planner, EdTV(it could be seen as a chick flick just because of the romance), Boys on the Side, and probably more, but...IF YOU LIKED THE WEDDING PLANNER, also starring McConaughey, YOU'LL LOVE THIS EVEN MORE. Personally I don't really like J.Lo. She's a good actress, but there's something about the roles she plays that I just don't like, so seeing Matthew with someone else was awesome.Honestly though, I could see why someone would not like How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, but with the way the film is, I think it depends on the viewer. In my opinion it's not your typical chick flick where the guy is usually wrong and the girl is the victim, blah blah blah. They're both being wronged and doing wrong.

218,devildevine,Funny and Fun,6,6 August 2003,"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is the new romantic comedy from director Jack Gill. Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey star as a journalist and an ad executive, one trying to make the other fall in love with him, the other trying to drive him away.
Kate Hudson plays the intelligent and energetic Andie Anderson. Andie is a journalist at composure magazine where she is the resident `How To' girl. All she wants is to write about things she likes; like the environment, economics, poverty and politics. Unfortunately for her, working at Composure magazine means she's limited to fashion, and men. When her friend, Michelle, is dumped, Andie's boss thinks it's a good idea for Michelle to use it as a story. Not being able to exploit her personal life for an article, the boss hands it up to anyone. Andie doesn't want the story being taken by an annoying little co-worker, and therefore takes it upon herself to write the story. She explains that she will do all the silly things that women, like Michelle, do that eventually lead to men being driven away. `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' is born.
Matthew McConaughey plays Benjamin Barry, the other lead role as the confident, well-built, handsome man that thinks he can make any straight and available woman fall in love with him. Two of his co-workers make a small bet with him; he has to make a woman of their choice fall completely head over heels for him by next Sunday; 10 days. The two co-workers notice that in the same bar is the woman they met doing the `How To' article! And if you hadn't guessed already, she is the one they tell Ben to make fall in love with him. We witness the next 10 days of these people's lives as Andie does everything in her power to drive Ben away; while he does everything he can to make her fall madly in love.
I was dragged along to see How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days by a few of my friends, and thought that I was going to see some mediocre chick flick that is scarcely original and would leave me gasping for air as I choked on my own throw-up after having to sit through this horrendous thing they want to call `film'. I am happy to say that my worrying was in vain and that How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, though not a masterpiece, is a solid comedy that'll keep you laughing 'til the expected, yet unavoidable, conclusion.
One of the key factors of this film that kept it from being run-of-the-mill was the amazing performance by the beautiful Kate Hudson. Seeing as how her role in Almost Famous completely stole my heart, I knew that she would not disappoint. She plays very well, and has the right energy and quirkiness to capture the audience and make them care about Andie Anderson. Matthew McConaughey plays average at best in his role as Benjamin Barry, but with such a dislikeable character it is hard to find praise. His character is arrogant, and unbearable, aside from a few scenes with some hilarious one-liners that kept him from giving this movie a lower rating. His co-workers Tony and Thayer, played by Adam Goldberg and Thomas Lennon, were much more funny and likeable than Ben, and provided comic relief when in the same scene.
How to Lost a Guy in 10 Days provides solid comedy with believable dialogue, and a great cast of characters. The witty script matched with some solid performances keeps this movie fast and entertaining. A few tiresome scenes, an unpleasant character here or there and the aforementioned predictable ending slightly detract from the light-hearted fun; but the movie still managed to have enough fun to keep me entertained from start to finish.***/****Note: **/**** if it weren't for the talented Kate Hudson to pull this picture out of mediocrity.",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

Lastly, the humor level touches on both women and men levels.  I laughed at a lot of scenes.  It may be a ""chick flick"" or a ""date movie"" but it's to me, a light hearted love-comedy (which is ultimately what I see as the goal).See this one, but try not to go for more than a cheap early bird if you're tired of the same predictable storylines.

Kate Hudson portrayed the role of a dynamic young woman,who is willing to do everything for her career, successfully. Matthew McConaughey was a sexy womanizer, who despite the weird situations that Andie (Kate) put him through, he did not gave up on his scope. The topic was pretty interesting, considering the project Andie had to do, and I can truthfully say that us,women, surely did learn something from her ""experiments"" on Ben (Matthew).

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a film that includes comedy, conflict, romance, and illustrates the competitive world of business, conveying how far one will go to get something that they want (this being a continuous universal theme throughout the movie.) I'm not saying that you're ridiculous if you don't think this movie is good..but you're ridiculous if you don't think this movie is good. It's definitely not a movie with considerable substance, but is hilarious and romantic, a great movie if you're looking for something comical and light. The dynamic between Kate Hudson and Matthew Mcidkhowtospell is strong and convincing, resulting in not only believable characters, but believable characters who complement each other. 10/10 movie!",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

The characters all work perfectly together; Benny and Andy are both in search of a step up on the career ladder and each little group of friends have chemistry together, Andy's friends are the perfect New York girls, Lennon and Goldberg blew me away as Benny's friends and Michele and Harlow are the ultimate witches. To watch Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey together is like watching two people who really are in love, it's not difficult to see the talent these two have and the on-screen chemistry as they fall in love is beautiful.The plot is predictable at times, but the comic outcomes of Andy's desperate attempts to drive Ben away and Ben's desperate attempts to keep hold of her will remind even heartbroken souls of being in love.I gave this movie nine out of ten because of it's intelligence and sparkle. It has undoubtedly become one of my favourite movies and Kate Hudson one of my favourite actresses.

I wish i could find a guy just like Matthew mcconaughey, cute and caring, sensitive and funny all in the same guy.

250,dmdclca,Fun watch,6,4 July 2020,"When I first heard about ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"", I thought that it was just another romcom, and although it does hit a lot of similar beats that most generic romcoms would have, the characters more than make up for it. This movie also throws in a bit of a twist. It uses the trope in which a guy makes a bet that he can be with a girl, and adds to it by having both the guy and the girl essentially using the other for their gain. This adds a lot of funny and clever moments where you see two manipulative people going back and forth trying to use the other for their gain. And Ben and andi have a lot of chemistry, that despite some of the cheesy lines, really helped you to want them to be together. The movie ends about how you would expect it to, but thats not necessarily a bad thing, not all movies need to be six sense. I really enjoyed this movie, but it did have flaws. Some of the writing was obvious and predictable, and id say that the jokes had a 60% chance if landing. This movie won't win any Oscar but its a great quick watch. Love it or hate it, this movie is a 2000s movie, and that means humorously cheesy looking outfits and dialogue. But honestly that kind of adds to the movie, and the guy friends in the movie were unironically very funny. This movie is no masterpiece, but it was a pleasant watch and I would 100% watch it again and probably enjoy it even more. I was very happy to have finally watched it!",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

It's the simple guy makes a bet that he can get the girl to fall in love with him so he can get a promotion, while girl does everything to turn a guy away in 10 days for her ""how to"" column. Guess what, they fall in love and a big fight breaks out (while trying to sing a duet...which is not funny at all), but she does the right thing by changing her article to a story about how ""he's the only guy she's ever fallen for"", blah blah blah. Anyways this movie is pretty bad, and here's why. The couple of Mc Conaughey and Hudson doesn't work that well (you have to have this to have a good romantic comedy). It's not particularly bad, but you see as acting not very believeable. Everytime I see Kate Hudson, I'm thinking this girl looks like she's 12.  Also this movie portrays men as very ignorant, and easy to manipulate.Every guy in this movie is mindless and easily swayed by a woman. True maybe, but I don't know any movies where anything like that is implied about women.The story is generally boring and drags on, and drags on.There isn't anything you haven't seen before.As far as the good things, (and they are few) I must start with Adam Goldberg and Thomas Lennon. I am huge fans of both, and they have some good one liners as Mc Conaughey's friends that do just enough to keep you awake. Shalom Harlow, enough said.Also some of the stuff Kate Hudson does is pretty funny (especially the Celine Dion concert and family album), but any real guy would have sent her packing if not before then, by then for sure. Kate Husdon was ok (I'm not a fan at all), I mean I was expecting horrible, but she had moments. None of this quite saves the movie, however.Anyway, I did take one thing away from this movie.

In fact, it goes one further to show us that, even though we do the wrong things sometimes, love conquers all.  Kate Hudson is an exceptional actress with great comedic timing as she volleys great one liners off McConnaughey's character.
I loved this movie for what it is...an hour and fifty minutes of laughing till it hurt and crying because you can't laugh anymore.  The general idea of the film: a writer, played by Hudson, has the wonderful idea to write a column about how women ruin relationships by doing things that we all do at one point or another.  She says she can get a guy to dump her in ten days. At the same time, an advertising representative, played by McConnaughey, takes a bet with his fellow employees that he can get a woman to fall in love with him in ten days.  The rest of the film is the two main characters doing their best to win their respective bets and ultimately failing miserably in the end, when they eventually fall in love.Don't go expecting to see an Oscar winning film about love and relationships.

The person who played the guy does a terrible job in his role not to mention the horrible job done by the person who played the girl.The plot is as typically plain and simple as can be with love stories: boy loves girl, girl unfaithful to boy: girl becomes faithful to boy, boy and girl live happily ever after.The directing was horrible. About half of the time, the actors were looking at the screen.

I had to take the headphones off and look out through the window just to shield me from the awful thing before me. It was designed as a girl-movie, but if i were a girl I would get offended from it.

289,slyfoot3,How to Lose my Interest in 10 Minutes,4,30 April 2004,"Bear in mind that I'm not categorically opposed to chick flicks. As far as I'm concerned, ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Titanic"" were watchable movies. But to me, chick flicks are movies that are best watched with a girlfriend. If I'm alone, they are definitely not my cup of [herbal tea] coffee. This movie pretends to be something other than a chick flick, but when it comes right down to it, it's about as predictably chick flick-ish as ""What Women Want.""Matthew McConaughey plays the ambitious and manipulative advertising executive who makes a bet that he can make Kate Hudson [the senior prom queen!] fall in love with him in order to win a diamond advertising account. Kate Hudson plays the ambitious and manipulative reporter whose job it is to snag a guy with charm and sweetness, turn into a psycho hose beast to make the guy dump her, in order to write a story called ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days."" So they manipulate! They scheme! They play charming and sadistic mind games with each other! Neither one of them knows they're being played like a violin! But, get this... they both really have hearts of gold and despite all of their machinations, they fall for each other!!And I'll bet nobody who watched the movie could've guessed that would happen!Oh, don't get me wrong, there's a few mildly funny bits, like when Hudson names McConaughey's member ""Princess Sophia."" At which point McConaughey objects that it should be called something more masculine, such as ""Krull the Warrior Barbarian"" or some such thing. But most of the gags just didn't strike me as funny. Yappy dogs that pee on pool tables are not funny, because pool tables are a serious business. (Heh!) Pretending to weep in a restaurant while telling the waitress and other ayngry lookyng womyn that your boyfriend thinks you're fat, when you are obviously built better than a statue of Aphrodite is not funny either. The elderly wife of a diamond executive flirting shamelessly with McConaughey was more yark-inducing than a bottle of ipecac. Maybe a lot of other men or women found this stuff to be hilarious, but I've read funnier installments of Hagar the Horrible in the Sunday Comics section.The cliches are sprinkled throughout the movie like rice at a wedding. You've probably seen the Scheming Reporter With The Heart of Gold in other movies, such as ""Mr. Deeds"" or ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" among others. And for the love of all that is holy, why does Hollywood keep resurrecting The Bet That Goes Bad plot that should have stayed dead with ""She's All That"" and ""Not Another Teen Movie?!"" I dunno, but these plots are like randy zombies that keep rising from the dead so that they can skull**** you over and over and over again.Naturally we have the revelatory scene where He Learns She Is Tricking Him, and She Learns He Is Tricking Her. Kate Hudson doesn't exactly get to be prom queen, but she gets to wear an outrageously expensive diamond necklace that reminds you of a scene in ""Pretty Woman."" After they find out they've been tricking each other, they have a duet where they extemporaneously sing accusations at each other that reminds you of a cross between ""Ally McBeal"" and the trash-talking from White Men Can't Jump. Okay, maybe I'm reaching a little too far for my analogies here, but screw it, I'm tired.And finally there's the obligatory chase scene: ""Oh my God she's moving to Washington, so now he's got to chase her cab on his motorcycle before she gets to the airport to let her know he loves herrrrr!"" Trust me, you've seen this scene played out in a dozen teen and adult romantic comedies, and it's utterly missable here. McConaughey reads Hudson's magazine article ""How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days"" which is so saturated with sugary pathos that it will definitely remind you of Drew Barrymore's newspaper article in ""Never Been Kissed.""Now you may be thinking ""If you had such a low opinion of this movie, why did you watch it until the end?!"" And I have a great answer. It was because I wanted to see how many times I could catch this movie ripping off another movie. And besides, I felt like an ambitious reporter taking notes at the scene of a really bad plane crash. I really couldn't have cared less whether handsome Matthew and pretty Kate got together or whether they died in a freak accident involving high voltage electric eels. Actually, the latter would have been a more interesting ending. The irony of it all is that the movie beats you over the head that Matthew and Kate are playing a game of 'bull****' with each other by having Kate visit Matthew's parents where they actually play a card game called Bull****! Man, I never would have gotten the message if it weren't for the card game...!So my final score for this movie is 4 stars out of a best possible 10. And since I  took the time to write all of this up for my blog, I thought I would go ahead and vent my annoyance with this movie on IMDB. You know, as a public service.I mean, not everybody enjoys a game of Bull**** played this badly.

One evening she caught me in a mellow mood and I watched it with her.To say it is contrived is an understatement. To say it is generally predictable is to state the obvious. It is a piece of fluff romantic comedy familiar to viewers of old movies. But there are a lot of people who LIKE fluff, and frankly, I think we will probably watch it again some day.The writing was occasionally witty, often funny, and sometime knee-slappingly hilarious, without degenerating into the completely silly. The chemistry between Kate and Matthew was great, and their performances were what made this movie rise above the mediocre.Don't waste your time with this movie if you insist on depth or insight into universal truths - it ain't happenin'.

However once I got it home and watched it, I was pleasantly surprised. Although the plot was somewhat predictable, there were some surprises from many characters. I expected both Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson to be annoying, but they acted supremely well, and the bar scene with the impromptu karaoke was, although painful to watch and listen to, hilarious in its own way. The only flaw in this movie was its apparent lack of creativity in most of the ""tender"" scenes. I mean, come on, falling in love with the guy after you meet his parents?! Jeez.

Thoroughly planned and put together in form of a great entertaining plot. Just try to see how many adults aim to pass time and have fun dating while ending in failed relationships. The movie shows how to look deeper into the other person to see if he/she is the right person for you !!! How: by being patient, tolerant, loving and building on positive aspects instead of running away. When all is done it can be a happy experience. Also, it gives you a warning to see if you may be doing something wrong and blame yourself, instead of blaming the other person. When you do that you can start by doing self refining to bring the best in the other guy. JUST TRY TO DO JUST THAT TO BE HAPPY IN RELATIONSHIPS - a subtle lesson learned form the movie.

Mde in 2003, the movie is starring Kte Hudson, in a role of a journalist and Matthew McConaughy, in the role of an executive advertiser.The movie is based on a short cartoon book of the same name by Michele Alexander and Jeanne Long. The plot revolves around our main characters, Andie Anderson, who is a writer for a woman's magazine called Composure as the ""How to..."" girl and Benjamin Berry, the advertising executive for sports. Everything becomes quite gripping once the acting begins. Andie is setting herself a goal for her new article: How To Lose A guy in 10 Days. At the same time, Benjamin makes a bet with his boss, saying that he can make any girl fall in love with him. The riveting party begins really, when the two of them end up together, without knowing about each other's plans. How will everything end? In burning flames. One of the things that I have loved about the acting,or just this movie in general, is that the main characters are absolutely charming together, let aside the fact that both of them are stunning. Although, the romcom does have a few bad sides too.Even though the action is convultet and the whole story is pretty cheesy and light- hearted, the script is a bit too predictable and also, it has a silly premise.

Kate Hudson works for some woman magazine and she notices some of her friends are unlucky with men, so she comes up with this idea for an article called How To Lose a Guy in Ten Days. This involves her finding some Guinea pig (McMonaughey), start dating him then try to see how quickly she can put him off. And her editor approves it.The characters are totally unrealistic. For example, Kate Hudson, while pretty hot, is annoying as hell (on purpose- see above comment on plot).It's not Shakespeare so the acting doesn't really come into it.I laughed out loud at a couple of scenes- but it was mainly at how predictable it is.
