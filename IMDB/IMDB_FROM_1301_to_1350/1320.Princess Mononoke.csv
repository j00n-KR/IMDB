0,MartinHafer,One of the only Miyazaki films that disappointed me,6,11 June 2007,"Every movie viewer has different tastes and sometimes a film appeals to one person and not another, or vice-versa. I know that this film set attendance records in Japan and is adored by many and I will admit that TECHNICALLY it is a super well-made film--with nice animation throughout--and in many ways better than the average Disney film. However, despite all this, I just felt very little connection to PRINCESS MONONOKE as the story didn't interest me very much and lacked the charm of other Miyazaki films. Apart from the cute little forest spirits, it was obviously a very adult film and was 180 degrees different from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, my personal favorite Miyazaki film. So, if you like the cute style Miyazaki films like me, you'll probably not appreciate this film as much as others who want a film with an agenda that focuses on nature and conservation. As for me, I don't want a message film--I want one that is just plain fun.",Princess Mononoke
1,TheLittleSongbird,Absolutely breathtaking!,10,4 August 2009,"Princess Mononoke is one of the best animated movies I have seen in a long time, and is up there with Studio Ghibli's best along with Spirited Away. I will say I am probably biased, as I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan, and love all of their films, I even like Cat Returns, which along with PomPoko is considered as one of the weaker Ghibli efforts. The animation in Princess Mononoke is absolutely stunning, with rich detailed backgrounds and brilliant character animation. The image of the Stag actually made my jaw drop. The music is fantastic as well, and although environmentalism is a subject matter very difficult to get right, what the filmmakers succeeded in doing was making a highly intriguing story that was not only original but succeeded in not being preachy at all. The film is also helped by the high calibre vocal talents of Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton et al (voicing quite remarkable characters) and a strong script. True, some of the images like the Demon Worm, may frighten younger viewers, but it is fair to say they were very powerful. All in all, Princess Mononoke is breathtaking and I recommend it highly. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Princess Mononoke
2,Leofwine_draca,Starts off great but loses its way,4,14 January 2011,"I'm not a huge fan of anime, so I'm not the best person to review this film. Nonetheless I found myself watching it to find out what all the fuss was about.Initially, I found the film gripping. The old-fashioned animation felt fresh and I loved watching the colourful panoramas play out on screen. The early scenes involving the terrible forest monster chasing the film's hero were vivid and exciting; then Princess Mononoke is introduced.Gradually, I lost interest in the film. I found the story far too slim to support the lengthy running time. Myriad characters are introduced and underdeveloped, and the emphasis seems to be on repetitive action involving the different factions battling each other. Certain sequences are certainly captivating on the animation front - especially the huge, translucent forest god creature - but the story just didn't keep my attention.",Princess Mononoke
3,SnoopyStyle,some great concepts but dialog needs work,7,18 June 2015,"In feudal Japan, Ashitaka protects his village and kills an attacking demon boar. Part of the curse infects his arm. Village elder tells him to travel west to find a cure and encounters a monk who tells him about the great forest spirit. In Irontown, he finds leader Lady Eboshi who freed girls from the brothels and trying to perfect her guns. She is cutting down the forest and killing its animals. Her holy grail is to cut off the head of the forest spirit. She is opposed by animals of the forest and Princess Mononoke who was raised by wolves.I really like the spirits of the forest. I wonder if the movie needs a true villain. Lady Eboshi is more of a Captain Ahab character. The conflict doesn't have the same punch. The other main problem is the clunky dubbed dialog. It really takes work to make the dialog sound natural and not just simple translations. Overall, this has some great imaginative concepts and spirits. This is a special animated movie.",Princess Mononoke
4,kosmasp,Eco War,10,10 August 2020,"Studio Ghibli proved time and time again, that you can make animated movies that speak to all ages. Now of course that is also true for many Pixar movies or other studios. So I'm not trying to knock down other peoples efforts, if I see one I love I'll say so at that movies site. So me gving this the credit it deserves, is not even close to me dishing out critique on others.Especially not because of the content. While I do love it when there is an eco message in the movies (and that's another thing with Studio Ghibli, or rather was, since they retired), it doesn't mean I can't enjoy a silly animated movie too (whatever it may be, Pets, Despicably me and so forth). Having put that out of the way, there are so many things included here, that even if you didn't know it was from Studio Ghibli, they have their way of telling stories, of animating them, of putting characters into them (and into peril). Mostly with a lot of innocence, but also a lot of violence too. They don't shy away from showing certain aspects of life (like death, the circle of life, with blood and all).So if you can bare that, the struggle is real and it is very well made. Tension from start to finish, with quite some ambiguity too ...",Princess Mononoke
5,classicsoncall,"""The Forest Spirit gives life and takes life away"".",8,12 January 2015,"A difficult story to follow and decidedly scary animation at times makes this more an adult film than one for younger fans. It's not too hard to follow in the early going but when the hero Ashitaki makes his way East to the land of the Forest Spirit he's faced with choices that put him on questionable sides of relationships already formed. While trying to save his own life endangered by a poisonous encounter with the boar demon Nago, his overriding mission is to 'see with eyes unclouded by hate'. For this he must valiantly strive to understand the motivations and prerogatives of those he meets, including monk Jigo, Lady Eboshi of Irontown and the wolf princess San, a human raised by wolves. In turn, each of these individuals comes to understand that good and evil are not mutually exclusive character traits, but exist in all to varying degrees. The way this all plays out can be confusing and is not made easier by the depiction of characters like Moro, the large threatening white wolf who by design one would consider a male, but in actuality is the mother of San. It's an intricately woven tale and loyal fans of anime will find it spellbinding, though I must admit, for myself it took a concerted effort to follow and understand.",Princess Mononoke
6,gavin6942,Japanese Cartoon Classic,7,4 December 2014,"On a journey to find the cure for a Tatarigami's curse, Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of a war between the forest gods and Tatara, a mining colony. In this quest he also meets San, the Mononoke Hime.While Americans rarely see much for cartoons beyond the world of Walt Disney (or perhaps Don Bluth), we can thank fantasy author Neil Gaiman for getting this Japanese film properly released in the states. Between ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"", there is much to be seen in the way of Japanese animation beyond the omnipresent anime.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called Princess Mononoke ""a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year."" He is not alone in that sentiment. Almost twenty years later, the film has not decreased in its critical praise.",Princess Mononoke
7,jboothmillard,Princess Mononoke,8,15 August 2006,"I saw Japanese cartoon Spirited Away from Studio Ghibli before this film, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and I was fascinated to see another original animated story with the same imaginative style, dubbed into English. Basically a possessed boar tries to attack a small village, and as the one who defeated him, the creature infects young Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) with an incurable disease. The only way eh may be able to cure his curse is to travel far east and find either the deer God, who makes all plant life grow, or Princess Mononoke, aka San (Claire Danes), raised by wolf Gods and leading the forest animals in the war. Ashitaka is also trying to intervene with the war between the forest and mining colony Tataraba, as they fight for freedom and resources, with all sorts of weird and wonderful characters, creatures, spirits and Gods getting involved. Also starring Gillian Anderson as Moro, Minnie Driver as Lady Eboshi, Jada Pinkett Smith as Toki, Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo, Keith David as Okkoto and Futurama's John Di Maggio as Gonza. The story is a little strange, but bare in mind it is Japanese, but with good dubbing voices and aspiring animation, you'll enjoy the experience. It was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, and it was number 43 on Film 4's 50 Filsm To See Before You Die. Very good!",Princess Mononoke
8,Tweekums,A brilliant animation,10,5 May 2008,"I'd heard good things about this film before seeing it and was not disappointed. The animation and story are excellent as one would expect from a Hayao Miyazaki film. Be warned however that this film isn't as gentle as his other films, we see several people having their heads and limbs removed although this is not shown in graphic close-up.I liked the fact that the conflict between the villagers and the forest creatures wasn't depicted as a clear cut case of good versus bad and like most of Miyazaki's films it has strong female characters that are neither damsels in distress nor trying to marry their Prince Charming like many western animated heroines.The film opens with a possessed giant boar thundering out of the forest and attacking a village. The boar is slain by Prince Ashitake but not before it wounds him. He is told that the found is part of a curse that will ultimately kill him if he doesn't leave his village and seek out the Deer God in forests far to the west.When he gets there he finds the forest creatures in conflict with the inhabitants of a village who are clearing areas of forest to find ore for their iron works. It turns out that Lady Eboshi, the leader of the village, had fired the shot that had caused the boar to be cursed. She is not a typical film villain though as she is very protective of her village and employs former prostitutes and lepers who wouldn't be treated so well elsewhere.Fighting against her is San (Princess Mononoke) a girl that has been raised by the Wolf goddess Moro in the forest and despises humans, and various forest creatures. When she attacks the iron works in a plan to kill Lady Eboshi, Ashitake intervenes to stop them killing each other. As he is taking San out of the village he is seriously wounded but she takes him to the deer god who cures this wound but not the curse.As well as these protagonist there is Jigo who has been employed my the emperor to bring back the head of the deer god as he believe it will give him the power over life and death.I can't comment on the quality of the English dubbing as I've only watched the subtitled version so far.",Princess Mononoke
9,ma-cortes,Riveting and marvelous cartoon movie by the genius Hayao Miyazaki,8,12 October 2007,"This magnificent cartoon movie concerns Japanese legends , it begins when Ashikata, a prince warrior is wounded by a cursed giant boar . He attempts to encounter some way to heal incurable curse inflicted . Ashikata saddled in his red deer goes to the east, where finds the Iron Town , ruled by Lady Ebosi confronting Sam , the princess Mononoke, a human girl raised by wolves . Ashikata encounters in the middle of fighting among the forest animals : large wolves, giant boars and humans : emperor Mikado soldiers , Lady Ebosi soldiers and Shogun army . Furthermore, in the forest finds the deer god and spirits called Kodamas .This wonderful film is plenty of fantasy , adventures, drama, spectacular combats and with ecological message . The picture is narrated with sensibility and sense of wonder and quite entertaining, though isn't apt for small kids but contains graphic violence . It's a deep critical about nature exploiting and killing the forests for the encroaching civilization represented by an iron mining town that cause a damage environment . This stunning film, though a bit too long, converted the first of any kind to gross over the box office in Japan and around the world. The motion picture was splendidly realized by Hayao Miyazaki , he personally corrected or redrew more than 80,000 of the film's 144,000 animation cels . Being accompanied by sensitive music score composed by his usual musician , Joe Hisaishi. Miyazaki also directed other excellent cartoon movies as ¨Howl's moving castle¨ , ¨Chihiro¨ , ¨Porco Rosso¨ and ¨My neighbour Tororo¨ . Rating : Sensational and fantastic , it's a masterpiece cartoon movie.",Princess Mononoke
10,Quinoa1984,mind-shattering anime; my favorite of Miyazaki's films,10,11 June 2006,"Some might watch Princess Mononoke and find ambiguity at times. It's goes beyond formula into something that challenged me, the interplay between the forces of nature where sometimes the seemingly 'good' side is not what it seems, until the bigger, darker picture comes into view. It's a purely imaginative effort, with a level of dramatic- more over cinematic- power that I'd compare with Kurosawa on a level. Princess Mononoke, in its uncompromising way, details the violence without pulling away while also being rather anti-violent in the process. It is also hard to pinpoint on any one level. Visually it's got so much going on to practically experience the abstractions that Hayao Miyazaki folds up into the rest of the story. The story itself trails along with the best of epic fantasy, with this crucial, earth-shattering quest that works on that level of action-adventure (possibly more for adults despite the PG-13 rating here in the States) as well as the mythological side of things. Some have written that it is a bit of a complex film in structure and storytelling, bordering on confusing. I would disagree, though I can see what they mean- you have to pay closer attention than usual of more American films. But on a more profound level, if one could call it such, it's really not hard to follow.The hero of the film, interesting enough, is the type of tragic hero, though with one clear sight amid the chaos on the two sides he encounters- peace. He is cursed by a sort of wormy-jelly demon that runs unyielding in the darker recesses of the world. He searches for something to rid him of his scars while on the human side at some points (mostly dominated by the women impressed- or against- his skills), and with those of the wolves on the other side. The title character is part of the latter, though also human, bringing a little more of the underlying symbolism with a character. Then there are also the boars ready to destroy the humans, even to their demise. Amid the battles that rage on, leading to the significance of a certain 'Deer God' as the centerpiece of the balance of the forests and civilizations, not too much is made explicit. At the same time, the side taken by the cursed hero is even questioned by one character, and with that part connected with the others the story trumps what could have been a kind of smothering over-symbolic representation into what is necessary and spectacular about the film.In fact, I would estimate on just the near bravery of what Miyazaki is achieving in the film, it's one of the best films of its kind. And 'of its kind' in this case is the animated film that breaks conventions and the typical 'good vs. evil' logic. Many times the suddenness of things had me wide-eyed, and each creature or little variance on the creations- both good and evil- are elaborated with out compromise. The digitally-animated worm-Jelly type monsters are some of the more memorable ones, to be sure, as they book-end the picture in different extraordinary ways (the climax in particular probably ranks with the best of the last decade or so). The tiny bobble-headed alien creatures are also a delight as they rattle and gather and multiply and flee all around; this is the kind of scene that is dream-like to a truly weird and bright sensibility. And many scenes that have more of that samurai-movie quality to them (again, Kurosawa) are extremely well-done on their own as then they become mixed around again with the fantasy elements.To say that the film is really a 'family' film might be not entirely accurate, as some of the battle and attack footage is pretty graphic in its own ways, if not as much as other more adult anime like Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll. There are even moments I would say that, had I been little and watching some of the more twisted and macabre scenes, I might have cried from it. But this is a credit to Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli; for older kids this could mark as something that is, indeed, foreign to their expectations, at least American ones. It is a work of art, not just animation, that takes chances and isn't afraid to go for the right twists and leaps of creation and at the same time keeping its message noticeable but not overbearing. It's a film I can't wait to see again, and likely my favorite of the filmmaker's too, with the same cinematic drive as in the other works I've seen but reaching the ambitious heights it intends.",Princess Mononoke
11,sunwarrior13,A Landmark Japanese Anime,10,7 March 2012,"Princess Mononoke is an epic Japanese animated historical fantasy feature film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli. ""Mononoke"" is not a name, but a general term in the Japanese language for a spirit or monster.Directed by renowned animator Hayao Miyazaki, this anime has broken a number of box office records in its native Japan. Essentially a statement on the ecological devastation brought on by human advancement, the story follows the battle between Princess Mononoke and a mining village.Princess Mononoke is a period drama set specifically in the late Muromachi period of Japan but with numerous fantastical elements. The story concentrates on involvement of the outsider Ashitaka in the struggle between the supernatural guardians of a forest and the humans of the Iron Town who consume its resources. There can be no clear victory, and the hope is that relationship between humans and nature can be cyclical.Miyazaki's exceedingly imaginative, beautifully realized animated epic adventure has been adapted into English with tact and talent.The imagery, ranging from sublime mountain-smashing power to firefly delicacy (individual waterdrops splashing on a rock) is exuberant and intoxicating.Even when animals speak, lip sync is avoided; they seem to be communicating almost telepathically, and one seldom feels that they're contradicting their animal natures.With its epic story and breathtaking visuals, Princess Mononoke is a landmark in the world of animation.",Princess Mononoke
12,preppy-3,"Long, dull, badly dubbed",5,8 November 1999,"THIS is one of the most popular Japanese movies of all time???!!! Yes, there's some excellent animation and enough plot for 7 films BUT, not all the animation is good, the plot isn't exactly interesting and gets real silly at times (I gave up when the tigers and boars started having conversations), and the film is WAY too long (130 minutes). Also, the dubbing of the American voices doesn't help at all. The only one who works is Billy Cudup who voices the young hero--his voice fits perfectly. Billy Bob Thornton is horrible--his Texas accent sounds a little out of place in ancient Japan! (Also his character makes no sense and disappears completely in the middle of the movie). Claire Danes makes the princess sound like a spoiled brat and Minnie Driver's English accent sound uproarious on an evil(?) Japanese queen. That's the problem, she reads her lines so unsurely I didn't know how to take them! This is definitely a movie that lost A LOT in the translation. Also there's some real gruesome violence, so this isn't exactly for the kids. A waste of time unless you're amine fan.",Princess Mononoke
13,grantss,Okayish...as a kid's movie,5,6 March 2016,"Okayish...as a kid's movie.Set in a fantasy world, a young man, Ashitaka, is injured defending his village from a giant pig-like demon. The prognosis for his injury is that it will deteriorate and eventually kill him. He can be saved if he finds the cure, which will require a long quest...Pretty much your standard Hayao Miyazaki movie. Good set up, with a fair degree of intrigue. However, the intrigue dissipates quite quickly as the movie degenerates into a long, rambling adventure with no real themes emerging. Add in lack of character depth and thus lack of character engagement and you have: random plot, shallow characters, no profundities - a movie lacking in substance. So, not ideal for intelligent adults.Kid's should enjoy it, though the longish running time may hinder that.",Princess Mononoke
14,Boba_Fett1138,A beautiful blend of an adventure and fairytale.,9,3 July 2012,"You really don't have to be into anime to appreciate some of the movies that the genre has to offer. Some of them are being simply so good and captivating that basically everybody should be able to get grabbed by it. And I feel that this is one of those movies, that is being a great blend of adventure and fairytale elements.It's really a movie that speaks to your imagination. It's set in a fantasy world, that still feels and looks a lot like our world and the movie is literally loaded with some great and impressive looking fantasy creatures, with the one even bigger and more amazing than the other. In essence this is a mankind versus nature type of movie, in which nature does a lot of fighting back! I can definitely see how ""Avatar"" got 'inspired' by this movie and it features some similar themes and at times also a similar type of atmosphere in it. And I should say though that I liked this movie far better than ""Avatar""! The themes worked out better and were overall more effective and as a whole the story of this movie worked out more pleasantly.I should admit though that the movie can get quite hard to follow at times, will all of its things that are happening and characters that are in it. But this is a 'problem' I have with basically every anime and it very rarely ever ruins the movie experience for me, so it's no complaint or problem really. The movie has some great strong characters in it that can hold their own, amidst all of the great and powerful looking creatures in this movie. And there really are a whole bunch of characters in this movie but this never becomes anything distracting and the movie also never looses its focus. All thanks to some great storytelling skills of course, by Hayao Miyazaki.The animations are absolutely great looking and help to give the movie a great and effective fantasy atmosphere. What I also like about it is that's being such an easy thing to exaggerated things when your animation it, especially all of the action but everything in this movie feels 'real' and doesn't goes over-the-top with things, despite the presence of lots of fantasy elements and characters in it.Another thing worth mentioning is the musical score by Joe Hisaishi. Some great stuff!Whether you like anime or not, this is a great fantasy-adventure movie for everybody, everywhere!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.nl/",Princess Mononoke
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Not what I expected,8,11 March 2012,"When the young warrior Ashitaka protects his village from a Forest-God-turned-demon, the curse that had gripped it infects him, threatening his life. For the protection of his kin and in order to revert this process, he leaves on a journey. He finds a young woman running a lead mill crafting rifles, with ambitions of rule and no care for the damage she does to nature(and he is suffering some of the consequences). And thus we get the not-so-subtle message(hint: she represents mankind). ""Can't we all just get along"" is the idea, but it does actually take the problem more seriously(with a mature sensibility) than other of these, such as Dances With Wolves, Pocahontas, and most recently, Avatar. This also gets into the theme of anger and hate being self-destructive, not only harmful to one's surroundings. There are a lot of concepts in this, and fully comprehending and following it may require several viewings, time devoted to piecing it all together, and prior knowledge and understanding of Japanese culture. This is not for children, or even teens, but adults, setting it apart from every other Miyazaki production I've seen, which is nearly all of them. The acting is very good, and I urge you to watch this with subtitles, not dubbed. I do wonder why they did not sync up the animals, unlike the humans. The animation is excellent, with memorable designs, and mood expertly built by, among other things, the right amount(and tone, nuance) of light and dark(it also knows when and how to use sound, as well as silence). There is a bit of action, and it's intense, visually appealing and well-choreographed. Sans credits, this is 124 minutes long. The DVD comes with trailers for Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro, Porco Rosso, Ponyo, this and Howl's Moving Castle, 2 Promos(coming to a running time of 8 minutes), 3 teasers(2 minutes put together) and 6 TV spots(totaling at 2 minutes). There is a lot of disturbing content, and, what seems somewhat gratuitous, a little violence, blood, gore and hints of sexuality. I recommend this to fans of Anime and those who want films that deal with the environment. 8/10",Princess Mononoke
16,neil-476,"Excellent, but not for everyone",8,11 December 2011,"Princess Mononoke, like most of Studio Ghibli's output, has a Japanese sensibility which is quite alien to a western audience which has grown up on Disney and Looney Tunes. The story hardly matters - the striking visuals rule.The story is perfectly fine, though: its vague ecological message survives the other-wordly weirdness of demons, forest gods, and warring factions kept apart by a pair of unlikely peace brokers.But it looks terrific - character design, backgrounds and animation are all first rate. And its weirdness is part of its appeal. There's no guarantee that you will enjoy it but, if you give it a chance, there is a lot to enjoy here.",Princess Mononoke
17,morrison-dylan-fan,My 5th fav film of all time.,10,5 February 2014,"For the first (and thankfully up to now,only time) time ever,I found myself in 2009 becoming completely disinterested in seeing films/TV shows,listening to new music and reading fiction novels,due to none of them really connecting with me at that point in time.Searching round for some DVD's to pick up for a friends birthday in late 2009 at a local HMV,I found myself strangely taken by the cover of a Japanamation title.With having never heard of the film before,I was caught by surprise,when I started to get a strong feeling that I had to pick up the DVD right away.Watching the DVD later that night,I found myself being left breathless by writer/director Hayao Miyazaki's complex,yet human plot,and also Studio Ghibli's, (the studio which Miyazaki founded) animation work being unlike anything that I had seen before.As I started to gather up titles to celebrate my upcoming 500th IMDb review,I decided that my 500th review would be the perfect time for me to take a look at my 5th fav film of all time,which led to me excitingly getting ready for a very special meeting with Princess Mononoke.The plot:Note:I was originally planning to watch the Japanese with English Subtitles edition of the title,but ended up watching the English language edition,when I discovered that the subtitles on the Optimum DVD did not match either the English or Japanese soundtracks (The DVD included subs for the 'mute' Japanese intro.) Attempting to stop a demonic boar god from reaching his village,Ashitaka grabs a weapon and kills the demon.Before taking its final breath,the demon wraps itself around one of Ashitaka's arm's and infects him. Relising that something has gone badly wrong,Ashitaka goes back to the village,and talks to the 'wise woman' Oracle.Shocked by how deep the demon's infection has gotten into his arm,Oracle tells Ashitaka that whilst the demon's power's will give him superhuman strength,the infection will soon cover the whole of his body and kill him.Giving Ashitaka some hope,Oracle tells him that he may be able to find a cure from the land that the god originated from .Deciding that this is his only option,Ashitaka heads out to the boar gods original location.Heading to his destination,Ashitaka runs into a monk called Jigo,who strongly advises Ashitaka to visit a nearby woodland area,which its claimed contains a mythical god called the Great Forest Spirit.Rushing to the woods,Ashitaka is stopped in his tracks by the remains of a battle that has taken place between the residents of Iron Town (led by Lady Eboshi) and a gang of wolves,led by a woman called San,whose main motive is to stop the gods from being killed,and the woods being destroyed by the people of Iron Town.Picking up the survivors,Ashitaka safely takes them back to Iron Town.Welcomed as an unexpected hero into the town which is run by former brothel workers,whose freedoms were paid for by Eboshi.Asked if there is anything that he needs,Ashitaka requests a meeting with Lady Eboshi.Hoping to arrange a peace deal between Eboshi and San,Ashitaka's hopes are left in tatters,when Eboshi, (who caused a boar god to be taken over by a demon,which would infect Ashitaka) tells Ashitaka that she is determined to get every piece of iron from the woods for her loyal towns people,and to also cut off the head of the Great Forest spirit.View on the film:Giving an intelligent cultural context in a narration adaptation by Neil Gaiman,each of the cast members give passionate performances,with Billy Bob Thornton giving the movie a soulful side as Jigo,and Billy Crudup brilliantly expressing Ashitaka's conflicting emotions on the deadly situation that he finds himself in.Joining the guys,Minnie Driver keeps away from giving Lady Eboshi a heart of iron by giving her a firm,but protective voice,with almost all of Eboshi's activates being linked to her wanting to do the best for the people of Iron Town.Perfectly matching her character design,Claire Danes gives a wild performance as San,with Danes showing the survival of the gods to be the thing that drives San's existence,whilst Gillian Anderson gives the film a meditating side,as the voice of the wolf god Moro.Personally drawing (or redrawing) 80,000 of the titles 144,000 animation cells,writer/directing auteur Hayao Miyazaki gives the last ever title to be filmed on plastic cells an astonishing send off.Showing no fear at all in making the movie 'adult',Miyazaki superbly gives each of the demonic gods a raw visceral edge by allowing blood to flow from every hole of their decaying bodies,with Miyazaki also showing a real eye for tough action scenes,as Ashitaka uses his demon powers to chop peoples arms off,and for decapitations.Contrasting the gory edges of the action scenes,Miyazaki shows an extraordinary eye for detail,with ever branch and leaf in the forest being individually drawn to beautiful detail that, gives the film a powerful Fantasy atmosphere,with Miyazaki also making the characters brilliantly fully dimensional, by allowing for all of their positive's and flaws to be expressed across their faces.Avoiding the risk of the screenplay becoming 'preachy',Miyazaki makes the environment issue one that is focused on the characters effects on the location,and not on the location itself.Keeping away from making Eboshi a boo-hiss villain,Miyazaki shows,that whilst Eboshi's battles are extreme,that they are firmly rooted to Eboshi wanting to make the residents of Iron Town's lives better.Giving Ashitaka an infection from the start,Miyazaki shows Ashitaka fight against his infection by developing a maturity in his complicated relationship with San,and also taking on the townsfolk and the woodland residence with an unwavering sense of determination,as Miyazaki reveals his Princess to be an unforgettable film.",Princess Mononoke
18,zetes,one of the best films i've ever had the chance to see,10,7 November 1999,"Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever witnessed. There has never been an animated film even close to this -- I kept thinking after I left the theater, how can Disney even have the guts to make another film after seeing this? Even live action movies pale in comparison to Princess Mononoke. There has never been a film to pay such close attention to details. Watch for the magnificent and subtle flying insects throughout the film, especially in the ancient forest, where bioluminescent dragonflies glide gently around the screen. There are thousands of subtleties such as this. You'd have to see it a dozen times to appreciate this film fully. Aside from it being the most beautiful film I've ever seen, it also has an enormously powerful script. The characters are some of the the most well rounded in all film. Ashitaka especially, the main character of the film, is so nuanced that he has become in my mind one of the great characters in film, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Jake LaMotta. I would compare him to Freder, the main character of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. His role in the film is a mediator between the forces of humans and the gods of nature. Both sides comment several times that Ashitaka must be on the other side, when he is trying desperately to convince everyone that there are no sides. Peace is the way. There is a little to be desired in the American voice talent. Claire Daines was certainly a wrong choice for San (Princess Mononoke), and Billy Bob Thornton just could not hide his southern accent, which made the character of Jigo seem more comical than he was probably supposed to be. Gillian Anderson's voice clashed with her character, the wolf god Moro, a bit. It hardly affected my passion. The film was so spectacular and beautiful that James Earl Jones could have voiced San and it would have detracted little. Definitely, though, I'm praying that they release the DVD with subtitle options. Anyway, Princess Mononoke is the best film of 1999, the best film of the 1990's, and, in my personal top ten list, no lower than #5, but closer to #2. 12 hours later and my heart is still beating with the power of Princess Mononoke! America: SEE IT!",Princess Mononoke
19,Mr-Fusion,The artistry here is astonishing,6,24 April 2017,"I guess you'd call what I'm doing a Studio Ghibli film quest, and ""Princess Mononoke"" was an interesting item to mark off. But it's not a favorite of mine. The movie's certainly ambitious, once again tackling an ecological story and adding a sense of ambiguity; good-and-evil isn't so simple, and the real struggle is for a balance between industry and nature. My problem (and I speak solely for myself) is that I couldn't get ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"" out of my head for most of this runtime. And I think that that film is entirely more potent with a well-defined heroine. Here, there's a split between Ashitaka, Lady Eboshi and Princess Mononoke, and even though the tone is definitely more adult (with the violence to match), the prior movie had the more effective characters. Is that fair? Maybe not, but again, it's just me. But like I said before, this is impressive on a technical level. 6/10",Princess Mononoke
20,Red-Barracuda,A beautifully executed film from Studio Ghibli,7,21 November 2014,"Animals, their gods and humans clash in this fantasy adventure from famed Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Consequently, nature vs humanity is a strong theme throughout Princess Mononoke, meaning that this is an animated movie with a definite message. Most of the humans, after all, are from a mining village who rape the earth, while the sympathetic people are Ashitaka, a boy who fights to bring peaceful co-existence between the opposing forces and Princess Mononoke who actively sides with the animal world and lives amongst them. It's quite clear, therefore, where the film's sympathies lie, although the ecological message is never delivered in a trite obvious manner and there are many shades of grey throughout.The tone overall is decidedly more mature than most animation and is one of the films from Studio Ghibli that goes for an older adult audience as opposed to the usual family friendly one. It's even quite violent in places, including several decapitations. But irrespective of the darker material it resembles Ghibli anime quite clearly. In any case this renowned animation studio had already released adult fare beforehand, anyone who has seen the harrowing Grave of the Fireflies will understand this. But in terms of visual artistry Princess Mononoke fits right in to the whole Ghibli cannon perfectly. In fact, this one has to be one of their greatest achievements on this front. The forest scenery is stunningly rendered and the invented creatures are consistently interesting. Of note are the wild boars, the night monkeys and the wolf god Moror but most spectacular of all is the deer-like god Shishigami - the colossal nightwalker. This latter being stalks the land in the twilight and generates a strange atmosphere and ambiance all of its own. The scenes towards the end involving it, illustrate the sheer imagination that Ghibli is famed for. The plot-line is not especially great if I am honest but it allows for the film to cover its themes successfully, while integrating them into a wonderfully rendered fantasy world. Like all Ghibli, it benefits considerably too from evolving unashamedly and organically from Japanese culture and mythology; this ensures that from a western perspective, it consistently remains unpredictable and fascinating.",Princess Mononoke
21,cherold,stunning,8,2 August 2005,"I was a little startled by Princess Mononoke. Having seen Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle and heard their director Miyazaki referred to as Japan's answer to Walt Disney, I wasn't expecting the considerable violence of this movie. It was appropriate for the movie certainly, but it sure startled me.But if you're not looking for a Disney flick, this is one impressive and wildly imaginative movie. Many scenes are absolutely amazing, and the last half hour is truly stunning, even though I watched it all on TV.The attitude of the movie is very interesting. This is basically technology vs. nature, but even though the film's sympathies lie more with living with nature, the technology side is not portrayed as evil but instead for the most part as good people with a different world view. The absence of black and white thinking in films is rare and always appreciated.",Princess Mononoke
22,ElMaruecan82,The Defying Creation about Deified Creatures...,10,26 June 2017,"I saw ""Princess Mononoke"" twice the same weekend but I'm not sure I grasped half of what makes it such a great movie. Even 'great' is too vague a word; so many 'great' movies are not one-tenth the film ""Princess Mononoke"" in style, content and universal implications. Even after two viewings, I can only provide a superficial overview on the story and a meager but enthusiastic review of what constitutes one of the best animated movies of the last decades. To think that the same year, Disney came up with ""Hercules"" gives you an idea of where the real magic of animation operatedthanks to the most imaginative creator and most accomplished artist of his generation: Hayao Miyazaki. Indeed, imagination and artistry never got along so well since Walt Disney. Now, to the story.Although set in medieval Japan, ""Princess Mononoke"" ventures between the realms of history and fantasy, in a universe where the spirits of a God-like Nature govern the lives of (precisely) all living creatures: animals, plants and even men, they all coexisted in harmony until the age of deforestation. The film opens when a wild demonically possessed creature attacks the village of Ashitaka. And the tone is set from the start: the monster looks like a giant boar recovered by a sort of tentacles looking like writhing snakes, the drawing dwarfs any CGI abomination. You might as well compare a Rembrandt with a 4-year old kid's painting. The film was made in the late 1990's at the dawn of the CGI frenzy and when 3D animation would drive half the box-office grosses, but all the special effects of the world will never hold a candle to the power of hand-painting. ""Princess Mononoke"", the highest-grossing movie in Japan but soon-to-be dethroned by ""Titanic"", required a level of precision that couldn't do without traditional drawing. Miyazaki resorted to computer for a few hundred shots, only 1% of celluloid, but it says something about the man's pragmatism as he could also embrace technology to keep a fair balance between his stylish and narrative visions.And it works. When Ashitaka defeats the monster, everything looks real and the injury resulting from the fight doesn't have the contrivance of a 'magical' plot device. Ashitaka's arm is infected by a mysterious curse that will ultimately cause his death although giving him temporary superpowers (like decapitating someone with his a simple arrow shot). The village's wise woman tells him he must be exiled for his own good, to save his arm with the help of the Gods of the forests. Then starts the heroic and epic journey of the young Prince. From what I read, a few words were mistranslated, he's not actually a Prince and the girl who gives him the talisman isn't his sister, they're actually lovers. It doesn't undermine the comprehension of the story but it shows that the film is impregnated by Japanese culture and some idioms might be lost in translation. Even the title is misleading: Mononeke doesn't refer to the name of the Princess, but her status as a ""possessed monster or outcast"", this description, from human perspective, isn't objective but it reflects her status as someone between two worlds. Her real name is San and she was raised by the Goddess-wolf. San is like a counterpart to Ashitaka, both human protagonists deeply related to the animal world, one by choice and one by fate. While San resents humans for their destructive actions and their effects on animals (we'll learn later that the boar-demon was cursed by a bullet lodged in his body), Ashitaka is a collateral damage of men's actions but he's incapable of hatred, and empathize with both animals' and men's pleas. As usual with Miyazaki, this is not your typical ""good vs. evil"" story. The closest character to a villain is Lady Eboshi, the chief of Irontown, and she cuts trees to make iron and build the fortress where many social outcasts, ex-brothel workers and lepers work in exchange of food and protection. Eboshi has understandable motives and she's also a powerful woman respected by men and therefore, needing to assert her authority. Even the main antagonist, Jiko-bo, a sneaky monk, has a mission: taking the head of the Forest Spirit for the Emperor, he's like a government worker, so to speak. Ashitara is like the centerpiece of an arena where creatures struggle to find peace and harmony; even the Gods Animals are unequally pacific. The environmentalist statements aren't spoken at the expenses of realism. We do root for Nature and accept Miazaki's protection of environment but there's the idea of people defending their own interests, for their own survival. It's not realism, but lucidity. But lucidity doesn't undermine the dazzling visuals: the forest looks majestic, the wolves have that furry amplitude that shows how determined they are, and the magic displayed whether to convey a sense of danger or beauty is hypnotically beautiful. But that's only the tip of the iceberg, there's more to see in the film. Even the romance between San and Ashirata is handled with a sense of maturity that respects the coherence of the plot and our intelligence. ""Princess Mononoke"" surpasses everything Disney made in the last years before and everything Peter Jackson will make, CGI can look fine but you're always tempted to cheat with it, computer does the trick. There was a screen writing manual titled ""Save the Cat!"" and explaining how most movies, especially on the field of animation and fantasy / sci-fi journeys were based on the same structure. I dare anyone to find a usual pattern in ""Princess Mononoke"", this is a film that defies all the conventions and where every frame is original and surprising. To put it simply, ""Princess Mononoke"" is a great animated film with a great story, can you ask for more?",Princess Mononoke
23,paul2001sw-1,Just a drawing...,9,5 December 2010,"I'm not normally a huge fan of fantasy, or of animation; but I'm prepared to make an exception for 'Princess Mononoke'. And not just because it's absolutely beautiful; but more because it has a level of moral ambiguity not normally seen in either of its two genres. The story features a protagonist who spends most of the story watching events he can't control; a town inhabited by vigorous ex-prostitutes, lepers, and useless men, led by a fearless warrior queen but whose future depends on environmental destruction; awesome, but vengeful and frequently misguided gods; a girl raised by wolves who hates humans; and various squabbling animals. Even the villain of the piece (and this is surely an obvious parable for own own world) is less a figure of evil but rather a buccaneering adventurer who puts his own self interest above the greater good. At first, watching a version dubbed into English, I was put off by the non-Japanese voices; but in time, I fell into the world portrayed anyway. And when, near the end, with their fates hanging in the balance, the hero puts his arm around the heroine, I found it strangely moving in a way that I didn't expect to feel about what is, after all, just a drawing.",Princess Mononoke
24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A tree falls in the woods...,8,24 March 2020,"'Princess Mononoke (1997)' is a story about humans vs nature, an age-old struggle here categorised by a literal war, that tries to implore a balance between the two intrinsically linked elements but never feels as though it's 'preaching'. The piece works as an epic adventure regardless of its real-life relevancy, chock-full of Studio Ghibli's signature strangeness and odd underlying charm. It's much more serious than the studio's usual stuff, though. Its beautiful animation is as often used to evoke fear as wonder, the piece being surprisingly heavy - and violent - for a 'PG' animated piece. This isn't a bad thing, depending on who you are, because it allows for a mature yet enjoyable tale. The thing is rich and exciting, building towards a genuinely tense finale. Its characters are also rather multi-faceted, never quite conforming to the expectation of their role. It's a really solid story with some great action, resonant themes and interesting animation. It's probably Miyazaki's finest work. 8/10",Princess Mononoke
25,ThomasDrufke,Fascinating Mythology,8,16 September 2016,"A visceral story from the brilliant mind of Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke is a joyous ride through the eyes of Ashitaka, a brave warrior who finds himself caught in the crossfire of relentless humans and vicious creatures of the forest.Speaking of relentless, even at over 2 hours long, this film flies by with brisk pacing and gorgeous animation by Studio Ghibli. For an animation film, the runtime is unusually long, but the epic scope and beautiful storytelling transcend typical animations. One of my first thoughts while watching was how good this story could be in live- action form. Even if it's a television series, the lore calls for this to be adapted into live-action.The mythology is incredibly well-realized and thought out as well. Each of the several sides to this ongoing battle against the forest have reason for fighting. Yes, Ashitaka is the protagonist, but I wasn't necessarily rooting for any particular side to win. That's when you know the characters have plenty of depth. My only real complaint here is that sometimes the dialogue comes out a bit dull and lacks the gravitas that the very scene calls for. Of course, this may only be in the English dubbed version that I watched, or the script. Either way, the story is brilliant, but the dialogue just didn't match it.Above everything else, Princess Mononoke is a special film. It transcends the usual tropes of animated films by being a viscerally graphic war film with plenty of heart and thought provoking ideas. It's no surprise this is praised as one of Miyazaki's very best films.+So different than any animated film+Meaningful violence+Interesting mythology+All characters have depth87/100",Princess Mononoke
26,gbill-74877,Beautiful and nuanced,8,25 April 2021,"There's so much to love about this Studio Ghibli production, with its beautiful animation and messages of environmentalism and co-existence. It starts off seeming like it will be another fantasy involving a young man going off to fight essentially as good vs. Evil, but we soon see it's not as simple as that. In fact, the character is more often a mediator, so much in the middle that others wonder whose side he's on, which I thought was a nice touch. There are two strong female characters on each side of the conflict, and I loved the nuance in that of Lady Eboshi, the leader of an iron works. She rescues girls from slavery and gives lepers jobs, seemingly a virtuous character defending her operation from the animals which threaten it, but we find that she's also ambitious and her campaign of deforestation is done with ultimate goal of power. She's doing what people do but it's destroying the ecosystem, which is then reacting. Meanwhile there are conflicts within both sides, e.g. Samurai vs. Ironworkers, and apes vs. Wolves vs. Boars. That makes the plot probably a little messier than it should have been, and a film with more action scenes (and associated carnage) than necessary, but it underscores the message that conflict is inevitable, and that mediation is critical to allow both sides to live in harmony. It's all wrapped up in creative visuals done with a wonderful aesthetic, making for an appealing film.",Princess Mononoke
27,ericstevenson,Best one this month!,10,16 May 2017,"Okay, I've changed my mind and my favorite movie for Anime Month is this one. It's pretty easy to imagine that a Miyazaki film would be my favorite for anime. What's really great is how gorgeously beautiful the animation is. Even when you get used to Miyazaki's artwork, you just still never stop being amazed at how beautiful it is. I remember reading a review of ""Pokémon 4Ever"" saying that it's obvious that director saw this movie. Yeah, it's very easy to see that as a ripoff to this movie. I mean, we feature a forest spirit and a lake that heals people and a character being absorbed into a monster.Wow, did they really think they could make something good out of a Miyazaki ripoff? Anyway, this actual movie is amazing. I heard that Miyazaki was good at romance, but honestly, I don't see that much romance in this or his other works. Still, it's a wonderful movie. One of the best parts is near the end, because of how realistic it is. It features the title Princess saying that she still doesn't trust humans but the main character is welcome to visit her in the forest while he goes back to the human world.The destroyed city is going to be rebuilt and I guess it's implied they're going to be better off this time. The spirit of the forest actually ends up dying. There's these great and truly frightening scenes where the giant boar is covered in these blood worm things. It's so powerful and horrifying. We get great battle scenes throughout the entire movie of course. It's cliché to teach about the environment, but this movie does it fine. Everything isn't perfect in the end, but at least we've learned something. ****",Princess Mononoke

The storyline was pretty good and of course, the graphics were too. I was very surprised to have found out the film was inspired by the Zelda series because of some scenes that honestly looked like it came from the video game!

34,sol-,Humans and Wildlife,7,2 September 2017,"Attacked by a wild boar and infected by the madness that drove the boar insane, a young warrior stumbles upon a war between human villagers and intelligent wildlife in this animated drama from the imagination of Hayao Miyazaki. The film benefits from having no clear-cut villains or heroes; both the humans and the wildlife merely want to use the same territory for their own means and the project as such comes with some positive ecological messages in terms of trying to be sustainable and live in harmony. The most fascinating character is the title one though - a human raised by wolves as one of their own. Oddly enough, considering that the film is named after her, the Princess is only ever a supporting character in the proceedings. Furthermore, the film only ever lightly touches on the intriguing personal identity issues that come with being raised as something that one is not. Fortunately, the infected warrior is a curious enough character with his resilience in the face of impending death that the film still chugs along well. It is also refreshing to see an animated fantasy film that dares to show graphic carnage in order further the story-line. If not quite as dark and impressively nightmarish as 'Watership Down', this Japanese offering certainly comes close to it. In short, this is a relatively engrossing tale if not nearly the best thing that Miyazaki has ever done.",Princess Mononoke
35,briancham1994,Tale of modernity,8,24 August 2020,"This film is a tale of ancient spirituality clashing with newfound modernity.

37,Rectangular_businessman,A masterpiece,10,12 June 2010,"Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by animation, I watched way too many cartoons and would often drawn them myself. I never thought of animation as ""real art"" or anything fancy, just one of life's simple pleasures. Sure Disney had made some ground-breaking animated features, and technology was allowing for more and more detailed and intricate animation techniques, but no animated film had ever moved me as much as a Godfather or Unforgiven or Dr. Strangelove, that is until one fine day in 1999. I was in high school, and Princess Mononoke was premiering at the Coolidge Theater in Brookline, I was pumped as I really enjoyed Castle in the Sky and Totoro, so I went to the theater with a few friends and was absolutely clown away for this. This film is so spectacular in almost every way and every piece comes together perfectly. The animation is top-notch, not that shoddy 1980's anime style, but the mind-blowing animation techniques that made Miyazaki the maestro his is today. The score by Joe Hisaishi is tremendous, though at times it may seem a bit overly dramatic (I mean this is an animated feature, not Lawrence of Arabia), but this is the ultimate animated epic, so it fits in well. The plot is dense and the characters are well-developed, there are no true ""good"" or ""bad"" guys in this film...and Miyazaki includes his favorite underlying theme of Man vs. Nature throughout. Some may argue that Spirited Away was Miyazaki's crowning achievement, but I believe that Mononoke Hime is his true Masterpiece.",Princess Mononoke
38,TheMovieDiorama,Princess Mononoke is Miyazaki's masterpiece.,10,28 February 2018,"I've found it, I've finally found it. Studio Ghibli's magnum opus. The greatest anime feature film I've ever seen. Possibly the best fantasy film I've seen as well. This, this is absolutely incredible. Flawless. The story involves a young warrior who is injured with a supernatural curse. He leaves his remote village in search of a remedy but is caught in the midst of a battle between humans and divine beasts. Depicting the clash between the natural ecological system and the modern urbanisation of mankind. Two opposing ideals and environments that struggle to cohabit in unison. An important environmental statement: be good to nature and nature will be good to you. A fundamental statement that doesn't at all feel preachy, but yet it's ever so present throughout every artistic scene. Strip away the fantasy elements and you are still left with a poignant plot that consistently engages throughout its runtime. Every scene matters, every scene builds upon each other like a stack of bricks to then culminate for an epic third act. The animation is stunning. A work of art. The imagination and creativity that is portrayed on screen is a wonder to behold, and will appeal to everyone. The English dub was well done, all the voice actors suited their roles. San's voice did take some time for me to warm to, but by the end I was on board. Surprisingly, this is an emotional journey. Towards the end where there are a few deaths, I actually felt saddened. The biggest impact of them all was actually the destruction of the environment, Miyazaki somehow creates a personality out of the forest to which I connected to it on an emotional level. Masterful work, it really is. Also, the musical score was mesmerising. Slight warning, its rated a PG but I think it will too much for younger viewers. Lots of severed limbs and bloody imagery that I'm sure will invoke nightmares. Princess Mononoke is the best Studio Ghibli animation I've seen, it's an epic masterpiece that everyone should watch. For that reason it gets the perfect rating.",Princess Mononoke
39,matthewssilverhammer,The Near-Perfect Synergy of Style and Substance,9,20 July 2018,"Don't be fooled by the outward appearances of Princess Mononoke. Don't be fooled by the Studio Ghibli tag, or the Disney distribution, or its princess-fantasy genre, or the animated format. This is far from a kid-friendly film. It's intentionally paced (aka ""slow), jarringly violent (decapitation, ripped-off limbs, intense physical transformations), and almost oppressively heavy in tone. It's also one of the most lush, colorful, and beautiful creations of Miyazaki's astounding career, combining his undeniable animation skill and boundless imagination with overwhelming success.
Oddly enough, Mononoke isn't our protagonist here. Instead we follow Ashitaka, a recently cursed Prince who, in his search for a cure, finds himself mixed up in a battle for the future of the forest and its inhabitants, both animal and spiritual. Its effortless mixture of compelling story, well-placed humor, naturalism and fantasy is like great literature, only told with unspeakably perfect hand-drawn animation. Each cartoon cel and 2D creation is given its own character, style and care. Possessed-like apes with blurry skin. Cute but unsettling forest nymphs with Picasso-inspired faces. Snake-like demons drowning giant boars, personified wolves and blood-covered humans with chaotic precision. 
Not that its all style and no substance. Miyazaki and writer Neil Gaiman are running the gamut on thematic presence here, much of which will be familiar specifically in the bible belt. Fate versus chance, the relentless power of hatred, the danger of false prophets, the difficult power of choosing good, life springing up from death, the frustration inherent in being an ephemeral creature. It's all presented with a wonderous mystery, only suffering from moments of over-explanation. Princess Mononoke represents an entirely imaginative spirit rarely surpassed in storytelling.",Princess Mononoke
40,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A fantasy fix you simply won't get any other way,7,28 January 2009,"No one tells a more imaginative, original story than Hayao Miyazaki. While fantasy is a genre with limitless potential, there's still nothing like one of Miyazaki's animated fairy tales and ""Princess Mononoke"" is one his finest.The story follows a young warrior named Ashitaka who gets bitten and cursed by some sort of forest demon. The wound is surely fatal unless he embarks on a journey to find a cure. In his travels, he stumbles across a town of iron miners who are seemingly at war with wild animals, namely a pack of wolves and their princess, San. Ashitaka must try to play peacemaker as the forest's deer god--who both sides seek out for different reasons--might be his only means of a cure.The animation that brings a world of fantasy but also of feudal Japan to life is excellent. So many of the creatures are transparent, the large demons and gods are drawn of individual organism-like things that all move on their own while also making up a whole. The work must have taken forever. The nature backgrounds are also beautifully drawn. While most of the work and figures are in traditional anime style, the magical creatures will amaze you and the action is particularly well-directed to enhance the visual experience.""Princess Mononoke"" is a film for those who either have an appreciation of anime or more simply, an appreciation for imagination. Miyazaki's deer god sweeping through the land, his forest demons consuming people, Ashitaka's living scar, etc. are all things that simply inspire the imagination in everyone.While the film leaves its biggest impression as just a one-of-a-kind fairytale, there is some definite effort made to show that this battle between the humans and the wild animals is representative of man's struggle with nature. It is a fantastical dramatization of how we often upset the balance and harmony between the two. For people who have been exposed to nothing but Western film with Western ideas, this is quite a refreshing theme rooted in Buddhist philosophy and other Eastern religions, but certainly one all cultures can understand.",Princess Mononoke

It's a historical fantasy adventure, it's a melodrama, it's a race against time. Its pace is wonderful, taking us climactically through the all-embracing, outspread scope of the story. It has heart, it has violence, it has visual beauty, it has internal conflict.What I like the most about Princess Mononoke is beyond all of these wonderfully delivered elements of a great movie. It's a movie about compassion and understanding towards animals. Yes, these animals are represented by gargantuan, violent beasts, but the movie is about human headstrong influence vs. animal outlook, sense, and behaviorism. It's about how astonishingly much more acute and attuned an animal's understanding is of the world's natural order than that of a human's.I think Princess Mononoke, while being a beautifully made action-adventure, it's an important film, especially for Miyazaki's younger fans.

43,Vartiainen,Life-affirming art,10,23 November 2014,"The magnum opus of director Hayao Miyazaki and one of the if not the best animation movie ever made. A film that children can watch no doubt, but which still deals with the themes of loss, sacrifice, the non-existent line between good and evil, war, death and the dying state of divinity and spirituality. It's a heavy movie, yet it's never so excessively dark and brutal that you couldn't show it to a twelve-year- old.For me, this is one of those perfect movies that you have the honour of coming across every once in a while.

45,jamesrupert2014,Beautiful and thoughtful tale of conflicting values,9,19 November 2020,"A Prince, wounded and cursed while fighting a demon, seeks answers and a cure in the forests to the west of his homeland. There he encounters a feral young women, the adopted daughter of a wolf-God, who is fighting to preserve the forest from encroaching human civilisation. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film is a stunning example of anime, with a rich palette and striking, memorable imagery (I especially liked the 'kodama', the odd, endearing little forest spirits). Although a clear message is sent about valuing the Earth and recognising the dangers of exploitation, the story is complex and ambiguous (especially compared to the simplistic morality plays usually pawned off as 'educational'). The look is typical of Ghibli anime (except Lady Eboshi, who looks a bit out of place) and, although the voices in the English version I watched were a bit bland, I found the characters engaging and interesting (although always secondary to the imagery). The music was also compelling and well matched to the mood and action. All in all, an excellent philosophical fantasy-adventure from the incomparable talents at Studio Ghibli.",Princess Mononoke
46,dfranzen70,"Princess Mononoke – it's not a name, it's a description",8,13 July 2016,"Hayao Miyazaki, the animation legend who brought to you such awesome films as Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, strikes again with this eco-friendly tale about the struggle between man, animal, and god within a deep, dark Japanese forest.Prince Ashitaka (voice of Billy Crudup) of the Emishi, stricken with a curse foisted upon him by a rampaging wild boar that was possessed by a demon, heads west upon his trusty golden elk Yakul to find a cure. He's also out to possibly save his people, as the appearance of the demonic boar portends grave consequences for the village – the gods and demons are reclaiming the forest.Ashitaka attempts to buy some food in a neighboring town with a gold nugget, but the shopkeepers do not quite believe that the nugget is a valid form of currency. Our fair prince is saved from further embarrassment by a monk named Jigo (Billy Bob Thornton), who offers his assistance to Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns from Jigo of a town called (in the English version, anyway) Iron Town, since they mine iron. Jigo also mentions that the forest gods still dwell around Iron Town, a fact that is certainly not lost on Ashitaka. He heads out the next morning.Meanwhile, a long column of men and oxen, carrying rice back to Iron Town to feed the denizens, is attacked by two giant wolves – one of whom bears a masked girl. Leading the men is Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), who orders her men to fire their brand-new muskets at the wolves. The wolves are driven off, but their mama, named Moro (Gillian Anderson) soon arrives and lays everyone to waste. Half of Lady Eboshi's men fall off the mountainside.Further down the mountain, Ashitaka hears the battle above and comes across two men in the river. He pulls them out (one unconscious, the other with a broken arm) and carries them both through the ancient forest to Iron Town. On the way to Iron Town, Ashitaka encounters the wolves and the girl by the river side. The girl is San, the Princess Mononoke, i.e., the Angry Princess. Why is she so angry? Because Lady Eboshi has been killing all of the animals, which has been causing the forest to fall into disrepair and has angered the forest gods. She kind of has good reason to be mad.The reception at Iron Town is mixed, as many distrust the newcomer Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns that everyone in the village helps mine the iron, with the women operating the mighty bellows themselves. Lady Eboshi also explains that San really has it in for her (because of the forest damage Eboshi's caused) and that when the Forest Spirit himself is dead, San will become human (although to the viewer she looks perfectly human as it is). San, raised by wolves, is not on board with this eventuality.All of which leads to everyone fighting everyone, with mass destruction guaranteed. Iron Town is under siege by Lord Asano and his samurai, who wish to control the iron ore. The Iron Town citizens are left to defend themselves against Asano while Eboshi and Jigo the monk seek out the Forest Spirit; Jigo has a letter from the Emperor himself that guarantees a large sum of money if Jigo can bring the Forest Spirit's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality). Then there are an entire tribe of huge wild boars who want to avenge the death of one of their own – the boar that wound up cursing Ashitaka to kick all of this off – as well taken on the humans for being humans. Oh, and apes who also want to kill the humans, particularly Ashitaka, whom they want to eat so they can gain his strength.There's plenty of action, in other words. In fact, the violence is a bit more explicit than you might expect in an animated film. When Ashitaka is first dealing with his curse, he fires an arrow at a soldier who is attacking him; the arrow cuts the man's arm clean off. Ashitaka doesn't know his own strength, it would seem. There's also a fair amount of blood, and a couple of particularly icky scenes: one in which San removes a bullet from Moro by sucking out the blood and spitting it out and another in which San helps Ashitaka eat by first chewing beef jerky and then passing it to him by mouth (he's very weak, you see). I understand, but eww.Princess Mononoke has plenty of strong-willed characters, and many of them are female: San, Lady Eboshi, and Moro, plus Ashitaka and Jigo. The Forest Spirit is a wonder to behold, too, appearing to be part human, part ape, part deer, and probably parts of lots of other animals as well. And the visuals are about what I expected from the maestro Miyazaki, although I think they weren't quite as well developed as they were in some of his other works, like the earlier Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. And it's also possible that there are just too many characters and plot lines and conflicts in Princess Mononoke to easily track. But overall, this is an unquestionable triumph of animation.",Princess Mononoke
47,dee.reid,"""Princess Mononoke"" - Wondrous, Magical, Mystical Storytelling",10,12 August 2005,"""Princess Mononoke"" is Japanese animation at its peak. It's full of dazzling visual delights, kinetic action, magic, mysticism, epic-level storytelling, and it is frankly quite difficult to not get swept up in it all. It made me laugh, it made me cringe, it scared me, and it moved me and it touched me, deeply. This is one of the most thematically deep and touching animated pictures I've ever seen. Lastly, it's also one of the most violent.Now I don't mean ""Princess Mononoke"" is violent in the same sense most Anime' is. This is not a 134-minute gorefest; it's ""PG-13,"" for crying out loud! But yes, people do get impaled, shot with arrows and bullets, forest animals transmute into swirling masses of life-sucking snakes and the blood does flow, but it is all done in a fashion that drives home the point of man's eternal conflict with nature.It helps to realize that Japanese animation is a lot more complex and daring than American animation cinema. The Japanese animators put forth enormous effort and strive for absolute perfection in their cinema, which places it on a level that will never be reached here in the United States.With that said, director Hayao Miyazaki, who is one of the most revered animators not just in Japan, but in the whole world, personally saw to it that ""Princess Mononoke"" made a successful transition from the drawing board, to the big screen, and finally to Japanese and American audiences. And in relaying ""Princess Mononoke's"" epic vision of man's conflict with nature to American audiences, comic book artist Neil Gaiman wrote the English script, and a fine cast of talented actors were brought in to voice the characters. Of course I'm talking about Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett Smith, Keith David, and Billy Bob Thornton.Set in medieval Japan, the film opens (after a lengthy narration by David) at a small village that's fallen under attack from a mysterious creature that emerged from the dense forest outside its borders. The daring and heroic Ashitaka (Crudup) takes on the animal, a giant boar amassed by hideous snake-like creatures. It's defeated but in doing so, however, Ashitaka is wounded - his right arm badly scarred.The wise woman in his village reveals to him that he's fallen under a curse as a result of his battle with the boar. The boar, which was once a forest god, had been transformed into a demon as the result of being wounded by an iron bullet found in its skeletal remains; the bullet then drove the boar mad, sending it on a killing spree throughout the forest. And because he had fallen to the creature's curse, Ashitaka is forced to cut his top-knot and leave the village forever. His journey: to venture to a far off place in an attempt to find a cure for his curse.Accompanied by his loyal elk-like steed Yakkuru, he goes off. He stumbles onto Iron Town, a mostly female-run colony that serves as an iron processing station, and it's run by Lady Eboshi (Driver), who has a sort of trustful mother-like relationship with the women workers (many of whom are mostly former prostitutes) and an uneasy alliance with the male workers.Lady Eboshi is a strong and determined female, the likes of which is rarely seen in Japanese animation. She has surrounded herself with loyal workers that she treats with the utmost respect, and she commands enormous respect too. I really like Miyazaki's treatment of her character, and a great amount of admiration can also be laid upon one of her most trusted women - Toki (Smith).But Lady Eboshi is at war with the forest gods, in particular the wolf clan (which is headed by Moro - voiced by Anderson - and her adopted human daughter San - voiced by Danes) and the boar gods roaming outside the colony's gates. Her iron works is destroying the forest and the gods living there are angry. Lady Eboshi thinks it will all end if she is able to capture the head of the Forest Spirit, the spectral entity rumored to control all life in the woods where most of this conflict is taking place, and she aims to do it with the help of a lowly hunter named Jigo (Thornton), whom Ashitaka had encountered earlier on his journey to the colony.""Princess Mononoke"" is a wondrous achievement in animation. It's breathtaking, with an amazing story about the rise of technology, man's embracing of it, and the war it surely enough started with nature. ""Princess Mononoke"" carries the same weighted messages you might find at any ecological protest here in the U.S. but it's done in such an even-handed and fantastical fashion that you can't help but be taken in.The animation is flawless, as I read Miyazaki personally redrew over 20,000 cells. The voice actors do a tremendous job of translating Miyazaki's words and relaying it to us for consumption and comprehension. I first saw this film back during the summer of 2001 and I easily remember the feelings I had when I viewed it. It was one of the most stunningly realized animated pieces I'd ever seen, as it made me understand the true power of animation, in any form.It's one of my top favorite Anime' films, as Miyazaki would surpass it in 2002 with his superior epic ""Spirited Away,"" which rightfully earned the Oscar that year for Best Animated Feature. Hayao Miyazaki is currently one of the greatest animators, as he has made one of the most beloved Anime' films of all time. It's my thoughtful prediction that one day he'll make a superior animation piece that could be the one to top them all off...10/10",Princess Mononoke
48,drqshadow-reviews,The Glorious Culmination of Ghibli's Early Period,10,25 June 2020,"I'm convinced this is the film Studio Ghibli spent its early years building up to. While previous efforts like Castle in the Sky and My Neighbor Totoro contained mythical elements - sleepy deities, spritely spirits, magic-tinged talents - the influence of god-level beings often feels secondary, relegated to a few enchanting (yet fleeting) glimpses. In Princess Mononoke, such divine creatures are essential, active participants. They speak, argue, swing their weight around. We aren't left to guess about their opinions or motivations, because their words and actions carry such a resonant influence. It's mesmerizingly effective, a contrast between the seemingly petty concerns of human tribes and the mass and muscle of a much heavier entity.Mononoke represents a huge step up for the studio, particularly in that sense of scale. Rather than maintaining the quaint, intimate essence that typified their early output, this time Ghibli has gone sweeping and epic. Everything, from the ambitious, enveloping symphonic score to the wide, gorgeous landscapes and distinct environs, emphasizes this point. We've left the village to find there's a broad undiscovered world out there. Yet the distinguishing little touches and unspoken human gestures haven't been lost in the transition, either. It still looks and feels like a Miyazaki movie, calmingly earnest and heartstrong, but the canvas is larger and more potentially powerful. And man, do they make the most of that promise.",Princess Mononoke
49,GiraffeDoor,Looks amazing. At least it has that.,6,22 March 2019,"I like to imagine, 10 year old me, in an alternative reality where the manga style of drawing didn't totally freak me out, catching this movie during some flight to a far away land and being swept away by its strange rhythms and formidable tone.In practice though, I saw this at 16 when I was a lot more jaded. This movie is a stunning clash of positive and negative aspects. It's basically blockbuster syndrome where the whole thing looks and sounds stunning but upon closer examination is pretty shallow.Basically everything about this movie is amazing but its script. Visually stunning with its lush setting coming up against the forces of modernity. The sparing but startling usage of CGI to represent the unholy. The mood, switching from epic battle of man and crazed demon to quite reflection as a stone gets speckled in rain. It ebbs and flows from peaceful to fiery that is hypnotic and compelling. The score will be your new guilty pleasure too.I've seen both the original and English dub. It was back at a time where I struggled to rarely take notice of voice performance when I was reading, but the English dub is fine. It's a mix of tolerable performances (like Mononoke and the main guy) plus some rather enchanting ones (the lascivious guy with the wart plusthe sultry english leader of the human forces).Now for the script: it's sort of different to have a protagonist caught between two sides, neither of which is fully in the wrong but this grey-lighter grey-white morality gets pretty sickly very quickly. I liked the apes and the Kodamas, they were all cool. But the message about the poisonous quality of hate was naive.The protagonist is a one dimensional mouth piece for the writer. He experiences no character development and barely expresses any emotion. He just stoically accepts that he's been banished and does so. He gets a little passionate when he gives grand sanctimonious lectures but they have little nuance beyond ""war is bad, environment is good"". I can totally get behind this on principle but it gives me nothing on how to put this into practice.The title character doesn't really do much. You know that kid in school that chastized you for eating meat? She's that. They try to sort of make them romantic interests but...I don't care about either of them.It ends more satisfyingly that its writers movies usually do. I got real sense of high stakes and conflict that wasn't resolved by easy answers.Frozen is a movie for all ages. This was a kids' movie.See it, but but expect a movie by a master animator, not a master storyteller.",Princess Mononoke
50,dwpollar,Complex and slow-moving battle between humans and the forest gods...,4,13 September 2009,"1st watched 9/12/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir- Hayao Miyazaki): Complex and slow-moving battle between humans and the forest gods didn't really play that well to me. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm not that in tune with the Japanese culture, but I just have to call things as how I see them and this animated movie by famed director Miyazaki didn't cut it for me. I think the main problem is that he didn't make us care for the characters involved and any movie that misses this part, I usually don't recommend. Miyazaki definitely winds an inventive story with unique animation and interesting demons and creatures as he usually does but the heart comes across missing. The story is about a group of humans who want to take the forest back from the animal gods who currently inhabit it and sometimes cause havoc with they turn into demons. This situation occurred early on and the prince of the story becomes infected to the point of having a curse on him that will eventually cause him to die. He's sent west to a forest area to hopefully get cured by the Deer God. He then meets up with Princess Mononoke, who is a half-human, half-wolf protector of the forest and tries to combine with her to help the cause, eventually. Battles ensue, and we do end up getting a happy ending – which we knew we'd see eventually, but two hours of the preparation for it was too much for me. I think the purpose of the story was to get us to see how we need to protect the forest, which I think we know, but the slow moving narrative ruins the purpose. So, a beautiful film again by the director but this one didn't hit home.",Princess Mononoke
51,andrewchristianjr,NATURE VS HUMANITY,7,17 July 2019,"Nature vs humanity. I enjoyed the spectacle and i recognize that its very well made. The story and setting are interesting but i gradually lost my interest in the film for the 2nd half. Wkwk.

52,Enchorde,Actually pretty good,7,11 March 2007,"Recap: Suddenly a great monster leaps out of the forest attacking the village. Ashitaka, with a steady hand on his bow, slays the monster but is at the same time stricken by its curse. He must leave his village and travel far to find the Deer God, deep in his forests, and hope that the Deer God will save him. Once there, he finds that humans and animal gods are fighting. Humans are destroying the forests in the process of gathering iron and the animals are fighting back. In the lead is the wolf Moro, her two cubs and Mononoke, a girl raised by the wolves. Ashitaka finds himself in the middle, and also find himself attracted to Mononoke.Comments: Rather good actually. The tempo in the movie is not high, but not so slow either that you get bored, a problem I find with a lot of other animés. I also liked the story, as it really had a beginning, a comprehendible and motivated plot, and an end. But it still is an animé where the scenery takes much space and focus in the movie. Small creatures that have really no place in the story comes and goes. But they never gets overhand over the actual story and just enhances it with some cute mystery. There evidently also is an idea with the story, a message but I will not comment further on it. So I haven't very much more to say actually as the movie to me was quite average. Pretty good, but not spectacular.7/10",Princess Mononoke
53,guisreis,Epic about the struggle between progress and nature,8,10 June 2021,"This epic film has the signature of the Studio Ghibli: beautifully animated, carefully working in each minor detail, with well developped characters and immersing spectator in that bright world. It is impressive how each Ghibli film has a deep and encompassing universe from its own. This one, different from others of their films, takes place in a fantastic Japan, not in a place ressembling Europe. In my opinion, this is not among the best Ghibli films (their average level is extremely high), as it is perhaps too long and sometimes seems unfocused, but it is still a quite good movie. What is its greatest merit, brilliant and unique, is its approach about the core issue: there is a metaphoric war between the modern/progress/industry/development and nature. Off course a balance between both is desirable but it is always hard to be measured and achieved. Exploiting nature is recurrently seen as evil, because of all evironmental problems we face. Indeed, greed and irresponsability are common traits of humans and they drove us to this situation. On the other hand, progress is not compatible not to change environment, and reactionary views on that usually do not care about poverty and inequality among people and countries. Nature is not only what gives us our resources, but is also brutal, dangerous, and challenges our survival when we are exposed. All that complexity appears in the movie in the shape of two opposite sides: humans want to destroy the forest motivated by greed but also by keeping their beloved community safe; the savage forces of nature led by Princess Mononoke and some entities want to preserve it untouched and to kill invading civilization. There is no manichaeism. Both sides commit mistakes, have good reasons, do not see the other side as an interlocutor, and may be ruthless. Indeed this is the most violent film by Studio Ghibli I have watched. To resume, this animated film establishes a wonderful ""mithology"" about the layered clash between progress and nature, in which the most they fight, the most both lose.",Princess Mononoke
54,Spleen,"I'm sure you're very good at what you do, Doctor Fell",6,14 June 2001,"Disney animation has linear detail, economical drawing, and extremely sophisticated motion.  In a word, it's classical.  Japanese animation has vertical detail, heavily etched backdrops that verge on being overdesigned, but rudimentary motion.  Japanese animation is baroque.  (Disney cartoons tend to have better draftsmanship, but this is inessential to the difference in style.)  The styles could hardly be more fundamentally opposed, and you like either one or the other.  It's hard to have a strong taste for both. To lay my cards on the table, I like the Disney style: I consider it more subtle and versatile, and at its best it lives and breathes like no other kind of animated image.  Still, the Japanese style has its strengths.It's essentially a static art: silence and stillness are what it conveys best.  It's interesting to compare ""Mononoke"" with ""The Emperor's New Groove"".  The latter film is unusual for Disney in that silence and stillness are used with surprising frequency, but the effect is always unstable: stillness is a kind of dissonance, something requiring resolution. The moments of silence and stillness in ""Mononoke"" are consonant and complete in themselves.  There are some lovely static tableaux in which the dialogue - if there is any - has as much time as it needs to breathe.The Japanese style is also good at conveying a sense of place.  (Disney can do this also, but neither as quickly nor as economically.)  Usually it's an urban place.  Think of definitive anime, and most Westerners think of ""Akira"" and ""Ghost in the Shell"", which are very urban indeed.  (My personal favourite in the genre is ""The Crimson Pig"", which, if not quite so urban, is heavily technological.)  ""Mononoke"" is different.  Most of the action takes place in the untamed, and I mean untamed, wilderness; now and then we enter a village.  Surprisingly, even these settings are solidly realised.  A single drop of water falls from a pine tree and lands on someone's face, and at once we feel that we are in the middle of a dense, damp, green forest.The story is deeply weird, in the best Japanese tradition - in particular, in the tradition of this particular director - and intensely sad.  The hero's quest is fulfilled, in a sort of a way, but the film does not end in triumph.  Instead of thinking ""good, X happened"", we think, ""oh well, at least X happened"".  -I must admit I was surprisingly unmoved.  Something about ""Mononoke"" distanced me; it may have been the facelessness of the central hero, it may have been the overall style; if the latter, it may have been entirely my fault, which is why I'm unwilling to commit myself to any kind of criticism.  All I know is that, much as I admired parts of ""Mononoke"", I am unable to love it.",Princess Mononoke

The animation work is great and rich in details, again as always from Studio Ghibli. But especially I liked how this movie contains some of the most beautiful still set drawings of backgrounds. As stills, they look so realistically beautiful, which also a bad side that it makes the foregrounds and moving animations seems too distinctive and don't blend well.

Instead I got a boring but beautiful piece of work that honestly isn't worth watching. Characters - None of the characters have any personalities or depth. Everyone has one motivation to do a thing because of the plot. There are no complex relationships or interesting exchanges between the characters. The villain wants to destroy the forest because she wants to. The hero wants no one to die because that's what he wants. The creatures want to protect the forest because they want their home to remain. It's quite unfortunate that the writers just forgot that to make a story interesting, everyone needs reasons for doing what they do and not ""because movie."" Plot - this movie's story is a bit vague and pointless. Basically some people want the forest to die, the forest is against this, they fight, no one wins. It's pretty simplistic and uninteresting. There's a pointless romance thing in there and some other random story threads that mean nothing. Animation - this movie is absolutely gorgeous.

58,pc95,Another Good Miyazaki Entry,7,30 March 2009,"Although not among my favorite Miyazaki films, Princess Mononoke must be given high praise for what is the standard for classical animation - Miyazaki. It's story is intriguing, but perhaps the most violent of any Miyazaki film - maybe too much. Despite that, it conjures up an interesting more historically leaning movie pitting man against nature. My favorite ideas in the movie were the kodama or forest sprites living in abundance to mark the health of the natural growth of plants, flowers, and animals as well as the kami-shika (deer god). Both were fantastically creative. The characters in the movie were fairly well done and the lack of romance was appealing. Perhaps more than other Miyazaki movies the hues of green in this movie jump out of the screen in colors as striking as any Miyazaki film. What I found a bit lacking (only in comparison) was some of the wonder and fantasy in other Miyazaki films which carry them to truly magical heights. Nonetheless, Mononoke-hime is a violent cautionary tale maybe meant to be so to jolt his usual audiences.",Princess Mononoke

It has an epic scope: political strife, eco-messages, natural and human violence, romance, deception, misguided philanthropy. Where to begin? First, I'd issue a warning that about the violence, unfortunate word choices and uncomfortable life situations for consumption by young audiences. This was unexpected, so I spent quite a bit of time surreptitiously observing my 9 year old viewing companion for adverse reactions. We also had a good debriefing conversation on the way home from the movies. I feel confident that I did not return her to her parents scarred for life (once again >phew<). Apart from those concerns, both she and I really enjoyed the movie. The artwork was superb, the characters were well drawn, the action was fast paced, the suspense was compelling, the voice talent was superb.

He carries the injured men through the forest, where he encounters many kodama, and glimpses the Forest Spirit.In Irontown, Ashitaka learns Eboshi has built the town by clear-cutting forests to claim ironsand and produce iron, leading to conflict with the forest gods. The town is a refuge for social outcasts, including former brothel workers and lepers, whom Eboshi employs to manufacture firearms to defend against the gods; Nago was turned into a demon by one of Eboshi's guns. Eboshi also explains that San, whom she calls Princess Mononoke, was raised by the wolves as one of their own and resents humankind.San infiltrates Irontown to kill Eboshi, but Ashitaka intervenes, knocking them both unconscious. As he leaves the town, he is fatally shot by a villager, but as he is sustained by the power of the curse, continues to carry San far beyond the town before losing consciousness. San awakens and is about to kill the dying Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She takes him to the forest, and decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit saves his life.",Princess Mononoke
61,sme_no_densetsu,Possibly Miyazaki's best film,8,1 October 2008,"""Princess Mononoke"" tells the story of a young man's journey to seek a cure for a curse that will eventually transform him into a demon. When he finds what he's been looking for he also finds himself in the middle of a struggle between the forces of nature and industrialization.The story is highly interesting and artfully told in a mature manner. The mythology makes for a highly imaginative story that is nevertheless eminently accessible. I have no idea what kids would make of it but, as an adult, I found it much more satisfying than the usual animated fare from America.I originally watched the movie with the English dubbing done by Disney/Miramax. At the time, my only complaint was that Billy Bob Thornton was badly miscast. Now, having watched the film with the original Japanese dialogue, I can't see myself wanting to go back to the English version. I watched a few clips afterward and the English dialogue just seemed forced and, at the same time, too Americanized.Visually, the film is splendid. The scenery is often quite beautiful and the action is generally well animated. Musically, the film is decent but not especially remarkable.In the end, when you consider the whole package (animation, voice acting, storyline, etc...) I think that ""Princess Mononoke"" makes a strong case for being Miyazaki's best film, though I admit that I haven't seen all of them (yet). This is definitely a must-see and not just for fans of animation.",Princess Mononoke
62,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"AVATAR was inspired by this classic, but is it better? Absolutely.",10,16 June 2011,"Princess Mononoke is one of those films that you don't hear much about, but one day you stumble upon it and you have the urge to watch that movie some time. Princess Mononoke is no exception to this kind of discovery. James Cameron got inspired by this movie, and then made AVATAR.The film is set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Just kidding. It's set long ago in Japan when the land was ""nick-named"" the ""Land of the Gods"". The movie has an instant start. It's one of those good instant starts in a film; it doesn't rush itself.When I saw this movie on DVD for the first time last year, I was blown away by how unexpectedly good it was. Hayao Miyazaki has to be one of the film worlds top geniuses. I haven't seen My Neighbour Tottoro, but I plan to do that soon. This felt something like Spirited Away mixed in with Lord of the Rings, mixed in with a John Ford western.The main character Ashitaka encounters an evil god which he has to kill at the beginning of the movie, but the god wounds him giving him an infection that gives him mysterious superpowers. Later he encounters the titular Princess Mononoke, the girl raised by wolves. This movie shows A+ character development, drama and animation.That's all for the plot. The movie was awesome in all aspects, using the technique of a film genius. If you love anime, fantasy or out-of this-world movies, this is the perfect movie for you.10/10- A movie with little to no flaws at all. A masterpiece.",Princess Mononoke

While allot of his other films are PG or sometimes G. The animation and story line is very well made and planned out. I didn't see it in theaters when it came out in the US of 1999. I first heard of it at my Jr. high school, got the DVD of it later on when I learned more of Miyazkai's films. It's one of those films were at first it seem OK, but as you keep watching it it gets better every time it's viewed. Not in my personal favorites but it's definitely a fine piece of work by Miyazaki himself. I advice it to keep it away from younger viewers cause it's very violent.

68,sharky_55,Mononoke-hime,10,19 September 2017,"Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke is big, brash and lyrical, bringing together several different ancient worlds into a new order where co-existence seems impossible. The film has been called the Star Wars of the east, but surely it is more than simply that, with a confidence and fluidity in its action-driven world building that immediately signals to us that these clans have existed for a very long time, and want to desperately continue that tradition. Then one day man discovered that iron ore could be forged into new and powerful tools, and the earth was broken to excavate it, and lines were drawn in the sand. Miyazaki has never been shy about his moral lessons. His debut Nausicaa, from way before Studio Ghibli was even established let alone a household name, pitted its eponymous heroine in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where toxic fumes (man-made, presumably) had corrupted nature and its beasts, and only underground gardens housed plant life. Here in Mononoke you can see its influence from the beginning, in the way that the boar god Nago has been corrupted by an iron ball shot into his stomach, and how the evil spirits writhe and attempt to consume him. Their movements, each individually hand-drawn, become a furious, teeming mass that is immediately reminiscent of the gigantic, mutated Ohm with their churning legs. Like the Ohm, Nago is an intelligent creature that has been reduced to baser instincts because of humanity's stain. The apes likewise have taken on a hellish appearance, and resorted to eating unnatural things. Made 13 years later, Mononoke is Nausicaa but matured in almost every way. You could never equal the original imprint of 80s tone and mysticism, backed up by a Joe Hisaishi score that found beauty in the strange, alien landscape (the haunting children's choir is a testament to that). But the allegorical tapestry of Mononoke has no animated equal; it attempts no less than to account for every horse in the race for the forest, and in doing so lifts early didacticism into a universal fable. Seeing it on the big screen for the first time, I marvel again at the artistry of Ghibli's animators. They twist beauty and corruption into one with their matte backgrounds; the whole damn world is under the curse of evolution and technological advancement, and the untouched nature is slowly bearing its scars. An early shot of an oxen delivery inching its way across a spiky mountain range and fog is reminiscent of the magnificence of Herzog's Aguirre, and how the opening dwarfs its tiny humans. In the midst of pure streams, still lakes and thick forests they draw cartoon violence that is undeniably shocking for the medium. Even Ashitaka trembles at how his corrupted arm lends him an otherworldly strength that allows his arrows to cleanly behead a chasing samurai. The pale Kodama seem cute at first, until they twist their heads all the way around and shiver, sending unease down our spines. And no one animates emotion quite like Miyazaki. When his characters run, they stumble and grasp for the ground, and almost leave skid marks turning corners. There's no run cycle in sight. Look how he evokes anger through the whole body; eyes widen, brows arch like caterpillars, hair bristles up as if charged with electricity. But nothing quite compares to the anger of the forest spirit in search of his stolen head from the invaders of his domain. Watching it I am filled with both thrill and fear; to have Miyazaki unleash the figurative fury of mother nature is to rebuke all previous images of the serene, gentle spirit. Does it simply give in to those who are poisoning the land? No, it has lived in peace for millennia and has not yet been challenged by individuals so powerful and careless at the same time. It launches a self-destructive last resort. It seeks to consume. There is Miyazaki's caution of the modern world, of its unchecked progress and uncertainty, but this time around he also sees how it can bring new life for those previously downtrodden. Lady Eboshi rescues the women from filthy brothels and gives them good, hard work, and entrusts to the marginalised lepers the most important job of them all. She is not simply evil incarnate, but perhaps short-sighted. Her arrogance in her tools leads her to believe that she can kill a god, and she loses a hand for this. But she learns, and the town grows again. Ashitaka and San are the ones to bring true balance to the war. San herself is a discarded product of the conflict, neither fully wolf nor human. She reacts initially with an almost animalistic, blind rage, like that Okkoto, who has been fighting too long to see sense. And in the end, although she comes to accept that their must be give and take for both sides, cannot forget what the humans have done on behalf of progress. It is refreshing to see a film not so easily discard its character's convictions. A western film might have poised the romance as dramatic resolution. Yet Ashitaka knows that such atrocities are not quickly forgotten, and that only time can begin to heal them. One day that seedling may become a tree.",Princess Mononoke
69,stamper,"Japanese anime: bigger, longer and uncut",5,30 April 2005,"Generally I am a real fan of animated films and since Hayao Miyazaki's films seem to be of very high quality I recently felt to give one of his films a try despite not being too keen on Asian anime. The only film I really liked was Vampire Hunter D to be honest and I can assure you that I've seen my share of Manga 'classics' (Akira and Ghost in the shell). I had a feeling though that Miyazaki's films would be more mainstream Hollywood style, since he has become something of a trade name since making this film and the academy award winning Spirited Away. After seeing this film, I was somewhat disappointed. Despite the fact that the film had some of the makings of a great adventure film, I just could not get used to the many fantasy; god/demon elements. From the start I felt that the films core the film had a dangerous equilibrium, which it managed to maintain during the first hour. The first hour was pretty exciting and interesting but in the second hour the weight on the 'boring' scale just got bigger and bigger. It was not as if Miyazaki did a bad job directing, but I felt that he put too much weight on the whole moral/mystical part of the film where more emphasis on the action would have made the film tighter. Maybe though it wasn't the emphasis alone, I also felt that some of the scenes were excruciatingly long. Or maybe it is safe to say that I'm not into the whole Asian 'spirit thing'. I mean I didn't like The Ring or Ju-On one bit and I didn't care much for this one either. The only thing I actually can appreciate in Asian (specifically Japanese) films is the amount of violence they use and the way in which it is often comic. There were a couple of instances in this film as well where I felt the violence was so over the top that it became funny. Too bad that isn't enough to keep a film interesting for 128 minutes. Miyazaki should have kept this one standard Disney-length (with a maximum of 85 minutes).5,25 out of 10 post scriptum: the English subs were really bad, cause last time I checked 'arigato' meant ""Thank you."" and not ""Good luck.""",Princess Mononoke

The running time didn't affect the expirience the least! It just kept on bringing interesting and exciting creatures or spirits to the screen. The humans live separated from nature and that's the true conflict of the movie, because everything else is connected to that. Some people may call it preachy, but honestly guys, that's too low to be taken seriously. The animation and the building of the fantasy world are what makes this movie an tremendous epic! The landscapes are gorgeous and the power of nature is brought to life with breathtaking effects and animation.

74,bellino-angelo2014,Not among Miyazaki's best but still good,7,28 April 2021,"Before I go into discussing the movie, I have to point out that before I saw PRINCESS MONONOKE I had never seen an Hayao Miyazaki before and I wanted to begin with this one. It's among his lesser movies but it was ok for me as an introduction.The movie is set in feudal Japan. In the beginning young prince Ashitaka protects his village and kills a huge demon spider. A injury infects his arm and so he has to travel for finding a cure and a monk talks about him of the great forest spirit. In the village he finds Lady Eboshi who is cutting down the trees and kills the forest's animals. Her major objective is to cut off the head of Okkoto, the forest spirit. She is opposed by the animals and by Princess Mononoke.I have seen the movie in the English dubbed version since I hadn't studied Japanese and for dubbing the characters they picked some famous stars of the 1990s-2000s' movies (such as Jada Pinkett Smith, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson, Keith David who also narrates the movie, Minnie Driver and Claire Danes) and it has quite great animation for its time.

In addition to the longest run-time compared to the previous Ghibli movies, the animation was also much more impressive and breathtaking. I was hooked from the opening, which showed an intense chase and fight scene. The story was intricate and made me want to see how it would all unveil. Unexpectedly, there were a lot of gore, which made the action even more thrilling. The theme about man versus nature and how nature can strike back were adamantly clear and impactful not only in 1997, but also now.

79,tomimt,Perhaps one of the most captivating Japanese animations,10,8 September 2006,"'Mononoke-hime' or 'Princess Mononoke', as the translated title goes, tells the old fable of how men cannot live in harmony with their surroundings. Instead of trying to adjust themselves to their surroundings they selfishly try to adjust the surroundings to their needs, in this case the people of Iron Town try to defeat the Forest Spirit, the guardian of the great forest, who is standing in their way in mining out precious iron from the depths of the earth.Prince Ashitaka defeats a wild boar demon near his home village, but in doing so he's injured and the wound casts a cures upon him that will devour him in the end. Thus he is banished from his people and he begins to seek the great Forest Spirit in order to get cured. On his journeys he befriends whit the people of Iron Town and he sets up on another mission as well: to try to get the people and the forest to live together in harmony.The animation and music is just wonderful. The scenery and characters work perfectly and the tempo of the film is almost perfectly balanced between calm moments and action. I haven't seen the original with Japanese voice actors, but I quite liked the English voice cast. At least they sounded like they were interested in doing their jobs and they did it quite nicely.'Princess Mononoke' is a rare gem of animation, aimed towards a bit more mature audience than your average Dinsey films, that while keeps you thrilled whit the beautiful writing and well fleshed out characters, it also gives you something to think about. It can be seen as a statement of how industrialization is good for people in the short term, but how it will eventually turn the surroundings around us, thus destroying the legacy of later generations to come.While many other animations will wither in time, I'm sure that 'Princess Mononoke' will be remembered as one of the classics of animation throughout the time.",Princess Mononoke
80,Blue-Grotto,"We cannot change fate, but we can rise to meet it.",10,25 June 2017,"Something is wrong. A shapeless rage and powerful demon appears on the outskirts of a small village. Animals as well as humans are poisoned and cursed at its touch. Ashitaka, a perceptive and valiant young man and peacemaker who is wise beyond his years, recognizes that this demon is blinded by its own agony. He attempts to quiet its rage and direct the sinister power away from the village. Despite his efforts and care to avoid the demon, and his success at saving the village, Ashitaka is touched by the curse. The village oracle encourages him to journey with unclouded eyes and open mind to the source of the demon's rage - a distant forest - where Ashitaka may be able to find a way to lift the curse. The journey takes Ashitaka to an ironworks encroaching on the forest, where people, animals and demons are at war with each other, and with themselves. As Ashitaka looks for a way to lift the curse and keep from harm, he uncovers secrets of the place and characters. This includes a mysterious and beautiful young princess allied with the wolves; Mononoke.Twenty years ago, in Georgetown, a Japanese embassy sponsored advertisement of the film caught my eye. I encouraged my fiancé to come. It was our first Miyazaki film and I was stunned by its insight, wisdom, artistry and beauty. It touched on some of my basic beliefs about human nature, love and the environment. A recent trip to Japan and the remote island of Yakushima (used as a model for scenes in the film) deepened my appreciation for Princess Mononoke.The artistic beauty is timeless and dazzling to the senses. Mist rises from the mountains and ancient forests of gigantic cedars. Rainstorms, shadows, clouds and rivers appear to rush over you as they pass on screen. The landscape character is revealed in the variable light of the sun and moon. The incredible attention to detail is evident in eyes that sparkle in the night, light and ripples on water, wind on grass, haunting bird songs, different shades of stone, the flash of gunpowder and a night sky filled with stars.There is incredible complexity to the characters; female and male, animal and human, earth and supernatural. This complexity is heightened by immersion in the Japanese culture wherein spirits and demons take human or animal form, or something in between - or even beyond - both. Twenty years ago, I ruminated about my fiancé and wondered what characteristics she shared with the fascinatingly intricate, attractive, stylish and spirited female characters. Mononoke and Lady Eboshi, both willful, fearless and independent, deftly navigate the male oriented world. The two are separated by belief. Eboshi is realistic. ""We have more to fear from ourselves than from demons or monsters,"" she wisely maintains. Mononoke is idealistic about the forest and, of course, wolves. Ashitaka, the peacemaker, is respectful and observant of others. He has the admirable ability to see through the eyes of strangers and understand how they feel. Tough and vulnerable at the same time, he helps others and shrugs off aggression.There are so many bits of wisdom scattered throughout the film and in surprising places. One important and recurring theme is the precarious balance of the natural world and our relationships to others. We are connected to the environment and others in all we do, and this film underscores this point. Destruction and violence just create more hatred. The film pushes us to be non-judgmental and hopeful like Ashitaka. New life is always on the threshold and within reach, if we allow it. We may not know what form it takes, but we must leave space for it to grow. We are alive, and we have each other. The film dialogue is delightfully intricate and unpredictable. The competing interests, changing circumstances and shifting balances of life are skillfully portrayed. We cannot change fate, but we can rise to meet it.The story is based in a time when Japan, 150 years ago, was suddenly transforming from the ancient ways, to iron, gunpowder and other technologies and beliefs. Listening to the film in Japanese, with English subtitles, adds another wonderful dimension to the film. One of my favorite films ever.",Princess Mononoke
81,griffolyon12,An Epic Masterpiece!,10,28 July 2009,"Princess Mononoke is a rare film, one that manages to transcend its animated exterior and become simply an amazing film.Princess Mononoke is an epic fantasy, following the battle between the ancient forest spirits in feudal Japan and the persistent humans that are pillaging their forests. It is a beautiful tale about love, humanity, and the environment.Director Hayao Miyazaki is simply a master at his craft. Not only is the film highly imaginative, well drawn, and has a very tight story; it is also a highly emotional film that will not only make you feel, but also make you think. Miyazaki weaves his environmental message into the story, taking center stage amongst all the epic conflict, making you grow to appreciate the great outdoors even more after viewing this film. Not only that, Miyazaki shows us how awful war truly is, he makes us realize all the sacrifice and loss involved. He does not glorify the battles within this film, he shows them in a very real, almost upsetting fashion (or as real as war can be represented in a fantasy). Though Princess Mononoke is also a story of real love. The romance between the warrior Ashitaka and the wolf princess San is beautiful, and very real in how it unfolds. In the midst of all this conflict, these two opposites come together and form a force that is stronger than all.Even still Princess Mononoke is also a terrific action film. The action set pieces in this film are many, all being extremely inventive and exciting to watch. The opening battle with the possessed boar and San's attack on Iron Town are among two of the finer action sequences in the film. Of course the one that is truly the stand out battle scene is the battle between the humans and the boars. This battle is played out in a very affecting, very artistic way, and is definitely one of the more memorable sequences of the film.This film is easily one of Miyazaki's greatest. It is far more mature than any of his other films, and that might be why it's so special to me. It's a film that is different, but relishes in it, delivering a film that is not just a good animated film, but simply a terrific film in general.I give Princess Mononoke a perfect 10 out of 10!",Princess Mononoke

The giant animals are awesome and the creatures of the forest are cool. The Forest Spirit itself is so strange and creepy, but really well done.",Princess Mononoke
90,blackmamba99971,Beautiful Movie,10,12 April 2010,"This is a great example of how the earth is so important. What we see is a land in Japan going industrial in the Shogun era. People under the tutelage of a woman who runs iron town. Basically a business woman who oversees her workers mining and smelting the iron to make fire arms or other forms of artillery. In the middle are two would be hero's, one is called San and the other Ashitaku, a lone man who was exiled from his village for being poisoned by a god turned demon. In his investigations he learns that the iron town was responsible for cutting down the trees and mining ore. But never gave back to the forest which made the gods angry. Seeing as the gods were going to battle, one lone schemer among the chaos only wanted the head of the forest spirit, to give his life a reprieve from the emperors sentence. Through it all San and Ashitaku try to achieve a goal of coexistence between the forest gods and humans, but all for not. Both sides went to war and the humans were winning their place in history. To see such grand scale imagery as well as a well thought out story I have to admit, this was a great teaching tool of ecological disasters. It was sad to see the forest spirit die to let the humans take their place alone in the world. To never again rely on the gods which had protected them for thousands of years or for that matter before time. But gods know that humans can endure the most riddled hardships handed to them, and must step aside to allow the human race to make mistakes themselves and to recover. I liked the way how the animals began to forget their own comprehension's and began to DE-evolve to ordinary animals of the wild. Brilliant picture, and brilliant cast.",Princess Mononoke

92,avik-basu1889,Humanity and Nature !!!!,8,23 May 2015,"Hayao Miyazaki is a legendary name in the genre of anime film- making. What sets his films apart from the rest is the fact that although his films may be animated which is generally considered to be a cinematic medium directed towards kids, but he makes his films profound enough for adults to enjoy too. The kids will find the vibrancy of the visuals enjoyable while the adults will get enough thematic and allegorical depth. Princess Mononoke is no different.Miyazaki deals with the age-old relationship between human beings and nature. The movie I believe is set in Japanese Civil War era. Miyazaki beautifully uses the fantasy-like storyline to promote the messages of tolerance, coexistence and unity and the denouncement of hatred. Man and nature have the right to exist together without any harm coming to either. The script does get a bit too preachy at times, but the visual subtlety and beauty of the film overwhelms the minor issues with the script. The film could have been a little shorter. The film ends beautifully with optimism and with a hope for a new beginning. I had minor reservations with the script, but nevertheless the mastery of Miyazaki's film-making is visible throughout the film and Princess Mononoke is must watch for everyone irrespective of your feelings towards the genre of anime.",Princess Mononoke

94,jimmycoffin-751-212853,Say What?,2,9 October 2016,"I'm a big fan of Miyazaki since childhood. I'm 34 years old. But I never come around watching Mononoke. The masterpiece that everyone likes! and his praised by critics and reviewers around the World to be ghibli's best film. Why?.. Maybe I was never drawn to the cover art.. I thought It looked like a bad version of Zelda. So all these years have passed And I have watched all his Movies countless times over. So finally My mind was set. I started watching Princess Mononoke. The Masterpiece of all masterpieces praised to the skies! ..Boy Was I in for a big surprise! It totally sucked!! My Eyes wasn't moved to tears, I started yawning to the action scenes several times.. I was wondering..Is this Studio Ghibli? I didn't like the soundtrack, The romance never took off, For one, they didn't know each other nearly long enough to fall in love. the movie just kinda made it up and expected you to believe it. There was zero evidence of actual romance Eboushi just magically changes her mind at the end? The ending was so anti-climactic. So this girl that he is ""in love with"" decides he isn't important enough for her to invite him to live with her in the Forrest. He also doesn't care enough about the girl that ""he loves"" to follow her in the end. He'd rather go help the townspeople he met last week?!? LOL OK. After all they went though they just decide to part ways & visit each other sometimes, WTF is up with the ending??? The ending... what was the Point of cutting the head of the deer god?? so the emperor girl could awake and understand she did wrong?? she had to kill thousands of boars, shopping every tree, kill Everything just to come to that conclusion that it was pointless? The worst part of this Movie is that I absolutely adored Mononoke. But they never took advantage of that, she is Always out of camera somehow you never get to know her, except she hates humans. It feels like they made this Movie for American audience. Is that why it has such high scores? cause of the generic plot, action, blood and all that usual Hollywood crap? sorry buts that the truth. I can't find Another reason why the big fans of Ghibli actually love this one. It's Not that great. It's the worst ghibli Movie i ever seen actually. The heroine is awesome, the few parts she has in the story, but thats about It. Spirited Away IS A MASTERFUL STROKE OF ART, this is not that good everyone made it up to be.",Princess Mononoke

You also have the unfortunate victims of demon attacks, who resemble mobile corpses in varying states of decay.Don't get me wrong!  This is one of the most visually stunning and compelling films, animated or not, I have ever seen.  It will stay with me for a long time.  I just wasn't quite prepared for all the gore.  Lots of critics failed to mention it and I thought I'd give people fair warning. The film is absolutely fantastic.Just remember not to eat while you watch it.",Princess Mononoke
96,zeekwunlau,A beautiful vision about people and nature,9,25 April 2020,"The film is not limited to the destruction of the environment by mankind, but from the natural contradiction between man and nature that cannot be resolved, through the survival angle of mankind itself, to explore whether man and nature can truly achieve the ultimate proposition of harmony and coexistence.
The story takes place from the 14th to the 16th centuries. Ashitaka's tribe, the Aji, is located in the northeast of Japan. One day a wicked god from the West was going to invade the village where Ashitaka was. This wicked god was transformed from a cursed wild boar god.Seeing the evil god stepping forward, Ashitaka came forward. Although he later killed the wild boar god, he was also cursed by the evil god, and his life could not be guaranteed. In order to resolve the mystery of the curse and save himself, Ashitaka followed the instructions of the witch in his village and went to the west to find out and seek a way out.
On the way, he inquired that the guardian god of the forest, the mountain beast god, could resolve this curse, and he set off to the forest. On the way, he rescued two people who transported iron ore to the valley and met Shan for the first time. These two people were from the iron smelting plant in Abercy.In the iron workshop, he unveiled the cursed fan of the wild boar god: Abbey attacked the forest with a musket, and the wild boar god guarding the forest, the god of Nago, became a demon because of hatred after hitting her musket. That night, Shan came to attack the iron factory. She was actually the daughter of a human being raised by the white wolf god who was abandoned by humans.
Shan was in a critical situation with a few enemies, but Ashidaka was determined to save her, and he was shot for this. His life was in danger. The rescued Shan was touched by Ashidakar's sincerity and bravery. Asidakar was seriously injured, and Shan decided to take him to the forest to let the mountain beast god rescue him.
The mountain beast god rescued Ashitaka, at this time the wild boar swarms that were deeply harassed by humans decided to fight with humans to save their home forest. Shan, who loved the forest, wanted to protect the guardian of the forest and left Ashitaka. , Involved in the battle of the wild boar group and the joint army of Alberti and the samurai.In the battle between Alberti and the wild boar herd, the wild boar herd was almost wiped out. In order to find the mountain beast god, the army and the samurai army put on the wild boar skin and painted the wild boar blood to track the retreating wild boar god and Shan.
As the mountain beast god's island approached, the army surrounded the wild boar gods and Shan and attacked them. The angry wild boar god will soon become a demon, and the shan to save it will also be implicated. Ashitaka, who has just arrived, wants to save shan, but he can't help it.Seeing that the situation is irreversible, the mountain beast god overwhelmed the life of the wild boar god and thus prevented the wild boar god from becoming an evil god. At the same time, Ashitaka rescued Shan with the help of the white wolf god.
Albert West took the opportunity to shoot down the Mountain Beast God, and the White Wolf God saw it, struggling to bite off one arm of Albert West, and then died. The angry mountain beast god absorbs life to get his head back. In order to save the forest, Ashitaka and Shan finally recovered the head of the mountain beast god.The mountain beast Shenyang, who had recovered from his head and lost his head, crashed to the ground and died. With his own death, he gave new vitality to the earth in an instant.
After saving the forest, Shan still couldn't relieve her crime of destroying the forest. She chose to return to the forest. Ashitaka respected Shan's choice. The two smiled in a lush green mountain.",Princess Mononoke
97,x_manicure_x,Mature Miyazaki,8,14 August 2021,"Got a chance to rewatch ""Princess Mononoke"" after years thanks to the Japanese movie theaters initiative to bring back Studio Ghibli classics to the big screen. I was surprised to find it way more mature, grim, and violent than I remembered.The film deals with the relationship between man and nature as a problem that cannot be ultimately solved. Mankind's instinct is to progress, destroy and conquer, but is ultimately doomed to extinction like any other species, no matter how advanced their weapons become. Nature, represented by the gods of the forest, can be dominated and manipulated by mankind, but still remains the only irrational force that can give and take arbitrarily. Ashitaka's position is neutral, he is just doing his best to keep living aware of his condition as a human being and avoid conflict. None of the characters is truly good or bad, but conflict is inevitable as part of our nature (corruption even drives Ashitaka to unwillingly kill people).The art direction is flawless as always, this time focused on the equivalent of Japan's medieval age and its animistic beliefs. Every Studio Ghibli film has its own unique atmosphere, but the mystic, grim mood of ""Princess Mononoke"" is still unsurpassed. Joe Hisaishi's soundtrack also heightens the epic quality and intensity of the film, with some of his most famous compositions. Gives me goosebumps every time.My only complaint is that, like in most of Studio Ghibli's films, the ending felt a bit rushed despite the long, slow-paced buildup.",Princess Mononoke
98,smakawhat,Who will save the forest??,7,30 September 2000,"An eyepopping piece of animation, with a unique story.This anime does not confuse, or leave the viewer bored.  There are always interesting characters to run into such as the small tree spirits, or the gigantic forest creatures.The message at the end is a bit preachy, but the idea and concept of living in harmony with nature is told well.  The story even makes it more interesting when they parable the infighting with some of the other forest creatures as to how they should deal with the encroaching humans.Not the best anime I have ever seen, but CERTAINLY not the worst.Rating 7 out of 10",Princess Mononoke
99,freakfire-1,Huh?,1,18 August 2008,"I just cannot believe this one got so many names. Billy Bob Thornton? Gillian Anderson? Minnie Driver? Were they all arrested for driving while intoxicated and had to do this as their community service?Seriously, the story and the characters are flawed. A demon that is the War God, surrounded by worm-like creatures that give it its power. While I am all about culture and learning, this made me less inclined to want to know Japanese mythology.I just had a bad time watching it. The promise of action quickly fell to the wayside and nothing of entertainment value happened. That Roger Ebert likes this movie just confirms that he has to be the worst movie critic of all time. Avoid this movie. ""F""",Princess Mononoke
100,jose-cruz53,Holy sh*t!,10,6 October 2012,"*Note: for fully imersing oneself in this film one has to watch it in Japanese. Do not watch in English unless you want to watch with with kids under the age of 10 (well, when I was 10 I was already watching everything subtitled, people should not be afraid of subtitles).The most powerful experience I ever had watching anything (be either a film, a TV series, theater or a show) was the second time that I watched this film. The first time I didn't really give respect this film deserves (I though it was a childish cartoon and I watching it for a guilty pleasure) and actually failed to really get it. After watching several other movies I remembered this film and I noticed it was truly better than anything else I had watched lately, so I decided to watch it again, this time really paying attention to it: The first few minutes were already better than the last five films I had watched put together. When it ended I cried and was unable to sleep for 5-6 hours, thinking about how freaking awesome this film was.This film features the most powerful score ever. I would call it truly a heavy score, like Black Sabbath, but more epic and without distortion. Most film scores are just background noise that serves to convey emotion, but here the score has a life of its own. Indeed, the score alone makes this film better than 90% of all other movies.Edit: Today a viewed this film for the third time. It became BETTER than the second time. I also viewed 2001: A Space Odyssey for the third time in the same day, and this film totally destroyed 2001 and I consider 2001 one of the best films ever made, but this film made it look like an episode of Family Guy by comparison.",Princess Mononoke
101,ssssgelojun,Princess Mononoke,10,23 August 2020,"I will always admire Hayao Miyazaki for his thoughts on the world, on man and natureNature has no feelings for life on earth. Birth and death may happen in a blink of an eye. When we go to save nature and change the environment, perhaps we are not saving it, but saving ourselves. We should be kind to nature, because human beings want to ""live"", maybe this is our only way out.The characters depicted in Princess Mononoke are also very delicate and profound. They are not simply good and evil. From the standpoint of human beings, She is a great leader and a humanitarian lover. From the perspective of nature, Shan Shan is a firm protector of nature and a simple girl who dares to love and hate.Nature is the god we should be awed by. In front of it, there is no right side. It is the manager of the scale to maintain the balance of the world.",Princess Mononoke
102,Darkjak007,Nature always wins,9,31 March 2021,"Princess Mononoke was directed by Hayao Miyazaki and the 11th film. It tells the story of a prince named ashitaka who after a cursed boar spirit attacks his village is cursed. Traveling east to find the source of the boar hatred. Ashitaka comes upon a town of outcasts and leapers lead by a woman name Eboshi. We learn that the humans of this village are at war with the spirits of the forests ,humans are digging up iron ore and Desecrating the forest. A result it's weakening the spirits Resulting in many being turned into demons. Amongst these spirits is a human girl name San known throughout the forest as princess Mononoke raised by wolf spirits she aids them against the humans. The most notable aspect of this film is the amount of blood and gore as well the action. This is hands-down the studio most graphic film with dismemberment, bloody wounds, piles of corpses. It's rather serious essentially a war movie between man and nature. The overall tone of this movie is that there's not really a de facto villain. It would be easy to pin Lady Eboshi as the villian that not entirely true. She's destroying the forest,she has a motive driven out by the Emperor. Caring for the lifes of her people. She sees the forest as a new potential for them, willing to sacrifice in order to prosper. She's more interested in the money not knowing the consequences for her actions . Ashitaka is the Voice of reason stoic and Courageous he's trying to prevent conflict between the spirits and the humans so it doesn't lead to more suffering for others. You believe he's not afraid to die but he still fights to protect everything. Course the last major character is princess Mononoke how design is creative, her stories similar to Mowgli from the jungle book being raised by wolves. Similar to Nausicaa of the valley of the wind she's a warrior and she knows how to fight. Moving swift in the fight offers adrenaline. One of the small downside is that you don't really get much time to know her .The choice in scenery is an excellent choice before the tale of Princess Kaguya this was the only film actually set in ancient Japan so I always gave it distinct personality. Playing off of the concept of nature and spirits the Settings are beautiful tons of landscapes panned over there really show off the scale and effort put into this worl. Huge amount of details put into the forest and the water. Design of the forest spirit & Kodama are creative. Princess Mononoke is action packed and remains one of the best works in animation.",Princess Mononoke
103,williampsamuel,As Good as Animation Gets,10,10 January 2015,"Princess Mononoke is by far the best anime I have ever seen. I've seen Spirited Away, Howell's Moving Castle, Ghost in the Shell, and many others, but none equal the beauty, depth, and epic storytelling of this film. Mononoke features as many fully developed characters as the largest Hollywood ensemble production, slicker fight scenes than many martial arts flicks, larger battle scenes than most war movies, and visuals as awe-inspiring as any ever drawn. The New York Post was right on the money in calling it ""The Star Wars of animated features."" I apologize ahead of time, but there is no way I can fully convey what makes this movie great without including spoilers. Consider yourself warned.The first thing that strikes you as you watch this movie is that dozens of Japan's best animators must have spent months on ending animating this film. The line art, pencils, and coloring are flawlessly executed and richly detailed in every scene. The movements and expressions of both people and animals are perfectly lifelike, individual leaves can be seen blowing in the breeze, and at times hundreds of characters occupy the screen, accompanied by smoke and flashes of gunfire. The writhing tentacles of the boar demon must have taken dozens of hours to draw all by themselves. Even Disney would probably give in and use CGI at this point. Come to think of it, the credits did mention a small computer animation staff, but for the life of me I can't remember a single frame that looked computer generated.Then there are the people. Prince Ashitaka is one of the bravest, most skilled warriors I've seen. His proficiency with both sword and bow would do Link proud. He also possesses wisdom and empathy well beyond his years. He fights and kills when he must, but his utmost priority is to save lives. And he repeatedly risks his life to stop the fighting around him, though it brings the distrust and at times enmity of all sides.Lady Iboshi is equally fascinating. Ruthless, ambitious, utterly fearless, and possessing impeccable manners, she comes off at first glance as the perfect villain. Her position as the region's top arms manufacturer and the revelation that she was indirectly responsible for his curse do little to dispel this image. After his outburst on first meeting her, and the attempt on her life, which ended with the prince helping the wounded assailant get away, I was certain that Ashitaka would side with the wolves against Irontown. And I felt a growing dread that the filmmakers would give in to heavy handed environmentalist moralizing, a la Fern Gulley.Amazingly though, they resist this temptation, instead taking a far more nuanced approach. Yes, Lady Iboshi is ruthless. Yes, she has despoiled swaths of the surrounding forests. And yes, she is in collusion with the film's real villain, whose scheme nearly brings on the ruin of everyone. But she is also generous and loyal to those who follow her. Everything she does, good, bad, or in between is to protect her people or to honor debts owed. Despite early appearances, she's an not evil woman, but a determined leader doing what she feels that she must.But the most interesting character by far is San, the wolf princess. Raised by wolves since infancy, San believes that she is a wolf, and bears an intense hatred of humanity, to the point of becoming violent when it is pointed out that she is human. And make no mistake; San is a very violent, very tough young woman. The first time we see her, she is covered in her adoptive mother's blood, which she is sucking from a poisoned wound. This chick is hard core.With characters like these there is lots of action, and all of it is awesome. The fight scenes are fast paced and beautifully choreographed, if that's the right word to use for animation. The prince's opening clash with the boar demon is exhilarating and more than a bit frightening, and the duel between San and Iboshi is simply breathtaking in the intensity and skill displayed by both combatants. The later battle sequences are likewise stunning in their scale and violence. The charge of the boar tribe rival's the Rohirrim's charge from Return of the King in its thunderous power, and the ending is like something out of Godzilla.Any way you look at it, Princess Mononoke is a wonderful film. It's grandiose, exciting, spellbinding, filled with a rich cast of characters, and possesses a clear message about the need for balance between man and nature, and the destructive power of anger. It may be too violent for small children, and I'm sure there's a good amount of subtext that western viewers will miss, but this is a movie that has something for everyone. I would highly recommend it to all audiences.",Princess Mononoke
104,dallasryan,Very Thought Provoking,9,5 April 2013,"It's always a common theme from Studio Ghibli in being that we must respect and be kind to nature, just to love everything that surrounds us from animals to a single strand of grass. That man is bad, but some men within man are good. Always very intuitive movies with brilliant writing and animation from Studio Ghibli. But Princess Mononoke is one of the best in the thought provoking department. Princess Mononoke is never too redundant, it's a perfect balance on all points that it's getting across and at the same time entertaining us to the fullest enjoyment. A real special gem of a movie that will bring the viewer into a touching awareness and a smile after viewing it. A movie for all age groups.

This is everything I've been expecting from Miyazaki ever since I first heard all the gushing over his films, and bloody hell is every bit of it deserved.

106,Bob Pr.,Beautiful artwork; interesting concept; sometimes confused storyline,8,8 October 2000,"(AKA English) ""Princess Mononoke""I'd read good reviews of this and long wanted to see it so got it when my local video shop had it. I found it worth seeing but a little uneven.Much of the artwork, especially of landscapes and atmosphere and weather, is stunning. Some of the artwork, to my taste, is too crude (e.g., as in the drawings of the wolf mother and sibs to Mononoke).Perhaps those growing up in Japanese culture absorb a supporting fabric that makes the story line more natural and understandable to them than to an American audience. I'm appreciative of the idea that it does not have to be Man vs. Nature (as some industrialists view it) -- that there can be a co-existence or maybe even a symbiosis? The storyline presented realistic conflict among the forces on both sides (nature & animal vs. man) but while the motives of the conflicts on the nature/animal side were understandable, those on the human side were far less so.*** WARNING -- SOME WILL FIND THE FOLLOWING SPOILS THE OUTCOME ***Generally, I often find story lines with supernatural forces are interesting, especially when they deal with moral issues as this does. I can accept that folklore has gods with different levels of power. But it did bother me that the supergod of all Nature, capable walking on water and special powers of healing, of transforming shape from day to night, of spreading out an ooze over the whole land that would injure humans, of living and functioning without a head -- that a god with such powers has a head that can be chopped off by humans and can not find it if humans keep it in a box.",Princess Mononoke
107,Gresh854,Studio Ghibli Fest 2018,10,22 July 2018,"I'm so thrilled that I decided to watch Princess Mononoke for the first time ever on the big screen. Studio Ghibli is just nonstop in terms of their animated quality (leaving most animated studios in the dust) even in times like the 90s when this film was released. The action sequences are crafted with such care and such brutality that it's hard not to be remarkably energized by them. The characters surrounding the movie are so engaging and iconic which immensely supports a deeply fleshed-out and powerfully thought-provoking story. Princess Mononoke is a breathtakingly painted tale of a man on a quest to balance two opposite ends of a war filled with hatred, greed, and violence. The conflict of siding between two teams is quite apparent in the film, and it's resolutions are as beautiful as they are significantly important in the real world throughout human history and especially today. (Verdict: A)",Princess Mononoke
108,harrylosborne,The jewel in Ghibli's crown,10,12 March 2020,"Studio Ghibli almost exclusively produce great films, but Mononoke is more than just colours and smooth animation: it is a complex story of man's attempts to harness nature, and how it shouldn't be a conflict, but instead should be a symbiotic relationship. Using 14th century Japan as the vehicle for this story is perfect - as the nation undergoes an industrial evolution, the forest tries to fight back, and only Ashitaka (the main character) seems to see the full picture.For something animated as far back at 1997, Princess Mononoke looks immaculate. The quality of animation is second to none, and the creativity that went into the aesthetic and the environment is amazing. The accompanying soundtrack is very good: subtle enough not to override the delicacy of some scenes, but still lends sufficient power to more dramatic moments. There is also an abundance of decent voice actors too - Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, John DiMaggio and many others lend their talents to this film, which makes the voice-dubbed version a painless experience.The story is both fantasy and action, a love story and a war film; so many elements combine for this plot, and the film is all the better for it. Loosely, the story follows a prince trying to find the cure for a curse inflicted upon him by a demon, but there is a lot more to it; the relationship between Ashitaka and Mononoke herself is one of both love and hate, since they both care too much for humans and the forest respectively to let one destroy the other.Words don't really do justice to just how good Princess Mononoke is. I know some people won't really understand just why I think this is such a masterpiece of cinema, but there is both nostalgia and emotional power to this film. I know for those that do connect with Mononoke, they will never forget this feature.",Princess Mononoke

A masterwork with compelling characters, a fascinating story and a great message to be learned. Hayao Miyazaki's best film still manages to put many modern anime movies to shame with its amazing visuals, action packed scenes and wonderful soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi. Mononoke Hime avoids the classic black or white morality issue and deals with more powerful themes than other Ghibli movies, turning this film from something that could've easily been a children's book into a fantastic tale for people of all ages. This is, in my opinion, the best anime film of all time.",Princess Mononoke
110,krational66,It's very layered.,9,14 April 2020,"Good film, there are many layers, more and more people like, can not stop.
See environmental protection, only the outermost layer, this film is so good that more than a lot of people imagine, its level is very deep.
In the film, the core characters and their meaning, roughly speaking, the nature represented by mono no ke, the human society represented by the city woman (black hat), and the bystander or thinker represented by the bird (axidaka). In addition, there is the animal kingdom of the radical boar god, the human society of such organizations and so on.
The hero is a near-perfect character, kind and brave (he risked his life to save his family), strong and calm (he ran back and forth between forces at the last minute), big-hearted and big-hearted (the one in dadara). But only in this way can the tragic feelings be reflected. He said to sang, ""we have done our best,"" and held her in his arms, accepting the unknown ending, living or dying, all came like a verdict in that brilliant light. Yes, even if we open our hearts, sympathize with each other, and try our best, we will not be able to balance the conflicts in this world, because it is no longer the so-called desire and contradiction, but the most basic helplessness of life in this world -- heaven and earth are not benevolence, and all things are the dog.
The favorite character is actually the female Lord who represents human reason and desire. In fact, she is by no means avarice or a surrogate for industrial civilization. The film is definitely not an indictment of industrial civilization. She was not cutting mountains and trees for her own greed, but for something very basic: survival. Happiness or pain, even like a ghost in the sickbed to breathe, but also want to live, and live with a little more dignity. On this woman, reflected a lot of human noble character, not pleased by external gains, not saddened by personal losses, there is no romance of the moan, only resolute, indomitable adhere to. There is no wrong, people alive, is the acquisition of nature. As the population grows, human needs become a bottomless pit that cannot be filled, but that is no reason for the uncaring to die without a sound. If being alive means having power, then she's determined to do it. In the end, she did not collapse like the post-modern people in the face of the tragic outcome, but calmly ""start from scratch"". There is no wrong, people, like those weeds, also have tenacious vitality.
Sang, the strength of the portrayal, in fact, not as profound as the former two. But because she is behind, have white Wolf, wild boar, unicorn god and so on, so the strength of this aspect is also very strong. The difference between a Wolf and a wild boar is also intriguing. Just as humans have many different attitudes towards nature, so does the other side of the mirror. Impressive such as the dialogue between the white Wolf and the bird, accompanied by the bleak and distant music (long stone! , such a simple scene, actually absentminded between like an epic feeling.",Princess Mononoke
111,manendra-lodhi,Completing its Purpose.,9,9 July 2012,"In animation films I always like the ideas which are purely imaginative like in the full metal alchemist or complete original ideas like the ratatouille. However in this film the imagination was not that much but there is a humble attempt to give original ideas and a very important message. The animation is good. The cast is very nice. But the fact which has made the film somewhat confused for me is that there is no protagonist or antagonist in the film. The film explores the nature of all the people fighting for their own causes and that is what is beautiful in the film. But I could not attach myself with the film because of this thing may be. The ending is however superb and flawless. The message is given in very much plausible manner.""A recommended watch for all animation lovers.""",Princess Mononoke

114,JaydoDre,A great epic with a few loose ends,8,21 December 2013,"Princes Mononoke is one of Hayao Miyazaki's high profile creations relatively well known in the West, which is not surprising considering its reserved adult tone and the down-to-earth ecological themes that should resonate with the Western audiences. Still, it is a complex epic with a high artistic level and it has a knack for holding the viewer's attention from start till finish.The film tells a story of a conflict between the forest Gods and humans into which the human protagonist is pulled as he comes searching for a cure for his worsening affliction. Although, it has a hippie tint to it, the story is not forcing any opinions and the characters are realistic with appealing personalities.The Japanese acting and its English dubbing are both notable. The makers tried to ensure a high quality conversion into English and even the songs are beautifully sung in English by Sasha Lazard. The English acting however isstrange. A lot of it is bizarrely devoid of emotion, far more than the original material, which is already relatively tame by Japanese animation standards. This is especially true for the main hero's dialogue.This detached English performance keeps coming back throughout the film in various characters and therefore seems to be intentional but it does not appear to be in key with the tone of the movie and, at some points, sounds out of sync with the emotions being portrayed by the characters' faces. As mentioned, the Japanese performance can also be very calm at times, but that calmness serves a purpose to underline someone's character or a particular situation and feels appropriate. The English monotony often does not.With some of the characters the English dub does feel weightier, most notably with the animals, but despite the efforts of such notables as Gillian Anderson the Japanese version still feels far superior.The personalities are all interesting, but the main character is a little unreal. He is a young person who is introduced to a new environment, but whenever it suits the movie, he somehow knows what is going on and what to do, with copious amounts of confidence and better than the characters who have been living at the location for a long time. It feels like the animators cut a few corners with his character not to make the already long movie even longer.The animation is awesome. Myazako is really all about that word, ""animation"". Everything feels alive. This life comes from a high attention to detail. Small and sometimes subtle movements breathe life into the side characters, some of whom will only occupy the screen for a few seconds , but they pass that life on to the rest of the film. These little imaginative details keep the viewer interested and drawn in.The high budget for the film shows in these details and in the fluidity of the animation. There are noticeably many frames of animation, not all the time but there where it matters. The visual transitions are also great, like the change from dry to rainy weather or from living to dead plants. These are made especially effective by sparing use of colour. Bright saturated colour in this film appears to be used primarily for contrast to indicate life or magic.The orchestral soundtrack complements the mood well most of the time, with an occasional recurrence of minimalistic taiko drums for extra contrast. I did notice a few scenes where the mellow music did not fit in with the action, but I know this is more to do with the Japanese cultural outlook on such type of action scenes.What is really good with both the music and other sound effects is that they are used sparingly and stop when appropriate. The lack of sound is used very effectively.If there is one point of contention it is the ending. It feels rushed. Once the movie comes to its conclusion you might realise that the motivations of different characters have not been fully explained. Considering how major the decisions they make are, it would really help to explain things in more detail. The last few events in the film and their consequences are also unclear. At this point the dialogue starts going off the track as well. One of the characters who failed at what he tried to achieve just happily accepts the outcome. The main hero starts uttering empty pretentiousness. Yet another character is just forgotten. Most of the issues the characters had do not get resolved. No lessons learned. The last few minutes of the film just feel mangled up and cut short.I feel the memory of this film in the fans may be a tad rose-coloured, but apart from a few story issues, Princess Mononoke is one of the greatest things you can see on the screen. The interesting details and good contrast in sound and visuals keep the viewer engaged. I want to say this film is what Ferngully should have been, but I feel like I am insulting Princess Mononoke by putting those two in the same sentence.",Princess Mononoke

116,honorhorror,"Behold, the Princess Mononoke.",10,20 February 2009,"If this can't be called the peak of anime art, I would like to say, ""Well, that's ridiculous."" By all means, Mayao Miyazaki gave the world a movie that's worth 100 viewings. And the achievement in the movie history already proved that. Check the IMDb plot keyword ""Epic"", and you will know Princess Mononoke is not the best animation movie, but also one of the best saga created in modern technology. The story involves a warrior, Ashi-taka, who had to leave his remote village for the the middle Japan, after he killed the enraged Mountain Pig and was cursed by it. Experiencing all the pains from the curse, he can't help being involved into the triangle conflict between the forest, the cannon-manufacturing city and the samurai......The movie had its own mythology, in which the forest was protected by the ancient beasts who are now called ""gods"" by other beings. The conflict between human being and the nature was a total war in every aspect. In the development, humans tried to destroy the habitant of the animals so they could derive all the necessary resources. The animals lead by their gods also tried their best to guard the frontier of the forest, killing as much human as they could. Does this sound familiar to you? I guess so because that's the very situation happening a thousand years ago and still happening now. The only difference is the nature only strikes at human in a larger scale in reality. So the movie is somehow unrealistic? No. Wait until the end to conclude. The whole script was so well thought out that every element, every single shot was legendary. You will remember the intense struggle to come to terms between Human and nature in both a symbolic way and a literature way. You will remember the holocaust created by human deeds. And, you will remember the visual style. Differentiated from all the other Miyazaki productions, Mononoke has an cutting-edge look that contains many bloody and gory scenes, decorated with the latest technology at its time. Though the technology it used didn't redefine the whole industry, it overwhelmed the whole movie industry, claiming the coming of an age that animation movies can carry great value like a real-set movie, and deserve more credits. Not after 6 years,an Academy Award for the best animated feature was delivered to Hayao Miyazaki, for his most famous production ""Spirited Away"". I believe without Miyazaki's effort, without the case of Princess Mononoke, we would never have such an award. 10/10. I still gave more credits to it than Wall-E.",Princess Mononoke
117,patrick_dunne,It will change your view of anime,10,20 October 2005,"When many people think of anime, they think of many different things. Some may be schoolgirls with samurai swords. Others may be sick and perverted jokes, and pantie shots. Then again, it may be sheer stupidity, with the characters faces undergoing silly transformations to show emotion.However, Hayao Mayazaki changed all that with Princess Mononoke. It is not as strange as most of his movies, but probably the best out of all of them. It has gruesome action (though not very bloody, like Kill Bill) and a very good story line.Ashitaka is cursed by a demon on his arm and goes to the Forest Spirit to pray for help. However, he is caught in a war between humans and forest animals. Of, course, he is a human, he would naturally work for the humans. But, he falls in love with Princess Mononoke, the girl living in the forest. So, he has to decide between the sides and still get cured by the Forest Spirit, before the curse on his arm eats him alive.This proves that not all anime can be silly and gross. Princess Monoke has very emotional drama, great action, well-thought out storyline, touching romance, and breathtaking visuals. The only flaw I could really find is that it gets old, after watching it too much. (Then again, I've probably seen it 100 times.)It probably doesn't matter if you do, or don't like anime, you should still see this movie. It's brilliant. -10/10The only reason I wouldn't give this a 10, would be that I would not want to watch it again. (Even the greatest films get old after hundreds of viewings.)",Princess Mononoke
118,kurosawakira,Not Devoid of Hope,9,1 June 2014,"I know you'll probably never trust anything I say ever again, but I didn't care about ""Mononoke- hime"" (1997) when I first saw it some ten years ago. I have been, however, on a stroll through Miyazaki's body of work, and I've finally arrived at the princess's domain again.And all I can say is it's nice to be able to change one's mind. The beginning is fervent, echoing both the Narayama legend and King Lear, the former in the strictures of village laws, the latter in its apocalyptic hopelessness: ""this world is a curse"" and ""life is suffering and pain"" could be something uttered by the great old king, wearing his crown of weeds. Without question, then, this complements wonderfully not only Shakespeare but Kurosawa's ""Ran"" (1985), as well, with which it shares the epic of hopelessness. But Miyazaki's film is not devoid of hope altogether. The violence is cruel, the action aggressive and sudden, the sense of death billows over the green meadows. Yet the love burns, the strong impulse to do what's right overpowers, and through death there is life.The last thirty minutes are among the most exhilarating moments of animation I've seen, the sense of crescendo and climax so overpowering it's as if the whole film is about to crumble in its wake. There are small moments of anticipation, details that contain the whole story (the dripping blood at the gate, the bone at the bottom of the lake, the first drops of rain), and they find their counterpoint in the utterly uncontrollable jolt of the resolution. The pond itself is a magical place, cinematically speaking, and the Deer Good exhibits just the right kind of ambivalence. I'm not a person to throw around monikers, but this is powerful cinema in all respects.The name of the film is of interest. The word ""mononoke"" is a general term that means ""a spirit"" or ""a monster"". Thus it's not the name of the princess, as in the English translation ""Princess Mononoke"", but rather has the meaning that's close to ""spirit-princess"". Neither human nor animal.",Princess Mononoke

122,arthera09,"Slow in the middle, but overall great",8,17 August 2010,"I do love this movie. It is just a little slow in the middle. The soundtrack is amazing and the visuals are top notch. There is a reason that Miyazaki is a god among animators, but I honestly think this is one of his weaker films. The characters are one of the most important thing for a movie for me and this movie did not have the strongest characters. I enjoyed them and I enjoyed the fact that Ashitaka was consistent when it came to his moral compass, but the arcs of any of the characters are almost non-existent. There are both scare and suspenseful moments followed by sweet moments that are really enjoyable. I guess the visuals and the universe Miyazaki created is what makes this movie so special. Unfortunately I did not every connect with any of the characters. I think he does a better job with delivering his message with other movies without it being so in your face. It is a great movie, but I do not think it deserves classic status. The middle of the movie was slow because of the characters, but it was really book ended with some truly great and memorable moments. The last big action set piece is one of a kind and I would have thought he would have never topped it if I had not seen Ponyo.",Princess Mononoke

This was the subtitled version and I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, Film 4 chose to show the dubbed version of ""Princess Mononoke"", presumably because it was broadcast in a prime time slot. Despite a script treatment by talented fantasy author Neil Gaiman, the dialogue was pretty lame in places. Some of the so-called voice talent was pretty poor as well. Minnie Driver must have literally phoned her performance in as Lady Eboshi, her voice registering as much emotion as an automated response. Jada Pinkett Smith sounded pretty incongruous as a Japanese iron worker and Billy Bob Thornton just didn't work as the sort-of villain. I enjoyed what I could understand of the plot and the imagery and production design were wonderful.

124,jake-law123,One of Miyazaki's best!,8,1 March 2015,"This is absolutely my 2nd favorite Miyazaki film, the first being Spirited Away. It's definitely one of the more adult animes I've ever seen, and I'm a huge fan of those. I love animes with dark and gritty themes that explore the realms of fantasy, which this film has covered.When a prince from a village is infected with a curse by a demon, he must travel to the West to find a cure, only to find a war being waged between the Gods of the forest/San, the wolf woman of the forest, and the mining town of Irontown, led by Lady Eboshi.Although the themes are centered around the environment, it doesn't include the typical ""man is evil"" message from every other Dances with Wolves or Pocahontas film. Lady Eboshi is likable and reasonable. San is strong willed and protective of the forest, but she has her own faults as well. It's simply about getting over differences when both sides are at fault. It's more about controlling hate and willing to compromise to keep the peace. Even though some of the dialogue kind of forces it in your face, it's still a natural feeling in the end.The animation is fantastic. The lighting and colors are elegant, and the camera angles on certain scenes is stunning. The animation in Miyazaki's films have stylistically evolved over the course of his career, and it shows.The film has a strong emphasis on fantasy. Although it takes itself very realistically and adult, the forest elements involving spirits are not only beautiful, but very powerfully introduced and used. With that said, the fighting scenes are incredibly realistic and entertaining to no end, mostly because of the amazing animation that goes with it.The story is told very quickly, sidestepping when necessary and getting right down to things, which is what I love about it. It doesn't drag, it's long, but very entertaining. There's no bs in this film whatsoever.It's a must see, there's nothing else to say. I recommend the dubbed version for Billy Bob Thorton's voice, it's irresistible. It's not as good as Spirited Away, but it's right there, one of the best animated films of all time.",Princess Mononoke
125,JeffG.,An excellent animated epic!,10,28 November 1999,"Miyazaki and Studio Ghibi have always produced fine work, but they've really outdone themselves with this wonderful anime epic. This movie is the kind of thing that Disney used to put out back in its glory days. Unique tale of man vs. nature stepped heavily in Japanese mythology. The characters are well realized and Miyazaki refuses to make them purely good or evil. They all posess shades of grey that you don't often see in characters in most modern animated fables. The English version of this movie is very well done. The translation is quite accurate and Neil Gaiman was the perfect choice for writing the English screenplay for a movie like this. The dubbing, which could've easilly killed this film, is good for the most part. The best performances come from Gillian Anderson (whose husky voice suits Moro perfectly) and Minnie Driver, who does such a fine job you don't even think about someone speaking with an English accent in feudal Japan.I'm glad to see this movie not only getting released in America, but actually being shown in theaters al well. This is a movie that should be seen on the big screen, as it best delivers the full visual effect. I really hope that Miyazaki makes another movie.",Princess Mononoke

127,Sankari_Suomi,A Miyazaki classic,9,15 July 2017,"This haunting tale of two young hearts trapped in a world gone mad will linger long after you've turned off the TV.The art style is classic Ghibli: fluid movement, realistic proportions, a strong moral component and the traditional clash between noble protagonists and immoral antagonists.That said, it's also pretty dark. Mononoke Hime revels in scenes of wanton violence, involving severed limbs, decapitated heads, copious amounts of blood, and that old Japanese favourite, the orifice-probing tentacle. Perhaps the boldest aspect of the story is its lack of a clear victory for the hero. Resolution is achieved, but it comes at a terrible cost. The most powerful character—a nature god—is presented as benevolent, yet seems almost indifferent to the plight of the forest creatures that worship him. His goals are clear, but his methods are harsh. He shows no interest in evening the score between oppressor and oppressed; he simply seeks to restore the balance, without any regard for the price that others will pay. There is no sense of fairness here. The deer god is an wild spirit; an animist's god from the ancient times. He does not issue judgement; he simply does what needs to be done. 'Justice' is a luxury for the gods of theists.I rate Mononoke Hime at 29.97, which works out as an orifice-probing 9/10 on IMDb.",Princess Mononoke
128,toqtaqiya2,Princess Mononoke preserves the director's spirit of humanism while succeeding as a daring action-adventure.,10,19 October 2010,"Director Hayao Miyazaki spent twenty years considering the story that would eventually become Princess Mononoke, transforming it from something more obviously linked to fairytale and folklore into a passionate plea for us to learn from history instead of simply repeating it. It's an uncomfortable film, full of ambiguity. Ashitaka is the perfect hero, brave, strong, unpretentious, and kind, yet he kills when he has to. San - vicious, unreasoning, and utterly focused - ought to be a villain, but Miyazaki refuses to allow that simplistic label, insisting through each of his characters and their relationships that instead of name-calling we should be cooperating, because the only alternative is destruction. Princess Mononoke is a primitive film in many ways, both violent and pessimistic. The woodlands in which it is set are full of strange spirits and gods, beautiful, but threatening. The score by Joe Hisaishi supports this sense of threat, with a closing theme that's an eerie counter tenor solo that sends chills down the spine. It's also the first Studio Ghibli film to make extensive use of computer animation, a decision taken by producer Toshio Suzuki to meet an otherwise impossible deadline at the end of the three-year production process. Unlike other Miyazaki films this one is not for small children - there's too much violence, bloodshed and death for that. It's a complex, legendary tale, but one that is easy to follow, thrillingly exciting, and never less than beautiful to look at - like a detailed painting brought to life. Though it was Miyazaki's subsequent effort, Spirited Away (2001), that won the Oscar, Princess Mononoke is probably more worthy of it.",Princess Mononoke
129,schroederagustavo,Princess Mononoke Review,8,16 August 2020,"This movie still, 23 years after its release has some of the most impressive hand-drawn animation work (or any kind of animation work) that I have ever seen. It is legitimately a gorgeous movie throughout and it's also very original, I think in the way things are drawn, but also in the way the story is presented. At first, this seems kind of like a simple hero's journey in the way Joseph Campbell described it. And the movie is that, but it starts getting more complicated and there are messages in here about nature and about feminism that to me in 2020, feel a little heavy-handed, but at the same time, I think in 1997 these weren't messages or themes that you saw all over the place, at least not in the way that they are now. Because if this movie came out in 2020, I think the animation would have still gotten all of the praise it got back then, because it is that good. But I think the way some of the messages the movie is trying to convey do feel a little much nowadays, at least for me. This is still a very good movie and very much worth watching. If you're not interested in the story, then it's at least watching for the beautiful animation and soundtrack.",Princess Mononoke
130,sudhakaranakhilan,For the serious anime viewers,8,29 April 2020,"For the persons, not about the kids loving animation, Princess Mononoke will be a better treat for them. The era now ongoing flourished with a lot of 3D colorful and lively animated works, Princess Mononoke went back us to the late decades of 2D animation. We are all familiar with Disney as the king of animation and along with Dreamworks, Pixar, etc but this is from the 'manga' place that is called Japan. The place, setting, and the subject set back us the historical background of Japan. The movie points out the question regarding humans and nature. We are confused about the above question because we don't know what should consider important in the context. Whether we have to fix human above nature or vice-versa. The film smoothly approaches to that question and finds a mid to mid answer through the characterization of Ashitaka. Ashitaka stood along with both nature and humans. It's about the human greed for nature for the development of their society and culture at the same time the animals thriving to set their place. So, Princess Mononoke is for all kinds of film lovers who don't consider animation works as mere a simple kid watching process rather than an important film genre.",Princess Mononoke
131,Doublej20005,A Fantastic Experience,9,6 March 2021,"What a beautiful experience. The animation is some of the best I've ever seen. The backgrounds are beautiful, the character designs fantastic and the action takes full advantage of the fact that this is animated, creating action that wouldn't work nearly as well in live action. It manages to work as both an enjoyable fantasy/action film and work as a film about environmentalism. The characters are so striking and enjoyable to watch, each serving their roles within the story perfectly. The music is just phenomenal - Lord of the Rings seriously ripped this off music wise. The pacing is pretty much pitch-perfect throughout, knowing when to go into all-out-action and when to let the characters have moments to themselves. my only major criticism is the ending, which felt a bit rushed in my opinion. But overall, it's a fantastic film, and I can't wait to check out more of Miyazaki's and Studio Ghibli's work soon.",Princess Mononoke
132,datautisticgamer-74853,A film no anime otaku should look over,10,29 December 2017,"Like with My Neighbor Totoro, this film was playing at the Music Box Theater near me as a New Year's celebration. Thus, I spent the better part of today's afternoon viewing it there. Judging by my rating, you may see where I'm going with this...I was impressed with how this film was presented in its original Japanese language, just subtitled so English speakers could comprehend. It also limits the amount that it can be censored by dubs, which I'm sure other Studio Ghibli movies went through when Fox and Disney dubbed them in the 90s. Anyway, the story is probably where my hardest judgment on this movie is. It can be hard for the common family to understand with its supposed subplots, but they are all written in a way that pristinely intertwine. Just when the second act starts to turn dull (if I had to downgrade this to a 9, it would probably be for that reason, though it doesn't go there), it hoists upon us the epic, heart-stopping third act that had me literally on the edge of my seat in awe. It's an experience I had never really gone through before with a Studio Ghibli film. The music really bolstered this movie, too, since it makes up for not being too tear-jerking with mixing to perfection with the mood and setting, plus beautiful lyrics portrayed by Yoshikazu Mera. The characters contribute to this being a really somber and edgy movie, definitely the perfect contrast to the silliness and light-heartedness of My Neighbor Totoro; they are written in such a way that their overall motives possess several complexities, which admittedly did have me slightly confused. It just goes to show how important the name Hayao Miyazaki is in animation as a whole. Giving us all this is animation that is blowout by anime standards at the time. Glorious environments and character designs come with some of the best incorporation of CGI to hand drawn I have seen in a movie so far. I probably could not make my admiration for Studio Ghibli's animation more lucid than here.You will take something out of this film when you watch it. It is the best anime film I have seen yet, and I want to ensure that more families, especially ones who are ready to expose their children to such edginess, and otaku can view this film. If there is an anime film that one must see before they perish, this is it. I cannot recommend this film enough in a review like this, so stop reading and find a way that you can view it. Once again, Studio Ghibli, I want to thank you for capitalizing on what Akira introduced to us 9 years ago; it was completely worth it.",Princess Mononoke
133,mbhgkmsgg,Princess Mononoke,10,14 November 2020,"Beautiful. Honest. Startling. Those are some of the words that I would use to begin to describe this masterpiece. Princess Mononoke is a brutally honest look at human nature and man's fight against what we don't understand.This movie depicts our relationship with nature more accurately than I would like to admit. Eiter we want to own it or control it, or we fear it because we don't understand it. This is how we have always been, now perhaps more than ever before. We don't care what happens to what is around us as long as it benefits us. And if don't understand it we want to destroy it. Princess Mononoke is, of course, a fantasized version of that brutality, but it doesn't mean that the message isn't accurate.Although this film is full of ugliness it is also exceptionally beautiful. What has never ceased to amaze me is the feel of these films. Achieved with emotional and beautiful music and gorgeous visuals, it's hard not to love every moment and every scene. No matter how difficult or dark a moment in this film is, there is always beauty in it too.It's hard to find any fault in this film. Sure, the story might drag for a bit too long in the middle but you'll forget about that in no time. It's also quite a violent film. Something that might put some people off. Personally, I thought that it was necessary for this film and it drove the message home very effectively. That's something that I have always loved about Miyazaki's films. No matter how crazy or weird his worlds are, the message always shines through brightly. What's more, the message is always important and good.I'm by no means an expert when it comes to Studio Ghibli or Hayao Miyazaki films. I have seen some them over the years and they have always stood out to me from the sea of movies. They have always stunned me with their beauty and made me reflect on the message they convey.

All film bodies seem to be biased against animation. So for a film to break through that barrier and win that grand award, it would have so be something really special. And this film is.It became the highest-grossing film in Japan ever upon release. Even after 20 years, it's still in the top six. The film in the top spot nowadays? Spirited Away.I love Spirited Away. It is one of the greatest films of all time. I will watch it twenty more times in the future, and if I ever have kids, I'll make sure to show it to them once they get old enough to appreciate it.But this film is better.Why? It has a lot to do with the kind of stories the films tell. They both tell their stories extremely well, but Spirited Away is more of a small-scale, conventional story about a girl finding her way home. Princess Mononoke is a grand epic about war, human nature, inevitability, resilience, philosophy, and culture.The best description I can come up with is that this film would Japan's version of The Iliad if The Iliad was as sprawling and beautiful as The Lord of the Rings. But that description does not really do it justice. This is a movie I can spend hours discussing and analyzing from every angle. Even if I saw it a thousand times, I don't think I'd ever get tired of it.Our lead is Prince Ashitaka, who in defending his village had his hand cursed by a demon. He must leave his people, who are rapidly dying out, and ride west to in an attempt to get his hand cured by the forest spirit. But there is a war raging between the forest and man, and he must attempt to negotiate a peace between the two sides if he hopes to get healed. He meets up with San, the titular Princess Mononoke, who was raised by wolves after being abandoned by her human parents. She has a nasty hatred for all things human, but she ends up falling in love with Ashitaka, and the two of them put their lives on the line to bring peace and stop man and beast alike from being torn to pieces.Technically, this is an environmental movie, but it's not preachy or one-sided or simplistic or even biased in favor of nature. It simply presents the two sides and lets the viewer think what they will. Even if this movie were bad, I would give it immense respect for that. Whereas lesser movies are afraid of nuance, this film is built upon it.The characters are a great example of this. There is no real 'bad guy' in this film, just forces and players and people with ambitions and people with understandable prejudices. No character is perfect, but every character is relatable, resulting in a piece of complex and nuanced art.And it is most certainly is art. If there were ever a movie that deserved to be calm, it's this one. The story is electric. The animation is gorgeous. The music is some of the best I've heard in any film. The emotions these 120 or so minutes evoke in me are so numerous and complex that I couldn't hope to list them here. This film would be worth traveling halfway around the world to see. That's not something I often say.This film manages to start out great, get better as it goes along, and finish out on a high note. The last twenty minutes are some of the greatest I've ever seen in any film. It takes all the energy and themes that have been present throughout the film and kicks them into hyperdrive. It's so overwhelming, I don't turn off the film until the credits are done rolling. That's how long it takes for me to even begin to unpack the rush that has unfolded before me.What makes it perfect is that the second credits theme, a replaying of The Legend of Ashitaka, is simply amazing. It a perfect piece of music. It's one of my five favorite pieces of all time. Whenever it randomly comes in my playlist, I get chills down my back. When it comes up in the ends credits, I collapse into a glorious fit of emotions and sensual overload and glorious euphoria.From its visuals to its storytelling to its presentation, this is the definitive animated film. It is superb. It is beautiful. It is a masterpiece.",Princess Mononoke
137,DonaldDooD,A Masterpiece,9,27 July 2014,"Princess Mononoke is one of Studio Ghibli's most acclaimed films, only behind Spirited Away. And few films deserve so much praise. Princess Mononoke is beautiful, emotional, and surprisingly violent. When I first watched it at 13/14, it was like nothing I'd ever seen, and it holds up.Miyazaki's films, especially Castle in the Sky and Nausicaa, focus on man's relationship with nature. But in these films, its clear that the environmentally-unfriendly military men are the bad guys. There is little characterization to them. Princess Mononoke is the ultimate evolution of these ideas, where neither side is portrayed as good or evil. Lady Eboshi, the leader of the mining town, is callous towards nature, but kind to her people, taking in those society has thrown away. The gods and beasts of the forest exhibit similar love and hate. This balance makes the world more realistic, and the danger more terrifying. And while some sort of peace is made between the sides, Miyazaki doesn't force a perfect answer.But its more than environmental commentary. The animation is among the best. Combined with majestic backgrounds of nature and a dramatic orchestra score, only other Ghibli films come close to matching Princess Mononoke's beauty. The action is thrilling, with perfect dramatic tension and intimidating creatures to face against the humans. Its one of the hardest PG-13 films I've seen, so don't show it to underage kids.Princess Mononoke is an anime classic. Everyone whose a fan of animation has seen this film. I'm just another voice gushing over it. If you're not a fan of anime, I promise you it doesn't fall for its immature tropes. If a 9-star film had to be a 10, I'd choose this one.",Princess Mononoke

140,winstonsmith_84,"Good stuff, not my kind of anime though",8,14 February 2002,"Princess Monoke was allright I guess.  I started off my anime watching with Akira and Ghost in the Shell, this is the 3rd I have seen.  And it's OK. Didn't think the animation was as good as Ghost in the Shell, but it was on par with Akira... The story was very original, and lots of good characters, plot developments, and complex characters add to the intelligent nature of this movie.  I didn't find the talking animals corny, or any element of the plot corny. The man vs. nature theme was good in this movie, more complex than expected. And, of course, the voice overs were incredibly well done.But even though this movie had all this great stuff, it wasn't my kind of movie in the end, really.  I was a bit bored through it, I guess, but other viewers who love anime will like it I guarantee.  I didn't think it was ""THE STAR WARS"" of anime or anything, but it is worth watching.  This movie could have been more interesting to me personally if turned into a feature film.  Imagine that!  So this is after all, quite the epic movie.  All the right ingredients.. so enjoy.",Princess Mononoke
141,robinski34,King of the World,9,8 June 2014,"Princess Mononoke is a delightful anime from the man who has come to define everything that is best about the genre, arguably, this was Hayao Miyazaki's calling card to the world outside Japan. The English voice cast boasts Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Jada Pinkett Smith, Gillan Anderson and Keith David - a considerable volume of talent for an animation back in 1997 (Toy Story was 1995), arguably marking the beginning of another trend - for big names to be heard and not seen. There are familiar anime tropes here, but all handled with such sensitivity and style that they still feel fresh on viewing today. The theme of environmentalism is strong, but not stereotyped - character motivations going far beyond cardboard cut-out in their complexity, and it is refreshing and enjoyable that Miyazaki finds room for nobility and honour in his protagonists given the present penchant for anti-heroism. Cinema is the poorer for the recent news that Miyazaki has retired at the age of 73. Here's hoping that the art of animation and of film-making properly acknowledge the debt that it owes him.",Princess Mononoke
142,GuyCC,A True Masterpiece of Animation.,10,17 November 1999,"I simply wasn't prepared for this film.  I honestly can't remember seeing a recent animated film that has swept me away like this movie did.  Actually, disregarding the fact that this is an animated film, this is one of the best movies that I've seen in quite a while.For some reason, I kept looking for a reason to be disappointed, but I couldn't.  Some flaw.  Some story element that just didn't click.  But it never happened.  The animation is incredibly fluid and conveys with an incredible amount of detail the personalities of the main characters.  The musical score is gorgeous, ranking up there with some of John Williams and James Horner's best works.  Neil Gaiman's translation is intelligent and natural sounding, and the voice acting is excellent.  It's not as quite as bloody as some people would have you believe, but it does have its fair share of violence.  Actually, the only thing I found strange was Billy Bob Thornton's voice and the look of Jigo.  The voice just didn't match the face.  But that's not to say Thornton gave a bad performance. If this film is overlooked as just an ""animated film"", then  it's a true loss on the critics' parts.  It deserves a chance at ""Best Foreign Film"" or even ""Best Picture"".  This is a beautiful fantasy epic, and it's understandable why this was Japan's big money-maker.  I'm really pleased that Miramax/Disney brought this movie to America with the care that they did.  I hope to see more, and I can't wait until the DVD comes out. Recommended to fans of fantasy, animation, or people who just enjoy a quality movie.",Princess Mononoke
143,hung_fao_tweeze,I'm in love with this movie,9,20 September 2008,"I'm not sure how this movie could be better than it is already. First off, I hate anime. The familiar generic characters typical of this genre are here, but I found that the weight of the story and the beauty of the presentation immediately negated this distraction for me. This is a beautiful film!!! This is a great story - never dull. The accolades poured on this movie by other reviewers are well-deserved. Though I harbored reluctance to see this film compounded by my son's infatuation with the likes of Pokemon and such ilk, I found myself sitting up and applauding the gorgeous attention to visual nuance right from the outset. I can't say anything more that hasn't already been said. I can say that I loved the movie the first time I saw it, loved it even more the second time, and found that it was just as good the third time! Many have made comparisons to Disney here. Disney Studios have never had an animated story that was this good. Many have also noted that this movie is better than most non-animated films. I second and third that motion. So well loved by me that I did not hesitate to purchase it for my library---and I don't take lightly my purchases. I won't own just any film. This is truly a cut way above. Not only is it two thumbs up, my big toes are also standing in admiration. SEE THIS FILM!",Princess Mononoke

Although there are strong element of hatred and ruthlessness shown in this film, it also has endearing creatures of both existing and supernatural worlds which is truly a delightful watch. This film is a beautiful fantasy film and the adventure here is skillfully narrated and realised just like other classic epics.What can be learned from this anime film are a portion of life itself and the consequences of human's greediness and selfishness towards nature and its surroundings. The relationship between human and human, human and nature, supernaturals and everything else in this film are remarkable as it teaches us to respect and treat each other with kindness.

145,thousandisland,Lovely but not for everyone..,4,9 May 2001,"I don't understand what all the commotion is about with this film.. Yes, it is beautiful to look at and has great characters and artistry, but it's so hard to follow!  It suffers the same deadfall that many, perhaps MOST anime films do.. The plot is just too confusing.  It starts out ok, even the middle of the film is engaging, but by the end of it there is utter confusion:  Too many characters fighting for too many different reasons.  I am even a science major, an adult, and an animation connoisseur, and this film stumps me.  There are all of these different parties going after the forest spirit, but also fighting eachother.  The forest spirit is ambiguous itself, friendly one moment, and then dangerous when its head is cut off. Warriors want to keep the head as a trophy, so they're stirring up trouble for everyone. There are the metal workers who are doing their own thing but inadvertently creating demons when animals get shot.  Sometimes.  Depending on the species of animal which is infected with the bullet. I think.  Then you have the boar people who are fighting everybody and trying to protect the forest.. And the princess and the wolves, who are really aloof and not on anybody's side.  And then there's Ashitaka, who is mixed up with all of them and has the demon infection himself and wants to find a cure. And we have to hurry up and reunite the forest spirit with its severed head, or we're all doomed.Get all that?  Lovely artwork from the characters to the landscape to the action... Breathtaking scenery and mysticism, but a little too muddled to come off triumphant.  This film would be excellent if it were more explanatory, or just had its plot streamlined a bit.  Anime fans may get it, but I think the average American viewer will be up the creek without a paddle.  Or maybe on the shore WITH a paddle.  Anyway, I'm getting dizzy just trying to sort it out.  A for effort, though..",Princess Mononoke
146,crowrobot,"""Why are you here?"" ""To see with eyes unclouded by hate.""",10,15 October 2006,"'Princess Mononoke' is, quite frankly, one of the greatest animated films of all time. It's a classic, filled with terrific, eye-popping imagery, complex characters, and it is truly powerful in its dramatic impact. I came close to tears by the film's end.The first thing you will notice about 'Mononoke' is the animation. Animation god Hayao Miyazaki fills his screen with lush colors and bizarre fantasy creatures (personal favorite: Ashitaka's deer/horse steed Yakul). It's a far cry from the increasingly cheap animation we have in America. The movie is ambitious in its scale, and there are some truly magnificent set-pieces, like the near-apocalyptic ending.Also of particular note is the story. These characters and this plot are not black-and-white. Lady Eboshi may be cutting down the forests and angering the gods, but she truly believes it will help her people; she shows compassion to outsiders like lepers and prostitutes, and her regret at Ashitaka's cursed arm is sincere (she did, after all, cause the boar god's madness). San, the ""Princess Mononoke"" of the title, has shades of gray, too: Yes, we sympathize with her desire to protect the forest, but she is not innocent of bloodshed. Even Jigo, a con man/priest who wants the Forest Spirit's head for the Emperor (which is obviously a bad idea), has his reasons for committing what may be considered ""evil"".The English voice cast has divided people, but I liked it. Billy Crudup brings gravity and stoicism to Ashitaka, and Claire Danes is appropriately fierce as San. The standouts, however, lie in the supporting cast. Minnie Driver is perfect as Eboshi, bringing wit and elegance to the role; Gillian Anderson breaks from her Scully persona to deliver a powerful performance as ancient wolf god Moro; Keith David, one of America's most underrated actors, rules as the boar god Okkoto, and Billy Bob Thornton is very funny as Jigo. Thornton's Southern drawl has caused controversy amongst fans, but I think it adds to the character's charm.'Princess Mononoke' is a masterpiece. To find a flaw in this movie is impossible.",Princess Mononoke
147,Cylex,"Brilliant, Weird",7,27 September 2001,The animation is spectacular. I especially liked the wolves and the wood sprites. The characters are well developed and no one is wholly evil. I was still on the side of the animals though. The plot is not in any way predictable and I was gripped from the start. The woods were full of all kinds of bizarre creatures and I liked the way they talked. I was a little startled by the violence but that was all part of the fun. A real masterpiece. 10/10,Princess Mononoke

149,chuck-526,sound both ways on DVD,10,20 October 2009,"Watching this classic hit Princess Mononoke now (2009) means DVD. The Region 1 DVD has lots of choices for sound, so you can either watch the ""American"" version or the ""Japanese"" version (or watch both or even switch), perhaps depending on whether or not you're an anime geek. The DVD has both the original sound track and the ""dubbed"" English sound track (and a dubbed French sound track too). It has two separate sets of subtitles, one also called ""captions"" that matches the dubbed English translation, and the other also called ""subtitles"" that are apparently the original transliteration from Japanese to English. (Be careful though that although both original and dubbed soundtracks are on this particular DVD, this is not necessarily true of other DVDs. For example I've heard, although I haven't yet seen for myself, that the only way to get both original and dubbed soundtracks on the same media for Ponyo is to get the Blu-Ray version.) The dubbing is very high quality. Although there are lots of opinions about exactly how it should have been done (or even whether it should have been done at all), it's clear it wasn't done ""in a hurry"" or ""on the cheap"". Although various people take issue for different reasons with different voices used for dubbing, the appropriateness and quality of the voices seem good to me.The original English subtitles are severely abbreviated, almost schematic. Comparing them to other translations available on the web (I don't speak Japanese) shows they're invariably much shorter. They minimally sketch in the story line while letting the viewer focus on the visual.One even suspects the original English subtitles weren't given careful attention, as frequently they are a bit awkward or stilted, and it seems they don't even try to carry nuances. For example, the Emishi village is led by an old woman; she helps think for the village, and when necessary she predicts the future too. The dubbed translation calls her the ""wise woman"", whereas the original subtitles call her the ""oracle"". Surely a better word naming a leader than ""oracle"" was available.A definite plus of the original subtitles is they're very good at conveying the (assumed intentional) ambiguities in the audio. Sometimes words can be understood two different ways, and every once in a while it's not clear which of two characters in a scene spoke some of the words. For example ""forget it"" can mean either ""you aren't understanding me"" or ""don't remember what you think you just saw"" (or both). The original subtitles are very good at conveying this sort of thing.You can switch between the various subtitles with the usual DVD button. But for some reason you can't use the usual Audio/Language DVD button to switch between dubbing and original; you have to go to the Menu, change the Spoken Languages setting, then select the Return to Film option from the menu.The music is almost exactly the same (except for translated lyrics) in both original and dubbed sound tracks. My guess (I don't really know) as to how they did this is the creators of the dubbed sound track had the complete original score, and had the whole thing performed again. The sound effects are largely the same too, although in the dubbing the intensity and timing of the sound effects are frequently modified.The English dubbed soundtrack is not just a literal translation, but is slightly different in quite a few ways. (The very simplified mouth movements of anime characters make it easy to change words, or languages, or even to make a silent character speak.) Types of differences in the dubbed soundtrack I noticed include: perhaps most importantly, the plot and symbolism of the story is made plainer; some of the dialog is a little more colorful; simple cultural differences are bridged painlessly (by contrast, more complex cultural differences are wisely ignored); ambiguous language is made clearer; a sexual innuendo (the only one I noticed) is softened so much that it disappears; and sometimes elements of the story thought distracting are simplified.And a very few times it appears the translators just plain blew it (or tried to change something I don't think they should have). When in the Emishi village the girl Kaya calls the departing Ashitaka ""older brother"" and gives him her jeweled dagger, the dubbing just translates the words literally, which means treating the girl as nothing more than a little sister. As a result, much later when San is given the jeweled dagger, she can't say anything more than ""pretty"". The original term though is one of those words that has both an archaic and a modern meaning. The archaic meaning is something closer to ""respected elder"", making it clear the girl is not his blood sister but rather his village sweetheart. And her jeweled dagger is a symbol of ""eternal love"", like a gold locket to Americans. Thus Ashitaka later giving the jeweled dagger to San plainly states his choice of his one true love. Unfortunately the dubbed sound track misses all this.",Princess Mononoke

151,cleary-joshua,The tale of Man vs. Nature,8,11 July 2013,"There is a long-running debate about Studio Ghibli movies as to whether it is necessary to watch them with subtitles, or it is okay to use the dubbed English. I won't get too far into this for fear of starting an argument, but for ""Princess Mononoke"", I did feel that the subtitles slightly ruined my viewing experience. Unlike many other movies that I've watched with subs, they felt slightly distracting. However, despite this, I did enjoy the film very much.The movie is essentially the tale of man vs. nature. A prince from a secluded tribe has to leave to meet his fate and save himself from certain death. Along the way, he meets a princess who is the daughter of a god (a large wolf), and she is fighting another woman who is the head of a large mining cooperation. The iron mine's presence means that the forest, home to many spirits, demons and other creatures, is being destroyed. To the untrained viewer, ""Princess Mononoke"" is just a dressed up fairy tale, about the destruction of the countryside and pollution. Really, it's a lot more than that. There's a lot about good and evil in the film, and how one person's good is another person's evil. It's very thought provoking, and creates a lot of questions afterwards. The characters are strange and fascinating, and their stories are told in such a way that you feel like you know what they've been through. Ashitaka's constant ability to see good in everyone is a quality which is not often seen, and it works well throughout.The biggest and best part of the film, however, is the animation. It's very beautiful and the fact that it's hand drawn makes it even more stunning. The action is gripping, and the huge battles towards the end are always interesting and engaging. Miyazaki has a magical way of thinking up spectacular monsters and creatures which you let yourself believe exist while your watching. It's very quirky in its animation, with strange things like the kodama, but this merely adds to its charm.The biggest problem with the film is its length. It's over 2 hours long, and this just feels like too much at numerous parts of the film. Even Spirited Away, which is barely 2 hours, feels like a strain at some point, and in Mononoke, it really drags at times when you're not really sure what's going on. The length does make the ending feel like more of an achievement, though, and it's the ending that makes certain parts of the film feel more worth it.",Princess Mononoke

The real theme of princess mononoke is to explore the meaning of life, as its main character ashitaka has repeatedly shouted: ""live.""
Although in various behind-the-scenes documentary hayao miyazaki stressed several times, he will not deliberately in the creative process to cater to the tastes of the audience or use a common story, every one of his works are like to ""behind closed doors, go out to match the"" this sentence for example, conforms to the people in the story of several thousand years experience summed up in the traditional rhythm.

153,Sanou_san,"Seen it, and it wasn't disappointingit was rather EXCELLENT.",10,27 December 2008,"Hayao Miyazaki's project never failed my excitement. He is totally different in the conventional art of 2d animation filled with so much story and detail. Though simple, it's packed with innovativeness and imagination. No wonder he deserves recognition and glory for his works. Mononoke-hime certainly warrants being included in top 250 of this site. The animated film, tells another enchanting story of forest gods co-existing with humans, and their conflicts with each other rising and remained unsettled. The main character in the name of Ashitaka (Yoji Matsuda), the boy residing in a village, who serves as a scout to watch for his village became the starting point of the story. Later the plot progresses into something complicated but nevertheless understandable in long run. I would admit that I'm being led to the idea that San (Yuriko Ishida) appears to be the antagonist, but revelations poured gradually all throughout the film.What's good about Hayao Miyazaki's project for Mononoke-hime as a successful animated film was he's unfailing creativeness and focus on the detail of the entire atmosphere of his story. The characters; both protagonist and antagonists, supporting characters, extra characters, the tree, the grasses, the sky, rocks, both living and non-living thing are given detail that doesn't only make their presence in the film subtle but significant and typical in their respective character. Unlike other frequent animations that only concentrate within the central characters moving and chatting and whatever they are doing. In this movie however, Miyazaki once again preserve the beauty of his work. What more I loved about this film is that it is not only filled with action, revelations, fantasy and creativeness, but along this primary qualities of a good film Hayao never fails to incorporate values and virtues on his stories. No matter how unbelievably unconvincing the nature of the film, he manage to create a system of the story on how characters reacts, acts and plays throughout.

Female characters wield a lot of power in this movie.The strength of the film is the animation.  The land was rendered lush and vibrant.  It made me pine for a planet covered in forest.

155,badoli,A masterpiece forever in my 3 best animated movies.,10,26 July 2021,"And a masterpiece that easily holds up to any movie, while doing this in a breathtaking beauty.Most reviewers marvel at the visual style, which is by no question amazing. Yet the greatest archivement of what makes this an epic is the ease in which it tells a complex story about various parties at war within a detailled set of rules, laws and traditions while still managing to focus on the small as to not overwhelm the viewer. You have war factions crashing, you have animal spirits attacking human caravans, you have emporer henchmen, you have nature gods in mystical forests transcending human comprehension and you have a boy trying to understand what is happening to his world. The amount of directors i would trust to pull all these ideas off successfully in one single movie fits in my hand. And yet Hayao Miyazaki makes it look like it's the easiest thing in the world.One of the biggest aspects which sets it far apart from general hollywood animation is the fact that you have no ""good versus evil"". All characters have their own motivations, views and flaws, which lead to the actions they take to influence the way story turns out. The hero isn't a hero for killing the villian, he is just pushed into a complex world to navigate. At times he has to take actions he doesn't want to and at times he has to decide between two equal choices. There is no clear path and that makes his world feel so natural.Of course it wouldn't be the epic masterpiece it is without amazing visuals and music. You're carried into a mesmerizing wonderland in such a fantastic fashion, i get teary eyed just thinking about it. This is what cinema should be.",Princess Mononoke
156,punctate,a masterpiece,10,4 January 2000,"Is Princess Mononoke for children in North America? The answer can be yes or no it depends on your viewpoint. A lot of this film will go over well with children and the intense violence well scare them out of their seats. The girls in Iron town were rescued from the brothels and they do mention that in the film but they don't say what they did other then men bother them. The film runtime is 135 minutes; children are use to films that run for only 80-90 minutes, as the result children will have trouble following the film. Adult anime fans will love this movie unless they just watch anime for animated nudity. When Ashitaka defeats a boar that had turned into a demon he is left with a mark on his arm that will spread across his body and kill him. Ashitaka leaves his village to find the Sprit of the forest in the forest from which no man has returned. Ashitaka makes to it a town called Iron Town where they make Iron. The town is run by Lady Eboshi who wants to tame the forest to gain profit; she is destroying the forest. Lady Eboshi has very good aspects to her she did rescue women from the brothels and gave Lepers a chance to work. A relationship develops between Princess Mononoke who was raised by wolf gods and Ashitaka when Ashitaka rescues Mononoke from Iron Town. The story is struggle between good and evil but simplistic one like in the case of Disney films. Japanese films have more freedom when it comes to creating their stories since they don't have to worry about over sensitive editors. Hayao Miyazaki gives us a story about how humans, animals and nature gods constantly fight over share of emerging order. The ending isn't better then life happy like in Disney its just practical and realistic. This movie is very well directed, the story is enchanting and involving, it grabs the audience attention and never lets it go. The animation is sharp and visually stunning, a true landmark in animation and fantasy adventure, a flawless masterpiece. 10/10 A definite contender for Best Foreign Picture at the Academy Awards.",Princess Mononoke
157,Ripe Peach,100% genre compliant,1,30 November 2003,"A badly translated script that leads to the voice talent jabbering most of the time, the usual array of characters who's personalities are blindingly apparent from their portrayals (wide mouthed buffoon, sinister moustachioed dwarf, icy bitch, spunky hero, spunkier heroine), and a plot that could be synopsised as ""Two legs bad, four legs good"".  Oh, and tentacles.  Tentacles everywhere.Fans of anime will lap it up.  Everyone else should avoid, because it's just the same old garbage, warmed up and seasoned with a few B list USian actors.",Princess Mononoke
158,Jeremy Bristol,Lush anime from Miyazaki-sensei,9,9 June 2001,"Mononoke Hime is nearly the ne plus ultra (look Mom, I can use big words!) of anime--certainly the animation is the best to date from Miyazaki (he supposedly created 80,000 himself).  The story is like a beefed-up remake of the Nausicaa movie (sans flying) and Shuna's Journey (sans flying saucer-like god machine).  The characters are complex, with no one acting out of evil (though there are scenes of violence that culminated out of anger, usually Ashitaka's).The best part, though, is when San ""kisses"" the food into Ashitaka's mouth, which works for me on two levels.  First, this is the first real act of kindness anyone has directed towards Ashitaka since his own sister broke the ancient customs to give him her jeweled dagger. Secondly, the Japanese are a really restrained society, and, supposedly, traditional parents won't kiss or embrace in public or even in front of their children (trivia: the concept of kissing was imported to Japan by Dutch missionaries (don't ask me why they showed them) in the 1500's--before that, the Japanese did not kiss).I have only two complaints about Mononoke Hime, one major and one minor. The minor one is that, as with kissing, gunpowder (and by proxy guns) was introduced to Japan by European travelers (which shows just how isolated a culture Japan was at the time), not by the Chinese.  Of course, there were no god beasts, either--this is a fantasy version of the past, not meant to be accurate (I'm sure an anthropologist would likely have something to say about the iron town, as well).  The major thing: the two pigs who get cursed.  I'm sure they're supposed to appear grotesque and disgusting, the way Miyazaki must imagine hatred to look like, but the snake things and the Super-Soaker blood is too over-the- top to be anything but ridiculous, ruining the tone of any scene they are in.",Princess Mononoke
159,JTurner82,"Breathtaking. Watch with ""eyes unclouded.""",10,20 March 2005,"In its theatrical Japanese release of 1997, PRINCESS MONONOKE was the hugest box office grossing movie of all time in the land of the Rising Sun until it was overtaken by James Cameron's TITANIC, and, four years later, director Hayao Miyazaki's own SPIRITED AWAY. No wonder. This movie, like an earlier project of Miyazaki's, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, explores man's relationship with nature, hatred causing destruction, and, more importantly, real characters (in other words, no real ""hero"" or ""villain"") trying to get by in a world continually torn by war.This is not a movie for young children, as there are disturbing shots of decapitations, amputations, and occasional blood spurts. Sometimes these elements of violence turn squeamish viewers away from Anime (especially when they're done gratuitously), but Hayao Miyazaki presents it not to sicken people but to show it for the horror that it is (plus, in this film, the violence is not overdone). Take, for example, the scene where the protagonist, Prince Ashitaka of the Emishi Tribe, possessed by a curse he received from killing a Demon God (in trying to protect his village), tries to stop samurai attacking innocent people, and in doing so shoots the arms off of one man, and, later, takes off a man's head with two arrows. The sight is horrifying to see, but the deed also increases Ashitaka's demon mark on his arm, which is slowly preparing to take his life. This is a truly horrible depiction about the dangers of violence.Also worth noting is Princess Mononoke herself, a human girl named San raised by the Animal Gods, and her struggle against Lady Eboshi of Iron Town, who is destroying the forest merely for her people's own good (the folks are outcasts, including lepers and prostitutes). San distrusts and despises all humans, and is especially determined to destroy them all (particularly Eboshi)... or die trying. When she's rescued by Ashitaka, however, a conflict within her begins to surface: are *all* humans evil, or is there at least one who is trustworthy? If there is any character who could be considered a villain, it would be the monk, Jigo, who wants the head of the Spirit of the Forest to bring to the Emperor. Such a deed would destroy the entire forest (as we find out in the film's chilling climactic scenes) but even Jigo has his own motives, too. He is not so much evil as much as he is just ""trying to get by"". This pretty much sums up the conflicts between all our characters here.PRINCESS MONONOKE may not have enjoyed similar box office success here in America, but at least a lot of work and care went into the translation. As with Disney's other English language tracks for Miyazaki's films, this one is very, very well done. Acclaimed writer Neil Gaiman worked on the script, rewording it only to a) fit the mouth flaps, and b) make it understandable to a non-Japanese audience who would probably not comprehend a lot of the cultural nuances found in this film. Added to which, the voice cast includes a commendable list of stars; Billy Crudup is perfect as Ashitaka, eliciting just the right amount of warmth, kindness, compassion, wisdom, and courage, while Claire Danes delivers passionately angry, conflicted turmoil to San. (Folks said she was miscast, but I beg to differ; her character is *required* to be outraged and aggressive, and Danes does have a strong voice to carry such emotions.) The rest of the cast includes Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo (a grossly underrated performance; his Southern drawl adds to the character), Minnie Driver (elegant choice!) as Lady Eboshi, Gillian Anderson as the Wolf-Goddess Moro, and Jada Pinkett-Smith as the friendly (if no-nonsense style) worker Toki. The translation flows smoothly to those who are not familiar with Japanese folk tales, and the story succeeds in making its point, too.This movie may not be for everybody, as it is the kind of film that may disturb young children, but older audiences will find themselves absorbed in the artwork, which showcases gorgeous, unmatched imagination, from the finely detailed forests to the cute little Tree Spirits who appear and disappear at will to the Forest Spirit itself -- a huge deer who makes plants grow with each step he takes. And at night he becomes a ghostly specter known as the Nightwalker, traveling higher than the trees. Such images warrant the purchase of this film. Better yet, its message is not too preachy, and rarely do animated movies (save those from Japan) showcase characters portrayed as, well, human beings.",Princess Mononoke
160,GreyFox37,a beautiful anime for all to see,10,28 February 2001,"one word, wow. this is an incredibly beautiful anime. just about everything is perfect, the animation is detailed and colorful, the story is rich and teaches a valuable lesson, the animals are cool, and the characters are very structured. this is very violent, though, there is decapitation and disembowlment. overall, even if you don't like anime, this is one title you don't want to miss.",Princess Mononoke
161,varundelpiero,Perhaps Miyazaki's most powerful and epic offering to date,9,26 January 2009,"Hiyao Miyazaki has gained his fame as a uniquely talented animator in Japan; one who has been deemed good enough to be imported to Western cinema. Miyazaki has also been known as a strict conservationalist/environmentalist, and this film combines his two passions seamlessly. I am aware that pretty much all of Miyazaki's films have environmentalist messages/undertones, but this one has a particularly strong and powerful meaning.As always, Miyazaki's films are catered to more mature audiences, and this one has one of the most intelligent and complex story lines one is apt to see in an animated feature. That's not to say that children will not be fascinated by the unique and flowing visuals, but it should also be noted that this is one of Miyazaki's most violent films, and contains various depictions of decapitations, dismemberments, and blood. As such, very young children may be detracted from the film, but audiences from their teens to their twilight years would find this a uniquely fascinating and rewarding movie-going experience.Thankfully, I was able to procure a subtitled version and not the dubbed one (although I am aware that the English voice acting was not as cheesy as most dubbed tiles) The main characters are quite likable and audiences will enjoy going along with them on their emotional and physical rides. Moreover, Miyazaki does not take sides, and presents the story in an intelligent and unbiased fashion, intimating that everyone acts in what they believe is their best interest.This was my third Miyazaki film and I enjoyed this even more than HAURU NO UGOKU SHIRO, but not as much as SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI. Overall, this film deserves a 9/10 and 3.5 star rating (out of 4). Should enter my Top 150 at 144. Unreservedly recommended.",Princess Mononoke
162,baumhenrik,One of the best in history,10,4 April 2019,"When I first saw 'Princess Mononoke' on Christmas eve back in 2006 I was 10 years old and couldn't really follow the story since I was quite disturbed from the explicit graphic content. Especially the giant pig suffering of a demonic disease scared the hell out of me back than. But never less is knew that this movie is something special, something I have never seen before. Since then I became a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and watched nearly everything they have produced. But still 'Princess Mononoke' stands out to me as their best work and to me is Hayao Miyazakis masterpiece. The topic of this movie is just as simple as complex. It's the fight between human culture coming with the technologic industry versus the nature and its variety of animals living in it and to this day it's a pretty relevant topic. The way both sides are portraied in this movie is just beautiful. Miyazaki manages to show both sides with all their strength and weaknesses. There's no good side or bad side. Instead every side can be understood by the viewer and even if you don't agree with their opinions you still are able to see why each side acts like they do. The visual work is top notch like always with Studio Ghibli. I love how they create a feeling for nature as one whole organism. I really recommend everyone to go watch this movie. To me this is one of the best movies ever created.",Princess Mononoke
163,neon47,Brilliant and Beautiful,10,15 May 2005,"This has to be one of the best anime's I've seen since Neon Genesis Evangelion. It's lush and beautiful. The story begins with the hero, Ashitaka, defending his village from an attacking demon. Ashitaka fights bravely but is touched by the beast and falls to a curse that will consume his body unless he finds the Spirit of the Forest (which is like a 100 point buck). During his travels ends up staying at a village that minds iron. Hence the name Iron Town. Ashitaka soon finds that Iron Town and the forest are at war. During his stay Princess Mononoke, her name throughout the movie is mainly San, attacks. Ashitaka breaks up the fight between M'lady (leader of Iron Town) and San. Soon Ashitaka finds himself caught up in the battle. The story is magnificent and makes for a great D&D scenario for you geeks out there (long live D&D). I have absolutely no complaints about this movie. I love the ending, which is something I'm VERY picky with. I recommend this to anyone who loves anime, adventure, and/or Record of Lodoss War.",Princess Mononoke
164,andyetris,Odd and Unpredictable,7,31 July 2003,"If you can look beyond the hype, this film is fascinating and radically different from its U.S. competition.  It's an odd rambling adventure, and contains a good deal of violence that makes it too strong for very young viewers.  I would recommend it for middle-school children, but for adults its chief charm is its unpredictability.What happens in this film is never what you might expect.  Standard Hollywood ideas of story development, in which bad behaviour brings about its own punishment and difficulties are valuable learning experiences, are largely ignored and the film does not end with all problems resolved. Most of the characters are not at all complex, however, and, with a few key exceptions, are relatively standard for contemporary Japanimation (anime.) There is nothing that could really be described as character development, there isn't really much of a plot, and the story just sort of ambles along to a puzzling ending.Other reviewers have encapsulated the story.  Prince Ashitaka is the beautiful, stern young protagonist standard for anime.  He rides a red elk and contradictorily fights with the power of hate, which provides the movie with some wholly unnecessary additional violence.  Princess Mononoke is the pretty teenage heroine likewise standard for anime.  She has been raised by wolves and consequently wears a fur stole (er - wolf fur?) and white jewelry.  The most interesting characters are the rascally monk/imperial agent Jigo, and Lady Eboshi.  Why does the emporer support Lady Eboshi in creating Irontown?  Why is she building up a powerbase?  Does she form a society of lepers and former prostitutes for humanitarian reasons, or for their loyalty?These and many other questions are never resolved, which adds some intrigue to the story.  However even the theme of the film, that humanity is out of touch with nature, is handled in a vague and contradictory way.  Are the humans supposed to embrace nature by putting on warpaint and riding wolves, or just not be in the forest at all?  Just how natural ARE boars that talk and wear warpaint?  Is the willingness of the wolves to let the boars die, or the attitude of the monkeys, meant to cast an ironic light on Princess Mononoke's faith in solidarity with nature?  The film also makes vague gestures in the direction of immanence but again, nothing is very clear.None of this is necessarily BAD, but it's hard to derive an ultimate meaning from all these tantalizing puzzles.  Still, it's a lot more intriguing than anything I've ever seen from Disney.",Princess Mononoke
165,taldarus,Miyazaki's Work on War,10,5 December 2020,"This is my favorite of his many movies, well maybe second favorite.His best movie is brutal torture to watch, and you should only watch it if you want to understand the creator of so many powerful, beautiful stories better. Grave of the Fireflies is a rough one, and I will immediately go and write a review on it after this one. Anyway.Mononoke Hime is a powerful movie, and I have seen it countless times. Unlike Grave, it is extremely watchable and approachable. The story isn't subtle, but neither is it simplistic. There is no 'bad guy' in this story as everyone is open and upfront with our hero, an unbiased observer, we can quickly learn that everyone has relatively decent reason for what they do.Still everyone is consumed with the fervor of war that even poisons the land itself, and we the lucky viewer get to watch a man who barely remembers the war, but did know its effects. All of his best works speak on and condemn war, and I can respect a man who is so vocal and honest about the horrors and destruction it brings.Not his best telling of the story, but definitely the easiest and most enjoyable to watch. If you don't know who the man is. Do yourself a favor and start here.",Princess Mononoke
166,benjamin_lappin,Miyazaki's Definitve Epic,9,24 July 2006,"Complex, simple, emotive, stark, bleak and truly brilliant, Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke is a work, not only of animated art, but truly a landmark in cinematic achievement. Miyazaki, first bit the conflicted notion of human nature versus Mother Earth in his 1986 work of Nausicaa of The Valley of The Wind and truly brought this issue to the fore in many a persons mind. Mononoke, is the defining glory, capsulating over ten years of thought and hard effort. It is intrinsically deep, and powerfully moving, with the notion and human sensibility of love, being the driving force, and, like in many a Miyazaki movie, is the answer to the problems. Compassion and understanding, key humanitarian traits, that we as a species often take for granted, and fail to utilise. After suffering infection and contracting a fatal disease from a dieing Shisigami, or demon, Ashitaka our films major protagonist, sets off on a journey to travel far to the west, leaving behind his native clan and position of prince to discover the source and cause of an old gods transformation into demon. Driven by determination and honesty his search brings him to Iron Town, and a sacred Forest, where he must view an on going feud with ""unclouded eyes"" and bring peace to a region, so fraught with hate and war. Paragraphic summaries, however, do not credit this film nearly enough. It is a landmark film, and while Akira alerted the world to the presence of anime, it was Mononoke that smashed through into the mainstream to enable this joyous art form to be enjoyed in the West. Princess Mononoke encapsulates the very essence of what it is that makes us human, yet Miyazaki understands there are two sides to every coin. He does not skirt over the issue, that we as a race have the ability to destroy, to act for our own selfish needs, instead he forces the issue, while concurrently highlighting that we also have potential. The ability to make things right, is buried deep within our psyche, it is intrinsic to humanity and the differential between us and animals. He shows if we cling onto our ethics and morees we shall prevail. A must for any fan cinema.",Princess Mononoke

""Princess Mononoke"" was no different. I watched an hour and 15 minutes of the movie before I got up and left the theater.While I found the look of the animation to be nice, the storyline was just to boring for me to watch any longer. Also, I only found the animation to be average. I bothers me that Japanese cartoons always seem to have a jerky, jittery look to them. There was nothing special to this movie. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good either. I'll give it a straight down the middle 5 rating.",Princess Mononoke
168,lucianomarzo92,Miyazaki's Masterpiece,7,10 November 2015,"Princess Mononoke is, by far, the best animated movie I have ever seen. From the very beginning, it captures the viewer's imagination and continues to captivate even as its length exceeds the two-hour mark. The film is well-known for its environmental message and stunning animation, but it deserves equal praise for its well-drawn characters, dynamic action sequences, and compelling narrative.Princess Mononoke tells the story of Ashitaka, a courageous warrior who, soon into the movie, battles a cursed boar god on a rampage in his homeland. Ashitaka is able to slay the beast, but just before he does, it latches onto him and afflicts him with its curse.In an effort to lift the curse, which he soon finds is deadly, Ashitaka heads west. Along the way, he discovers several mystical creatures in the forest, one of them being the beautiful San, a young girl who lives among wolves and despises humans, yet who must somehow reconcile her antagonism to mankind with her own humanity and her fondness for Ashitaka. After emerging from the woods, Ashitaka becomes acquainted with the workers at a mining colony whose weapons, he learns, have inflicted this curse upon him.Finding himself in a conflict between the workers of the mining colony, who wish to advance their civilization at the expense of the natural world, and the forest gods, who have declared all humans as the enemy, Ashitaka must choose between fighting alongside the forest gods as well as San, whom he cares deeply for, and defending his own kind.In a riveting war between man and beast, the creatures of the forest are left with no choice but to retaliate against the humans' progressively hostile and encroaching way of life. An epic battle ensues, one that, while rooted in the fantasy genre, is surprisingly relevant to the world at large. In its depiction of the disconnect between civilization and nature, the film possesses true allegorical significance as, even amid great chaos and suffering, it contains rare moments of healing and peace.",Princess Mononoke

Many of the audiences even sat silently throughout the end credit with the aura of respect, and it's understandable.  It's breathtakingly beautiful, emotionally complex, and epic in scale.  I mean, this movie is just so absorbing.  Once in a lifetime, I am grateful that someone like Mr. Miyazaki fully awakened my inner child and totally had me absorbed throughout the movie with a world so rich in mythical wonder.  How many animated movies out there can make a fully grown adult fight back tears without any sentimentality?  The characters are all so down-to-earth and realistically portrayed, throw in a plot that is full of heart, and thank goodness for the top-notch dubbing done by top Hollywood actors. I can just go on ranting and raving about this movie until the cows come home.  In my opinion, it's SO good that no other animated films can ever hope to compare with Princess Mononoke.  Bottom word, it is a flawless masterpiece; a pure work of genius that deserves to be seen by many generations to come, both adults and children alike.  So see this film, because it will be one of the best ride to another world anyone could ever experience. I personally guarantee it.",Princess Mononoke

There are basically no weak links in this movie. San and Ashitaka are both great characters with a nice amount of depth and strong moral beliefs, and their relationship progresses pretty naturally I think. The side characters are also strong, and the villain gets their usual redemption at the end, which I like. The plot starts quickly, and you're immediately introduced to the action. The pacing for the rest of the movie is equally well handled, and there is not a single scene or character that feels wasted. The animation and score are both fantastic, as per usual for a Ghibly movie, and the movie utilizes a lot of overview shots to establish the beautiful locations we visit. The environmental themes fit perfectly into the movie, it isn't shoved in our face with awkward dialogue, but rather shown subtely through striking metaphors and symbols. The worldbuilding feels dreamlike and is very enchanting, as is the case with all Miyazaki's films. The climax is satisfying and tensionfilled and the ending is heartwarming and leaves a great feeling in your heart. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with this movie, and it will remain one of my favorites for a long time.",Princess Mononoke

173,Nigel St. Buggering,An incredible achievement in animation,10,2 November 2003,"Not only better than anything you're likely to see from the Disney school of factory filmworks, but quite possibly THE best animated film ever made. The sheer imagination, artistry, and detail in every frame of this work is breathtaking. I applaud Miramax for leaving the American release unedited, both for length and content.Of course, serious fans of Japanese animation will be watching the subtitled version in the original Japanese language.  But given that the majority of American viewers will go with the default dub, a few comments on that version are in order.  The voices are a mixed bag; Danes and Crudup are merely adequate; nothing any competent voice-actor couldn't have pulled off, but a bit lacking in passion at times.  When emotion is expressed, Danes can come off a bit on the whiny side. Thornton's southern accent, though he tries to conceal it, is a bit distracting set among the visuals of historical Japan. Minnie Driver and Gillian Anderson are both quite good, however, and bring great gravity and dimension to their roles. Flawed as it is, it still stands as one of the best dub jobs imported anime has to offer (though not up to the standard of the excellent Akira dub on the special edition DVD).Thematically, this is like a return to Miayazaki's roots.  Its elements of man's declaration of war on the environment, and the environment subsequently fighting back are reminiscent of his first film, Nausicaa.  Of course, the animation, breathtaking background work, and sheer attention to detail bring a level of beauty that Nausicaa couldn't match in its day. Also worth noting is composer and longtime Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi, who presents one of the best works of his career here.For fans of Miyazaki, the brilliance of this film will not come as a shock, but for everyone else, it should be quite an eye-opener. Just don't show it to your children expecting a Happy Meal cross-over with cute sidekicks and musical numbers.",Princess Mononoke
174,willeasyer,A Movie we need,10,20 July 2020,"A true masterpiece that contrastes Miyazaki's genius. For me this film represents life with its ambivalence, like true life seen on a microscopic level there's no good or bad, no final Victim or offender since everything is a matter of perception. And princess mononoke shows this perfectly by not setting any true antagonists. Since all the sides of this film are doing what they're doing for a convincing reason, for their survival and ishitaka serves as the mediator in the middle of this storm trying to find harmony. It's also more relevant then ever because the way it addressed industrialization and its desastrous effect on earth, the human thrust for more resources will lead to his end, and our stiving to survive might be, ironically the reason of our extinction. The film is very savage, brutal and dark, it's definitely not a kids film because i don't see a kid comprehending it. Still the animation is stunning, the details, the colors the movements this movie is a work of art, and it's really a statement of how animation can provide a complexe and solid substance that live action features can't.

The animation is just beautiful. Wondrous. Hayao Miyazaki is a genius. I love the story, it's like an ancient tale told through the ages.The story begins with Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup) battling a giant demon. It turns out to be a huge boar covered with black, evil worm-like creatures. Some of the creatures wrap themselves around Ashitaka's arm, and he is infected. ""Though you cannot change your fate,"" he is told by the village wise woman, ""you may rise to meet it."" So Ashitaka begins a journey to be cured of this infection by the mysterious forest spirit, a glorious creature you must see for yourself. Along the way, he battles samurai and makes a stop in Irontown, ruled by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), and encounters a monk named Jigo, who gives him advice and is friendly towards him.

However, Princess Mononoke isn't quite as bad Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Ponyo, Tales of Earthsea etc, but it's still pretty bad.

Pokemon is silly. Sailor Moon turned stupid. And so far, the only show that looks decent is Escaflowne. And Pokemon the Movie was the worst animated movie I've ever seen. I didn't even bother seeing the sequel. I was also slightly disappointed by Grave of the Fireflies. But this. This is something else. This is something magical. It's probably the only anime movie worth watching, although I could be wrong. First the positives. The characters are realistic and well developed. There are no true ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"". The story is also great, sometimes sophisticated. Although the premise has been done to death, this is more than just your average environment movie. Finally, there's the animation. It's beautiful and breathtaking, especially with the backgrounds. The Nightwalker sequence is probably the one of the better animated pieces in history. Now the negatives. While the movie is wonderful to look at, the animation technique is still anime, which drives me crazy to no end. Those used to Disney's fluid style of drawing and animating will find the hyperactivity and shortcuts of anime a tad unrealistic and maybe even cartoonish. The movie also tries to do too many things at once, and as a result, certain parts look unfinished, rushed, or unpolished. Some parts even seem unnecessary. Finally there's the ending. Do all animes end in a wimpy, ambiguous note? Because I'm not used to it. These flaws aren't enough to make it a bad movie. On the contrary, this is a fantastic movie. However, this won't receive a perfect 10 from me, just a 9.",Princess Mononoke

I can never watch it without wishing we had someone like Miyazaki-sama here in the States, or that we had more of his films on DVD, or that this movie had gotten the mainstream theatrical distribution it deserved.  If Disney had been smart enough to release this film subtitled, with a real advertising campaign, it could have been more successful than Crouching Tiger.  There's a reason why this is the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, and if its distributors had handled it better it could have won Best Foreign Film.  Hell, it should have won Best Picture for 1997, and Jo Hisaishi ABSOLUTELY deserved the Best Original Score award. 
But none of that happened.  And that's why it's so hard to watch.  Because Mononoke Hime is the best film of all time, and most Americans will never bother to see it.",Princess Mononoke
181,steve.schonberger,Beautiful and deep; one of the best movies ever,10,29 November 1999,"Princess Mononoke is stunningly beautiful art, with wondrous detail in nearly every scene. The animation is rich and imaginative; the demon forms and the forest god's ""night walker"" form are images I've never seen before, and the forest scenes are full of beauty and wonder. The sometimes-gory violence isn't just mindless action; one can almost feel the pain of characters when they are injured. Even the dubbed English (the only version I've seen) script is matched fairly well to the original lip movements. The voice actors are good or excellent, particularly Minnie Driver (Lady Eboshi), Billie Crudup (Ashitaka), and Jada Pinkett (Toki, a smaller part). Finally, the story is deep and thoroughly involving.The depth of the plot is shown in the way the many factions act. Each contends for its own interests, rather than for an abstract cause of good or evil. Most believe their own cause to be good, and opposing interests to be the enemy; each shows goodness and flaws.In the simplest view, the conflict is between the Lady Eboshi's industrial Iron Town and the gods and animals of the forest. But there are more factions in conflict than just those two.The remainder, except the final paragraph, includes possible minor spoilers.In the introduction, Ashitaka fights a demon -- a god driven to madness by pain and hate. He kills it, at the cost of a curse that will slowly kill him. He chooses permanent exile from his home, the dying idyllic Emishi civilization (elsewhere thought to be long dead). He sets out on his quest with a heart unclouded by hate, in hope of the possibility that the curse might be overcome.He travels West to the source of the conflict that turned the god into a demon, and learns of the numerous factions in the conflict. One major side is the Forest, with its gods and animals, divided into a number of factions. The other major side is the humans, also divided into several factions, most in conflict with the Forest.The Forest is united in its desire to prevent destruction by human encroachment, but divided into factions with different ideas of how to protect their world. The boars favor a frontal assault, to kill the humans or die trying, even though they're somewhat aware that they're more likely to die trying. The monkeys favor a defensive approach, replanting the forest and killing humans opportunistically. The wolves -- including San, the Princess Mononoke -- understand the humans' strength from fighting them, and hate them, but urge caution in fighting such a dangerous enemy. Finally, there are the Forest Spirit and the Kodamas, whose motivations are deep and mysterious.The humans are divided also. Lady Eboshi and her Iron Town are the main human faction. Eboshi is loved by her people, who include outcasts from other human societies: former prostitutes whose freedom she has bought and lepers she has taken in. Instead of conventional women's clothing, she wears a man's pirate coat. A minor faction is the samurai, who seek Lady Eboshi's iron. Another human faction is the monk Jigo, who befriends Ashitaka but seeks (with his hunters) the mountain of gold the emperor has promised to anyone who can bring him the forest's secret of immortality.Finally, there is Ashitaka, who starts out with his own agenda, to overcome his fatal curse. Along the way, he learns to see the good in both the Forest and Iron Town. He becomes a friend of them both, and looks for a solution that allows both of his new friends to survive, while continuing to hope for a cure to his curse.Few movies have this much depth of plot detail. The story is deeply involving, and takes many unexpected paths. The art is beautiful, wonderfully imaginative, and moving. The animation and voices are well done. I could find no flaws. This is one of the best movies ever.",Princess Mononoke
182,caseyt-48511,Possibly the best film by Hayao Miyazaki,10,9 April 2019,"I have a long history with this movie. When I was about 7 I caught it on tv late at night and was interested but didn't know what was happening. I was traumatized by the violence and scary images. I legitimately had nightmares! So I avoided this movie for years. But, nearly 15 years later and I am a big Studio Ghibli fan. I knew I had to watch it. I was not disappointed.
The story of the movie has the feel of a Tolkien epic. A prince goes on a journey to lift a curse off of him. He meets spirits, gods, a town of outcasts and more. The plot is brilliantly put together and tight. There is no wasted moment. The characters are all well written and developed. There's a lot of ambiguity in the film. No character is a stock character and their motives could be easily commended or condemned. I think this leaves the viewer to interpret how they feel.
The animation is so beautiful. Over 100,000 drawings were used in the film. It's colorful, vibrant and feels alive. It screams animated masterpiece.
There's something about Ghibli films that give you a certain feeling. Kinda like what you get when you watch a great classic Disney film. I can't quite put my finger on what the feeling is. Not quite nostalgic, but it's a good feeling nonetheless.
There's so much to talk about. If you love Japanese animation, or just animation in general, then this is a must see! Be warned though! This can be a very violent movie. If you want your younger kids to see a Ghibli film then try My Neighbor Totoro or Ponyo. But once their older, show them this film. Believe me, it's worth every moment.",Princess Mononoke
183,prasadandre,Conceptualize in best way!!!,9,21 October 2020,"Kids shall have such kind of animation movies rather than other animation stuff.

184,JG2001,Greatest Animated Film of All Time,10,5 November 1999,"That, people, would have to sum it up right there. The animation is dazzling. The characters are wonderful, the plot is brilliant. It's an animated film with heart and goes after an older, more mature, understanding audience. Out of American animated films, very few come close to the heart this film has, the closest I believe is The Iron Giant. Mononoke Hime, Princess Mononoke, is what animation should strive to be, breaking free of the childish cookie cutter mold Disney has created, allowing for true artistic magnificence.",Princess Mononoke
185,kriitikko,Miyazaki's first true masterpiece,9,2 October 2008,"In an ancient Japan, at a time when Gods and demons walked the earth, a young prince Ashitaka defends his village from a furious demon. Ashitaka slays the beast, but is cursed to suffer an early death. His only hope is to travel to a forest where the Great Spirit is said to dwell. As Ashitaka approaches his destination, he gets in the middle of a war. On the other side is an iron town, lead by Lady Eboshi, who wants to expand their town and live in peace of the beasts. On the other side are the Gods and animals of the forest, who also want to protect their homes. In the forest lives also San, a young girl raised by wolves, who fights for the forest and is after Lady Eboshi. While trying to find a cure for himself, Ashitaka also tries to put a stop to war that will have no winners. But how does a cunning monk Jiko fit in this picture? ""Princess Mononoke"" (Mononoke-hime, 1997) is maestro Hayao Miyazaki's first true masterpiece. I'm not saying his previous movies would be bad; on the contrary, you can read my reviews of them and know I love them. However, ""Princess Mononoke"", as well as Miyazaki's later film ""Spirited Away"", reaches a whole new heights. In this film, Miyazaki returns back to his anti-war and protect the nature themes that he already had in ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"". Especially the mindlessness of the war is well shown in this film. Miyazaki has avoided the cliché situation that on the other side are good guys and on the other bad guys. Both sides have their reasons to get rid of the other one. Both are good guys because they protect their homes and communities, but both are also bad guys: iron town wants to destroy the forest and the beasts want to kill humans. By making Ashitaka, an outsider, the main character we are able to see the war also as an outsider's point of view. We understand the reasons behind both sides, but we can also see that this war will not bring a happy ending to either of the sides.The first time I saw this film I was truly awed. Still at the time being relatively unfamiliar to Miyazaki's works there was nothing that could have prepared me for this. Visually this film is so much more powerful than anything I have seen from Disney or in any other western animation (or in most of Japanese animations for that matter!). The only animations to come to same level with such detailed designs and visual awesomeness are Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" and Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Akira"" (both also from Japan). And what would Miyazaki movie be without the music of Joe Hisaishi. From the epic opening score to the beautiful theme song, Hisaishi offers only the best.It should also be mentioned that ""Princess Mononoke"" has a surprisingly good English dub. I usually prefer original Japanese audios, often finding dubs either lacking or going over board. Only few times do I find dub to be as great as the original audio (anime series ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" is one of these cases). In ""Mononoke"" the English lines are written by Neil Gaiman, author of the books ""Stardust"" and ""Neverwhere"". This might explain why ""Mononoke"" is the only case when I found the dub even better than the original audio. This has never happened before or later to me. Japanese audio is by no means bad, but talented dubbing cast (including Claire Danes, Minnie Driver and Billy Bob-Thornton) seem to bring just a little bit more life to it.""Princess Mononoke"" is an awesome movie, both visually and as a story telling. It has great characters, meaningful story, beautiful score and sequences that make your jaw drop. To me only ""Spirited Away"" tops this as the best Hayao Miyazaki film.NOTICE: unlike other Miyazaki films, this can not be recommended to the smallest of the family. Some scenes during the battles are rather graphic.",Princess Mononoke
186,zerogirl42,Better Quality Animation,8,28 December 2006,"Films like these are certainly setting the mark very high for animation. The monsters, creatures, gods, demons, animals, backgrounds and what ever else I've missed are top quality. It certainly gives the feeling of an animated illustration.The story is good too. It goes back to the struggle of nature versus man. Throw in some gods, demons, curses and magic to create quite a spectacle.I found only two major weaknesses in the film.1) Some of the voices for the English version are horribly miscast. I would rather have heard an expert, non-famous, voice actor than some of the star-studded cast choking their way through the dialog.2) The ending was rather weak. It still didn't clearly wrap up the story and the destiny for each character. Some were clear, while others were not. I won't say more. I don't want to spoil it.",Princess Mononoke
187,jared79,I really wanted to like it...,3,28 April 2020,"I love a lot of Studio Ghibli movies. One of my all time favourite movies I s Laputa. Spirited Away is also another excellent movie, as is Kiki and yes, I am a 40 year male. But I like nice stories and Kiki was that, a nice story.Everyone raves about this movie and maybe that was the problem, maybe my expectations where too high. I have seen a number of Studio Ghibli movies and had enjoyed most of them (except Tales of Earthsea). But I'm sorry, but this movie sits with that one, at the bottom. The story dragged on and on and really, none of the characters where really likeable. It was way more violent than I was expecting too with severed limbs and decapitations etc.It's probably the whole underlying environmental fluff that made me dislike it so much. The ""anti-human"" tone was annoying. I think I also got annoyed with the back and forth of, this person is bad, these wolves are bad, now everyone is good and now they are bad again. Pick a lane.Anyway, I'm obviously in the minority in my view of this movie. Like I said, love a lot of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki movies. This one, certainly isn't one of them. Do yourself a favour and watch Laputa, Castle in the sky or Spirited Away. Much much much better movies.",Princess Mononoke
188,IkuharaKunihiko,A not so royal princess,6,4 August 2005,"Medieval Japan. Ashitaka has been infected with a strange disease when he killed a mysterious demon boar covered with leaches that attacked his village. On his journey to find a cure he meets lady Eboshi, a female leader of a town exploiting the forest and fighting with creatures protecting the nature. The leader of those creatures is San, princess Mononoke...When I first went to see ""Princess Mononoke"" I expected a gentle, romantic, dreamy fairy tale. Was I surprised when I saw the raw and brutal story! This is in my opinion Miyazaki's most violent film, but non the less, it really is an impressive anime. I wouldn't necessary put it on the 102. place on the IMDb's top 250 films, but I admit it has something in it that fascinates me.------- The most clever aspects of the story are the ones about how lady Eboshi is tricking her people into helping her exploit the Forest, while at the same time dismissing the wolf's revenge attacks as something illogical. Also, just watch the sequence where San is being captured inside a sea of red leaches on a demon boar: the part where Ashitaka jumps into that bunch of leaches trying to save San from them, but is being catapulted into the water, is pure dark poetry and romance in one. Also, there's the spectacular image of the gigantic deer god's body walking through the hills.Still, Miyazaki made a lot of mistakes. The middle of the film is repetitive and too long making only the end exciting, the characters are somewhat wooden and the whole mood of the anxious world is way over the top. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone younger than 16. Also, I miss a lot of humor Miyzaki had in his previous films. I got the idea he made ""Mononoke"" just because he was in his depressive ""I hate the world"" phase. All in all, the epic ""Princess Mononoke"" deserved it's success( it's average critic's grade on rotten-tomatoes.com is 7.7/10 ), but in the long term there was still something missing in it's story. What? Just watch ""Being there"" or ""The Graduate"" and you'll see what.Grade: 6/10",Princess Mononoke
189,adam-may-bower,Legendary,8,2 June 2018,"'Princess Mononoke' is a beautifully animated and epic fantasy film by legendary Japanese filmmaker and animator Hayao Miyazaki.
This was the first film I got to view at the Celebrate Studio Ghibli film festival in Melbourne and I thoroughly enjoyed most aspects of this film.
The clear standout for the film is the breathtaking hand-drawn animation by Miyazaki. Everything from the painted forest, the Great Forest Spirit, and even the characters themselves are visually striking and shows that these films were well ahead of their time. There's a very good reason as to why Miyazaki is considered one of the best animators of this century.
The soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi is everything a good soundtrack should be, with epic numbers for the action sequences and then beautiful pieces for the emotional scenes.
The storyline of this film is epic and gripping, from the very first opening scene. What made it unique though, was its underlying themes of environmentalism that were quite powerful. The characters in this film were also very complex; the villains weren't really villains and the heroes weren't really heroes. Each character, even the supporting ones, had a depth in them that is absent in too many movies these days.
However, it's in the pacing where this movie fails to be a masterpiece. There are many scenes that a very drawn-out and difficult to maintain attention. With a running time over two hours, this film definitely has it's moments that seem to drag on. The main issue with these scenes is the fact that they're not particularly part of the main storyline, so there's no real need for them to be as long as they are. Fortunately, Miyazaki redeems himself with a fantastic ending that left me in awe and overall I was very pleased with this movie.",Princess Mononoke
190,easy_life80,Anime is awful,2,9 July 2020,"I watched this hoping it would change my mind on anime. But it really is atrocious. This has a ridiculously high score for what is ridiculously childish nonsense. I like animation, I really do, there's some outstanding animation out there. But Every. Single. Anime. Is bad. If there's an exception I thought this would be it. It wasn't. Childish dialogue with cliche after cliche of caricatures. What am I missing!?? Who knows. Anime I give up.",Princess Mononoke
191,TensersFloatingDisk,Is it subtle? Or just muddled. I'm going with 'muddled.',2,4 March 2006,"Given all the hype surrounding Princess M., I expected to like this film a good deal more than I did.I tried to like it. Truly. Unfortunately, the producers make it extremely difficult to do so, since their primary conceit seems to have been: ""let's confuse our audience as much as we can."" The primary way they accomplish this is by having every character vacillate back and forth from protagonist to antagonist every other scene. The wolves are good guys. No, wait, they're threatening to kill the hero. Oh wait, they're trying to save the forest. Nope, they're just small-minded bigots. etc. etc.Worse than the mythic figures were the humans: ah, the people of IronTown are attacked by wolves, goodie! Oh wait, they're destroying the environment, I hate those guys! But wait, they're not as bad as these soldiers, so we sympathize again, only now they're shooting at the Princess of the forest, darn they're bad, but wait...And so on and so on. I recognize the desire to present complex characterizations and avoid the black-and-white mentality of so much fantasy work, but this quickly devolved into simple inconsistency. Eventually I just gave up and decided to hate everybody in the film, after which it became kind of bitter fun to watch them spill one another's blood across the screen (which they do in simply astonishing volumes).As for the environmental sub-text of the movie, it was not only severely undercut by all the heavy-handed side-switching mentioned above, but almost entirely buried in the morass of annoying mythological background which plagued the movie. In the last fifteen minutes, it turns out that this mythological stuff has actually been the whole crux of the movie (surprise), providing the excuse for a boatload of visual effects but leaving the central plot, as it has been heretofore presented, in the dust.Final words: confusing, inconsistent, turgid mythology punctuated by inadequately explained violence.

And this one was fairly highly rated so we watched it together. Well, this one is neither for kids or for adults. It's like adult story told by a kid.My daughter was mortified by all the brutal beheadings and body parts flying around. My wife didn't appreciate animated women showing off their cleavages and hitting on a child. And I didn't like how literal the storytelling was. It was basically explaining everything instead of implying it for viewers to think about.The basic plot was good. I even wonder if James Cameron got the idea for Avatar from this movie.

196,kingtanichi,I am not worthy...,10,14 January 2004,"WARNING: EXTREME SPOILERS!!!This is not an objective review. Princess Mononoke is one of my all-time favourite movies, and I believe there is no complaint about it that is not answerable. That established, now on to business.Princess Mononoke is a testament to all that can be done with animation, but almost never is. The very nature of the medium is to free one up from all physical limitations, and yet North American culture has restricted it to being a medium for children's movies. The visual beauty and complexity of this film is the equal, if not the superior, of any of the glossy stuff produced by Disney; but the difference here is that it used to tell a mature, intelligent story. Nothing here is sanitized or simplified, and the characters are all three-dimensional beings -- not the one-dimensional caricatures common not just to Western animated films, but to movies in general.The only song here is the moving one over the end credits -- a counterpoint to the masterful score. These characters actually converse with each other in what's not only one of the best-translated scripts ever, but a damn good screenplay in its own right. The voice casting is also first-rate: Billy Crudup is good as the young hero; Claire Danes hits just the right teenage-angst-out-of-control note with San; Minnie Driver as Lady Eboshi moves excellently between diplomatic and soft-spoken, and demonic and megalomaniacal; and Billy Bob Thornton is understatedly funny yet dangerous as Jigo. The real lightning in a bottle, however, is Gillian Anderson as Moro. Agent Scully is nowhere to be heard as she combines deep anger and ferocity with great wisdom and love. Her death is one of the most heart-wrenching moments I've ever seen on film.Princess Mononoke is a testament to the power of film as art. It would have been excellent as a live action movie. That it's animated is even more spectacular. It lets us in the west see just how little we've done with animation.",Princess Mononoke
197,Eviljomr,Classic of animation,9,10 December 1999,"I cannot possibly say enough good things about this film.  I'm really dissapointed Miramax isn't giving this film a wider release.  More people need to see this.  Even only having seen it on video (and a less than perfect copy at that), I find it to be a much more satisfying adventure than the last Star Wars film or the last Disney animated film.  I can see why this film is the top-grossing film to date in Japan.  I don't put this film in the same category as your usual ""Japanimation"", because I really don't see myself as a big ""Japanimation"" person, I just look at it as a very good animated film that just happens to come from Japan, much the same way I look at Miyazaki's other films, Akira, and the films of Mamoru Oshii.The film is written and directed by master animator Hayao Miyazaki, from whom I have yet to see a less-than amazing film.  The artwork and animation in this film are beautiful, and the film has a much more ""cinematic"" feeling than a lot of animation, Miyazaki could direct a great live-action film if he wanted to (some anime directors have also directed live-action films, like Oshii and Otomo).  One thing I like that that the CGI was used sparingly and effectively, not obtrusively like in a lot of animation these days.  The film also makes me think a lot of The Thin Red Line in it's depiction of nature balanced with violent conflict.The musical score by Joe Hisaishi is simply beautiful, I personally think it's one of the great film scores of all time, right up there with Ryuichi Sakamoto's score for The Last Emperor (which Hisaishi's score for this film reminds me of a little in parts).In short, an incredible film, if possible, see it in a theater, or, failing, that, video.  Just see it!  I'm purchasing the DVD the day it's released.",Princess Mononoke
198,oneofthesilence,"Kinda flawed, but still very good.",8,5 September 2020,"I'll get my negatives out of the way first.There are a number of things in this film just felt kinda underdeveloped. The universe of this movie is really cool, but some of the details about how it even works felt poorly explained. It also took me forever to at all understand what was happening politically. They mention ""The Emperor"" so many times and I find it incredibly strange that we never see him. The conflicts between all of these warring factions felt very unclear at times. The plot just could have been a lot tighter in general. The film didn't need to be this long. That or it needed to be longer.I also didn't quite get some of the characters. Most specifically Jigo. I genuinely still don't know if he's actually a monk, a mercenary, or something else entirely. The film never really makes it all that clear.San/Mononoke is also weirdly underdeveloped. Like seriously, for being the title character, there's really not much to her. I like how she's basically combination Princess Leia from ""Star Wars"" and Mowgli from ""The Jungle Book"". But that's kind of where my intrigue for her character ends. She's cool conceptually and does a lot of badass things. But I just don't think she's interesting. Also, the romance between her and Ashitaka was incredibly underdeveloped. I didn't buy it at all.And one last thing, the pacing in the 2nd act of this movie is way too slow. It gets kinda boring in that section.And now for all the stuff that I actually liked.The animation is amazing. It's so smooth and visually impressive. It captures so many small details as well as the film's more grandiose moments perfectly. Whether it's showing us something stunningly beautiful, or grossly horrifying, it does it all perfectly. The action is also consistently amazing. It's so brutal but still insanely fun to watch. The facial expressions and body language are also very well done. This film just looks incredible. The music was great as well.The film is very tonally consistent, and I like how it's never afraid to get dark. Both visually and thematically. It's not every day that to see this kind of stuff in a animated movie. But this film's darkness thankfully never feels over the top.I really liked Ashitaka. He's a pretty standard protagonist, but still a very good one. He had a compelling journey and he made for a great lead in this movie. I actually cared about his character.But my favourite character was definitely Lady Eboshi Although she is technically the antagonist, she's not pure evil. Nor is she really that good. She's very morally complex and interesting to watch. We see her do some very compassionate things, as well as really messed up things. She's also just very cool. Just the very way in which she presents herself makes her feel to badass. She's a fantastic character.I also just really loved everyone in Iron Town. Their camaraderie mixed with their unique gender divides were really fun and endearing to watch. The super distinct collective personality that they all had really made me really like this town. The movie was just infinitely better and always engaging whenever they were focusing on Iron Town. I actually really cared about seeing this town survive.Other than the 2nd act, this film is very well paced. The film starts and ends in a very engaging way. The climax is truly excellent.And the world of this movie is still super cool and fun to explore... even if it doesn't fully make sense all the time.So overall, this movie certainly isn't perfect, and I think it's kind of overrated in the grand scheme of things. But it's still a really good movie regardless of any problems that I may have with it.",Princess Mononoke

202,Shilo_R_A,"8.4/10 - Nature Gives, Nature Takes",8,28 October 2021,"""Can nothing be done? To simply wait for death...""Princess Mononoke is the kind of film that sounds like a cool metaphor with an important message, but turns out to be much more when you dive deep into it.This movie tells the story of Ashitaka, a young warrior from a small eastern village. While defending his village from a mad demon-god, Ashitaka got cursed, and he has to travel far to the west in order to lift the curse, to save himself.But this is not what this movie is really about, and you probably know that. Princess Mononoke is about the relationship between humans and nature. It's also kinda about the climate crisis, but it's not the main thing so I'll leave it for now.Nature may bring life (""I neve knew that the deer god made the flowers bloom..."") or take them away. It may, and it does.And when we take, nature takes too. That's kind of how it works, and Miyazaki communicates this idea in a very interesting, subtler than expected way, on Princess Mononoke. The whole film is one big allegory, but the way that each character portrays a certain mindset, or the way that a single line of dialogue can add so much to this allegory is quite damn impressive.I think that the score here is solid too, the plot is - though slow a bit at times - quite interesting, and the final act is especially great. You know how much I love a strong ending.Oh, and the animation is decent too. I know that miyazaki went on to create stuff that's by far more impressive visually, but this film is still very well made, and for a relatively small budget this film looks really solid.Issues I take with this film - San's character is a little underdeveloped in my eyes. Especially her relationship with Ashitaka or Moro. Also, I feel like Miyazaki kinda shows a little bit of escapism regarding the climate change towards the end of the film, BUT. I do get that it may very possibly not be exactly what he was aiming for, and the message of the film is still quite important and is communicated in a deep way, and not through one pov only.So, that's it I guess. This film is pretty damn good, and though it has some issues it's definitely worth your time. The message is important, the allegory interesting and the film is very well made as a whole. Plus, a strong final act is alway great. I'm feeling an 8.4/10 on this one.",Princess Mononoke
203,TheOnlyOwen01,A marvel in animation and cinema,10,5 December 2019,"Everytime I watch this film and it ends, I get the feeling that something amazing has just happened. That being said Princess Mononoke is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's a film that get better everytime I watch it and one that I will always hold in high regard.The follows an incredibly selfless and shockingly beautiful young prince named Ashitaka who kills a demonic boar when it attacks his village but not without consequences. The demon curses him which forces him to leave his village to find a cure and he comes across a war between humans and nature.The film does have an environmental message but I always thought that wasn't the main message about the film, I'll get to that later. First things first, the animation is phenomenal. One of the best looking movies I've ever seen, everything looks flawless. This movie has been out for at least 22 years now and the fact that it looks better than most newer movies is quite something. It's boosted by an incredible amount of color, atmosphere and smoothness that feels organic and makes the world feel alive.The music is also fantastic as it summarizes exactly what the film is: an animated epic for the ages. Every piece of music is outstanding, especially the last track of the movie. The pacing is immaculate because the opening sequence showcases that this isn't going to be a slow moving film which it isn't. There are slower moments but that's only to give the audience time to digest the characters and learn more about them and what's going on.The story and characters really help this movie. First, we have Ashitaka. The young, pretty boy hero who wants both sides of the war to be in peace and tries to do that while maintaining his curse. San, the Princess Mononoke herself, also three dimensional. She's the Princess of the forest gods and is the love interest for Ashitaka since even though she lives with animals, she's still a human. Lady Eboshi may come off as an antagonist but really isn't because there's no villain character in the film making the world feel more alive and the characters more realistic despite that some of them are giant talking animals.Remember the environmental message I talked about? Well, I always thought this was the true message of the film: Throughout the movie, Ashitaka and San grow closer and than right before the movie ends, they confess their feelings for one another. This highlights something: love the unloved, love the sacred and forgotten, and love people enough that they understand you love them without staying with them. They don't even kiss once throughout the entire film because Miyazaki is smart enough to showcase their love without something cliched like that.Overall, Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's a film that I can put on at any point and still love it the same way. I've seen it countless times and it never gets old. 100% recommend.",Princess Mononoke
204,randyhndrsn,Great anime.,10,16 January 2006,"This is a great anime and the first movie i ever saw from Hayao Miyazaki, i loved this movie and did not know he made it until later.After this movie i watched a lot of his movies like spirited away and castle in the sky, his films are some of the best anime movies out there and this one is one of his best.It is very original, but i love thus movie for it's great fight scenes and wonderful creatures and characters.The story is wonderful and the animation is just about perfect, with great voice overs that i just loved.This is a rare anime that i think any anime fan shouldn't miss out on, with many great things this anime is a classic.",Princess Mononoke
205,PureCinema,Some of the most amazing animation I've ever seen,9,26 December 1998,"Mononoke Hime is not just another Japanese animation, It is a phenomenon. During it's box office run in Japan last summer it didn't only become the highest grossing Japanese film of the year. But the highest grossing Japanese film... EVER! And believe me, the film definitely does live up to the hype.The film takes place in 15th century Japan and opens with a warrior named Ashitaka in fierce battle with a Tatari Gama (a huge boar with worms covering it's body). Ashitaka kills the gama and successfully defends his village from it, but in the battle the gama came in contact with his arm, leaving a dark scar. The village doctor tells Ashitaka that it is a curse from the gama and is slowly killing him. Convinced that there must be a cure, Ashitaka leaves the village never to return.  Ashitaka later comes to the great forest and finds an iron factory in the middle of it. The factory is run by Lady Eboshi, a woman who employs former prostitutes and lepers, giving them jobs that they would never have in the rest of society. She tells Ashitaka about the constant battle between her people and the gods of the forest, giant wolves, boars, etc that are trying to protect their forest from Lady Eboshi's desire to expand her territory.One night, the gods of the forest plan an attack on Lady Eboshi's factory. They are accompanied by a girl named San. San jumps into the factory and begins viciously attacking Lady Eboshi. San is injured and winds up unconscious. Ashitaka then feels sorry for her and comes to her aid... taking her unconscious body back to the forest. He then learns about San's past and why she is living with the animals instead of the humans. The two develop a bond as Ashitaka tries desperately to end the constant battle between man and animals in the great forest and at the same time, cure the growing scar on him arm.My first impressions after watching this film were disbelief that an animated film could have such an impact on me. The story is extremely well done and is geared more towards adults that youngsters (there is plenty of violence here) and the animation (oooh the animation) is SUPERB! I have never seen such beautiful images on the screen for a long, long time, animation simply does not look better than this. I was in awe that all of the elements that make up a great film were all present here... in perfect balance and harmony. It is so well constructed that at times, I totally forgot that what I was watching was animated and not real. The characters are so well written that you are absolutely convinced that they are real people.Disney and Miramax are planning to release this film here in the states sometime in early '99... I'll definitely be looking forward to seeing this one on the big screen.",Princess Mononoke
206,SlimeyPete,Just thought I'd add yet another good review,9,30 September 2002,"OK, first of all this film does have flaws. It's sometimes overly sentimental and has very little philosophical depth. However, that's not a problem if you rate it as what it is - an epic hollywood-style adventure which is more about thrill than thought. It looks fantastic, with beautiful backdrops, some good (and sparing) use of CGI and that great stylized almost-but-not-quite-fluid animation that marks good anime apart from western animation. The storyline is engaging, and the characters likeable. Plus, it features battle sequences on a par with (or...dare I say it... more exciting than) Fellowship Of The Ring for sheer style and pace.  The english dub is pretty good, which makes a change, with all the actors seeming quite believable. The musical score is effective, though sometimes it veers into what my A-level film teacher called 'emotional fascism', i.e. it can be a little TOO overwhelming which won't appeal to those who don't like having their feelings dictated to them. On the whole, I'd give it...ohhhh...alright then, 9 out of 10.",Princess Mononoke
207,Jeremy-93,"One to convert the sceptics, a rich, thoughtful and charming animation",7,11 February 2003,"If, like me, your heart sinks at the prospect of another pious, sanctimonious, tub-thumping eco-fable, give ""Mononoke Hime"" a chance all the same. It does have a distinct, and far from subtle, ecological message, of the ""can't we just live together?"" variety, but on the other hand it's far from clear that the answer the film suggests is ""yes"", and there are plenty of nuances and subtleties along the way. More to the point, there's a proper story, well-conceived and well told, there's a memorable, beautiful and violent world, credible characters and a good deal of charm.The animation is mostly very fluent and careful, though not flashy in the way we're getting used to in this CG age. (""Mononoke"" uses cgi, but subtly and with restraint, so that the feel remains that of a group of traditional craftsmen under one guiding hand). Quite often one finds that there are more static elements in a tableaux than you'd expect in a Disney animated feature, but I think this is an aesthetic choice rather than a mere economy: it stylizes and formalizes, while focussing attention on the important elements in the frame. But there is occasional jerkiness, though not enough to detract seriously, and perhaps it wouldn't trouble audiences whose frame of reference isn't so western as mine - I'm not sure.Talking of the western and eastern sensibilities, the Region 2 DVD which I'm reviewing gives you a choice of English and Japanese dialogue, and though I watched the American dub first, I'd generally prefer the Japanese version, for the key roles of Ashitaka and San. Billy Crudup is appealing but too low-key, and Clare Danes strikes me as badly miscast: she sounds a bit too old, and altogether too urban to bring out the core of wildness or the steely sense of loyalty to her world. Like other reviewers, I have trouble with the Texas drawl of Billy Bob Thornton, which is just too regionally specific to match the look of the character (please understand that I'm not suggesting the cast should all have done fake Japanese accents!). On the other hand, it's pretty much a toss-up between Yuko Tanaka and Minnie Driver (who's very closely attuned to the aesthetic of the original) as Eboshi, and Gillian Anderson and Jada Pinkett Smith are just right. Still, overall you get more vividness and conviction from the original voice cast.  Oddly, the lip-sync seems more approximate in the Japanese version, perhaps a fault in the synchronization on the R2 DVD.  The subtitles unfortunately but understandably come from Neil Gaiman's adaptation of the screenplay rather than re-translating the Japanese - one's aware, for example, that Gaiman has added bits of extra, explanatory dialogue.With all that out of the way, let's concentrate on what makes the film work: it delineates a world that's at once mythological and believable, and refuses to sentimentalize or simplify (even if it occasionally allows itself to preach).  There are feuds and failures of trust not just between the humans and the animals, but within each world - and the animals seem as ready as the humans to exclude the other from their world. Indeed the conceit of the film seems to be that language, rather than being a product of distinctly human evolution, was originally shared among mammals at least, and it's as the war with the humans goes on that the animal kingdom becomes more brutish and less coherent. For all the prince's idealism and the delicate rapprochement some of the characters inch towards, one gets the impression that the logic of conflict will be hard to resist.Perhaps the most appealing and intriguing element in this world is the kodoma: the little, voiceless tree-spirits seem to be a cross-between a mushroom, a toddler and a rattle, and I defy anyone not to be captivated by them.",Princess Mononoke

209,ace-150,How does one act in the face of unsolvable problems?,10,11 December 2005,"This is a sophisticated film with complex cultural, political and personal themes which just happens to be animated. As in real life, each character has parts that you love and parts that you hate. Ashitaka's impassivity in the face of his fate seems beautiful and noble at the beginning of the film but becomes frustrating, even enraging at the end. Eboshi destroys nature to rescue humans on the brink of destruction. Nobody apologizes for their bias, just like in life. Some critics have accused the plot of being driven by the stupidity of the characters, but this critique holds them to the standards of current US society. Nineteenth century Japan was a society strictly regulated by traditions, traditions that were being threatened by Western incursions into Japan. The characters act the only way that they can act - they do their best in an incomprehensible, unsolvable situation. Personally, I sided with Mononoke, but Ashitaka acts with honor in every situation that he faces. I hope that I would have his inner strength in the face of such problems. Things are not neatly wrapped up at the end. This is only one battle in the war between burgeoning Japanese industry and the ancient gods. The war still rages on in Japan as it does in the United States. Oh, the animation is superb. And, for goodness sake, watch it in Japanese with subtitles. If you watch the English version, you won't see the movie the way that it's intended.",Princess Mononoke
210,l_r_26,Wow what a ride! But you have to be very patient. First half of the movie is just too complex and it isn't as good as the second!,7,5 November 2014,"I almost gave up on this movie , 45 minutes into it. But, I am glad I didn't because this movie pays dividends!So, the start is very interesting.. but too complex and it hits you with tons of information to inform you of the world on the screen. The spirits, the different people , the leaders, and tribes and ..Then, as the story unravels, it grips you to the screen!! It becomes amazing!Still, this isn't exactly my cup of tea. What I would like to see, is some more romance and tension and interaction between Ashitaka and San.All in all, slightly under my expectations, but I could definitely sense the magical moments of this movie.Maybe I have just seen too much and have grown out of it.

212,the_horned_owl,Princess Mononoke is the greatest animated movie I have ever seen.,10,14 April 2016,"If I had to summarize this movie in a few words, I would say – Breathtaking, Magnificent, and Brilliant. It is one of my top ten favorite films. One of the many things that make this film great is the story. The film is set up in the Iron Age in ancient Japan when the humans used to live in harmony with nature. But the discovery of Iron and selfish nature of humans led to the mass production of weapons which altered this balance. Princess Mononoke is a movie about Nature versus Humans. It also takes elements from Japanese myths and folklore and shows us the great ancient Japanese culture.The opening scene of Princess Mononoke is jaw-dropping. In the beginning, we see a strange creature and thousands of snakes (or whatever it was) coming out of his whole body. This strange creature goes berserk and tries to wreak havoc upon a nearby village. A young lad named Ashitaka tries to stop him from going to the village and send him back to the forest but things go wrong and Ashitaka kills the Creature. The strange snakes grab Ashitaka's hand and leave a mark before vanishing into thin air. It turns out that the creature was a giant Boar who turned into a Demon God. He was cursed and the curse of the Demon God was now transferred to Ashitaka.They find a metal piece in the remains of the Boar and come to know that someone shot the boar with a gun and that is why his agony and hate for humans turned him into a Demon God. Ashitaka, knowing that he has only a few days to live, goes out on a journey to find the person who shot the Boar and was responsible for this heinous act. This journey leads him to the west. There he meets Lady Eboshi who rules a piece of land called Ironworks and was responsible for the Boar's death and Ashitaka's curse. She has thousands of workers working under her. She knows how to make gunpowder and weapons which were responsible for the Boar's death. She does not hesitate to kill anyone who tries to stop her. She wants to rule the forest but is she a bad person? You will have to decide for yourselves because Miyazaki does not let you judge the characters easily.Ashitaka also meets Princess Mononoke or Mononokehime – a wolf-girl, born human and raised by wolves. She despises humans because she thinks that humans are filthy, selfish and pathetic creatures. She has vowed to kill the humans and take back the land of Ironworks that once belonged to the forest. She is always looking for the ways to kill Lady Eboshi and her people. Now what happens, you will have to watch that for yourselves. I am not going to spoil the film for you.This is just the basic plot of the film and let me tell you that the storyline is much more complex than this. There are so many characters and subplots and all the characters are well developed. Ashitaka's character has the proper depth, warmth, kindness, wisdom and courage whereas San's character is developed as an angry soul who just wants revenge. Lady Eboshi's character is given different personalities so you won't be able to judge her. You will also get to see the Deer God AKA the Forest God, The Spirits of the Forest, Humans, Wolves, Villagers, Boars, Apes and other creatures. Princess Mononoke is a story about how messing up with nature can lead to devastating results and it delivers the message successfully. The story is epic and the scale is huge, but the storytelling is what makes it brilliant. Miyazaki takes you to this great journey where you can feel everything. Any other director would not be able to achieve such depth and beauty. Miyazaki had a great understanding of animated films and that is why the people at Pixar and Disney worship him and see him as their idol.The animation work in Princess Mononoke is hand drawn and the result is breathtaking. The scenes that take place in the forest are outstanding. Each and every frame is having great details and beautiful colors. They pop out of the screen and make you want to live in the world you are seeing. At the top of that, the 3D rendering adds more depth and beauty to the handmade drawings. You don't just see the world of Princess Mononoke, you experience it and live in it during the whole runtime.The score of Princess Mononoke is one of the best scores I have ever heard in a film (The Lord of The Rings and Princess Mononoke are my favorite). I have seen this film more than 5 times and I cry every time I listen to the Theme. Joe Hisaishi, you are a genius. Overall, Princess Mononoke is a once in a lifetime experience. I loved it the first time I watched it. Then I listened to the OST and watched it again and loved it even more. I love it more and more every time I watch it. So it is a kind of movie that grows on you after multiple viewings. I was not a lucky guy because I couldn't watch it on big screen but I seriously want to watch this in theaters even if it costs a hefty amount. You cannot go wrong with Miyazaki, can you? May his soul Rest in Peace.",Princess Mononoke
213,JoJo-31,An awesome film!,10,16 January 2001,"This film is one of the better quality animes I've seen in quite awhile.

214,buzzerbill,Sometimes you just have to go against the grain.....,1,6 January 2006,"Last night I watched this film. Just before the credits rolled, one of my cats got up, gave a disdainful sniff, walked into the bathroom and into his box, and delivered his own large and malodorous comment.I have to go with my cat on this one. My immediate reaction to this film when it ended was, very simply, ""Great looking, but the dumbest story I have seen in a long, long time."" I have to admit to a few criteria here. I am not an animation fan. For me, animation pretty much begins and ends with Warner Brothers and Chuck Jones, who taught us all that pretty pictures and trembling leaves and water droplets always get trumped by a great script. Jones's best work, combining a linear and somewhat abstract style with high and low comedy, is the best. Disney--let's face it--is gooey. And many other recent animation hits have been 15 minute shorts exploded into features, like ""The Triplets of Bellville,"" which would have been far better if it had stopped after the first 15 minutes. (Okay, okay, I did like ""Toy Story"". And ""Fantasia."") ""Princess Mononoke"" gets points for two things. First, it looks good and often looks wonderful. Second, it does sustain itself for close to two hours. And credit is due for trying to be serious, while still catering to the core kid demographic. However, Miyazaki's script is, to put it charitably, a mess. Its civilization vs. nature theme is very, very tired, and most of the time it just does not make any sense. A single example: Forest Spirit's head is removed. FS turns into a Japanese version of the blob and destroying the forest. FS gets head back--dies and crushes Irontown--and the forest grows again. Someone please convince me that this can make any sense whatsoever. If you are going to the trouble of creating a film for adults with capital-S Significance, you ought at least to make your case persuasively. You can call it ecological consciousness; you can call it Shinto animism; I call it pretentious, ill-digested crap.This has been touted as one of the great films of our time. Sorry, this reviewer will generally agree with his cat's tribute. Seek it out if you are an animation junkie and enthralled with the techniques. I certainly cannot recommend it as a film.",Princess Mononoke

216,morphion2,Enthralling and Artistic,10,7 January 2006,"Studio Ghibli has been Japan's leading anime Production Company since the 1980's, when legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki released his first feature film ""Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind"" (1984). From the very beginning, it was clear that the Japanese director had a fantastic flair for animated film, and the uncanny ability to engross his audiences beyond the normal movie-experience that makes him the King of Escapism. Over ten years later, it seems that Miyazaki is still just as good, if not better, as he invites the world into his latest visionary fantasy, the cult classic ""Princess Mononoke"".The film is set in Japan, during the Muromachi Era, and begins in the quiet peaceful township of the Emishi tribe, when young Prince Ashitaka (Yôji Matsuda), the last of the Emishi royalty, is wounded slaying a demon in an unexpected attack. When the tribe's wise-woman tells Ashitaka that the wound is a curse of hatred that will eventually kill him, he sets out on a journey to the west to discover the origins of the demon. What he finds is a war being waged between the villagers of Iron town, an industrious Iron-works fort led by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Yûko Tanaka), and the beasts of the forest, represented by the beautiful Princess Mononoke (Yuriko Ishida), a human girl raised by wolves, with whom the cursed prince falls in love. Soon Ashitaka's efforts to make peace are put to the test by each side's bid for allegiance.""Princess Mononoke"" is a fantastic work of art on many fronts, and arguably Miyazaki's best film to date. While some of his other projects have had the same enchantment and excitement, ""Mononoke"" has an intriguingly dark and infinitely more mature feel, established by the bloody battle-scenes and sensitive color treatment, and solidified by a complex plot and rich, interesting characters. The most obvious illustrative trait of the film is the ambiguity of the characters' nature; the lack of distinction between good and bad. The ruthless lady Eboshi, while caring nothing for the forest or its inhabitants, is very compassionate towards the underdogs of her own community, such as the brothel girls and the lepers. And the wild wolf-princess, while desperate to defend her fellow forest-dwellers and protect the forest spirit, has a deep-seated mistrust of humans that even steeps into self-loathing at times. These interesting character traits make the film a lot more rewarding than many of Ghibli's other works, which were aimed mostly at children.Of course, all these intriguing themes and characters are only a part of the film's wonder, because Miyazaki's true gift lies in imagery. The detailed animation of ""Princess Mononoke"" is astounding, drawing its audience into its environments, from lush forest to open fields to crowded marketplace and more; the team of animators that poured their hearts and souls into this film should take utmost pride in their accomplishments. Using minimal and tasteful CGI, the movie stays very warm and inviting even when the subject matter and mood is less-than-friendly. This is also owed to the audio aspects of the picture; the voice talents involved are highly engaging and enjoyable, even in the English dubbed version, which features such big western names as Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Clare Danes and Gillian Anderson. Joe Hisaishi's music is also a rather splendid complement to the film.Overwhelming success of the anime production in Japan alone stands as a testament to its fine quality. Breaking a 15 year record held by Spielberg's ""E.T."", ""Princess Mononoke"" became Japan's No. 1 movie of all time in the year of its release, as well as taking the title of best-selling video/DVD of all time. It is also the most expensive animated Japanese feature in history, reaching a budget of 2.4 billion. Outside of its home-country, however, the film continues to inspire and engage audiences from all corners of the globe, taking a well-deserved place in the list of cult-favorites for film-lovers everywhere.",Princess Mononoke

222,Boris-57,"Perfect, but...",10,18 September 2004,"... despite much has been made of Neil Gaiman's dubbed lines, you should absolutely watch it in Japanese with subtitles. The dubbing actors seem not to completely understand the intonations their characters' lines require, which, to me, made the first 20 minutes rather confusing. It was only when I switched to Japanese that it all seemed to make sense. Don't ask me why, like I said I guess it's intonation. Furthermore, it's always daft not to see a movie in its original language. And that goes for anime too, unless you still believe it's not real film.But this is! OK, we've seen the story about nature vs humans before (after all, is that not what the Arthur / Merlin / Morgana / Mob legends are all about?), but what makes this one stand apart is 2 things: 1. no one is all good or all evil; 2. the visuals are stunning and testify of an imagination unbound by logic. These 2 points are crucial, for it is there that most Disney films or plain Hollywood films go wrong - one could say that they're made by 5 year olds. But no, it's just the reverse! Most Disney animation and Hollywood stuff is made by 'soundly reasoning' adults with an emotional life not reaching beyond love and hate, motivational insight not going beyond revenge (or getting laid) and an imagination enslaved to logic. This film isn't, and as a consequence some call it 'difficult'. And not suitable for children. Let me tell you, 5 year olds have, with their boundless imagination, no difficulty getting into this.This film is just so good it's hard to believe someone just sat down at a table, wrote the thing and then drew it on a piece of paper.** Addition ** I've recently read the Nausicaa anime, and it becomes even clearer now that Mononoke is Miyazaki's re-take on his Nausicaa film (which was premature even in its full-length format), with Nausicaa split in two over Ashitaka & San. However, though this is obviously Miyazaki's second best (after Laputa), it remains difficult to pour all the complex musings about man's relationship to nature in 2 hours (the Nausicaa manga is over a 1000 pages long and took him 13 years; when it was finished he made Mononoke). Hence, some things (like Ashitaka helping out Eboshi even after she's done such evil deeds) have left some viewers bewildered. In all, I found the persona of Nausicaa (in the manga) more fit, in her responsible role as a princess, to convey The Message than the split version here. Still, the very idea about man & technology vs. nature and the question of ""is anything ever over"" (ewige wiederkehr, the cycle of life) is at its most nuanced here. In any case, image-wise, I doubt you'll ever see anything as beautiful as this.",Princess Mononoke
223,j-00900,The perfect movie,8,3 June 2020,"The feeling that this movie brings to me is too complicated, there is anger, touch and hope. Angry and disappointed with humanity, but moved by the love in it, and hopeful that eventually humanity is still alive. Ashidaka is the only man I like in so many Hayao Miyazaki movies. The phrase ""you are beautiful"" is simply a perfect confession",Princess Mononoke
224,Soujiro,A Unique and Beautiful Story,10,26 September 1999,"I watched an English subtitled version of this movie, and I often had to rewind the movie to read the subtitles.  Not because I am a slow reader, but because I couldn't tear my eyes away from the images on the screen.  I watched the movie a second time and ignored the subtitles, and the movie's impact was just as great. 	The film explores the theme of nature vs. technology much like many of Miyazaki's films.  There are definitely similarities between this and Nausicaa, but Mononoke Hime is much more serious and occasionally dark. Although the film does have moments of graphic violence, I would think that it would be very safe to bring an intelligent child of twelve or so.  The hero's attitudes towards violence are made very clear.  His most repeated phrase is ""calm yourself,"" usually yelled in an attempt to avoid bloodshed. 	This is a film that could not be made as a live action movie.  Fancy computer-generated creatures and live actors would make it seem less ""real."" (not to mention ridiculously expensive)  Miyazaki has always been careful in his films to create complete worlds with their own religions and mythologies, and he never oversimplifies his characters.  The heroes have bad traits and the villains have good traits, and we the audience are left to  figure out what makes the villains in the wrong. He also has a tradition of strong women characters which is very evident in Mononoke Hime. 	Computer graphics are used sparingly and never seem out of place or thrown in.  People who are not used to watching anime often jump to comparisons with Disney films because they equate animation with cartoons or children's movies.  For the most part, this is an unfair comparison, since the target audiences are extremely different both agewise and culturally. 	If I had to compare this to an ""American"" movie I would say that it's a less sappy, more realistic Neverending Story with hints of Braveheart thrown in here and there (primarily in the epic battles, setting, and the music). If you get a chance to see this on a big screen, no matter how horrible the dubbing or translation, please do so.  The visuals and story will still draw you in.  Bring as many friends as possible and send a message that showing anime in American theaters can be profitable.  If you like Mononoke Hime, Miyazaki's other films are of similar quality and are more suited for younger viewers.",Princess Mononoke
225,Jester69,Whats the big deal???,7,29 December 2000,"I admit I liked this film and thought the animation was very good, but what's with all the hype???

As far as animated films go, Heavy Metal is the best!!!",Princess Mononoke
226,constructionbob,Beautiful. Absolutely Beautiful.,10,3 June 2000,"I had heard so much about this movie that I traveled an hour and a half to Dallas with my friend to see it in the theater, and I can honestly say that it was a 5 hours well spent.  Hayao Miyazaki has created a true work of art in this film, and its questions will stay with you long after its viewing. Please do not dismiss its power on the basis of it being Japanese animation, long a realm merely championed of geeks and fanboys...This world is so completely realized that it gave me goosebumps on occasion. The plot cannot be summarised in a mere blurb-it involves an ancient curse, demons and forest spirits, society and modernization, greed and sacrifice. And that's leaving a heck of a lot out.  I especially like that the evil is so hard to define, kinda like real life, eh?  Who are you gonna side with? The forest protectors are violent and cruel, but what they defend is surely worth defending in such drastic means.  Irontown may be destroying the land thus, but those people have to work somehow, and Lady Eboshi's motives are humanitarian therein.  These are some of the conflicts the hero has to puzzle through, and you may find along with him that there is no clear answer.In short, I recommend this movie highly, to anyone who enjoys film that makes you think.  Sure, there's action, quite a bit of it too intense for children, but it's never wanton.  10/10, and a huge thank you to Miyazaki and his animators for this beautiful vision brought to life.  Oh, and the American voice acting's not bad at all either.",Princess Mononoke
227,MrAwesome1022,Great Storytelling,9,2 April 2014,"This was my first Studio Ghibli film and I was blown away by the visual spectacle this movie creates. The storyline and visuals seem are very similar to that of James Cameron's Avatar, except in anime form.Hayao Miyazaki definitely succeeded in his vision for the film as it is absent of the typical ""Good vs Evil"" plot focus and instead is centered around characters that are without evil intent. Many live action films fail with connecting on a personal level, but Princess Monoonoke was able to deliver strong themes that are easy to relate to.The story telling is remarkable, the characters are extremely detailed, and the storyline is incredible intricate without any holes. This is a film I would recommend to anyone and would love to someday see adapted to live action.True Score: 8.8",Princess Mononoke
228,Jimmy Jimmereeno,It's not Disney or Pokemon,10,30 November 1999,"See it while it's still in theatres!! This came out around the same time as Pokemon. Both are animated and Japanese. The similarities end there. Princess Mononoke is not a kids movie. Kids could see it if they wanted to but it's not the sachrine-sweet that disney usually churns out. This is an amazing anime film. The art is beautiful and brilliant, there were times I forgot I was looking at animation. This is a medium that allows the filmmaker to do so much more than you could with live-action. Anime is not new or anything but this is the first time I ever got to see one on the big screen. The story is about an epic battle between the animals and humans. It is so so good. See it at the theatre while you still can!",Princess Mononoke
229,Rebochan,Disney wishes they could make movies this good...,10,25 June 2001,"Yes, you read that right.  And the irony is that Disney brought it over.  It bombed thanks to them, because they realized that the movie was not typical kiddie krap-no songs, the cute creatures don't even talk (they click and fortunatly don't distract), and there's no hit-you-over-the-head moral in it.  Simply put, this is the best movie ever made, animation or otherwise, and Disney couldn't handle that.The characters in this film have incredible depth that even live-action films don't attain.  There's no characters that are outright good or bad. Eboshi at first glance would be the haughty villainess, but while she does commit evil by killing the gods, she also does great good by buying up the contracts of women forced to work in brothels and caring for lepers without even fearing for their illness.  San, whose name is the ""Princess Mononoke"" of the title (Trivia: Mononoke means ""Ghost"" a name that shows the depth that Hayao Miyazaki uses in his films), while she is trying to save the forest, is quite bloodthirsty.  The gods, who protect the forest, are also very warlike, and despise humans.  The fact that there is no real line of good or evil in the movie is what makes it so powerful.That is not to say the animation isn't impressive.  They pushed the limits with this one-the final sequence with the mutated Deer God is so real you forget that your watching a series of drawings that are only an illusion of motion.  The worm demon-gods would be impossible to create in live-action-only the realm of animation make them seem plausible.This movie proves what animation can do, and also shows a sad fact-while animated films have been around for about a century, their potential has been severely overlooked to the point where the most crude of drawings and pointless of plots are considered to be ""art"" and are relegated simply to the realm of ""mindless kids entertainment"" (or worse-EDUtainment:P).  Disney would do well to learn, but they haven't-they're still not releasing the other Miyazaki films they bought the rights to.  Perhaps they realized that if people saw how bad their own animation hsa become that they'd have to spend the extra time to make GOOD movies instead of the mindless drivel or pathetic made-for-video sequels (Little Mermaid II anyone?) they keep pushing out to us.",Princess Mononoke
230,jeethjohnp,Brilliante!!!!,10,5 November 2008,"I just don't have to write much because all the other reviews tell a lot about the brilliant masterpiece that is ""MONONOKE HIME"". The complexity of the story is simply too complex. The animation: breath-taking. The characters: so real. All in all this is an animation that should never be missed. I was a person who used to think that Disney was something mammoth-sized monster that could never be defeated. But after watching all the Hayao Miyazaki animations, I am simply awestruck by his imagination and his brilliance in their execution. Hats off to such a brilliant artiste!!!!! And I just hope that he won't stop with ""PONYO ON THE CLIFF BY THE SEA"". He should make many more brilliant features..........",Princess Mononoke
231,marialiiva,EPIC,9,14 March 2020,Ive seen this movie so many times but Ill never get tired of it! Its just soo good!,Princess Mononoke
232,baseballfanjm,One of the most brilliant and beautiful movies I've ever seen - Spoilers,10,13 October 2003,"I'm going to go into some detail about this movie, so please don't read this if you  haven't seen it. And if you haven't seen it, go out and rent it right now, and be  sure to watch it in Japanese. The Japanese language track has much better voice acting than the dub. Anyway, I've been reluctant to write a review, simply because I fear that I can't  do this film justice. Rather than write a traditional review, I'd like to focus on the  main characters. With this movie, Hayao Miyazaki refuses to give us what we're used to with traditional animated fare. Where we want to see an evil villain, with thousands of  mindless followers, he gives us Lady Eboshi, head of the Ironworks. She is very  greedy, and her destruction of the environment, as well as her slaying of the  Forest Spirit are terrible, but she also cares deeply for her people. Her people  truly love her, and it's easy to see why. Where we are used to seeing either a damsel in distress for our hero to sweep  off her feet, or a female lead who is completely noble and kind, he gives us San,  the Princess Mononoke. She was abandoned by her family, raised by Moro, a great wolf, and has a deep hatred for humans. Her cause is a just one, she has  to defend her home, but her actions are driven by hatred, the same hatred that  turns the boars Nago and Okkoto into demons. Never in this film is her hatred  justified, and I found it to be frequently contrasted with the forgiveness of the  main character, which brings us to Ashitaka. Ashitaka is the aforementioned main character. He is opposed to killing, but is  willing to do so if his life or the lives of the innocent are threatened. In defending  his village from the rampaging Nago, he receives a deadly curse. He is, through  no fault of his own, thrown into this battle between man and nature, the Ironworks and the forest, Lady Eboshi and San. Unlike Lady Eboshi, he sees the wrong in the wholesale destruction of the forest. Unlike San, he isn't blinded  by hate and is willing to forgive. It is Miyazaki's handling of these characters, and the constant contrast that goes  on between them that helps make this film so different from what people are used to with American animation. But my favorite aspect of the film is how Miyazaki handles the character of San. Nature could easily have been represented in this film by some forest creature, but by using San, who hates  humans, but is a human herself, he creates a whole new angle. She is a human,  but she no doubt has ever had any emotional contact with a human, other than feelings of hatred. When Ashitaka tells her she's beautiful, her reaction is one of  fright, like a scared child. Mind you, when he tells her this, he is badly wounded  and she is holding a blade to his throat. As she develops feelings of love for  Ashitaka, she starts to deny them. It is also made clear, at least to me that she is  not a heroine, not if heroines are just. Granted, as I said before, her cause is  just. But she has no problems with killing humans in cold blood. Down to the very end she refuses to forgive humans. Again, one might say that her feelings  are justified, but they do contrast with Ashitaka, who is very forgiving. When  Lady Eboshi is wounded by Moro, Ashitaka brings her to safety. San wants to kill her as she lies helpless and when Ashitaka stops her, she goes through a  breakdown and stabs Ashitaka (not badly) with a dagger. That dagger is very symbolic. It was a dagger that he gave to her as a gift of his love for her, a  dagger that was given to him by his sister as he left his village, never to see his people again. She wants to use to kill, and then stabs him with it. Really, the whole contrast can be summed up by when Ashitaka says to Lady Eboshi that he has come ""to see with eyes unclouded."" San's eyes indeed are clouded. Anyway forgive me for focusing so much on this aspect of the film. I don't mean  to make San look like a villain. She isn't. However, people constantly talk about  the message this film wishes to send, a warning about mindless destruction of  the environment, which is a message the film sends. But I rarely see anyone mention the faults of San and the destruction caused by hate. That's the brilliance of the film. Ashitaka is an innocent hero, thrust into this  world where neither side is completely wrong and both sides are driven by an evil, the humans by pure greed, the residents of the forest by pure hate. Ashitaka's pleas for peace fall on deaf ears, with both sides accusing him of  supporting the other. It all culminates in a climax in which both sides end up  suffering, and ends without offering a straight ""and they both lived happily ever  after"" answer. But what it does offer at the end is a glimmer of hope. And that, I  think, is the ultimate message of the film. Despite the greed and hatred, and the  destruction caused by them, you can never give up, and good will overpower evil. This is a truly incredible film.",Princess Mononoke
233,jn1356-1,A Beautiful New Sylvan Mythology,9,4 March 2007,"My daughter makes me watch these. Nine times out of ten I'm glad. This time I was ecstatic! Ashitaka's village is threatened by a demon boar. In killing the boar, Ashitaka's arm takes on the infection that has turned the boar into a demon. He must leave his village, knowing his fate, knowing that when he fully becomes a demon, he could kill them all.In his travels, he encounters a huge range of characters and situations, ending with what I can only call a great mythology. The movie is breathtaking.One thing I truly love about this show (I hope this isn't a spoiler) is that in the end there are no villains. There are antagonists and protagonists, but everyone is genuinely, sincerely doing what she or he thinks is the best thing. This is a great, artistic, true expression of how things usually are. A great lesson.",Princess Mononoke
234,tuomas_gimli,A fantastic epic with a problematic second half,8,16 November 2012,"If Studio Ghibli's fantasy films were a menu, Nausicaä and Laputa would serve as appetizers for the main course which is Mononoke. It is a grim, adult fantasy epic which deals with heavy themes in a mature way. It doesn't ask simple questions, nor does it give simple answers and its only moral shades are of grey. It is fantasy fiction at its finest, and magnificently realized.Which sadly makes the few flaws it has all the more apparent.Mononoke has a theme of man vs. nature. However, instead of going the Avatar route, Mononoke presents both sides as fully fleshed out, and neither of them seems better or worse than the other. This is perhaps Mononoke's greatest strength: real-feeling moral ambiguity where wrong and right are shady at best.Mononoke has also a multitude of other things going for it: the animation and art are gorgeous, and don't seem dated in any way. The music is among Joe Hisaishi's best, and that is not something you can say lightly. The action scenes are perhaps the most visceral and thrilling in all of the Ghibli films, and Miyazaki's imagination outdoes 99% of mainstream cinema.Mononoke has only two major flaws, but sadly they can't be ignored. The first is the main characters: they're believable and well developed, but there's an odd lack of emotion to them. Ashitaka, for example, doesn't seem to display much else than cold indifference or steely determination. I also would have liked the hinted romance to have been explored a bit more. It clearly is there, why not go for it? The second, and biggest, problem with the film are its around last 45 minutes. In short, the whole story and all plot threads are solved in one long, intense action sequence which takes up most of the film's second half. The intensity is kept high for the whole time with little pause for breath, and eventually it does get tiring. I think it could have been done better. Also the ending feels quite abrupt after the long action sequence, as the ""what happened next?"" question is answered with only a few short scenes, and then we cut to the credits. There could at least have been an image montage during the credits like in Totoro.Recommendation: Despite my criticisms, Mononoke is in the end a great film and practically obligatory to see for any who consider themselves anime fans. Must-see for Ghibli fans, heartily recommended for anyone else",Princess Mononoke
235,El_Rey_De_Movies,"A major achievement, unfortunately marginalized in the States",8,7 April 2008,"Disney has always dominated the animation market here in the States with their popular, streamlined, well-crafted series of films aimed at children with a little extra thrown in to keep the parents interested. But it's a different story in Japan, and one look at ""Princess Mononoke"" will show you the exact reasons why. Whatever you may think about Japanese animation (or ""anime"", as it's popularly known), one thing you have to understand is that it's definitely NOT aimed at children, and that the level of animation is far superior to anything the House of Mouse has ever produced. This film, which I consider one of the greatest ever made, is the story of young Prince Ashitaka. While defending his tribe from a rampaging demon, he is infected with its' venomous hate. The infection is lethal, and the only hope for Ashitaka is to leave his ancestral lands, venture into the west, see what caused the entity that attacked his people to turn into a demon, and ""to see with eyes unclouded by hate"". His journey takes him to Irontown, a village of miners and metalworkers, and their struggle with the Great Forest Spirit. At that point, it becomes a moral fable about how humans coexist (or more often, fail to) with the natural environment and the price that they pay for trying to control the elements of nature. It's a tremendously fast-paced and exciting story, full of strong and well-rounded characters voiced convincingly by the likes of Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Billy Bob Thornton. The animation can only be described as jaw-droppingly beautiful. If you've never heard of director Miyazaki or have never seen anime, this is the place to start.",Princess Mononoke
236,Cindy-39,a terrifyingly mystical film,8,13 February 2000,"The real miracle of Princess Mononoke is the design of the creatures. From the giant oozing demon in the beginning to the gray blind boar and the Spirit of the Forest (which looks like an antelope with a smiling human face), Miyazaki was able to tap into something very deep and provoking. The creatures are at the same time beautiful and terribly ugly. Like the race of the little white ghosts that inhabit the forest. They are some of the most achingly cute characters ever made (in fact, I saw dolls of these characters at a gift shop in Little Tokyo), but at the same time a little disturbing once you realize that their heads are like skulls and their bodies like Pillsbury Dough Boys. I found myself flinching in terror at the sight of the blind boar with blood gushing out of his eyes. On that note, I think that the violence of this movie really propels it to another level. It was the one thing that really got reactions from the audience. And I'm not talking the kind of gratuitous violence in action movies. The violence in Princess Mononoke is quite extreme, but it does so to portray the brutality of human (and animal) conflict.Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the voice acting in the American adaptation. It was really a mixed bag. Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, and Gillian Anderson in particular were fabulous, but I felt that Billy Crudup and Claires Danes did some typical cartoon overacting. Many may disagree on me with this, but I found it to be distracting and cheesy at times.I would also like to comment on the current popularity of anime. With the slew of violent action movies being brought over to the states (Ninja Scroll, Gundam, etc.), people get the misconception that the appeal of anime is the mature content. But the real beauty and success of Japanese animation is in the way the artists are able to convey the smallest details of real human life. Hayao Miyazaki's work (My Neighbor Totoro, Castle in the Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service) is a prime example of this. Such as in Princess Mononoke in a scene where a leper, completely covered in bandages, talks about the tragedy of his life.  You cannot see his face or tell by his voice that he is crying, but rather from the bandages over his eyes, where dark circles appear as his tears soak the fabric.  It's scenes like this that make the film so impressive.",Princess Mononoke

(with the exeption of Ranma 1/2 and Dominion Tank Police) The more recent Miyazaki releases have been considerably butchered. How should I say it....this movie encompassed all of the emotion, and sublime beauty of Nausicaa and Tonari no Totoro!! The scenery is lush with detail. The animation is astounding. And the acting was suprisingly good. If you're worried about seeing an english dubbed anime and are waiting for the dvd, please see this on the big screen before it's too late!

238,louis1011,Brilliant stroy backed with stunning animation,9,10 July 2018,"Princess Mononoke was on may radar for some time before I first saw it. Hearing that it was a 'Miyazaki master piece' but not really knowing what to expect. However as I started to watch the opening of the film I could tell from the amazing musical score and the breathtaking animation that I was watching a truly captivating film. As the story progresses you get a more three dimensional look at the characters in the film looking from all points of view seeing whats everyone wants. In particular you get a good look at the main character Ashitaka(voiced by Billy Crudup) as he tries to stop a conflict between San(voiced by Claire Danes) ,a girl raised by wolves, who is helping lead the wolves and other Forrest creatures up against Lady Eboshi(voiced by Minnie Driver) the Head of a village who are gradually destroying the Forrest for the resources the land has.Compared to other films Princess Mononoke should rank among the best animated films as it have a level of grandness that could only be matched by films like The Lord of the rings. Over the years this film has also been compared with other anime films however this film has a completely different tone to most of them as you don't get a shonin vibe or a high school romance.

The story is also far more complicated than anything American animation has imagined, illustrating the true nature of conflict and its resolution better than any of them.  It also features a truly great character in Eboshi, whose motives aren't as black and white as western animation might have made it.  But most notable was the running time.  No, not how long it was, but how short it felt to me.  I really don't understand when others complain of it being too long.

Up until I was 10 or 11, I found a lot of enjoyment in shows like Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh, like many other children my age. I also really enjoyed staying up late and watching some of the darker, more violent animes on TV like Inuyasha, Gundam and Bleach (despite not understanding the plots sometimes).For the next 7 years, I didn't watch any anime. I blame that on my peers in middle school who liked to make fun of people who watched it (and, as a result, I also blame my own self-consciousness). Though I've never returned to any of the shows I mentioned before since I have outgrown some of them (with the exception of the Pokemon video games), Princess Mononoke has kindled a new flame for me; I want to watch anime again.There isn't a single element of the film that Miyazaki and his animation team haven't poured their hearts and souls into. The characters and environments breathe on the screen, and the historical Japanese setting- especially the most significant forest in the film- is on par with any fantastical world that I've ever immersed myself in, including the likes of Middle-Earth and the Star Wars universe.The plot is fantasy, but it is laced with metaphors and philosophical themes, such as a rather vengeful form of environmental awareness... perhaps it's best to refer to it simply as ""environmental revenge"". Iron Town is particularly interesting, since its goals are fundamentally opposed to those of the forest spirits, yet its residents are not unkind, or driven by any form of manifest destiny (for the most part); in fact, it would be unreasonable to refer to any character in this film as an antagonist. Everyone's motives are justified one way or another.The voice acting is quite literally of Hollywood quality, unlike most English-dubbed anime productions. Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Gillian Anderson and Minnie Driver sound much more fluid and natural than the sometimes stale offerings on an average anime TV show. There are hiccups on rare occasions, but they are swiftly forgotten and forgiven.Above all else, Princess Mononoke leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. It has inspired me to watch the rest of Miyazaki's work, and if you're wanting to introduce yourself to the anime genre, this is the way to do it.",Princess Mononoke
249,talullalu,This movie is a masterpiece WEOW,10,29 May 2021,God there is just so much to say here. The soundtrack is such a knock out it is so beautiful Joe hisaishi is a marvelously talented composer! And the plot is stunning and important and epic but not too convoluted or cliched. The characters can be a little bland at times but WHO CARES the whole setting and dynamics are so incredibly fascinating and the moral grayness of the factory town is so engaging and cool and it is such timeless subject matter. Visually it is absolutely bonkers and blends history and fantasy/folklore seamlessly. The designs for everything are marvelous WOWOWOW <3 It is an INCREDIBLE epic take but also very emotional and really instills such indescribable emotions. My favorite character has got to be lady eboshi she is so interesting morally and also she is very hot lol. I absolutely adore this movie it has such an impact time and time again .,Princess Mononoke
250,soloriamagic08,"You'll feel either of these three things after watching. Hate, Love, or Neutral",5,31 August 2006,"Plot:A prince from a far away land gets a wound put on him when defending his village from a demon. He is banished from his village and is told he will die,but might have a chance if he can find the spirit of the forest.On his journey he meets different people who all seem to have one track minds and he seems to be the only voice of reason in the whole film.He also meets a girl who can talk to animals and seems to be bloodthirsty for humans even though she's a human herself. That's maybe because she was raised by wolves,and that humans especially one B*tch in particular has been destroying the forest and animals just so she can make iron.Anyway this movie will definitely p*ss you off,and if that was it's intent it succeeded.Oh,but the ending SUCKED. I mean really could it have been any cheesier? Visuals: Looking at the visuals from a 2006 perspective they weren't all that great. Better than old Disney cartoon visuals,but definitely not better than anything that has been put out since we entered the new millennium.Characters: You will feel for the characters especially the main character.I quite liked him, and hated others. On a superficial note he has a sexy voice too.LoL! Bottomline: This movie is rather drama orientated,and really violent in some scenes. If you like those sort of things you'll fully like this movie. I have hated so far all this man's movies with the exception of Howl's Moving Castle.So for this movie to get a 5(Neutral) from me is saying something.Basically see this movie if you love drama. Stay away from it if you don't.",Princess Mononoke
251,LLinus,Blessed with a curse,7,20 July 2013,"The story was well built, i felt like it had a good purpose. It was about strength, peace, war and love for other creatures and as well hate. The main character has a goal and a journey in front of him and we get to witness the obstacles he faces throughout the path. The main character is a brave and honest young man, who is struggling to keep his strength up most of the time, but is burden by his curse. As we progress further in to the movie you come to realize the rivalry between the different kinds of races we witness, they just won't get along. But still this movie had these moment of greatness were you felt an big urge to pay even more attention to it and you forget how uncomfortable you lie in your bed. There are a few fight scenes that i thought were very well done, it was these sound effects other than the usual that made it spark a bit (not literally) and the fight were not too long or made you bored in any way. The music had a bit classic feeling, or kind of typical music in movies made by Asians, don't get me wrong i loved it, they made the music match well in to the movie. Of all the anime/Manga iv watched one thing always catch my interest is that the animation and sound effects is always astonishing, in one way i really can't explain so good, the voices don't fit it but it still works well, I'm not sure why. I usually don't watch anime/Manga but my friend made me watch this movie, i don't dislike anime its just that in most cases it isn't something that interests me.",Princess Mononoke
252,MoffatLP,Visually Stunning,10,4 July 2012,"Hayao Miyazaki is clearly one of the best directors to this day. His best movie is, in my opinion, definitely Princess Mononoke. Being a fan of Miyazaki's work like Spirited Away, The Secret World of Arietty (which he only wrote), Castle in the Sky, and Porco Rosso (I could name more but back to the review) I had no little expectations for such an amazing film, boy was I wrong. My expectations were greatly surpassed and what we receive is one of the most visually stunning films of all time.The story is about a young warrior who has a curse put upon him by a raging boar demon-god. He sets out on a journey to the western forests where he hopes to find a cure that would lift the curse from him. It's definitely like Hayao Miyazaki's style.The characters are also pretty awesome. The film's main antagonist, Lady Eboshi, develops so nicely you have this real sort of hatred towards her, one that should be present in every film. She has a reason for it though, she wants success and wants the ability to survive. The protagonist, Ashitaka, is a cool character. He sees peace on both sides between the forest gods who want the humans dead, and the humans who want the gods dead. He can't find an ally on either side directly and he constantly is in a struggle for survival. There's a good romance story between San (the human who believes she is a wolf-god) and Ashitaka and over the course of the movie their relationship develops a ton. You actually get an emotional attachment to the characters, something that's very rare. While they aren't directly involved with one-another, you can see the love between them. It's rather heart-warming considering it's a film about death and stuff.The voice acting is great, as expected. With an all-star cast that include Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, John Di Maggio, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and Gillian Anderson, it's hard to believe that the voice acting wouldn't be good. It has a very good musical score that contains intense and emotional factors, never leaving the action bland or boring by complete silence.There's much to enjoy about Princess Mononoke. It's just a film in general that's great to watch. Lots of colours are featured and leaves a stunning visual impact that really catches the eye. The animators all deserve recognition, as the animation blends in with the colours and nothing is absent. It gives the film industry a perfect reason why hand-drawn films are nearly always better than computer animation.In all, Princess Mononoke is one amazing film. Definitely one of the all time best and it leaves nothing out. There were intense sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat while keeping the main attraction to the visual scenery. Everything was perfect and it's difficult to find any errors with such a masterpiece. Princess Mononoke is definitely an overlooked film. It also goes to show that special effects aren't the only thing to make a film look beautiful.",Princess Mononoke
253,irwanjuanda_ndson,I Can't Find Right Words To Express How I Love This Movie!!!,9,17 September 2014,"It was beyond great and amazing...! And remembering that it's produced in 1997, it makes me honor and respect this movie even... even better. The characters are lovable and hateable, that's how characters in movie should be like. Some characters are just so ""human"" I want to slap them in the face, and by saying some, it already includes the good and bad characters. And the imperfection of the characters stance, that is another element that makes this movie works for me.The storyline is not a plain one character's problem which is typical and weak, it's a multi-sided one that makes you able to view everyone's ""importance"" in what they are doing and therefore understand the ""why"" in their actions.Without forgetting that, what I love most from this movie is the fact that it encourages people to love the environment and not being so greedy with our human's ambition, and it teaches us to understand that our prejudice about what we don't know sometimes is the thing that makes us do bad things, and it shows why people do some bad things and why war happens and... oh my, I can't arrange the right sentence of how great the movie is.Just watch it!!!",Princess Mononoke
254,etg1701,A masterpiece in anime,9,9 April 2007,"There have been many times where after watching an anime, I have found myself seriously questioning the value of the medium. Whether due to misogynism, gratuitous violence, or tentacles, I walk away wondering what is going on in Japanese culture. Princess Mononoke, like Miyazaki's other works, is not a vehicle for shameless fan-service, nor does it rely on the tired and implausible concept of mecha as its selling point, unlike so much anime I have seen. Instead, it deals with the age-old tension between human attempts to shape the environment for its own ends and the life-and-death power of nature.Despite its clear point, Princess Mononoke does not stray into obvious lines of good and evil or try to drop the message on the viewer like an anvil. Rather, it portrays both sides of the conflict in a balanced manner, showing the good and the bad and depicting the harm brought by hate on both sides. Perhaps the only major flaw I can see is that Miyazaki's romanticized monarchism, which leads him to again bring out the decidedly clichéd heroic warrior-prince/princess.",Princess Mononoke
255,Ftaren,One Of The Best I Have Ever Witnessed,9,23 April 2001,"Anime is not my thing. Certainly, there have been those films which I have enjoyed, but so few and far between were they that as a whole, I had little hope of ever finding a REAL film amongst them. then, this came along. A classicly styled fantasy epic, so vividly brought to life that it almost makes you cry at the commitment its creators have demonstrated. And it was animated, which was the perfect choice for this story. The music, sound effects, the direction, which honestly I have never been able to detect in an animated feature before, the story-it all boiled down to one of the greatest viewing pleasures I have ever had.     Now, if there is a complaint to be made, it is that there are sequences which seem a little overdone, or bits of dialogue that somehow seem out of place, or at least badly performed, which is surprising being that the voice casting of the English dub for the film is extraordinary. Aside from that, EVERYTHING else is pitch perfect.     This is a film where you can usually count the digits on a hand, and come up with the right number. Where when the breeze sweeps through a persons hair, not only do you see it, but you can nearly feel it yourself. A film that has the courage to show its audience something profound in a format which, in the United States, is sorely lacking. In this country, the creatures would all be cute, not menacing. Here, even the most docile of creatures has a realistic edge. It would have none of the philosophy this contains, and most heartbreaking of all, it would be overlooked entirely, all for the simple fact that it was animated. This proves the point that animation is an art form. CARTOON does not apply in this case. The film isn't for children, & I would never recommend this to anyone under 13. Not because of excessive violence, foul language or nudity, but rather because the tone and the complexities of the story will probably not keep the interest of most under the aforementioned age, or even interest them in the first place.     This is a film, which, when compared to live action features such as Excalibur, Gawian and the Green Knight, Dragonslayer, Conan, Beastmaster-it has only one difference: the freeing majesty afforded it by virtue of being animated. I mention these films as they are similar in tone and texture to this, yet, somehow, this surpasses them all. Not just the greatest animated film of all time, but perhaps the greatest fantasy film in cinema history. If you have ever read the ancient myths and legends of mankind, if you thrilled to the ""Lord of the Rings"" series, then this is the film for you, one which manages to capture on screen what your imagination once conjured.",Princess Mononoke
256,sonicfan5715,Animated Brilliance...,10,22 March 2013,"To a lot of people here in America, who have been raised with Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Shrek, Woody, Spongebob, Batman, Spiderman, and so forth, tend to toss aside any remote idea of watching anything that is ""anime."" Why? Because it's very different then what we're used to, and anything we see related to anime is usually kid oriented or just flat out weird that we turn a blind eye to this form of animation.But we should not, anime is a fantastic genre in both animation and its own form of comics called ""manga"". We should not ignore this, and open our eyes to some of these wonderfully animated films and shows from Japanese animation. And I think a good start is with the Studio Ghibli films, who have been partnered with Disney for quite some time now actually, and almost all of the films to come out of this studio are wonders. Like ""Princess Mononoke.""Here's an animated movie that is definitely geared towards a more older teen/adult audience, but not only because of the bloody violent or scary moments, but because of the surprisingly compelling message that it tries to get across. That not only should nature be cherished and preserved, but also that whenever there is good and evil conflicting, there is no ""fairy tale"" guarantee that good will conquer, or even if both sides would be spared by destroying something far greater than either could have ever imagined. The film does so incredibly well with pulling you right into it, with it's compelling storyline about a young man Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) who is poisoned by a demon and will inevitably die, and makes a journey to find out how this demon originated, eventually having to make the more then tough decision of what side he should be assisting: nature, or man. And after coming across an ever determined princess of the wolves, Mononoke/San (Claire Danes), he is confronted with obligations greater than he could have comprehended, whether or not he should help man conquer the pest of nature and the Forest Gods that fight for it, or protect an essence of life itself, the Forest Spirit.""Even if all the trees grow back, it won't be his forest anymore. The Forest Spirit is dead."" -San/Mononoke ""Never. He is life itself. He isn't dead, San. He is here with us now, telling us, it's time for both of us to live."" -AshitakaAlong with some of the most gorgeous animation you've ever seen in any animated feature, this film is brimming with luscious scenery, creative creature/characters constructs, and both luminous and dreary settings to go through. Action scenes can be quite engaging, and even the most calm of scenes where characters are just talking, the animation just never ceases to amaze. The English-dubbing for the animation is just fantastic, each voice actor putting forth some of their best performances in their career, including voices like Billy Bob Thorton, Corey Burton, and even Jada Pinkett Smith. Simply every aspect of this film is fantastic, and it shines tall as one of the best animated features to date. Everything from its great animation, stellar voice cast, a moral/meaning that even adults can learn from, and all from the, again, brilliant Hayao Miyazaki.Even if you're used to the traditional Disney or Warner Bros. animation and don't really plan on venturing too much into the world of anime, it would be unwise not to give this a watch. It will be well worth your time, and you'd never regret it.10/10 By: sonicfan5715/Jeffrey",Princess Mononoke
257,WondrousMoose,Princess Mononoke is one of Studio Ghibli's best and is one of cinema's finest fantasy epics.,9,18 July 2017,"In a cinematic landscape inundated with sequels, reboots, and adaptations, it's refreshing to step back a decade or two and watch something wholly original and incredible. Princess Mononoke was Hayao Miyazaki's seventh feature film and remains the longest that he has directed. At 134 minutes long and with a story as grand as the world it depicts, Mononoke is far from the standard animated output of either the US or Japan. This one is violent. It is epic in the truest sense of the word. It shows us all the world in which we live, only completely different, and it does so brilliantly.We hear two distant drum blasts, and the film opens on vast, forest- covered mountains. Trees fall and plants die as a monster passes through the them. This, we learn, is an angry demon in the form of a giant boar, and it charges to attack a nearby settlement. Prince Ashitaka (Matsuda/Crudup) meets the monster outside of his village and defends his people from it, but not without sustaining a cursed injury. He must leave his village and head west to search for a cure.As he travels, he comes to Iron Town, which is under constant attack from the forest that it has been destroying. Leading this attack is San (Ishida/Danes), a human girl who was raised by a wolf deity and has vowed to kill the town's matriarch, Lady Eboshi (Tanaka/Driver). As the conflict escalates far beyond the town's mountain, Ashitaka must choose where his allegiances lies and how he can end the war.I consider this to be one of the few truly great, mainstream environmental films. Its treatment of the nuanced issues at hand is equally nuanced, and unlike the easy ""nature good/people bad"" moral of so many others, Mononoke is able to leave us with the message that there is a balance that must be maintained. Humanity will always develop and progress, but it must do so with the knowledge that our lives and our resources all depend on the world that we inhabit.This film pulls no punches. Limbs and heads are shot clean off, and hard questions don't get easy answers. Perhaps most challenging, though, is the character of Eboshi. She acts as the antagonist of the film but is benevolent toward those in her town, buying prostitutes out of nearby brothels and offering lepers employment and respect. She is destroying the environment surrounding her land but all for the sake of her people. The cultures and relationships depicted in Princess Mononoke are uncharacteristically real for a blockbuster release.Mononoke's animation is top-notch, even compared to Miyazaki's other works, as the landscapes, characters, and monsters are given incredible life and depth throughout. Joe Hisaishi's score is epic and has got to be among the greatest scores in an animated feature. The sound design as a whole is incredible; through it you can feel every arrow landing around you and smell the dust as it flies up from the feet of Ashitaka's elk. Princess Mononoke was supposed to be its director's last film, and while I am glad that he changed his mind, this would have made for a fine final work.",Princess Mononoke

Well, I want to march up to the teacher who made me watch it, slam a copy of ""Princess Mononoke"" on her desk and tell her, ""Get rid of that other movie and start showing your classes this!"" Seriously, this is a fantastic environmental movie! Why? Because instead of saying, ""People are evil, nature is good!"" it says that people and nature can live in harmony. They never say which side is good, it's up for the audience to decide, while never shoving the message down your throat like other environmental films at the time. Granted, I wouldn't show it to younger audiences, there are multiple bloody scenes of people getting body parts ripped off, and I found the Spirit of the Forest to be really creepy. But, if your kids can handle it, seriously show them this movie, you won't regret it.",Princess Mononoke

261,TanjBennett,Allegory on the balance between humans and nature,10,15 April 2003,"This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.  The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards.  The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance.  But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance.  The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy.  The story is not easy to understand.  It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore.  And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted.  Japanese television documented a lot of the production.  The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have ""gotten it"" quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work).  Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that.  His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute.  There is no other animation like it.  This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.",Princess Mononoke
262,J5iftY5iveXtreme,Beautiful animated film!,10,17 August 2005,"From acclaimed animator Hayao Miyazaki (""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Castle in the Sky,"" ""Porco Rosso,"" 2002's ""Spirited Away,"" the recent ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" etc., etc.) comes one of the late 90's most acclaimed films - ""Mononoke hime"" (better known by its English title, ""Princess Mononoke""). Taking place in Japan somewhere in the late medieval times to the early Renaissance in Europe (you can tell its time period since you see guns), this animated epic tells the tale of Ashi-taka, the young prince of a lost Emishi Tribe.The tale begins when Ashi-taka slays a boar demon and saves his village from that monster. But in slaying the beast, he gets cursed, and a wound appears on his right arm. In search for a cure, he journeys, with his ""red elk"" Yarraku, out from his village, never to return.He eventually comes upon Irontown, led by the feisty Lady Eboshi. He is welcomed in that town, and meets several people including Gozo, Eboshi's brute henchman, Toki, a feisty woman worker (like all the women in town, formerly a prostitute until Eboshi bought her freedom), and Toki's husband whom Ashitaka saved, Kohroku. It is in Irontown that Ashitaka learns that Eboshi was was the one who accidentally caused the boar demon to attack his village, since she shot the former animal god and caused it to become angry.Irontown is a modern town and its inhabitants produce rifles, cannons, and other modern weapons introduced to Japan by Westerners. Irontown, a symbol of machinery and metal, sits near an old forest inhabited by spirits and animal spirits, who constantly wage war against Irontown, whose citizens are constantly destroying the forest. It is in this forest that Ashitaka meets San, or, as the rest of Irontown calls her, Princess Mononoke. San was abandoned in the forest and raised by wolves, under the guidance of Moro, the wolf spirit of the forest. San hates human beings (even though she is one), and is determined, under the point of death, to protect the forest from human beings, who are constantly destroying it in an attempt to modernize Japan.San and her fellow nature-loving animals are at war with humanity. Amidst a series of events and many characters, lovable and loathsome, Ashitaka develops a close friendship with San and attempts to bring peace between man and nature.""Mononoke hime"" is a very complex film. Its script, handwritten by Miyazaki using his storytelling talent, is filled with many issues, mostly concerning the role of man in protecting and defiling nature. Although ""Mononoke"" may seem like a simple environmentalist film, its issues are actually deeper than that. The cast of characters is great, filled with lovable (and loathsome) people, all of which are three-dimensional. It's great that Miyazaki chooses to make his characters complex. There are no true good or bad guys in this story. Even the ""bad guys"" are have redeeming qualities. Eboshi, the leading antagonist of this tale, is actually a caring person and houses detested lepers, even giving them a life in Irontown.""Mononoke"" is a very fine film. The animation is gorgeous and beautiful to look at. While in the West, animators are resorting to CGI (i.e. Pixar films, and I love Pixar), Japan retains a traditional method of hand-drawn animation, and thank God for Miyazaki's genius! The score, too, is excellent, and the composer, Joe Hisaishi, is a genius. Combine the score with breath-taking cinematography, gorgeous hand-drawn figures, stylized action scenes, and a powerful story complete with memorable characters, ""Mononoke hime"" is a treat for every movie-goer. This is a mature film in terms of story and content. It even has a few (non graphic) be-headings and dismemberment's, earning it its PG-13 rating in the US.Originally released in Japan, this film featured Yôji Matsuda as the Ashitaka and Yuriko Ishida as the title character (Mononoke/San). It was translated into English, featuring the voices of Billy Crudup as Ashitaka, Claire Danes as San, Minnie Driver (in one of her few notable voice performances alongside Disney's ""Tarzan"") as Eboshi, Gillian Anderson (X-Files) as Moro, Billy Bob Thorton as greedy monk Jigo, and a large cast of English-speaking actors. This English version, alongside the Jap version, was a success. It remains today as one of the best animated features.Miyazaki, we salute you!134 minutes Rated PG-13 for images for violence and gore",Princess Mononoke

267,jakimiku,Anime at its best,10,28 March 2010,"I first saw this film some years ago and it instantly became one of my favorites. It simply has one of the most beautiful plots. I am truly fond of Miyazakis creation and Princess Mononoke is by far his greatest film.The ""ground-breaking motion picture"", as it is described in the trailer, is about a young prince, Ashitaka, finding cure to a deadly curse put on him by a giant demon boar. On the road to salvation he meets Princess Mononoke (San the wolf-princess) and Lady Eboshi the mistress of the Iron town, who is on a campaign to destroy the forest gods for richness in the ground. As Ashitaka is torn between a brutal war between the forest and humans, he tries to make the right decisions and falls in love with San. The film is really about the conflict between nature and civilization. Somehow i feel that Mononoke has such a great story and that Mr Miyazaki has come up with something absolutely extraordinary.The animation itself is beyond doubt, exceptionally amazing. The little details of the forest and its creatures, the whole nature, is just astonishing. Disney and Pixar have a lot to learn and bow down to. The character development is pure and believable. There is no clear villain: everything has both evil and good inside, and that's what makes the story so good. You watch the movie and its magic just absorbs you into the films depth. The soundtrack too, is great and flows with haunting beauty.I truly believe that Princess Mononoke is the best animated movie of all time, it is just so good.

I had read quite a bit about this film and its director but was still totally overwhelmed by the beauty and brutality of this movie. The complexity of this movie is something never seen in the United States in an animated movie and even exceeds that of most live action movies as well. It combines love and hate, war and romance, nobility and deception in ways rarely seen in movies today. Lines of good and evil are anything but clear cut and in the end is hope but no guarantees, no promises. This is truly an adult movie but my children, ages 12 to 15 all loved it and talked about it for days later.

It also has a solid English dub.It concentrates on a different type of character than most of his films, a young man, Ashitaka, rather than a young woman. His quest does not change him like in many other films but rather he changes many others. The film leans just enough on environmental issues to show a cause while allowing the graphics and story you desire from a Miyazaki film. Special note to the soundtrack which is one Ghibli's best. It concentrates on an iron-works and the battle between various factions of humans, the beasts, and others.I don't plan on spoiling much else as the films plot speaks for itself. My only complaint is that certain scenes drag a bit too long and if anything a bit too much blood spills at a certain part of the film.

It still has the wonder of his other features, but this one is different, mixed with a kind of Shakespearean grandeur and tragic intensity.  It's almost ruthless in its lack of sentiment, but because of this it achieves, at least to this viewer, a visionary breakthrough into unfamiliar territory.  This one will stay through the years and if you attend well enough, haunt your dreams.Kudos to Miramax for taking it so seriously and doing a good job with the dubbing.  Still, the American English just does not really match.  It is too laid back, softened and rounded.  It really dulls the impact of this film.

He then leaves the village to find a cure for his curse. Coincidentally he arrives at a iron-mining town and later meets Princess Mononoke on animals' side in the war between animals and humans. At last, in revenge for the death of the boar king, the boar god starts the war.You'll see there's much Japanese mythical imagination throughout the film, but it may not be the kind of film for family as you won't find much or even any laughter in the film but the illustration of the devil, blood and wounds. Anyway, Miyazaki tries to remind us of the importance of environment protection. Humans' greed may get the life-taking deer god's revenge in return.The whole film runs very smoothly yet slowly, but what I like best is the whole theme and also the way it's presented. You'll just enjoy the film itself as a kind of imaginative story, or give it some more thoughts because it's not usual to find many in the industry comparable to the works Miyazaki produces.",Princess Mononoke

284,LordDynamo,Powerful and magical!,8,4 August 2011,"Princess Mononoke was the first, Studio Ghibli film I have seen, and I saw it before it was dubbed into English! It suffices to say that I was ENTHRALLED! It was after watching this that Hayao Miyazaki, the director of Studio Ghibli, has become my favourite director and Princess Mononoke has become one of my top favourite films. The film tells of young Prince Ashitaka and his epic quest to find a cure for a wound made by a demon which has bitten him. During his journey, he finds himself in the midst of a war between humans and gods (in animal form). Fighting alongside the Wolf tribe is a warrior girl called San, also known as Mononoke-Hime. In my opinion, this film is better even than Disney classics, it has more magic and imagination. You really feel as though you're in the imaginary world that the story is set in. What's more, there is no actual villain in the film. The supposed antagonist is Lady Eboshi, given that she is doing the most damage to the forest, though she accepts lepers and even apologizes for Ashtitaka's wound. That's the beauty of Miyazaki's films, it isn't the usual ""good vs evil"" story where the villain is completely bad and gets killed in the end. Additionally, this film gives a message: care for nature and the environment! I feel Miyazaki has portrayed the destruction of nature brilliantly! I don't think the message could have been given in a better way. As a conclusion: I highly recommend this film. It is a marvel to watch, with the type of magical sensation found in a book! Watch it! You will not regret it.",Princess Mononoke

I saw it just a few days after entering college, and i can clearly say i don't regret it. This is definitely the greatest achievement in all animation's history. And there is nothing more to be said about it. Some will precisely say it's annoying to watch a movie (almost) everyone loves, but nevermind. More than ever the message of it all is so strong, so deep no one could forget it: The spirit of Nature lies way above our comprehension, but we despise and keep on killing it slowly. Period. The movie lasts 135 min., and it feels  almost like it's enough. Those 2 hours and a quarter picture everything Miyazaki has been ""fighting"" for so far. Please watch them.",Princess Mononoke
286,Demetrius_Stork,A masterpiece of art and animation,10,20 December 2015,"Wow. This movie blew me away, to say the very least. All of it was captivating; the animation, the characters, and story, all of it done to perfection. Hayao Miyazaki, whose work I'm only beginning to take notice of, is truly a genius in terms of bringing landscapes and it's many creatures to life.The plot revolves around Prince Ashitaka, who is told that he must leave his village and never return after he is cursed by a horrible demon. Ashitaka, along with his red elk, Yakul, sets out on a journey to ""see with eyes unclouded by hate,"" as he puts it and his journey brings him to see many things. He comes across a prosperous settlement that produces iron, fittingly named iron town, and its leader Lady Eboshi, voiced by Minnie Driver. Ashitaka finds that Iron town is at war with the creatures of the forest due to the human's attempting to settle in the forest to create prosperity, which of course the forest dwellers aren't happy about. Ashitaka later meets the princess of the wolf tribe San, who happens to be a human despite her title. Ashitaka becomes caught in the middle of a dispute as old as time itself, man versus animal.Several other characters are added to the mix; a strange little man named Jigo, voiced by Billy Bob Thornton, the lieutenant to Lady Eboshi Gonza, voiced by John DiMaggio (the voice of Bender), Moro, the god of the wolves, and Okkoto the god of the boars. These characters are all brilliantly written, and all have their own likability. One thing that this movie does well is that there isn't really any main villain. All of them have reasonable motivations behind what they're doing. It would have been so easy for this movie to throw in a tired message about how man is evil and how we should save the environment. Many may argue that this movie is trying to set up this message, but I don't think so. Lady Eboshi isn't necessarily a bad person. She's a strong person, who doesn't back down in times of adversity. She's a good leader who protects her people and only wants the best for them, giving a home to the lepers, fighting for the lives of her people against the boars, and sticking up for her fellow women's rights and honor. While on the other side the wolves aren't the villains either; only wanting to protect the spirits of the forest and their home from what they perceive to be their worst enemy, the humans. It's understandable why both sides feel this way, they all have a reasonable motivation and likability.The animation in this film is breathtaking, the creatures just fly off the screen with how they're drawn and how they move. The creatures in this world are all just so creative and beautiful in their designs. The Spirit of the Forest is one of my favorite designs in animation history, especially when the sun goes down. Even the designs of creatures that already exist, like the apes or the boars, all have a unique design and charm. This movie could honestly be watched on mute and still be thoroughly enjoyed.The story of this movie is unbelievably fantastic and deserves much more recognition than it gets in the U.S. It's a fantastic movie by a fantastic animator and is now, after seeing this for the first time yesterday, one of my all time favorites.",Princess Mononoke
287,EugeneOL,"It's Mononoke, What Can I Say",9,10 April 2020,"Whenever someone dares criticize a movie marketed towards kids, there is an overwhelming response of ""But it's for kids! It's supposed to be dumb!"". I long for the days when this isn't a valid excuse for subpar storytelling. But that is another discussion for another time.""Princess Mononoke"" proves that kids' movies can be intelligent. Sure, it doesn't delve into complex real-world social and political issues or use extremely subtle techniques to tell a story, as that would be stupid and ignore the main demographic. However, it is a nuanced narrative that doesn't pit strictly good against strictly evil, and shows no clear favoritism in a traditional ""humans vs. nature"" way. It is an exceptionally well done story that can be enjoyed by anyone, not just children. It isn't ""great for a kids' movie"", it's just great, period.The environment and fantasy world are absolutely jaw-dropping.

For those who think this movie is another ""Pokemon"", go rent and watch this movie!  ""Princess Mononoke"" is an excellent example of the exotic beauty of the art of Japanese animation.  Not for the kids, though, as the films' storyline has some mature dramatic elements.  Hopefully, this movie is an indication of where anime will be going in the country I live in.  Anime should be released in theatres all over the country and all over the world, and I think that ""Princess Mononoke"" will be the catalyst for this realisation. This movie is pure Oscar material, moreso than Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"".  If I could, I would like to shake the hand of every single person involved in this production.  If anyone involved is reading this, then allow me to say ""Well done!""  - Reinhart",Princess Mononoke

292,reddevil_42,Miyazaki: A True Artist,8,14 March 2013,"Nearly all of Miyazaki's works rest in the 'Must watch' category for everyone. He is a true artist who manages to engage his viewers to the screen at all times with another beautifully made movie, Princess Mononoke.Princess Mononoke reflects on the conflict among men, and between man and nature. Cursed by a demon, Ashitaka wanders the forest to search for the cause of his distress and the spirit of the forest for a cure to the curse. There he finds San, who is the daughter of the wolves, bears deep resentment against humans and has vowed to protect the forest at any cost. The other prominent character is Lady Eboshi, who has helped brothel workers and lepers earn a job in her iron town. The movie then proceeds to showcase the events that take place when the paths of the characters cross. There are certain elements in Miyazaki's works that are always accentuated. Lady Eboshi is yet another strong female character. She creates employment for the unemployed and is pragmatic in her approach. She is not daunted by the task in hand till the very last and rejects the help of others as she is confident of herself and her people. In Ashitaka, we see the hero willing to make sacrifices for the greater good. It is his valiant efforts that manage to create some sort of a trust between combative parties. He acts like a mediator between the two warring factions. The analogy of damaged nature with troubled spirits, as seen later in Spirited Away as well, helps understand the plight of nature. The theme of man against nature manifests itself in the form the Iron town's gain of resources at the cost of the forest's well being.Overall, it is yet another liberal and refreshing work from Miyazaki that everyone should watch, preferably when young. The hope that remains is if we could all emulate the virtues of the characters and reject the basic human notions of greed and hatred, our World will become a better place to live in.",Princess Mononoke

So, Japanime isn't always popular with me, but I really like this movie. I relate to the main character because he cares about others and does what he can to help. And the movie showcases cooperation between animals and humans well... think horses. Yakul, Ashitaka's red elk, which looks like a Tauntaun from Star Wars, carries him from place to place. At the beginning of the film, actually, he is riding Yakul when Nago, a wild boar covered with a horrible spirit, attacks a small village. Ashitaka helps a small group of villagers escape from Nago, who looks like he is covered in a heavy, thick, amorphous black oil, but upon closer inspection, it looks more like a pool of worms. These worms shoot out of him like tentacles. A piece of the black spirit shoots out from Nago and strongly twirls, lightly grabbing Ashitaka's right arm. He pulls away. While a small amount of the sludge is on his arm, he is able to release an arrow into the monster's eye, killing him. After his first fight, as his arm rots, this wound glows and he needs help to heal it or else he will die. Find out how iron is killing the animals and see how Ashitaka helps save the forest while preventing his own death.",Princess Mononoke

297,twofold420,The most beautiful movie I have ever seen,10,2 March 2008,"I haven't seen this movie in a long time, but I still stand by my choice as this being the best film of the 1990s (that I saw anyway). This was simply the most stunning and beautiful animation I have ever seen. Disney wishes they can make a movie that looks this good. From the opening scene in Ashitaka's village to the forest of the gods, and even the factories of Iron Town, Miyazaki never lets up on creating a wonderful piece of cinematic beauty (He drew over half the frames himself). Also his attention to detail with how the rain falls and hits the ground, how characters move and talk, and flies buzzing in the background. Hell, live action movies wish they could do something this good.All that is worth two hours of your time, but now we add a complex story where there are no good guys and bad guys just people. There is a lot of action in this film which is unusual for a Miyazaki film, but the plot calls for it, and it doesn't detract from the character development. Each character is well defined and has real depth. The screenplay is powerful and emotional. Most live action films can't achieve the complexity of Princess Mononoke, and it would have to be even harder for animation to convey real life feelings, but as I watched it, the script and beauty kept drawing me in further and further.The voice acting was OK for the US version, and outstanding for the Japanese version. Billy Bob Thorton was completely wrong for any part of this movie (a southern accent in Japan?). The other American voices were all adequate. Interesting note, the voice for the wolf god that Gillian Anderson does was done by a male for the Japanese version. The music was as breathtaking as the animation, and was a perfect match, especially at the end during the restoration scene. This is one of the best musical scores I ever heard, and I'm surprised it didn't get the recognition it deserved. Anyways, the song (Japanese, not American) was also beautiful. 10/10 for both US and Japanese versions, but watch the Japanese version if you can.",Princess Mononoke
298,Danherb,"Mystical, imaginative and fierce: A mature Miyazaki",8,9 June 2005,"Princess Mononoke is another fantastic, magical and profound piece of work of Hayao Miyazaki.It takes you into a mystical world of Forest Spirits, ancient gods and despotic humans. In the land around a mystical forest different tribes of humans combat each other in greed for land and resource. A tyrannic lady doesn't even shy away from destroying the old forest with its ancient gods and forest spirits with fire arms. A young prince tries to interfere and reconcile the tribes. He wishes that animals and humans can live together alongside. But the war has already developed its momentum.Princess Mononoke is about the ancient conflict between humans and nature. Miyazaki embeds this story in a wonderful scenery, with all kinds of weird and mystical creatures. But in contrast to other Miyazaki-films is the style of Princess-Mononoke not that childish, the creatures and battles might be too scary and violent for under-13-year-olds, even though it's still animation.But the maturity of the film does good.Especially in the first halt of the movie, Miyazaki once again delights us with beautiful pictures of a magical scenery and a great soundtrack.First, Miyazaki shows us a beautiful and unspoiled forest and then we witness how human greed tries to destroy it. The presentation of such elementary contrasts works very good.The main advantage of every Miyazaki film is, as it is also in Princess Mononoke, the ravishment of the spectator into a wonderful and visually overwhelming fantasy world, but exactly here lies a flaw of the movie. The coexistence of the ordinary villages and the mystical forest seems a little bit overdone at times. Particularly the role of gods and demons and their transformation into each other comes across a bit too confused and fantastic. Miyazaki concentrates too much on a spectacular as possible finale, so that the film totally looses its magically calm atmosphere in the end.But anyway, Princess Mononoke impresses with beautifully breathtaking pictures an imaginative story and a great soundtrack.",Princess Mononoke

Far more complex and real than Disney outings, it is definitely not for kids younger than, say, nine or ten. For the rest of us, this film affords a rare look into Japanese culture and sensibility.

While the scenario somewhat resembles Miyazaki's earlier work ""Nausicaä"", even as a re-make this movie is a marvel.  The characters (both human and not) are strong and colorful, unlike Disney's one-dimensional cash-cow arsenal of clowny sidekicks and sappy heroes.  The animation quality that exceeds Disney's best is combined with artistic skill and rich music to sculpt scenes of intensity and beauty mainstream America has never seen.  The end of the movie and return to reality creates such a sharp sting of nostalgia (""dump shock"") that no one can see this movie only once.Disney and its horde of 2nd-rate translators are releasing this movie in April 1999 in a meagre 4000 screens.  Hardly respectable treatment for the Japanese all-time blockbuster that beat the best of the best.",Princess Mononoke
302,Jeremiah-8,* * * * for this gem of a movie,10,29 November 1999,"Hiyao Miyazaki brings his poetic sensibility to `Princess Mononoke,' the latest from Studio Ghibi. The film is an ecological fable about the conflict between man and nature, but offers no solutions or preachy messages like most animated films. In addition, it doesn't provide the usual scapegoats or easy targets we are used to. The genius of the film lies not only in its pure cinematic excellence (each image is stunning in its beauty and detail), but its willingness to provide clear and understandable motivation for the consumers/exploiters.Lady Eboshi (voiced elegantly by Minnie Driver) runs Iron Town, a mining village which is reaping its raw material from the Great Forest, taking it by force against the will of the Animal Gods, who battle to regain control over their habitat. Traditionally, Lady Eboshi would be an unrepentant villain who needs to be taught a lesson: destroy the environment and we destroy ourselves. Easy to say, right? Try telling that to the women who work the factory, who were once prostitutes before the lady took them in to work, or the lepers, whom no one but she would hire. Suddenly, the issue becomes clouded. And we understand that technology is both a friend and an enemy. Where would we be without industrial progress? (Miyazaki himself has understood in other films the wonder and glory of these advances, having a fascination for flying mechanisms which runs through his entire body of work.)However, industrial progress comes with a price, and the film unflinchingly portrays Lady Eboshi's cavalier destruction of the forests and disregard for the lives of the Animal Gods who live there. The Boar Tribe is almost entirely wiped out. The Ape Tribe is afraid to plant new trees for fear of the fiery man made catapults. The Wolf Goddess is dying from a poisoned bullet, grimly accepting her fate.San (Princess Mononoke, voiced by Clare Danes) is one of the key defenders of the forest, raised by the Wolf Goddess to despise all humans. The iron bullets are transforming the Gods into vicious Demons, wrecking everything in their path, and the damage is going beyond the Forest and Iron Town, into remote villages throughout Japan.  The film's protagonist, Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup) comes from such a village, attacked by a mad Demon Boar and leaving him with a poisoned wound which will slowly infect his entire body and corrupt him. Ashitaka rides into town and attempts to bring both sides together in a compromise.As you can see, the mythos heavy plot requires you to keep up, but the film is consistently entertaining.  It features epic battle scenes which rival those of the master, Akira Kurosawa (an admirer of Miyazaki's work), and an understanding of how animals behave which is believable throughout (in body language, gesture and, seemingly, in thoughts.)  The adaptation by Neil Gaiman is remarkably vivid, unlike most translations, which seem to lose something special from the source. The voice characterizations range from excellent (Driver, Crudup, Gillian Anderson as the quietly ferocious Wolf God) to questionable (Clare Daines is a bit too cutesy as San, and Billy Bob Thornton is at first seemingly a strange choice as Jiro, a sneaky monk, but neither of them are too distracting. Billy Bob actually grew on me.)`Princess Mononoke' was one of the finest films I've seen this year.",Princess Mononoke
303,tezzzaaa,Disney eat your heart out!,9,14 July 2002,"Mononoke Hime is definitely the best fairytale cartoon I have ever seen. Not only is the animation outstanding, the story is beautiful too.  At last the viewer is treated with an intelligent cartoon, as so many are made and so few distributed, especially in Europe (shame on the film industry!).Miyazaki's style is wonderful.  I have enjoyed this film thoroughly three times.  It deals with the opposing forces of man vs. nature.  This fact gives the film an extra dimension.  Things aren't black and white as they are in mainstream American cartoons.Some scenes are pretty adult in the portrayal of violence (then again if your a Japanese kid, no harm done right?) and the philosophical layer the story contains.  At the same time it's plain fairy tale and warrior saga. Beautiful landscapes, amazing characters (don't you just love the little white silly forest spirits?) and exciting moments.  I can strongly recommend this film to many people.  Some are hesitant about watching cartoons, they expect Disney style animation and storyline.  This film is on a much higher level though.  It deals with an element of human nature which has taken the worst of us.  The essence of Mononoke Hime is the inevitability of human development, exploiting nature and taking the earth's destiny in our own hands.  Hereby we have killed the forests spirit, as indigenous people's everywhere are very aware of.  They are dying with it.Take these dimensions of the film as you will.  If you just want to enjoy a great piece of animation, without bothering to see the deeper meaning, be my guest and see this film too!",Princess Mononoke

The small forest spirits were really cute, and gave the movie an extra aspect of mystery. The feeling of hopelessness in the end really hit me, and kept my attention! And the scenery.... was AMAZING! The weird forestspirit's face, the boars and the wolves were great! The background, however was breathtaking! Like how much time must that have taken?!?!

306,kevin86,"Mononoke Hime is this centuries last ""5 Star"" anime.",10,10 June 2002,"Mononoke Hime is this centuries last ""5 Star"" anime. Its captivating story, amazing visuals, and intense characters are merely a cover for the true lesson being told. Its a story which forcasts the lifelong battle between our Earth and those who walk upon it. But even more meaningful, the battle every one of us fights each waking moment of our life deep inside as we struggle to find our place in this world.Each character in Mononoke Hime is facing these very same struggles. On one side we have those who want to improve themselves but feel it is necessary to destroy what is around them in order to achieve it. Then on the other side we have natures Gods which are fighting to preserve the origins of life but are laying blame on a single race when it is all who is at fault. Finally there is the man stuck between both, confused as to why they are fighting a war when they could simply just find a way to coexist.While simple at first glance, there is a lot of complexity to the movie in terms of morals and beliefs.

307,Luke-Walker,The greatest animated film - bar none,10,25 July 2002,"Continuing from the title, this also comes very close to becoming the greatest FILM of all time. Why is that? Because it has everything that makes cinema great. It is one of those rare gems whose total worth is greater that the sum of its individual parts. Every aspect of the movie words wonderfully together to make a sense of harmony that is unique to this film.The script masterfully works its strong characters around an amazing and epic story. If there is any fault to the story, is that it is TOO epic. So broad in scope and range it is, that even at a lengthy 133 minutes long it still feels like its running at breakneck speed. But this also means that there is never a dull moment in the whole picture. Every one of the hand drawn frames is a portrait to this amazing fantasy world. The creatures are animated with fluidity and grace, even when the intention is to make them clumsy and slow. The same can be said for the human characters, that while not looking incredibly life-like, have a marvellously distinct and interesting style.The voice acting is way above par for typical anime. The lip-synch was manipulated to fit the english soundtrack, and it works (like everything else in this movie) incredibly well. And the music? Pure bliss. It brings goose-bumps to my every time I hear it. Why it was not nominated for best original score at the oscars just goes to show the narrow scope the judges look to at that insult to cinematic awards.This is more than just a movie. It is a testament to how meaningful and great cinema can truly be. You will leave this movie feeling elated, inspired, and down-right entertained. For those that dont like this movie, fair enough, its an aquired taste.I call it good taste.",Princess Mononoke
308,janecamacho,An epic tale to remember...,10,31 July 2009,"Mononoke Hime (or Princess Mononoke) is one of those movies for which words are not enough, because its simply too beautiful to describe! As I'm writing this comment, I'm reminiscing on how I came to read of it for the first time, through a small review in a known movie magazine, where its critic wrote how the first ten minutes of Princess Mononoke were just breathtaking. That review stuck with me for some time, and was revived two years later as I went to the video store looking for something for my young brother (aged 11 at the time) to see in the weekend. To make a long story short: I was the one that end up watching it, at 2:00 o'clock on a Sunday morning. And what a surprise! I didn't knew who Hayao Miyazaki was, but I certainly got to Know him from that point on! The story is set in a fantasy like Japan, where the groundbreaking molding of iron was disputed by several feudal lords (and the emperor itself), and the forests were ruled by spirits and gods in the form of giant animal-beasts! In deed the first ten minutes of the movie are presented to us in over drive, as a former god turned demon rages in to the peaceful village of the Emishi tribe, leaving it to its prince, Ashitaka, to defend it . And so the movie gets started!In all of his previous movies Miyazaki had already presented us with the classical duel of Human versus Nature which is in the center stage here. The whole movie can be seen as a huge metaphor, exploring that very same theme, with characters depicting each side of the conflict_ Lady Eboshi and San _ that are everything but one dimensional characters, and can't be labeled as good or bad, as if Miyazaki is inviting us to make our own judgment about them; and of course there is Ashitaka, a fated prince that in his own search for peace of mind ends up being the leverage that tries to bring each side to a peaceful existence. In the end you are left in absolute awe, and questioning yourself how could such a masterpiece ever got to the finish line in one piece! Could it be the story and script on which Miyazaki labored for so long (story has it that he started developing the characters as far as thirteen years prior to the movie)? Is it the top notch cell animation technique, or the beautiful color with which the sceneries are depicted? Or is it the engaging musical score by Joe Hisaishi, that gives an epic feel to the movie as well as enhancing the more intimate side of it (I saw it yesterday and I'm still humming to every single tune there is in the movie)? Perhaps it's the sum of all in the end that make up for its magnificence and beauty. So if you are skeptical about such seriousness being presented in a fantasy-like animated movie don't be. Trust me! Just risk seeing the first minutes of the movie and you'll get hooked, for sure!",Princess Mononoke

310,jz02,Blew me away,10,10 June 2001,"Seeing as how this film has already been so heavily reviewed, I'll just keep this to being about my own reactions. I perfectly agree with whoever it was that said that it does not do the movie justice to describe it in words. You really have to see it to experience it. Aside form the phenomenal animation (equal if not better than Tarzan), amazing action sequences, the plot is just so amazing. I didn't even try to analyze it, I just absorbed the movie's message instinctively, and I cried during the scene where San fed Ashitaka (I almost never cry during movies). In many ways this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, certainly the best anime film I've ever seen. I seriously wish I knew Japanese, because I also got a feeling that they tuned down the dialog in the English version. The music was also great, especially the theme, very haunting but peaceful score. For me the movie was just incredibly emotional, I cried during the movie, and I cried after the movie. The ending was bittersweet.",Princess Mononoke

I would even go as far as to call it epic. It is beautifully animated and has a plot with a serious message, with brilliant, well drawn-out characters, each with their own unique personality. The climax of the film may freak some viewers out because of how, well bizarre it is. But all of Miyzakai's films are quite strange, but the idea is to simply forget about that and immerse yourself in the story and become one of the characters. Princess Mononoke is a film you will never forget, and I would recommend it even for people who dislike anime.",Princess Mononoke
313,lumpynose,ho hum,3,23 October 2002,After all of the raving I heard about this I was expecting a lot more. The characters weren't interesting and none of them made me care about them. The character development was weak.It seems to me that drama is hard to do with animation because they can't do as much with the facial expressions.  Perhaps it's too difficult to be subtle with animation (or anime).The story was only mildly interesting.  It didn't have any epic qualities about it.  The animation may have been great but these days with computers helping them it's hard to be impressed by mere glitz.The scene near the end with the forest spirit turning into a headless monster gave me the feeling I was watching an animated variation on the Godzilla theme.Very run-of-the-mill overall I'd say.,Princess Mononoke

And a glorious purpose at that. Though slightly violent, Princess Mononoke teaches a valuable lesson to all children who watch it, and should be placed on a pedestal with other films like Requiem for a Dream. While some may scoff that films can't teach life lessons, Princess Mononoke stands out with its healthy, wholesome, and beautifully crafted message to our next generation. However, while the message deserves to be heard by all, and should be required viewing at schools, the film still has some imperfections. Though I am not usually a stickler, the love aspect and lack of solid good/evil is both a strength and a weakness. Too many decisions are left unexplained, and too many characters experience too many changes too fast. Regardless of its faults, Princess Mononoke is a beautifully constructed film, and should be required to be shown to all children.",Princess Mononoke

I don't dislike Japan. I don't dislike any of the voice overs. I don't think I had ever heard of it until I saw it in the top 250 list the other day. I thought it was going to be mind blowing given all the accolades and rating. In the great words of Ron White: ""I was wrong!"". It was the most pathetically average thing ever. Boooring story. Waay to long. Average animation. It has all the stereotypical characters one would expect to find in a much older American cartoon making fun of Japanese stories... right down to Japanese sambo. Completely predictable. Not something you'd want your kids to see, and something your adult friends would scoff at. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. A 30 minute Family Guy remake would put this to shame.

This movie is the right movie at the right time, if not for us.I have seen a few times in both the Japanese and the English (Gillian Anderson is a surprisingly apropreate mother wolf voice) and still find this a breathtaking, complex and perfect piece of animation. Unlike so many North American animation piece, there are no 'evil enemies' and true, valient causes. Almost everyone is in some way a sypathetic character, which speaks of the powerful storytelling medium Animation can be when giving the right tale.Miyazaki is a true visionary, whos works deserve wider recognition in North America by the public in general.

320,neisesjason,Visually Stunning,10,22 January 2020,Hayao Miyazaki is as talented as it comes when your talking anime. His writing and the story telling in this movie is nothing short of spectacular. Animation is better than most today. Voice acting in this animated film is spot on.

I didn't really like them because they never seemed to take anything seriously. I always wanted something serious from the cartoons, because they were extremely stupid. This movie changed all that.One of my friends in school was telling me about this movie and I thought it sounded interesting. He let me borrow it and I instantly fell in love with it. Everything surprised me in this movie.First off it was extremely long. I mean it in a good way. That a movie over two hours can keep me entertained is something special. (Only movies that can do this are the LOTR trilogy) The art style also kept my attention. I have kind of liked anime art style, but it never seemed to take my breathe away. This movie did. The backgrounds were colorful and detailed, every character, no matter how small the role, had different facial features and depth.To finish this is the best anime ever. The only other anime that has almost held my attention like Princess Mononoke, was Spirited Away. If you like animes and you haven't seen this movie, it is a must.It's too bad I started out on the best anime ever made first.",Princess Mononoke
322,talkjawking100,One of the most beautiful films in cinema that can stick with you for the rest of your life.,10,3 February 2008,"For those who have never heard of this, or any of Hayao Miyazaki's works, please do yourself a favor and offer the courtesy of checking out his works.Forget everything you know about animation, if all you've experienced is the mind-numbing, lowest-common-denominator American money-maker cartoons. If you think all animated films are for kids (Disney films), or for very low-minded adults and teens (Adult Swim cartoons), prepare to be proved wrong. Hayao Miyazaki is a legend in animation that revolutionized the craft in his storytelling and imagery.Princess Mononoke is a film of a journey, of war and peace, of character perseverance, and of balance. Set in a mythological Japan, it tells the tale of a warrior on a journey to fulfill a destiny of which he doesn't know yet. He has to endure demons, villagers, warriors, and forest spirits, both good and bad. And Ashitaka, the hero, is a peaceful mind unlike any other seen in films. He never waivers between what's good or bad, and only has the intention of peace and prosperity between all living things.Before you go thinking this is a preachy medieval warfare yada-yada film you've seen a thousand times before, please trust me in that this film still deserves a viewing to even those with no immediate interest.First, a warning. Ignore everything negative you've heard about this movie. I'm not saying this as a ""fanboy"" who gets irate when people give negative reviews on stuff I love, but because this film simply deserves a chance. It took me 3 times of seeing this before it overtook me and I fell in love with it.So what makes this film so amazing, anyway? First of all, the obvious: the writer/director and animator: Hayao Miyazaki. Known for revolutionizing the animation world with his non-conventional children's films (Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away), this is his most mature film, and I don't just mean in terms of content. Yes, this film is PG- 13, violent, and probably not meant for the younger kids, but it's beside the point. The story is dark and deeply personal. Miyazaki had stated that after all his more family-friendly films were out, this was the film he felt ""he just had to make"". And there is an air of deep seriousness that comes with this film that's hard to miss.Please remember this, most of all: Miyazaki's films ARE NOT ANIME. Let me repeat: MIYAZAKI DOES NOT MAKE ANIME FILMS. The number one prejudice people will have going into his works will be their view on the strange, typical ""Anime"" world and their views on it. I am NOT an Anime fan, I'm generally neutral towards it. A few shows are entertaining, and one or two films, but I would never consider myself a fan. Miyazaki is completely different in style, animation, texture and story. The one thing that angers more than anything are the people who bash this film because they don't like Anime. I beg of everyone who hasn't seen this film to take that into consideration.Miyazaki's paints a world like no one has ever seen, and always beautiful and fascinating. But what really brings his films to life is the music. Half of what makes his films so beautiful is the score of Joe Hisaishi, perhaps the most gifted musician in movies of all time. His music is intriguing, mysterious and impossible to look past. With films like this, I get to thinking his music was made for Miyazaki, and Miyazaki's films were made for Hisaishi. They balance each other perfectly and work marvelously.Now, many people may not think much of this film the first time they see it, and I was no exception. I was a huge Miyazaki fan already when I saw it for the first time, and I was expecting to love this the same. But the first time I saw it, my feelings were neutral. So a few months went by, and I decided to give this another try. The same thing. It didn't strike me. So another few months go by, and another whim comes over me to give it one last shot. And it finally worked. I was swept away in the story for the first time, and it overtook me.So if you see the film once and are not immediately in love with it, you may just need to try it again in due time. But please, don't think that I'm trying to make you feel that something's wrong with you if you don't like it. I know some people just won't like it, and some people even strongly dislike it. This review is my opinion and love of the film, and I'm just trying to do my part to help other people have their lives enriched like mine has been.All in all, Princess Mononoke is one of the most amazing films ever made. Easily, it's probably the most well-made animated film, but the animation world aside, this film conquers a HIGH percentage of all films and sets a mark on all cinema. The sad thing is it will most likely be ignored because, A, it's Japanese, B, it's highly unknown, and C, it's marked as ""Anime"" and will probably never go past that categorization.But at least take some of these many dragged on comments I have made into consideration if you haven't seen it. Most of you may be let down by it after reading how much I have praised it, but if there's at least a few who are affected by it as I have been, than I will live that much more in content.

326,LadyKanerasoka,Miyazaki's Absolute Best Work,10,5 June 2021,"I've been wanting to see this film for many years after hearing that numerous elements in this film served as the inspiration for other numerous elements in Star Wars, particularly the famous character Ahsoka Tano from the animated series and The Mandalorian and the Loth-wolves in the final season of Star Wars Rebels. But when I finally saw this film through HBO Max, I was TOTALLY unprepared for just how epic and extraordinary this film was. This film covers over the endless issue of mankind struggling to get along with nature, but is presented in a way that will DEFINITELY make you think twice before littering or doing something disrespectful to a nearby forest. Not only that, it takes hand-drawn animation to a WHOLE new level. The backgrounds and environments, even for an animated film, are absolutely beautiful and breathtaking, especially if you're a nature lover. Many of the forest spirits presented in the film are based on actual Japanese mythology (you can look it up through videos on YouTube). The English dub has a great all-star cast including Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett Smith, John DiMaggio, and more. It's also one of the longest films in the Studio Ghibli collection, so be sure to find a good pausing point. Also, since it's the ONLY Studio Ghibli film that is rated PG-13, you better think twice before letting young kids watch it. There's an EXTENSIVE amount of animated blood, and some scenes presenting it are pretty disturbing (even for me, a 29-year-old woman). There's also quite a lot of violence involving samurai techniques, using cannons and guns at the heroes, and in the battle scenes numerous characters on both sides are dismembered and even beheaded, but they're not presented in a terribly gruesome way, otherwise the film would've been rated R. But like I said, I'd advise extreme caution when it comes to letting kids watch it. Other than that, it's an absolute work of art that will take your breath away and keep your eyes glued to the screen. An absolute must watch!",Princess Mononoke
327,Kore-O,One of the most epic Animes of all time.,9,22 December 2005,"Based on old Japanese mythology and folklore, in ages past, Mononoke-Hime, tells the tail of the young prince, Ashitaka, who in the beginning of the film confronts a vicious demon. Even though he defeated the demon, he was cursed. To try and save himself, he decided to travel west, to try and lift the curse, so he wouldn't die. And that is the beginning of Hayao's biggest masterpiece, Mononoke-Hime is about. Though it also has tons of other themes as well. It's a movie with a very strong point and very solid believable characters. You will truly want to care about, what happens to them.The movie is full of action, beautiful hand drawn and colorful animation as well as stunning music and excellent voice acting. Of course, the Japanese voices are far superior to the English one, based on my personal preference. One of the things that Mononoke does best, is to tell the story in an epic way. We get to see animal gods and different points of view, from one conflict, without it seeming childish or stupid. This movie, is of my all time favorites. You just have to watch it. It's a true work of art. A hallmark in Animation and movies in general.9/10",Princess Mononoke
328,trenttuttl,A return to epics,10,22 July 2019,"Miyazaki makes his return to creating epics with this film. While I can't say I like it more than ""Nausicaä,"" I can definitely understand why this film was as popular and successful as it was.Let me just say though, it's probably Miyazaki's darkest, and most pessimistic, film. Severed heads, severed limbs, and a surprising amount of blood amd gore are featured in the film. No problem with this really, but it can be shocking coming off films like, ""My Neighbor Totoro.""Miyazaki counters this pessimism with his usual happy ending though, and it makes great use of his two major themes. Love, and respect for nature. In fact, the respect for nature theme may come off as heavy-handed for some, but it never bothered me.The film also has a wonderful English dub. A classic for a reason! Check it out!",Princess Mononoke
329,Nifune,Transcendence over conflict,10,1 November 2018,"""Nature vs. Human"" is one of the central topics of this film. What many people misunderstand is that, however, this ""human"" (symbolized by ""Jigo"") includes most of the ordinary people in the world who live in a wood-made house, drive a car exhausting gas, and use plastic-made goods, not only the hopeless money-driven people who typically make a golf-course by cutting woods.From the bird's viewpoint, modern capitalism or neoliberalism is coherently and thoroughly criticized, for San (Princess Mononoke) symbolizing ""nature"" is consistently not compatible with ""human"" until the end. Ashitaka intends to reconcile ""nature"" and ""human"", but unfortunately, his way is to accept the conflict and discrepancy of them with his endless struggle. So the dog-god Moro strictly advised him to ""live"" beforehand.In the mid '90s, a continuous economic decline, ""lost 25 years"", were just beginning in Japan when people committing suicide were increasing in the locked-up feeling. On the other hand, people who lived in the Muromachi era around 500 years ago always deliberated their views of life and death facing daily deaths. The strong and catchy message of this film, ""survive"", thus having a double meaning, must be widely accepted 20 years ago.After 20 years still in the economic decline and left behind the global economy, Japan rather seems to recover its harmony with nature and human or anti-capitalism compared to that time. So far partly and still fashionable though, no golf and no cars, increase in young people loving more rural areas than urban ones, development of ecosystem such as electric cars, the advent of minimalism and sharing economy... probably these new trends would be life sprouts after their economic death as if caused by Shishi-gami!",Princess Mononoke
330,deepcheck,"a fantastic ride, Miyazaki's best to date",10,1 February 2000,"Miyazaki has had a long history of amazingly deep and thought-provoking movies with, nonetheless, very simple themes.  ""Tonari no Totoro"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" are prime examples.  His characters are often tastefully understated and normal human beings, in terms of their character. Unlike the typical US-ported anime movie, Miyazaki's films contain none of the stereotypes of anime, such as the big-breasted, small-brained woman, the enormous weapons, and the bad guys who are always Americans.  Instead, his films are dignified by the relentless observation to the rich detail of the animation and fullness of the soundtrack. ""Mononoke Hime"" is no exception.  Or rather, it is the exception in that it surpasses entirely all of Miyazaki's movies to become his finest.  The animation, the music, and the voice-acting were all masterfully done.  Even the American-dubbed version was very well adapted.  The plot was convoluted in content but simple in nature, which successfully emphasized the individuality of each of the major characters. This is the movie to see, however you see it.  I've always judged a movie by whether I could forget I was watching a movie and let myself fall into the story.  With Mononoke Hime, I fell in by the end of the first five minutes.",Princess Mononoke

Ashitaka and San are my favorite protagonists in arguably any Ghibli film. As a nature lover, this was a really impactful film for me that inspires me in a way that extends beyond cinema.

It's fantasy but gives you the feeling it could have actually been our world in the past. I know some grown men who refuse to see it because of the word ""Princess"" in the title e.g. The Princess Bride, and makes them think it's a little girls movie worth skipping. It is not. It's a timeless classic for all ages and genders. You will love it. 10/10",Princess Mononoke

There is a great valuable message this great creation conveys to us

334,delta3002,Touching,10,17 February 2003,"(May contain spoilers) This is not one of your typical cartoons. This is a movie about a young man named Ashitaka. In the early parts of the movie a demon boar attacks his village. He fights off the demon but is touched by it causing him to have a curse. He finds that the curse will spread like a disease and kill him. At the same time the curse gives him superhuman strength and agility. (Shown by him pushing open a huge door, that would take ten men to open normally, Inspite of a bullet wound) He tries to find a way to cure himself or at least do some good before he dies. Now that is one of the plots. The others include a man looking for a God's head in order to gain eternal life, a woman running an iron making town who is constantly being opposed by other men and the very forces of nature, and a girl raised by a wolf god who tries to protect the forest from the miners. Put Ashitaka in the middle to try and make peace and you've got one of the most excellent animated films ever made. Although the fantasy and bloody violence the movie has a background message that everyone deserves to live no matter how intent they are on destroying their antagonists. The film has an excellent score, incredible animation (especially considering the scenery), very rounded characters, and a wonderful theme to top it off. The only part that is disappointing is the dialogue in the last few minutes of the film is cheesy. Inspite of the small flaw near the end i give this movie an 8.5 /10.",Princess Mononoke

336,ccasey-1,visually stunning; spotty English-version voice talent,6,12 September 2005,"This is perhaps Miyazaki's most visually stunning artwork. The visuals alone are worth viewing. The Nightwalker is particularly magical. Unfortunately, that's the best part. The moral carried throughout the storyline focuses on the battle between the natural environment and human's development of the environment; good enough so far. However, some of the English-version voice talent is lacking to awful. Billy Bob Thornton, to put it flatly, sucks. His voice doesn't fit the character and his delivery is annoying from the get-go. Every time is character appears, I cringe. Almost as bad are the anonymous voice characterizations of evil creatures. Its as if the talent were taken off the street, paid $50, then in post-production some cheesy sound effects were added to make the voice sound ""scary"". Simply awful! The voice talent is nearly saved by Jada Pinkett Smith's London-inflected, accurate characterization (I hope I got the correct actress). In the end though, it's the visuals that make this a movie worth watching, at least once.",Princess Mononoke
337,kashifmeh-925-29262,Nice but could be better,7,27 December 2020,I really liked the animation and the overall story concept as well as the main protagonist. However it was marred by a confusing story line and an unsatisfying ending.What was most confusing as to why Ashitashi was supporting the Lady right till the end even though she was the one causing the most havoc. It is good that he wanted peace but he was all over the place and I am not sure whether he helped or hindered.There was also too many tribes / clans in the story with no background to help the viewer understand how they overall fit / are relevant.,Princess Mononoke
338,danbranan,"NOT the ""Star Wars of animated features""",7,24 May 2016,"No matter what the New York Post said about it (as is recorded on many of the DVD editions of the film), this is definitely not the pinnacle of animated films, nor even of Miyazaki's own work. I really, really wanted to like this film more than I did. I am a big fan of Miyazaki and this is supposed to be his masterpiece, but I'm just not able to go that far in my own assessment of it. It was complex, and beautifully animated (as you expect from Miyazaki), but it left me a bit hollow. Part of it was the incredible violence in the film (NOT for children under 13, IMO), and part of it was hearing Billy Bob Thornton's drawl as the voice of Jigo, but a big part of my reluctance to rate this film more highly is that it felt a bit like Miyazaki was reaching for something that he had already grasped. I think he addressed almost identical themes in a much better way in Nausicaa. Princess Mononoke seemed uncharacteristically ""preachy"" and heavy-handed, in contrast with Miyazaki's generally subtle style. I know it's super popular and has a stellar reputation, but I just can't recommend it when there are so many other great works available from this true Artist of Anime.",Princess Mononoke
339,PhoebeDay,Interesting Watch,6,19 October 2016,"I have to admit - the idea of this movie was a little too bizarre for me. Characters like a giant boar and a wolf god was kind of what set me off. I did enjoy the animation, however, and the meaning of the movie was great. The idea of nature versus the human world does tie the whole movie together and makes it rather enjoyable. There's a good message to be taken away from the entire movie. I do think that if anyone is a fan of anime or overall a strong animal presence in a film they will enjoy this movie. The female characters have extreme strength as well which is a nice change of pace from several other films. If you enjoy a strong female presence as well this is the film for you.",Princess Mononoke
340,tomfry-10237,Miyazaki's Fantasy Wonder,9,8 May 2019,"Hayao Miyazaki isn't a name synonymous with fantasy epics grand and aggressive such as the Lord of The Rings, yet in a pleasant twist of fate it appears as if the renowned director has yet another genre wrapped around his finger, intertwining a vast yet personal epic with a profound message for the younger viewer in 1997's 'Princess Mononoke'.Suffering a cursed injury, Ashitaka, the last Emishi prince of the Emishi village, finds himself on a journey Westward bound to try and find a cure for his ever-worsening ailment. Along the way we meet a colourful cast of characters including the titular Princess Mononoke (San) and her band of wolves.Venturing into the wild Ashitaka discovers a town destroying the land around them, the home of the wolves, in order to develop iron, growing exponentially in power and wealth. Should this trope sound familiar to you it would be for good reason. For many years the issue of defamation of the natural world for the prosperity of humanity has been a frequently touched upon issue, yet from the get-go the beauty in this film is in its initial reluctance, and then outright refusal to take a side.The destructive mentality of the people of the ironworks is merely a community attempting to find its place in the world; they destroy to prevent themselves from being destroyed (as it is established clearly they are not the most powerful force in this world). They destroy in fear of being destroyed, in many ways a reflection of the aggressive animals they kill rather than a binary opposition. Following this train of thought, even the animals are not without fault. The forest is divided into tribes of different species, and amongst them it is clear that there is conflict. They bicker and fight all in a desperate bid to survive, much the reflection of ourselves.This conflict is centralised through our connection to Ashitaka whom from the first scenes retains a clear reverence for nature, smiling and gazing in wonder at its otherworldly beauty. He acts as us, the everyman, looking on in horror as two worlds that he adores and is familiar with crash together In fire and blood, a desperate bid for survival where no survival is guaranteed. He fits his role very well and plays off San well also, however if I did have one flaw with the film it would be that: in earlier scenes he seems to develop a connection with San that is only apparent to them and doesn't translate to the audience very well (yet one could always argue that the reason for this is as what they represent thematically usurps what they represent in emotional connection.)Speaking of fire and blood, this is by far one of the most unexpectedly violent Studio Ghibli films I have ever laid eyes on. From the first scene blood is abundant, limbs are lost and death reins over the land. However, unexpected as it threw me, out of place it was not. The violence perfectly reflects the theme previously mentioned; the disarray of the conflict at the centre of the film between the growth of industry and nature, senseless and heart-breaking.This profound melancholy surrounding the theme yet contrasts itself with joyous human moments sprinkled throughout the film in romance, friendship etc. all heightened by a mesmerising score and Ghibli's signature rich vibrant visuals, which both make the world we're exploring feel full, truly living and breathing.Princess Mononoke is a film which takes risks, hovering in-between the side of nature's right to rule and the roaring progress of industrialisation, yet never wavering in its resolve. It knows that the issue isn't black and white, with dynamic elements frequently affecting the actions of both man and beast, with violence resulting from confusion, and a sense of pensive grief hanging over the film. Through all this conflict, neither side overcomes in the end, with the beauty of life itself being the true victory, a truly profound message for both children and adults alike.",Princess Mononoke
341,sickboy-11,the IMDB needs to introduce a new rating scale because of this movie,10,24 November 1999,"Being a long-time fan of studio Ghibli, i already expected Princess Mononoke to be an excellent film..but it was entirely foolish of me to expect something like Kiki's delivery service or even Laputa on a more epic scale.To say that Princess Mononoke is on an epic scale is a vast understatement, and that is regards to the animation, the story, the statement on man's inability to co-exist with nature, and Miyazaki's brilliant and vibrant imagination. I only seen the film a couple of hours ago and i am still even speechless to an extent, but i am of the realization that even for non-anime fans, Princess Mononoke (Hime) is possibly the greatest animated (or even non-animated for that matter) film of all time. it is a complete, thought provoking treasure that i will be sure to see multiple times, and multiple viewings are required to take in the complete bombardment of symbolism.
In closing i would like to say that this movie effortlessly receives a 10 out of a 10 and Hayao Miyazaki is truly the world's last visionary in existance. Go see it immediately, even if it involves driving for an hour or so (its worth it)",Princess Mononoke
342,GDC,Disney left in the dust,10,8 November 1999,"Not only better than anything you're likely to see from the Disney school of factory filmworks, but quite possibly THE best animated film ever made. The sheer imagination, artistry, and detail in every frame of this work is breathtaking.  I applaud Miramax for leaving the American release unedited, both for length and content.  The voices are a mixed bag; Danes and Crudup are adequate; nothing any competent voice-actor couldn't have pulled off. Thornton's southern accent, though he tries to coneal it, is a bit distracting set among the visuals of historical Japan.  Minnie Driver and Gillian Anderson are both quite good, however.  For fans of Miyazaki, the brilliance of this film will not come as a shock, but for everyone else, it should be quite an eye-opener.  Just don't take your children expecting a Happy Meal cross-over with cute sidekicks and musical numbers.",Princess Mononoke
343,veed_santos,Humanity...for the good and for the bad.,8,17 April 2010,"One of those movies you don't see every day, month or year. The story is simple, modest and at the same time, groundbreaking and epic for its mix of reality and fantasy (actually the premise is very similar to Nausicaa's). The characters are also very simple. However you can't help but sympathize with them, even with the antagonists, each one of them is unique, well developed and with its own fundamented and reasonable goal. The visuals are simply stunning, I will go and say: the best the 90's anime have seen. This movie will entertain you and make you think, there's a lot more to it than gods, demons, ecological messages, smooth and violent action sequences or beautiful emotional scenes. Watch how every character's action in this story can affect everyone and everything around them.",Princess Mononoke

All Hayao's films are tho since he takes a very long time on each project. I do love stories about Japanese gods, demons, spirits, and curses which is all in this movie! This is a must watch movie for all anime fans!",Princess Mononoke
346,elidirkx,It still makes me cry.,10,5 May 2010,"In ancient times, the land lay covered in forests, where, from ages long past, dwelt the spirits of the gods. Back then, man and beast lived in harmony, but as time went by, most of the great forests were destroyed. Those that remained were guarded by gigantic beasts who owed their allegiances to the Great Forest Spirit, for those were the days of gods and of demons.About 9 years ago, I saw this film for the first time in my life.My mind was pounded very harshly. With my only experience with manga or animé having been Dragon Ball Z and Pokémon, yes. It was definitely different. What struck me most about this was the sincere tone in which they handled the entire film. No exaggerated humour, no pop culture references.We open with a brief narration, after which we see a young prince of the Emishi tribe, Ashitaka, defend his village against a former boar turned demon.His arm receives a terrible curse, and he is to travel to the West to there see, with eyes unclouded by hatred, what caused this beast, that cursed him, to go mad.Riding his red elk, on the way he meets many figures among which being a monk named Jigo, a ruler named Eboshi who harvests iron for the sake of melting it into bullets so as to be able to expand her territory, and a mysterious girl who has sided with the wolves of that same territory.Each of these parties clash against one another often, while Ashitaka only wishes to stop the fighting, as demonstrated in a beautiful scene where he brutally interrupts a battle in the middle of an entire crowd.He seems to figure his own need to cure his own curse is irrelevant compared to the sake of ridding the present society of its own diseases.I feel no need to disclose any further details. Do yourself a favour. Watch this film. Watch it again. And again. Do it in an endless loop, if you will. I can almost guarantee it is highly unlikely that this one would ever get old.It could seem like an environmental message in disguise, but don't you dare fool yourself! It's truly much deeper than just that.It has never failed to make me cry. And I suspect it will always succeed at just that.",Princess Mononoke
347,rebecky14,This movie is the reason I love anime,10,6 June 2012,"I first watched Princess Mononoke a year ago, when a friend of mine recommended it to me. I'd never really liked anime, but I gave it a shot anyway, because it looked interesting. Within in the first twenty minutes, I was hooked. The story takes place in an old-style Japan setting. It's about a young prince in a village called Ashitaka. One day he fights and kills a boar demon that was threatening to destroy his village, but in the process he is gravely wounded with a dangerous curse. The curse fills him with hatred; pain, a lust for violence, all this as it also slowly starts to kill him. Shunned by his village, he is forced to leave and search for a cure for the curse. He goes on a journey to the far-off mountains where the boar demon supposedly came from, hopeful for a solution to his problem. When he gets there, he discovers a town that is mining from the mountains and the surrounding forest, but they're slowly destroying the forest and all the creatures that live there. While staying in the village, it's attacked by a pack of wolves and a young girl called San, who lives with and was raised by the wolves. They're defending the forest and all the creatures that live in it, especially the magnificent forest spirit, which the villagers plan to kill in order to destroy the forest. Ashitaka decides to stop the villagers from killing the forest spirit because he knows the forest is sacred and beautiful, but he wants to avoid violence at all costs. Princess Mononoke has the title of being both the first anime film I ever saw, and also one of my favorite anime films of all time. The artwork and animation is gorgeous; the landscapes are beautiful and vast, the forests simply amazing, the characters excellently designed and the violent yet incredible battle scenes are drawn attentively, down to the last, tiny detail. For some anime movies or TV shows, I've noticed the English dub is poor compared to the original Japanese audio, but in this movie the English dub might even be better. The voices match the characters very well, even though they're speaking in American accents.The music is part of my main love for this movie. As a musician, I often listen more keenly than others to the background music for movies or TV shows. And I can say this movie has one of the best original scores I've ever heard. The music is oriental in style, as can be expected of an anime film, but the main thing I love about it is because it sounds so different to any other piece of music I've heard. With some American movies, the music is very dramatic and beautiful (think Lord Of The Rings), but it's still undeniably film music because it's predictable in parts. However, with Princess Mononoke, the music was unpredictable, but still brilliant, almost to the point of sounding like a piece of real classical music. The music suits every situation perfectly; it blends into the scenes so well that it almost seems to become part of that scene. In summary, Princess Mononoke is an absolutely brilliant movie, and one that should not be missed. I know that Spirited Away is considered the best of the Studio Ghibli films, but personally, I enjoyed Princess Mononoke more. It's darker, richer in music, artwork and is more adult than Spirited Away. It's one of the best animated films I've ever seen.",Princess Mononoke
348,SolidSnake86XX,One of Miyazaki's Best,10,28 September 2003,"This movie was it for me.  I am a huge fan of anything Japanese, and this movie has played a big role in perpetuating that.  It's such an amazing work of art.  This movie follows a young warrior-prince named Ashitaka in feudal Japan who sets off to find a cure for a curse he incurred by defending his village from a demon.  It explores how humanity's seemingly harmless sins, greed most prominent among them, can snowball into atrocious acts of shockingly great magnitudes.  I advise anyone and everyone to see this. Disregard the fact that it's animated; Japanese animation has proven time and again that characters drawn on a piece of paper have no less depth than that of one portrayed by a live actor.  Princess Mononoke remains one of my favorite movies.",Princess Mononoke

I've watched this for more than 2 times, and what I've found out was that more and more I watch, more and more meanings I've found from this movie.After watching this, and while watching this I really had lots of thoughts of what is good and what is bad. In one person's view, something might be bad, but other might think that it is good. It had great lesson of people having different views of justice.This movie was very deep and really fun. It showed great views of human and animals. I really loved the ending of how everything that was destroyed recovered.The reason why this movie is one of my best movie is because it has great deep meaning behind just a kid movie. I guess this is the strongest skill of Miyazaki.I strongly recommend for people to watch this because I feel like there's lots to learn from here.",Princess Mononoke

351,DiggiDoodle,A Lesson Well Appreciated,10,26 January 2021,"I went into this film completely unknowing of what I was in for, as I have with all Studio Ghibli films watched so far, and I'm telling you it is one of the best things I decided on doing with series and movies alike.With this said, I found Princess Mononoke to be nothing short of an absolute masterpiece. Every element surrounding this film was wholesomely and remarkably captured, from the beautiful artwork, which falls nothing short of artistically visionary, to the variance of realistic characters, which leave you appreciating and/or regretting your choices of them throughout. Along with the overall musical score, environmental atmosphere, and masterfully structured consistency throughout, the film leaves you contemplating as to how selfish and severe our impact towards nature truly is.Princess Mononoke never fell short once and encouraged me to exercise my entire emotional vocabulary in only a 2 hour time period, leaving me in awe as to how surreal a story can be. Hayao Miyazaki's direction, together with Joe Hisaishi's scoring + all staff involved, did everything justice when telling this story and truly hit home once the overall message was realized.",Princess Mononoke

""Mononoke"" is a visually-impressive film, with smooth animation, superb attention to lifelike movement and detail, and sympathetic characters who are never reduced to chest-beating heroes or cackling villains, but three-dimensional people with both good and bad qualities and believable motivations.  Like much of Miyazaki's better-known works, it's an engaging story about Man's struggle against Nature, with a poignant message that shines through the plot rather than becoming preachy.  This movie has all the technical excellence of movies such as ""Akira"" and ""Ghost In The Shell,"" but also has the soul that those two movies lack.  While the original Japanese-language version is excellent on its own, the English dub is one of the best treatments I've heard in translated anime.  All of the big-name voice actors do wonderful jobs - even Billy Bob Thornton's rendition of the monk, while completely different from the tone of the original Japanese casting, is well-done and fitting for the character.

I thought Princess Mononoke was way overrated.After seeing the American cast, I was going to give this movie a shot. I did and was just bored. The dialogue just felt so stale.

356,bavski-knovril,Don't be put off by the whole 'princess' thing.,9,20 March 2009,"Most of my male anime-fanatic friends avoid this film like the plague because it has the word 'princess' in the title, urging connotations of pink jewelled wands and plastic long-haired horses. If this applies to you take note: -It's about a girl who was brought up by giant wolves and spends every waking hour coming up with plots to savagely kill her nemesis.-The other main character, Ashitaka, kills a giant demon-boar thing and his arm gets possessed by the evil from given off by the demon which will ultimately consume his whole body and kill him, but gives him a sort of super-power until then which causes the arrows he shoots to dismember almost everyone they hit.-At one point in the film there is a blind boar the size of a house who's thirst for human blood is not extinguished even when he is pouring his own blood out of every orifice.Knucklehead appeal aside, by the end of this movie you will probably empathise with many of the lead characters - Mononoke: the savage wolf-girl, Ashitaka: the demon-possessed country bumpkin with a heart of gold, and even Eboshi: the woman who shoots iron bullets at everything that moves, but who hides a soft spot for lepers...Oh, and the visuals are beautiful, and Joe Hisaishi's soundtrack is awe-inspiring. Highly recommended",Princess Mononoke
357,artificeprime,My favourite Ghibli Film and one of the best animated films of all time,10,4 November 2013,"I have seen every Ghibli film and almost every major animated film. Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the very best. The soundtrack is perfection, the characters are complex and sincere, and the themes are strong without coming off as preachy. It is extremely rare to find animated movies that present a fair and balanced view of the conflicts within the story. Most animated movies tend to paint the world in black and white, good and evil. Princess Mononoke does an amazing job of addressing the issues of human kind's struggle to live in balance with nature. Every character has a philosophy and viewpoint that is understandable. The plot is mature and complex while still easy to follow and understand. On top of the excellent characters and story, the animation, designs and visuals are all great. Like all Ghibili's movies, the visual presentation is top notch but unlike many of the other Ghibli movies this one is darker in style and in its content. There is a lot of violence and blood in this movie but it is never overdone, everything that happens is relevant to the story and fits perfectly within the context of what is happening. Young children might find it frightening but the content should be acceptable for older children.For those who enjoy Ghibli movies, this is a must see and in my opinion the very best the studio has done (which is saying a lot). Even for those who don't normally enjoy animated movies I would still recommend this one. Its maturity and depth make it stand out among even the best animated movies out there.",Princess Mononoke
358,MrPunch,Beautiful Masterpiece,10,4 May 2006,"There is almost competition to ""one-up"" each other in reviews, trying to find new and greater hyperbole. But the fact is that two simple words describe this movie: Beautiful, and Masterpiece.Both words get thrown around and it tends to cheapen them, but they are the best words to describe this film. Here the master craftsman has created his greatest piece (amazingly equaled by his next, Spirited Away). And it is beautiful.The story reaches the viewer on many levels... forcing one to see each of the many points of view conflicting the story. The Forest Gods are dying off as the Iron Age takes over, as it must. Do they go to war because they have no hope, or because they must? The Iron Town must destroy the Forest Gods and use the environment if the people are to prosper in the evolving civilization. Do they kill because they are defending their way of life, just as the Forest Gods are? The Emperor wants eternal life, something that only the head of the Great Forest Spirit can give. Aren't the bounty hunters looking to kill the Great Forest Spirit just doing their jobs? In the end, war only brings death, and nobody is satisfied with what it brings. Only through co-operative rebuilding will anyone prosper. That is the final message. And it is beautiful.",Princess Mononoke

361,BuzzardHawk,Top notch animé,10,24 March 2001,"It is all too often the case that outside of Japan, the animation genre is typecast as being strictly for kids. Also, when animé does come to the West, it is often bastardised by the studios that bring them to the English-speaking market, through heavy re-editing, thereby disjointing the story line, and amateurish dubbing. ""Sailor Moon"" is a case in point.Princess Mononoke is a definite exception. The dubbing is on par with the original Japanese dialogue (although for a more authentic feel, you should check out the sub-titled version) courtesy of top writer Neil Gaiman, and the animation surpasses even Japanese standards.The animation and voices are just half of what makes this film whole. The story line, although slightly complex, does not have the formulaic good-versus-evil scenario. It sends a message that nature is about understanding, rather than taming, it. And the characters are three-dimensional to boot.Hopefully, Princess Mononoke will be the catalyst for the animé genre as a whole to reach a much wider audience. This is definitely animé for the non-animé viewer.On a final note, Princess Mononoke was rated 'PG' by the censors in New Zealand. Personally, I think it should have been rated 'M', since there are various battle scenes involving gore.",Princess Mononoke
362,Trev,A great work of art,10,23 October 2001,"I consider this as one of the great movies of the century.  The way the story progresses through a series of contradictions (visual and script wise) is worthy of Kurosawa.It may take some time, but I can imagine this film making its way onto the film studies curricula as an example of how profound and timeless topics can be presented through film (note, ""film"", not animation).",Princess Mononoke
363,Jason60,Interesting,5,4 February 2001,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this film.  I love the style of anime art, but sometimes the stories are quite strange.  So in this movie you bring in Disney to help out.  I had read the reviews online saying that this is the greatest anime ever, its not.  It's ok, very watchable.  I expected a more western plot line considering Disney was involved.  It was not.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  But the story was strange.  No more stranger than any other anime but still strange.  The art was pretty, but the four part Macross Plus series is still the best animated Japanese toon I have seen to date.  I liked Mononoke, but didn't think it was a wonderful movie.  The story was a bit lacking, and and the art work was not what everyone is making it out to be.  I have seen better.  I did find it funny though that Disney doesn't want to associate themselves with this cartoon here in America.  Apparently they are afraid it will hurt their image.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 5 for plot, and an 7 for art.",Princess Mononoke

366,mohitshh,Great movie with a great message,9,20 July 2014,"I have heard a lot about this movie but never got the chance to watch it. Over the years it slipped right through my to-watch list and then one day I stumbled upon this title on IMDb and finally decided to see it.The movie is an excellent piece of art and has a lot of underlying meanings to it. It is about a village prince Ashitaka who gets cursed while saving his village from a demon. On his journey to find the dear god who will be able to heal the curse he comes across a village named iron-town led by Lady Eboshi. Eboshi is set out to destroy the deer god so that she can take over the forest for iron mining. The animal tribes of the forest are trying protect the forest. Princess Mononoke aka San has been brought up by the wolf tribe and is fighting the humans to save the forest.Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of this war and tries to see everything with unclouded eyes. He is able to see the suffering as well as good in both sides. His heart is wedded to San the first time he sees her and wants to have a life with her in peace. He tries to make everyone see that they can live together in harmony and tries to help both sides every time he gets an opportunity. He is the true definition of what a hero should be like.This movie is the story of human civilization itself and how we have recklessly destroyed nature for our needs and more often than not for our greed. This movie is an appeal to everyone to see with unclouded eyes and reason for themselves why we cannot live at peace with nature.There is one line in the film that ""to want everything between heaven and hell is the human nature"". Well Ashitaka is the person who proves this is not the case and there is still some good left in humanity.I have truly enjoyed watching this film and would surely recommend it for anyone who wants to experience something different and innovative.",Princess Mononoke
367,nedatronics,rare eye opener,9,10 June 2008,"This movie was not only brilliant in the cinematic sense, it was also a story telling masterpiece. It completely changed my perception of Japanese/based animes and brought me to a whole new cinematographic experience that i had been missing. I rented Mononoke with much skepticism but i found the title after searching IMDb top 100 best films...it rated the highest among the animated genre.True to its rating, it was extremely wonderful as there was not a dull moment in the film. I was literally glued to the screen of the not-so-predictable storyline as we have come to expect of many Hollywood makes. Mononoke achieves the ability to connect with the viewer intimately. It is action filled, emotionally drenched and with an awesome storyline. Despite the fact that i watched the Japanese version with English subtitles, i think it would be safe to say that this would be the best way to view the film to achieve its full effect.This movie has marked a turnaround point for me in reference to my perception of anime and with due effect, i will search for the all the top rated anime films that i can get.""Let us live together(forest and man)""",Princess Mononoke
368,FogelNo1,"Separates the men of fine film from the boys of ""mere anime""",9,17 September 2002,"There are two ways to look at this film...from the eyes of an anime lover, and the eyes of a film lover. Frankly, I'll choose the latter viewpoint, as I find most anime to be petty, and meaninglessly cerebral. Hayao Miyazaki has truly inherited Disney's talent with the art of animated film, but his style is his own, and his technique, different, but just as good as the deceased master. Mononoke Hime stands not only as a masterpiece of animation, but a masterpiece of Japanese film...a grand, enticing epic which does its own thing, standing up to the epic films of Kurosawa and David Lean. This goes beyond simple anime, and tells a simple story with mind-blowing, beautiful technique. The only anime that tops it is Grave of the Fireflies, Isao Takahata's masterpiece...the only anime I'd consider in my Top Five of Japanese cinema (Seven Samurai, Ikiru, Sansho the Bailiff, Tokyo Story, Rashomon).",Princess Mononoke

Pretty darn bloody, including decapitation.) 10/10.",Princess Mononoke
370,dadaredevil,long live Miazaki and Studio Ghibli!,10,26 May 2003,"i already commented on this movie, but I gotta do it once more. This is probably Miazakis most violent film, rightfully earning it's pg-13 rating. Although this is not Miazakis best movie (comes close, beaten by spirited away and castle in the sky, just above totoro, and soars above kiki, which i didnt like) it is still quite good. It is well paced, and the music is pretty good, though compared to laputa, it falls on it's face. Some people say that the plot is complex, but whats so complex? I mean, some guy goes out of the village after getting cursed by a boar to look for a cure from the forest spirit, and gets caught in this war between the forest gods and the humans. Ooohh, it's too complex. That cleared out, it's a very nice movie, with a powerful message to the world. My favorite scene is the one with the wolf god Maro, and Ashitaka in the cave/mountain argueing if San will die in the war. quite stirring, though not in the cryig type of way.10/10 Hey, it's Ghibli!",Princess Mononoke

372,Justin-r-bates,Superb Storytelling Meets Breathtaking Animation,8,11 October 2014,"Princess Mononoke is the brilliant epic of a young prince, Ashitaka (Billy Crudup), who stands between the humans who destroy the forest for its wealth and the animal gods who would destroy the humans to save it. The animation in this film is superb; while most animated films of its time (and many today) lack detail, luster or realism, the master storyteller Hiyao Miyazaki ensured that every frame is beautifully crafted. From the wide-shot landscapes to the droplets of rain upon the grass, Miyazaki's attention to detail is evident.The score, prepared by Joe Hisaishi, is reminiscent of Howard Shore's Lord of the Ring's trilogy as it both captures and enhances the emotion of the film. Perhaps, what makes this film so fascinating is that Miyazaki has created a world that is at once, fantastical and yet grounded in reality.You may recognize some familiar voices as Minnie Driver (Return to Me and Phantom of the Opera) voices Lady Eboshi, the industrious leader of Iron Town. Billy Bob Thornton also lends his talent as Jigo, a greedy monk sent by the emperor to behead the great forest spirit. While the film was originally released in Japan, Disney has taken the initiative to make this and other classics available to a wider audience.The beauty of the story is that it can be enjoyed by all different kinds of people, due to its many layers, subplots and themes. While a casual viewer may simply see it as an entertaining adventure film, which it certainly is, a closer look reveals an insightful allegory about the good and evil within all of us and a call for introspection. In my opinion, what makes a story believable and captivating is when it portrays evil as it is generally found, as part of a good person who believes they are either doing the right thing - or at least not doing anything wrong. Lady Eboshi exemplifies this duality of the good and evil within all of us and demonstrates Miyazaki's unwillingness to settle for what some have called, ""simple evil.""Princess Mononoke is not a story of wicked people destroying the innocent and peaceful forest creatures so much as that of both sides striving to defeat the evil within themselves. In Ashitaka, we find the conscience of both the forest gods and humanity. I highly recommend this film for the aforementioned reasons, though due to certain violent elements and mild language, it may be best to adhere to the PG-13 rating when considering watching it with children.",Princess Mononoke
373,dawa_jamsen,A respond review.,8,3 June 2016,"To mister taz1004,After reading your review called Highly-Overrated about the movie called Princess Monoke, I can't stop but say that how wrong you are about this movie. ""Princess Monoke"" has been one of the best animated movie created by Hayao Miyazaki with a strong message about the relationship between human and our earth. At first I too thought this movie would be like the other Miyazaki movies(Totoro and Ponyo) but these movies were base more on child-viewers unlike Princess Monoke which was base more on adult- viewers as this movie was intended to inform the grown-ups about the environmental issue of our earth through the director's creative way of showing it through the movie's incredible story. And if you check the rating's for this movie itself on IMDb, it has been rated PG-13; contains strong images of violence. So, obviously it seems like it was your own fault for showing this movie to your children without checking the content ratings for this movie and than you blame the movie by giving a bad review of being full with violence.If you really love Miyazaki as you said in the beginning, you must know that his animated movies are not like the Disney or Pixar animations. His movies are more mature and have more depth than a Pixar or Disney movies. I think you maybe confused between the Japanese way of animating and the more popular animations like Disney or Pixar, as they are solely different methods and different objectives. So I would recommend that next time before you show your kids any movies be sure to check the ratings and have more awareness about Hayao Miyazaki's work before stating bold statement against his movie.",Princess Mononoke
374,Engage_With_Zorp,Greatest Animated Film I've Ever Seen,10,10 January 2009,"Miyazaki is a master of animation, on a par with Walt Disney in innovation, and even greater than him, I think, in sheer storytelling ability. You won't find any singing elves in this dark tale, but that's for the best; instead, we get arrows lopping off arms and heads, and a great war between the forest gods and the industrial Irontown.To reveal any more about the plot would be a crime, but suffice it to say, our main character, Ashitaka, is put under a terrible curse, and must find a way to save himself - and the beautiful forest girl San (the Princess Mononoke of the title) - before it's too late.That very small summary right there does this complex movie a disservice; the themes here about the coexistence of man and nature are much more nuanced than that, with no clearly defined heroes or villains. Our two extremes are Lady Eboshi and San - but even as despicable as Eboshi's plot might seem, Miyazaki never lets us forget how very human she is, and the good things she is capable of. Between these two lies Ashitaka, who realizes what the audience only begins to understand by the end of the film.The animation is beautiful, of course, but the absolutely stunning visuals are only a part of what makes this film so beautiful. Everyone should see this movie; it's an experience that's not to be missed.In closing, if this review seems somewhat scatterbrained, it's because it's difficult to express in words just how magnificent and one-of-a-kind this film is. To call this simply one of the greatest animated movies ever made is a disservice to its genius; it is, without a doubt, one of the greatest films of all time, period. A magnificent achievement all around.",Princess Mononoke
375,nyk2000my,Japan Animation's Best,9,6 January 2006,"This film is Japan Animation's all time best to me. To be frank, i don't really like Japan Animation and Japanese either (may be because I am Chinese). But I certainly love this film and most Miyazaki's work.Mononoke - Hime is a 2 hours plus epic featuring a brave young warrior named Ashitaka's journey to search for Demon that cure him when he kills a corrupted beast God to save his fellow villagers. Without doubt, Ashitaka journey is packed with adventure and fictional elements. But the height of the film and also I think the intention of Miyazaki, was to portrait the clash, between human civilization and the mother nature (especially tree and forest).Without doubt, our young hero able to save himself, the wolf girl, and may be the forest too at the ending of the movie. But the consciousness that brought up by this film is certainly enormous. It seems that Miyazaki try to tell our kind to preserve the nature beside an unavoidable clash with development. And then, the plot, the sound track, was so fantastic that I can watch this film again and again.When the film come to its peak, eg:- the battle between San and Wolf God against the Iron City, the ambush of the Pig God, the dead of Shishi Gami, and every tragical event that occur in the film later in the film, was perfectly displayed by the animation team. Just like my friend said when he watched it together with me, he said the later part of the film was so breath taking.However, i need to point out that another Japan anime Pom Poko, made by Miyazaki's colleague Isaotaka. If Pom Poko made it with comedy elements and sense of humor, Mononoke was a darker version with enough tragic event to open our mind. That's why I give a 9 dough, coz Pom Poko and Mononoke - Hime share a same subject and if I am not mistaken, Pom Poko was released earlier than Mononoke. Any way, this is a great Anime that no one should missed. Marvelous! Btw, another thing I really appreciate about Miyazaki and Isaotaka is that they never exploit women's body shape in all their film. Considering the whole Japanese Animating Industry has this kind of stupid trend (have a look with Sailormoon, those are kid show and see how they drawn the heroine), Miyazaki and his pals should gain some regards on this matter too.",Princess Mononoke
376,Schro,Overrated,5,25 May 2008,"This is one of the most overrated anime movies of all time. I think most of the high ratings comes from people who were either stunned by the animation or give it a 10 just because it's anime. If you don't believe me about the second part, just type in the name of any generic shallow shonen anime and I can almost guarantee it will have at least a 7/10 rating. *cue 1000 ""No this review was not helpful"" clicks* To get this out of the way: The animation is great and overall it's not a bad movie. It's worth a watch. However it's also really slow and dull in many parts plot wise. There are several times where I just wished it would get to the climax so the movie would end. The main characters are pretty 2 dimensional(San and Ashitaka) and I found myself wishing that the movie would spend time on the side characters who are more interesting. San is the heroine who was raised by wolves and hates humans. If you've seen any anime with a generic tsundere(Wikipedia if you don't know what I mean) girl then you basically know her character and everything she'll do right away. Ashitaka is the hero who really has no back story and has a painfully dull ""PLEASE EVERYONE STOP FIGHTING"" personality. The point of the movie, like a few of Miyazaki's other movies is that the environment is cool and we shouldn't burn plastic in our full size SUVs while spraying aerosol cans out the window. While that's not a bad message for a movie to tell, Princess Mononoke does it really heavy handedly and seems like it wants to make you feel bad for human progress.Anyway, most of this ranting is to offset the hundreds of ""THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST THING EVER"" reviews and I honestly don't dislike the movie THAT much. I just think it could be a lot better for what the hype surrounding it promises.",Princess Mononoke

379,RobLowe,wow,9,22 October 2000,"**SPOILERS**   **SPOILERS** Intro: Wow. Quite an amazing film.The plot of Mononoke moved pretty well. It follows the typical ""good vs. evil"" anime storyline almost to a tee through the first two-thirds of the film, then takes a couple of neat turns in the end. It kept me engaged throughout the entire film.Though Mononoke doesn't have the best animation I've ever seen, the drawing was quite well done and the movement was rather smooth at most times. I wouldn't put it on the same spectacular level as a film such as Akira, but the detail and flow of the artwork was very respectable.The soundtrack must be heard to be believed, though some of the voice-actor casting on Disney's part is questionable. The most notable casting miscue was Minnie Driver - she did a good job with her part, but her voice sounds completely out of place with the rest of the cast.** THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE MAY NOT WANT TO READ THIS *****The neatest thing I thought about Mononoke was how it didn't completely follow the typical anime storyline. I would place Mononoke in the apocalypse category, where all life as its known is halted in a great cleansing, and those who survive must put upon the task of starting over with their new lives. Mononoke differs from the typical apocalyptic film in a few ways, however.Ashitaki, the main protagonist, doesn't get to keep San at the end. She still despises the humans, and she will apparently only give Ashitaki her audience. Although both of them will go about rebuilding their worlds, they will go about it separately, as opposed to rebuilding the world together.
Also, it is not only the good people that survive, but the not-so-good as well. Lady Eboshi was not killed in the end by Moro, although she was punished for shooting her. The monk (Gonza, I believe) also survived, though he was the one responsible for the destruction of the forest at end of the film.These twists separate Mononoke's plot from most other apocalypse film plots, and those twists help to raise Mononoke from the level of the ""average anime film.""ROB",Princess Mononoke
380,Spaceman-6,A wonderfully complex movie,9,10 December 2000,"So many movies today boil down to good vs. evil, but the characters and situations here defy such easy characterazations.  There is no real good guys or bad guys, but simply people doing the best they can.  You don't hate the people working at Iron Town anymore than you think that some of the things the animals do are evil.  Both have ideas about how things should be, but neither one is more right or wrong than the other.  It was wonderful to see a movie that was not only engaging but also has the courage to give us a plot that shows us that the world is made of grays rather than black and whites.",Princess Mononoke

The animation is fantastic -- the attention to texture is marvelous, and the way that each scene exuded atmosphere was amazing.  The characters were wonderful.  There was none of the irritating one-dimensionality we see in typical animated fare.  The story was an elegantly attired quest for personal salvation that touches on an impressive array of weighty themes, such as the environment, considered both philosophically and physically, economics, and spirituality.  Adding to that was the fact that the movie was coherent and easy to follow (a frequent difficulty I've found with anime, no doubt due to different cultural referents).  All in all, a very satisfying film.  Go see it.",Princess Mononoke
383,oltmansg,Not as good as advertised,5,2 October 2000,"I suppose I am a glutton for punishment. I've had a love/hate relationship with anime for quite some time now. Despite being disappointed more often than pleasantly surprised. I keep coming  back for more for some reason. I suppose it's because I hope that sometime someone will get it right and finally mix stunning  visuals (of which there are plenty in the anime world) with a coherent plot, and an interesting story (of which there are woefully few).Princess Mononoke fits into this category quite nicely. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking. I would rate it in the same  category along with other fantastic anime like Macross Plus, Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell, and Wings of Honneamise. The framerate was better than average for most anime. The only place I think they could have improved was on the behemoth night-walker spirit, which seemed a little choppy at times.The soundtrack is one of the best you'll hear. The musical score in particlar excels right through to the end of the movie. The sound effects were outstanding also. If a soundtrack CD is offered for this movie, I'll buy it in a heartbeat.Where the movie really disappoints is with the storyline. This is tragic too, because there are so many good characters on which to develop and plot devices (the tree spririts were fantastic) to use. After the first 30 minutes or so, the plot becomes incoherent, with no clear direction, and the characters sink into the not necessarily good/bad roles that has become the norm for anime.I feel that Princess Mononoke scores highly on technical merit, but really lacks when it comes to an involved, entertaining storyline. I hope that anime studios will learn from this, and in the future hire some talented writers to match their artists.",Princess Mononoke
384,vprabhu,Simply incredible,9,24 December 2000,"What else is there to say about this animated movie other than it's absolutely spectacular? Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke in the States) is the latest film from acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki, and it somehow manages to top everything he's ever done (an incredibly difficult task, if you've ever seen any of his other movies). Where do I start? First off, the art is flat out jaw dropping. The backgrounds are incredibly detailed, the animation is always sharp and fluid, and the use of color amazing. In fact, I might buy this movie for its art alone, but then Miyazaki throws in an epic storyline and cast of interesting characters.The storyline echoes the environmental themes of Miyazaki's 1984 classic Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa, but handles it in an interesting way; rather than make the humans into the antagonists and the plants and animals into the protagonists, this film presents both sides of the story and there are no clear bad guys or good guys. Both sides contain a capacity for good and evil, and the object of this movie's lead character, Ashitaka, is to get both sides to settle their disputes. It proves to be intriguing for the entire movie, and this is a fairly long movie.If you've familiar with the world of anime, you'll know what a daunting task a good dubbing can be. Nevertheless, Disney has gone far and beyond what I would have expected and given this movie a truly first rate dubbing. The English dialogue was written by storyteller extraordinaire Neil Gaiman and English voices include such big names as Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson, and Minnie Driver.I can think of only one possible complaint people might have about this movie: that it's too similar to its predecessor, Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa. That may be true, but I think with its interesting ambivalent take to sides and unparalleled art, Mononoke Hime is a must see for everyone.",Princess Mononoke

You know,having seen ""Howl's moving castle"",""my neighbour totoro"" and ""spirited away"" beforehand made it seem intense. but you know that's the only way they would've been able to illustrate how senseless human atrocities are. The first time I saw it,I didn't make much of it,but it kept playing in the background of my mind. And that's where the genius of it lies,in my opinion. I mean,any movie that keeps you thinking afterwards is a successful movie. My takeaway from it was,other than the obvious ""humans,stop messing with mother nature"",it was most importantly the terribleness -if I may - of hatred and anger. What I learned from it is that when people feel hurt,they can become toxic if they choose not to forgive and hold on to their grudges. Like, that boar literally turned to a demon and was infecting whoever came close to him because he let hate get the best of him. Also,it made me realize that,indeed,like the movie pointed out,hate does feed on anger and fear. Also,it highlights the idea that each story has two sides,and we should really drop our prejudices in order to make room for understanding. All in all,this movie is a piece of art that you don't have to understand or appreciate from the first time,but that gets many messages through.",Princess Mononoke

However, I can truly say this was one of the greatest animes......no movies...that i have ever seen.At first it was a little confusing but then it cleared up and was stunning.

The plot simply glitters with such complexity, thoughtfulness, maturity and action, that makes even the best of Western animation seem like child's play. The story carries a powerful, yet not preaching, ecological message, asking the question of why the human and the animal worlds cannot live in peace with one another. And what is remarkable, is that there is no true villain: all the characters, as well as the storyline, are very ambiguous. Some of the film's beauty also lies in the fact that the action is NOT non-stop: it is often the quiet, tender scenes that capture the viewer's attention. The animation, being of course chiefly hand-drawn, is nothing short of exquisite. From the calm beauty of the forest pools to the smoke and grime of the iron factories, not a single minute detail is overlooked. The characters, be they humans, stately animal gods, cute but eerie tree spirits, hate-filled apes or simply mice, insects and raccoons, all possess a certain beauty and credibility that is not always easy to come by in this day and age. The soundtrack is spine-tinglingly beautiful. And oh, the power of the silence as the Forest Spirit approaches, plants springing up in his wake... However, I must add a word of caution: this film lives up to every ounce of its PG-13 rating. The story and visuals are dark, violent and disturbing at times: People and animals alike are slaughtered in vast numbers with arrows, rifles, hand cannons and mines; profusely bleeding giant boars are invaded by tentacled demons. Death, as well as rebirth, and the horrors of war, are recurring themes. And the film is over two hours in length, so some children may become bored and confused by the plot. But do not be put off by this: 'Princess Mononoke' is pure brilliance from start to finish.",Princess Mononoke

I was never confused by all of the strange happenings, but always captivated, whether by the effect that the Nightwalker's footfalls made or the interesting society of Iron Town.  The story develops slowly, and I find the movie mildly depressing, but there is nothing that seriously detracts from the experience.  I would have liked Japanese voices (Jada Pinkett and Billy Bob Thorton just seem a little out of place in anime). The only thing missing from the movie is romantic love.

Since it was a Studio Ghibli film dubbed by Disney I liked the fact that it wasn't a ""they all lived naively ever after"" film. There were no complete ""good"" or ""bad"" guys. Even Lady Eboshi the most antagonist character in the movie had a reasonable motive for trying to get rid of the animal gods and cutting down the forest. Although it her actions were environmentally damaging and wrong in general, she did it to help her people survive which is what all the species on Earth strive for. Another wonderful aspect of the plot is that it sends a message - Protect the Earth and all will survive in peace - a message either discreetly or strongly portrayed in many of Miyazaki's films. Perhaps the portrayal of this message (and the tiny hint of San and Ashitaka's romance and Moro's views on nature) was what made the film so touching to me.Like many Miyazaki movies, the animation (as always) is wonderful and nicely detailed which is also another quality that genuine Disney films lack (thank goodness for Studio Ghibli). The music was beautiful and well suited to the movie.The only predicament to the movie is that it is a bit downbeat and does not contain much happy laughter (oh well, I can watch My Neighbor Totoro - also a good movie - for happy laughter.).10/10 - And my favourite movie of all time.",Princess Mononoke
391,wild-angel-8x,There's just not much to see,6,25 September 2020,"Interesting plot, but throughout the movie, it gives you that feeling that it's going nowhere. Then the abrupt ending does no favours to the movie. I could watch Kiki's Delivery Service again and again but this one took me 3 tries to finish. Decent to watch but if you get bored somewhere in the middle, don't be afraid to stop, you're not missing much.",Princess Mononoke
392,arky-saw,Hayao Miyazaki Does It Again!,9,22 October 2013,"Hayao Miyazaki a master animator, manga artist, producer, and screenwriter has once again crafted a wonderful story of life, death, forgiveness, respect of nature, and moving forward with life.Emishi prince, Ashitaka, whose body has been tainted by a demon is exiled from his homeland in seek of a cure. Along the way he sees The Great Forest God whom he hopes can cure him but does not. He comes upon an island town called, Irontown, led by Lady Eboshi. The town strips the forest of wood to mine precious iron to build weapons. The Wolf Clan, led by Moro, consists of herself, her two sons, and her daughter San...a human. San, raised by wolves, hates humans due to their rape of the land and defends the forest. Ahitaka acts as a mediator between Irontown and the various animal clans that inhabit the forest. He does his best to strive for peace.The film is beautifully animated and well written. It proves interesting to those who are not even interested in Japanese culture. It makes the point of respecting wildlife and moving on with life even when events turn bad.I highly recommend this film! It is great in English and in native Japanese with subtitles.",Princess Mononoke
393,firehead_lazzo,"Maybe I just don't ""get"" Mononoke.",4,10 February 2013,"I would never say that I hate anime, but I am usually bored and confused by it. So much anime acts thoughtful and deep, but ends up being fairly shallow and simple (see: Neon Genesis and Death Note). Miyazaki has always been a person I could turn to for anime that is both fun AND thought-provoking. Please understand that I am as surprised as you are when I say that I really didn't like this movie.Now, I don't hate Mononoke. I enjoyed the spectacle, and I recognize that it is very well-made. The story is competently told and the setting is interesting.My problem is with the characters. No one in Mononoke acts like a human being. The prince is a perfect angel who isn't affected by human emotions like fear and greed. He is utterly flawless and boring. I mean sure, he's been cursed, but it doesn't really seem to do much to him. In fact, it only appears to make him stronger. What's he complaining about?The women of Irontown are the most hateful people I could possibly imagine. After the attack, one of them joked, ""If you hadn't been there, we'd all have to find ourselves new husbands."" That's really funny, except to all of the women whose husbands are actually DEAD. What sort of callous, spiteful monster would say something like that? And worse, who would laugh at such an inappropriate joke? That same lady's husband was pushed off a cliff, almost died, and struggled for days to return home to his wife. When he finally makes it back home, what does she do? He calls him a dumbass and berates him in front of everyone. ""I wish the wolves had eaten you! Then maybe I could've found a real husband."" What a heartless bitch! There is no sense of love or camaraderie from anyone. I don't believe that these two have ever actually loved each other.I could understand this if the animals were portrayed sympathetically. They are not. All of the animals are rather dickish about eating and destroying everything in their path. The people of Irontown are only trying to defend themselves and they are made out to be the villains. Sure, they're destroying the forest, but it doesn't appear like the rest of the world is all that bad; just this place.In fact, the only person in the movie who I actually liked was Lady Obashi, the evil gun-toting power-hungry psychopath. Sure, she wanted to rule the world, but she felt like a human being. She was kind to the lepers, took pity on the whores and gave them all new and rewarding jobs. She loved her people and wanted to protect them. But she's supposed to be the villain? I don't buy it.And what about the pig? I understand that the first pig turned into a demon because he was filled with rage, but what about the old pig? The last thing he felt was hope that all of his warriors were still alive. Why did he become a demon when he wasn't full of hate? For that matter, all of the other animals WERE full of hate. All of the wolves, the monkeys, and most of the pigs were hateful, vengeful bastards. Why didn't they turn into demons? It doesn't make any sense.Perhaps the depth of this movie has been lost on me. Perhaps Miyazaki is trying to say that war can make a monster out of anyone, no matter how noble his cause. I suppose that would make for an interesting film, but I don't feel like that's what Miyazaki was trying to say. As it currently stands, I think that this is Miyazaki's weakest film.",Princess Mononoke
394,ShadoWolf0913,Love this movie so much,10,19 July 2012,"I first saw Princess Mononoke on DVD a few years ago, when I was around twelve, and although it is more of an adult movie, I loved it. I am sixteen now and I still consider it my favorite movie ever. The art and animation is so beautiful, not all 3-D looking like animation nowadays. The soundtrack is just amazing; it fits perfectly with whatever is happening on screen at any given moment and is incredibly moving and emotional.This storyline is phenomenal as well. A young man, Ashitaka, is fatally cursed after killing a demon boar to save his village. In an effort to try to stop the curse, he travels far away and stumbles upon a war between a mining colony of humans and the animal gods who live in the forest that the humans destroy in order to reach the iron in the mountain. Horrified by the bloodshed, Ashitaka tries to help both sides come to peace but, in doing so, becomes an enemy to both sides as well because he is seen as helping the enemy. He befriends a family of giant white wolves, the young woman, San, who was raised by the wolves, and a number of the humans in the colony, but then is torn when the humans and animals clash in battle. At the same time, Ashitaka has to fight the growing curse as it threatens to ""eat him alive"" with its hatred and stop a bounty hunter who wants to kill the Great Forest Spirit for ""a hill of gold.""This movie carries a deep, environmental message, as many of Miyazaki's films do, but also a haunting warning of what can happen when you allow hate and angry to consume and corrupt you. It has a very sophisticated plot and some smaller details may be hard to follow at times, especially if it is your first time watching it, but the general story is not hard to understand and should be quite enjoyable nonetheless. Some parts of the movie are rather intense and violent (One man has his arms ripped off by an arrow, two others are beheaded similarly, etc.) and may not be appropriate for a younger audience or anybody particularly squeamish. But if you do not mind that kind of stuff, I would absolutely recommend this; just be prepared to see a lot of blood.I have seen a lot of films by Hayao Miyazaki, and Princess Mononoke completely blows all the others out of the water. Even if you absolutely hate anime, this movie is still more than worth giving a chance. It is, in my opinion, the greatest story ever told by the greatest storyteller in the world.",Princess Mononoke

Ashitaka stops it, but becomes sick. He's have to move out from the village and find a cure to his sickness. Awhile searching he goes a long journey like you've never seen...Miyazaki did it again!

397,superbrendan715,Studio Ghibli does it again!,9,10 March 2017,"""Princess Mononoke"" is a brilliant animated film from 1997 by the extremely talented ""Studio Ghibli"". This film follows a young man whose main goal is to bring balance to the spirit world and the world of humans. However, this is very difficult as both humans and the spirits are constantly trying to destroy each other. This is an incredibly well done animated film with a very good message and theme. The theme being war will only destroy the world and possibly all that we have built, but if we work together and stop fighting we can live in harmony and make a beautiful world. This movie was definitely made to make people think about the environment and about how we treat others.This movie is one of my favorite films from Studio Ghibli, and that is mostly due to how well the message is integrated into the film. I also felt that the characters in this film feel very real and I love that! The animation for this movie is absolutely incredible, and I really do admire Hayao Miyazaki for this film as he not only directed and wrote this movie very well, but he himself animated a lot of this film and I think that is super special. I will say however the small downside this film has is it is quite long, however I do not feel that any part of this movie could have been cutout, as it all was needed. This movie is definitely worth watching, in fact I tell people to watch this film all the time, because it truly is a special film that most adults and some kids should watch.",Princess Mononoke

401,daniel-169,Almost as great as My Neighbour Tottoro,10,12 February 2001,"This is an adventure movie on an epic scale. Comparing it to Star Wars is about right, but still fails to describe the level of storytelling in this saga. It is not only a story of heroism and death, but one of our own battle against nature, how we keep forgetting how to live with nature instead of against it, it is of hatred and forgiveness, love and pity.
The only reason why this movie is not as god as ""My Neighbour Tottoro"" is that that story is entirely void of any action, any cheap effects. It is a story that carries itself and keeps you riveted, even though nothing really happens. To make a story like that interest is truly genious.But in waiting for ""My Neighbour Tottoro"" we can only watch the director's genious at work.",Princess Mononoke
402,jgtg,graphic artistry exceptional but story content weak,6,16 February 2000,We felt privileged to be able to see this very artistic expression in our remote area.  The animation is beautifully creative but I felt the story line was disjointed; it felt written on the spot.  Maybe some of that roughness is because of translation or cultural differences.  It definitely worked hard at resolving a LOT of conflict.,Princess Mononoke
403,sunsetrider,A movie without resolution,7,19 March 2001,"What first drew me to this anime is Hayao Miyazaki's epic manga work 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'. It is there that I have surmised what Mr.Miyazaki is trying to tell us, that there is no distinct definition of good and evil; or in a much simpler sense, a term 'good' is a purely relative term.Because there was no 'evil' to relinquish to save the day, there was no clear achievement on the part of the protagonist. Hence, there was no clear resolution, and left me a sense of bewilderment and frustration. Particularly because there was absolutely no way for me to even 'imagine' any means of a definite conclusion within the world envisioned by the creative mind of Mr.Miyazaki. And Mononoke Hime is no exception.
Perhaps as with the ilk of the movie such as 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', this anime will clearly pique the audience's interest by it purporting a sense of novelty. That the film garnered the most revenue next to 'Titanic' is more than willing to try to coax us to see what made the Japanese so frenetic about the anime.Clearly, Mr.Miyazaki's imagination is a vivid realization of pure enchantment. The forest is drawn with stunning detail and the surroundings of Japanese mountainside and its geographical features seem to take a life of its own. But it is a bit hackneyed, as he seems to be dependent upon his formulaic approach of rendering his characters (both storywise and graphically). Pricess Mononoke looks a bit like a cross between Nausicaa and Kushana, and Ashitaka resembles Asbel. And almost all the female bellow workers are rendered in a simple manner that seems to represent a cohesive and collective organism; a bit disconcerting at worst.
If the viewers are not willing to partake in the vision that is defined with Miyazaki and view the animation with a stoic sense of poignant reality privy to Western mindset, this anime will be nothing but a haphazard and silly fantasy tale spun from the wildest of lunacy. Of course, the movie should confound many people who do not know anything about various Japanese mythos, barrage of which are included in the movie to perfect Mr.Miyazaki's vision. But Mr.Miyazaki cordially and humbly invites us to his world of medieval Japan in the conflict between humans and gods, and it creates a convincing suspension of disbelief.However. The biggest flaw in the anime would be that it is trying to enumerate almost everything that is Mr.Miyazaki's philosophy on life. One can only put so much definition in a two hour movie. Just like in his celebrated manga 'Nausicaa', Mr.Miyazaki dispenses with some definite references for evil and good. Therefore, his characters in the movie are both stunningly and horrendously static, no room for growth, no changes. Even after the entire Tatara Ba is destroyed, humans will forge another means of destroying the nature. It is bound to occur again and again and again, this pointless conflict between humans and nature. But what is 'pointless' if it is permanently embedded into human history or human 'nature'? Alas, even the relationship between San and Ashitaka ends in a blur of irrevocable end. The ending is rather quick and anti-climatic to grace the film of this much expense and scope.Mr.Miyazaki's works are not my cup of tea, plainly because of it is not a wholesome entertainment within the limits of its animation or comic. But I cannot help but be intrigued by his premise and pretentious approach of presenting his ideas in such a medium. Maybe I am just a nitpicky fan of Mr.Miyazaki, an accomplished artist, who completely altered my predisposition about the animation works in general. But the anime is plainly too subdued and a dawdle of a confusing adventure.
Princess Mononoke is without a resolution. Therefore it is a depressing story mired by helpless and static characters only rising up to the occasion to resolve a circumstantial dilemma. I cannot recommend this anime with a full assurance.",Princess Mononoke

The story of these characters so intriguingly told, with such depth, in a brilliant and rather violent dance of color, motion, emotion and sound. Animation quality overshadowed by none, musical score so touching and backgrounds so life-like and impressive, makes you wonder how such perfection could be achieved.

I would try to explain the story of Princess Mononoke, but it cannot be expressed well in words.I recently bought the DVD of this movie, and there is a feature that allows you to see the literal translation from Japanese to English.  I was very impressed by how well they adapted the final translation from the choppy, literal translation.For those of you that may have been turned off by the excess violence, gore, and nudity of other anime films, you can watch this without being offended by such scenes. The voices that were chosen for the dubbed English version were spectacular, Minnie Driver and Billy Crudup in particular.

Instead of focusing on one or two aspects of the movie I do not like and formulating a biased opinion based on my hasty and clouded notions, I can now decipher both the good and bad points of a given flick. Upon watching Princess Mononoke, I must say I first thought it would be very difficult to look past the animation style and see it for what it was- a dynamic film directed be the highly acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki. After about ten minutes of dwelling on the follies (and there are, in my opinion, many) of the ""anime"" style of art, I became enthralled with the quickly unfolding plot and the subsequently dire fate bestowed upon Ashitaka, the protagonist of the film.

Entertaining and enlightening, this story of an outcast young man fighting the corruption of industry, intertwined with an exploration of Shintoism and our bonds with nature touches the viewers heart and mind. Everything in this movie simply works the way that it was planned. The world is believable and intriguing, the characters make believable decisions, etc. Its only real flaw is that it is just so similar to every other Miyzaki film.Even the American dub is wonderful, with a great cast.

416,bfprower,A Masterpiece of Animation,10,7 April 2011,"Hayao Miyazaki, Japan's equivalent of Walt Disney, has given us some of the best animated films in history; including Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. Princess Mononoke, in my opinion, is his finest creation. Princess Mononoke centers around the young and noble hearted Ashitaka, whom after being cursed by a demon, must journey to the sacred forest to be exorcised before the curse ultimately destroys him. On his journey, he encounters several forest spirits, a group of iron workers, and a mysterious girl raised by the forest's wolves. The story focuses on the constant clash of man and nature, and how both must make sacrifices in order to coexist. There are no heroes, and no villains. All shareholders have motivations that can be sympathized with, and some that cannot. The story is deep, compelling and flows very well. I will admit at times it can become moderately confusing, especially when elements of mysticism are introduced. However it's presented so well, I feel that the confusion is my fault, not the film's;. It's as if my insufficient mind isn't capable of grasping the magnitude of the plot. The characters: human, animal and otherwise are all well developed, multi-layered and interesting. The animation is the Miyazaki standard: very bright, very vibrant and always carrying energy and emotion. The action scenes are some of the best in all of animation and the entire film carries with it a sense of awe and wonder. The film even manages to take several actions that we would otherwise consider disgusting, and make them appear beautiful. The music corresponds to the scenes perfectly and moves the story almost as much the animation and dialogue. I recommend you watch the film in Japanese as the English dub is very good in places, but downright annoying in others. Once I realized that Toki was voiced by Jada Smith, I switched over to the subtitles. But watching the film in English won't take much from the experience. I could praise the film for hours and it's truly one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's gripping, creative, intelligent and correctly delivers one of the most difficult to execute themes in all of film. Absolutely watch Princess Mononoke.",Princess Mononoke
417,sivertholm,"Creative, action-packed and with breathtaking animation!",9,5 December 2014,"I just watched this for the first time recently, and I loved it! i had only seen one other Studio Ghibli film (Spirited Away), so I'm relatively new to their films. But because I loved this film so much, and Spirited Away is one of my all time favorites, I can't wait to watch some of their other work (already watched ""My Neighbor Totoro"", and i loved it).It has a great and original story, which i wont spoil anything from. I went in knowing nothing about it, and I think it's the best way to watch it. It also has some great characters, and a great settingThe movies is filled with tons of creative creatures, and the world they live in is equally as creative. All of this is boosted by the incredible animation. Studio Ghibli is known for their incredible animation, and this is no exception. If you're expecting some cheap, lazy animation, you will be pleasantly surprised. It was surprisingly violent, and the action was directed very well. Funny how an animated film has way better action than most action films today.In conclusion, Princess Mononoke is one of the best animated I've seen in years. It's fast paced and action-packed when it needs to, and it's slow paced and emotional when it needs to. It blends action, emotion and comedy very well, and you should definitely watch it.Highly recommended for fans of Animated films, or just well made films in general.9/10",Princess Mononoke

Although kids (maybe not children under seven) can watch this movie. it is definitely a break from the traditional childish films that animation brings, especially anime! Princess Mononoke is more than just environmentally aware, this movie happens to have a lot of themes to it besides man and nature's relationship. It's a story about love, loss, and most of all, being alive! This also not a movie where there is good vs. evil (even though the humans and the forest gods are fighting against each other) all the characters are complicated, everybody, even the animals are human, which makes this movie more realistic.I especially like Ashitaka, because he not like the usual hero in an animated film. He is wise and sensitive and because he cares for both humans and the forest,( he especially has feelings for San the wolf girl, who is the main heroine and another likable character), he will do anything to stop the bitter battle between the two.Overall this is great a movie and I highly recommend it!",Princess Mononoke
419,SmithWinston,Another Miyazaki masterpiece,10,22 August 2005,"The story begins in a Japan of centuries ago, with the noble young hero Ashitaka being cursed by causing the death of a god-turned-demon. Leaving his lands and community behind, he journeys to where the god originated to find out what caused it to change into a demon. What he discovers are men who, in their single-minded pursuit to obtain more and more iron for their iron-mining town, have made war upon the forest situated nearby and its inhabitants. The film proceeds to show this war and its effects on both forest and townspeople, and how the presence of Ashitaka influences them.The forest creatures are diverse, most of them part of Japan's native wildlife. Some of them, however, are from Miyazaki's own boundless imagination. There are Gods in the forest, whose purpose is to protect its life and creatures. It is they who battle against the townspeople. And what Gods they are: a mother wolf with two cubs and her human daughter, Mononoke Hime (Princess of the Spirits).The war grows ever more intense as each side is determined to see the death and destruction of the other. The townsfolk reason that once the forest gods are dead, there will no longer be any resistance to obtaining iron ore. The most important of these gods is the Shishigami Sama (the Deer God) who looks like a deer during the day, but at night... there is no description for what he is or how spectacular he looks then. It's sheer visual splendour. Having said too much already, I'll remain silent on the title character and further disclosure of the plot. Although the movie takes no sides in the matter, presenting both parties in the war impartially and imbuing both with good and worthy characters, it was impossible for me not to choose a side. The forest got my vote. After all, theirs was a fight to defend their very existence. Besides, where else do you see a Wolf giantess, with two tails, speaking in the tongue of humans in a male voice (in the Japanese version)? And noble boars, willing to fight to the end? Remarkable.Miyazaki never once compromises his characters. The animal Gods remain animal, growling, with their appetites. Yet they are never unreasonable or dim-witted. The humans are indeed human. They have their own views, which are limited to considering only their lifetimes, their families, communities and livelihood, and so unable to see the bigger picture. However, they are not unreasonable either.Perhaps the war is inevitable, for as communities grow so does the need for supporting them by diversifying labour. Iron mining in this case was their ticket to a well-provided and secure life. Man, having been part of nature until then, eventually found himself facing it instead, thinking himself to no longer be entirely subordinate to its rules.The film's finale is exceptional, matching the brilliance of the rest. As the movie progresses, one already realises there will be no easy end. Suffice it to say it is very satisfactory indeed.Being a Japanese film set in a semi-historic Japan, Shinto beliefs pervade the entire movie (as happens in most of Miyazaki's work, especially Spirited Away and My Neighbour Totoro). The spiritualism is quite moving, and whether the Gods existed or not, one secretly wishes they did and were still around. Providing some much-needed balance and antagonism in this world where nature has no voice to raise in retaliation and no visible way to fight back as we continue in our quest for progress, ignorant of our place in the world and the bridges we are burning.For those who appreciated the natural spiritualism of the film, a suggestion (besides the other Ghibli masterpieces) is the exquisite, animated version of Wind in the Willows (UK, 1995, TV). It too features a mystical God, brilliantly rendered by the artists, comparable to the majesty of the Shishigami Sama. It's also filled with dreamy experiences inspired by the beauty and mystery of nature. Alternatively, one can just read the book.",Princess Mononoke
420,mirza241612,Viewer Review,6,10 June 2005,"I heard about this movie when Channel 4 (in the UK) did 100 greatest cartoons. Princess Mononoke nearly made it to the top 20 (21 it reached). I watched Spirited Away first but I decided to watch one of Miyazaki's earlier works. Boy, was Spirited Away 10x better than this. Though the opening was good but at some points the film tends to get boring. The intro of Ashitaka was visually great same with all the other characters except Lady Eboshi where she was introduced straight away. The reasons that Princess Mononoke could not be televised for kids was that it had 2 'B' words & 1 'P' words. Yes, swearing. Also the part where Ashitaka lets his arrow fly to stop someone where the victim loses his arms and one where he loses his head!!! Blood & Gore to top it off. However the animation was good to watch but the story was weak. Music by Joe Hisaishi is suited at all parts of the film and well deserved music. I like the Legend of Ashitaka which is brilliantly instrumented. Off course if the film didn't have gore and swearing then this would have been a great family program but otherwise don't let your kids watch this and learn bad words. Overall- Average",Princess Mononoke
421,Squidd,What Disney lacks...,10,22 October 1998,"The king of Japanese animation displays his (as of yet) most carefully crafted work.  As in all his movies, the audience must be prepared to enter into a magical world, where the background scenes are beautifully painted in a realistic manner, but are imaginary and fantastic...  To be taken to a mythical Japan where wolves have two tails, where forests are inhabited by head-ticking spirits, and where boars can be cursed with hatred, seems at first to be an exciting adventure.  But we find that this world is all too real.  At the center of this epic is a battle between man and nature. People kill animals and trees... as well as each other.  Trees are burned for iron, iron is used for guns, and the guns are used for war.  People die, animals die, and spirits die.  But Miyazaki is a messenger of hope.  He claims to want to show children not how the world is, but how it could be. His characters are neither evil nor good, and so they allow for change. Disney could learn from this.  The magic of Disney lies in its abiltiy to tell happy tales of good people vs. evil people.  The magic of Miyazaki lies in his philosophy.  His love for craft, and his relentless passion for animation and story-telling allows him to produce movies that are original and breathtaking.  The effort that he places in the creation of his art guarantees that his work is worth watching, at least once.  And for that effort, we as an audience should put in the proper effort to try and understand what this director is getting at, as well as the effort of appreciating the animation itself.  There are scenes in this movie that Disney cannot do (at least not yet) simply because of the technique. Miyazaki deserves a place with the masters.  He has shown that animation is no child's play.",Princess Mononoke
422,heuge,Please see this movie... 8),10,28 November 1999,"I can only hope and pray that Mononoke is seen by more movie lovers and that it gets a wider release.  The support of individuals is what will allow more Japanese animation to come to the US.I had to travel from Rochester, NY to Washington, DC to see this movie.  It was not listed in Rochester, but I was shocked to see that it was only being played in one theater in DC(another theater somewhere in MD).  While the theater was teeny tiny (really small screen in a really small (triangular) room, the movie was excellent.  I have been in love with Kiki's Delivery Service from the same director for many years, and this movie does not disappoint.  A great feel for visuals, plot and action, and a continuation of two forces living and fighting with and against each other (nature/civilization).  He seems to really like those concepts.  Mononoke is quite wonderful eye candy, but it also brings good discussions when the movie is done.Others have written better reviews, but I throw in my recommendation.  Go and enjoy this movie, and bring lots of friends to bring up the ticket sales.  I want this movie to come to my hometown so I can go see it with other friends on a big screen rather than simply on a TV/DVD/laser/etc...

423,dnaeye,Truly amazing and inspiring,9,29 October 1999,"This film works like clockwork and is spotless as a silicon chip in a vacuum-sealed semiconductor lab. Granted it's not as epic as ""Nausicaa"", the superb action sequences, the terrific accompanying score by Joe Hisashi, and the gritty harshness of its dramatic themes made ""Princess Mononoke"" a much tighter package, as well as a more elaborated version of the message put forth in ""Nausicaa."" I understand that Miramax's distribution and marketing of the film up to this point has been rather low-key, but I hope somehow this film will reach enough people to make a change in the mindset of the American public. A note to parents, this is not ""My Neighbor Totoro"" or ""Kiki's Delivery Service."" There is some violence in ""Princess Mononoke"" which may startle younger audiences.",Princess Mononoke
424,Dr.Worm,One of the best animated films EVER.,10,31 October 1999,"Anyone who's convinced that Japanese animation consists of nothing more than sex and violence needs to see the collected works of Hayao Miyazaki. Granted, that can be difficult, as few of his films are available (legally) in the States, but it's a task that is well worth it.  His movies are always overflowing with strong, complex characters, involving stories, and breathtaking scenery.That said, when I heard that Mononoke Hime was a tale about man versus nature, I was a little hesitant, despite the fact that it was Miyazaki's work.  I shouldn't have been.  The film may be ecologically-aware, but the throrough treatment it gives to the subject makes previous animated American shots at the same look like the preachy, simplistic claptrap they are (paging Captain Planet...).  Neither side in MH's battle is ""evil"" - both are fighting to preserve their way of life.  And the cliche of nature as pure and righteous is tossed aside here; the animal gods are just as given to unseeing hatred as their human enemies.Anyway, if you only watch one animated film in a year, it should be this one.  Hell, if you don't watch ANY animated films... well, you get the idea. It's a simply beautiful animated epic.",Princess Mononoke
425,Netwalker,"So far, the best anime I have ever seen (all this from a man of experience)",10,29 November 1999,"I have seen quite a few anime movies, ranging from Akira to Roujin Z, to Ranma 1/2, and Dominion Tank Police. And by all means, Mononoke Hime blows the socks off of everything I've ever seen. Along with the storyline being excellent, it's appropriate enough that I could take my 10-year-old brother to see this movie.</rant on> There isn't any aspect of this movie that I wouldn't rave about, including the soundtrack. The soundtrack to this movie is excellent, to the point that I would like to purchase it. </rant off>",Princess Mononoke
426,Filmboy-14,"Best Film of 1999 (Yes, I think it's better than American Beauty.((Don't get me wrong, I thought American Beauty was a great film, but Mononoke was better))).",10,21 January 2000,"Princess Mononoke is the most breathtakingly artistic film I have ever seen. It ranks among Fantasia and Pinocchio as the greatest animated films ever made.  The story line is beautiful and complex.  It's not your normal, boring, conventional, and predictable Hollywood plot that everyone seems to want nowadays.  Some people had trouble with Princess Mononoke, I think, because there are no real good guys and bad guys.  You can't really take sides, every character has different motives with good and bad intentions. But that's one of the things I liked about Mononoke.  It's not the good old simplistic Disney tale where there is a definite good and evil.  Princess Mononoke is not about good vs. evil, or even man vs. nature, but about how we should all reach a certain compromise and try to work together and help each other.  You won't find too many themes like that in movies, especially animated features.  Princess Mononoke is not for small children, not just because of the violence, but because it will probably go way over their heads.  It is geared toward adults and older audiences.  The love story between San and Ashitaka is very subtle, moving, and even profound.  It's not conventional Hollywood.  Princess Mononoke is #1 on my ten best films of the year list because I believe it is a landmark feat in the animation genre.  I think it will eventually change the way Americans look at animation; that it's not just limited to the family and small children, but can be for adults and only for adults.  Mononoke shows that animation is just another form of expressive filmmaking, it can show things on film that could not possibly be filmed in live action.",Princess Mononoke
427,JediRaptoR,The Best Animated Film!,10,9 April 2001,"The first time I saw this movie (even the dubbed version, although it was exceptionally done) I was completely blown away.  I had liked a couple forms of anime before hand, but was never totally interested in the subject until I saw the Princess Mononoke.  After that, I dropped all the anime I had liked before.  This movie is nothing like what Americans classify as anime. The movie isn't choppy, loaded with neon colors, and doesn't involve weird hybrid midget animals or gigantic robots (sorry guys, but Pokemon and all those kiddie shows ruined Japanese animation's rep).  Instead it involves a piece of history, and true-to-life characters that nearly everyone can relate to.  What interested me was that there were no black-and-white characters involved with the story: no truly evil or good people, unlike the popular Disney movies over here in the states.  And the characters don't break out in song every five minutes either.  On the contrary, this is a very serious film (something like ages 11 and up), and it isn't one of those stories where the most evil people on Earth are mowing through the forest of the cuddly, dewy-eyed animals.I hear people complain that they're not interested in ""that Japanese stuff"", but I'll only respond with the fact that this is far from the quality of those kiddie shows, and it's only the style of how people are drawn that's foreign to American's style (i.e. Batman, Marvel stuff, Disney movies). Once you experience this film, however, what will really catch your eye (and I mean in an extreme way) is the beauty of the simulated backgrounds (there's even a bit of 3D-simulated scenes - very cool); the mist filled mountains, the wondrously painted backdrops of the forest, the detail in every scene is astonishing: you have to watch the movie 5 times plus just to make sure you absorbed everything!  The animation itself is also incredible. The majority of each scene proves very smooth action and rarely is there a shot where there's more that 9 seconds of stillness.If you, by now, have yet to see this movie, then by-golly why are you still sitting here?!  Order it, or preview it first from your local Blockbuster or whatever's closest by.  Better yet, go to the official site and download the theatrical trailer (they did a nice job with that too^_^).",Princess Mononoke

Although I came in late, I was sucked into the plot with in minutes.  Mononoke had such wonderful animation and a story which sucked you in.I had seen Nauiscaa the previous night, and heard that Mononoke was in many ways a repeat.  In my opinion, Mononoke was better. The characters, for one, were much more developed.  I think that it was improved by not having San do everything, as Nauiscaa did.  It was nice that there was more variety in the action.Mononoke also had amazing animation.  I have been seeing anime for a long time, and love the style when it is pulled off well, not in the Pokemon fashion.  Mononoke's scenes of battle, towns, and particularly the forests were breath taking.I wholeheartedly recommend Mononoke to anyone who enjoys stories of love, nature, and battle, but avoid it if you dislike gore.  As I have said, the animation is good, gore looks real sometimes.",Princess Mononoke

So when this film played on my campus this weekend, I went only because it was something to do on a slow day.  I was blown away (and went back to see it again the next day).  The animation is incredible.  The voice acting is well done.  The story is beautiful, brutal, and brilliant.  It was a joy, after all these years of American cartoons to see talking animals portrayed in such a natural, non-comic relief way.  The characters were all very human and ambiguous, very shades of grey.  You could feel for all of them (even the nature-killing Lady Eboshi) at times during the movie.  I have never seen a better piece of animation, and have very rarely seen a better film.  My eternal thanks to Miyazaki for creating this, and to studio Ghobi, for making sure that it wasn't torn apart by Disney to fit ""traditional American"" tastes.  See this as soon as possible (video release June 13th), you will not regret it.",Princess Mononoke

The plot was stupid, the voices/sound were aweful, and the animation graphics (much raved about) were nothing better than a Disney movie.  I really like most asian movies, and anime as well.

The 8.3 (or whatever #) rating is absolutely too low as the movie should be in the top 25 movies of all time! This is Miyazaki's best work, narrowly defeating Spirited Away, and was the biggest hit in Japan until the Titanic (for reasons unknown to me). The animations is superb, the soundtrack is amazing, and the story is one you will remember forever. If you are familiar with Miyazaki's work, the film is packed with loads of symbolism, and an array of ""wierd"" stuff as usual.

There was not one part I didn't understand.

This film aired in 2005 or 2006 on Cartoon Network and one of my sisters recommend I don't watch since it was very violent and gory. It wasn't until this year when I felt ready to see it since I've seen plenty of R-rated films.There are many things I liked about the film such as; the idea of the main protagonist being a male rather than the same old signature female in most of Miyazaki's films, this film appears to be about a war but a war where humans and mystical animals fight each other. The second protagonist is San and I've heard that the character, Nausicaa from ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" was a precursor for this character.San is similar to Nausicca except she was raised by Wolves and she hates humans despite being one herself. My two favorite scenes is when Ashitaka stops a demon-cursed boar form destroying his village, and when Kiya gives Ashitaka her crystal dagger when he is banished from his village.Overall the film has a very good story and a message that people can understand and relate to.",Princess Mononoke

This film is simply fantastic, it shows that no matter how far digital animation progresses it will never be able to capture the concept of humanity as Studio Ghibli's traditional animation does. The human characters seem more than human, despite all their physical exaggerations you forget that they are animated images and believe in them as much as any tangible actor.This film transcends the genre of animation and sits among the great cinematic works of all time.

I know that some anime fans hate this movie saying that it is overrated and that ""Akira"" is a much better movie, but I don't agree with that. Don't misunderstood me, ""Akira"" is a excellent movie, is just that ""Mononoke Hime"" is a completely different anime, and the style, story and characters made by Miyazaki are quite different of the ones created by Otomo. Unlike many animated films, that are aimed to children, ""Mononoke Hime"" is a epic story, filled with elements of tragedy, adventure and heroism, and all beautifully told by one of the masters of the animation that is Miyazaki. Every single frame of this movie has a unique beauty, and all the characters, humans or animals are very likable and interesting. This movie isn't overrated.

Studio Ghibli is employed with wizards of anime who always seem to blow us away with their style.

446,greenridersharysa,The third Miyazaki film I've watched really is the charm.,10,9 October 2005,"The first film I watched by Hayao Miyazaki was, naturally, Spirited Away (I was too young to have known about Princess Mononoke when it came out). Since then I've decided to try and find, if not buy, all of Miyazaki's films.Princess Mononoke is one of the most beautiful and well-done films I've ever seen in my life. I especially like Minnie Driver as the voice of Moro the wolf goddess, since I have a fondness for subtle, dignified voices. Lady Eboshi is one of my favorites in the fact that she's quite real; no matter how much people view her as a ""villain,"" all she really wants is for her people to be happy.It also helps that I'm an anime fan. Although I disliked seeing the battle scenes with the demons (I detest leech-like things) even they had redeeming qualities in my opinion; having been corrupted by hate, the gods have been transformed into monstrous beings. I say again, Princess Mononoke is a truly beautiful film.Miyazaki seems to have perfected the art of making characters human enough to be realistic. Unlike in Disney's movies, nobody is truly on one side or the other, and even Ashitaka, who can be deemed the 'hero,' is alternately for the forest and then for the humans. Truly a masterpiece that surpasses any work of Disney and Pixar put together.",Princess Mononoke
447,evelynpigggy,:),7,9 November 2016,"It was a meaningful movie. Although it was made in anime form, but the messages were still well-delivered. It was a movie about the equality values in city lives and jungle lives. It was a movie that made us ponder about our way of treating the wild animals. Human usually consider themselves higher and more developed than any other animal, but that isn't the alternate truth. Animals have developed the same society as us, but it is not yet discovered. We should stop putting us on the top of animal chain but learn to accept and to love all us equally. I loved the main girl, she's really brave and wise. after all it was great.",Princess Mononoke
448,Velocyus,Simply put Legendary,10,6 April 2020,"This is truly breathtaking. Kept me focused from the beginning to the very end. Humans were terrible and should have been wiped out by the God of the Forest. Too bad Ashitaka was still focused on the humans, but after all this I bet he took Mononoke with him back to his peaceful village to be prince and princess of the Emishi clan, which in my book is CANON.
At this moment it's probably pretty late for this and they have zero interest in it, but Ghibli could continue this story with their children growing along with the cubs of the wolves, fighting for survival once again, because Jigo knew who Ashitaka was because of his red Yaku and stone arrows. He definitely told the emperor all the story including the part where the survivor of the clan he genocided prevented him to deliver the head of the Forest God. This, plus the fact that he wanted all of their clan to be annihilated makes it quite plausible he then wanted to send a small army to completely wipe them out. Lady Eboshi and the people of the ironworks could be his allies, or they could not, who knows? There's so many possibilities because Miyakaze made the story so complex. It's almost like he meant to continue it.",Princess Mononoke
449,jeffchickens,Great film,10,31 October 2005,"This is the third Miyazaki film I have seen (after ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Spirited Away""), and though I loved the other two movies, this one is probably the best. The animation, as with all of Miyazaki's films, is simply superb; the way that these drawings portray every aspect of nature is just breathtaking. An excellent feature of the storyline, I believe, is that there is no one character that represents evil; Lady Eboshi seeks to destroy the forest, but only because she thinks it will save her people; Jigo may be greedy and seeks glory, but not to deliberately hurt others. The environmental/social commentary throughout (particularly invention vs. nature) gives the story a depth that is almost non-existent in modern animated films. Overall, a truly great movie.",Princess Mononoke

He goes on a quest to find the cure for the cancer-like disease. In the process, he meets a young woman who was cast out as baby and adopted by a wolf pack. Through her eyes and the wolves', the prince sees why the boar god was cursed in the first place and how mankind's disregard for the preservation of nature was the cause. Only when mankind learns to live harmoniously with nature will what caused the boar go to go insane be healed.I saw this movie in the Japanese language while reading an English summary of it. The visuals are awesome. The music, of which I have a CD, is beautiful even when listened to apart from the movie. I would put it on a scale with the award winning score from ""Titanic.""

455,beverins,A Great Film,10,7 November 1999,"This film by Hayao Miyazaki is one of the best FILMS I have seen in awhile. Please note that I did not say ""animated film."" Many people seem to think that animation is something purely for children. I see it as simply another form of art, that can be used as personal expression and can be used as a viable form of entertainment for anyone. I thank Disney for not editing this movie (well, they were contractually obligated not to) and the intelligent scriptwriting by Neil Gaiman was on the nose.Some people may be turned off by the amounts of gore in this film, and the rather sudden scenes of violence. Well, all I have to say is that there is nothing here people haven't seen in movies like ""Braveheart."" It was amusing that, in NYC's Angelika Theater, there was a sign above the ticket office that said"" this film has scenes of animal and human violence, this is not Pokemon."" Amazing that such a sign should be needed - I guess people don't read movie reviews, or MPAA ratings.What disturbs me is that Miramax is not advertising this film on TV. How are people supposed to know to go see this? Then, later, if this movie doesn't get good box-office income (from all 16 theaters that are playing in the USA!) they will say ""people don't like cartoons like this."" If they knew it was ON, they might GO... Many people I have told about this movie went ""Princess Mono-what?  WHat's that?"" A shame. This is a terrific movie, and not something I would be afraid to show my 10-year old!",Princess Mononoke
456,Mr. Sparkle,Words don't describe it. 8*,9,13 September 2000,"After seeing so many 'Anime' movies, even though I like them my one major complaint is the stupidity used in the dubbing. One of the best in this genre, Akira, has tons of 'huh's. Come on, It gets really annoying after a while. I sometimes wonder if it's actually translated, for all we know it could be something else. And that is where Mononoke surpasses other 'animes.' The dubbing is qued, it's meaningful. I really couldn't care less who did the voices, but the dubbing was done well, making it seem like I wasn't watching an Americanized version of a Japanese movie, but I was watching an American movie. And on top of that, the animation and the art work was extraordinary.Well worth the money.",Princess Mononoke
457,pas-5,"Beautiful, but...",8,29 September 2000,"I'm sorry that the Disney deal with Studio Ghibli kept the Japanese version from being seen in our usual anime outlets.  The English-language script was quite good, though Disney did their usual flawed voice casting.  Over all the film was beautiful, but I did not find it as emotionally engaging as other Miyazaki films.",Princess Mononoke
458,Matt256,Princess Mononoke is a stunning animation and a modern masterpiece.,8,3 May 2008,"I would never believe any animation would surpass the magic of one of Walt Disney's earlier works. Animations that involved years of hard labour and revolutionised family entertainment. In all honesty, Princess Mononoke could hardly hold a candle to something such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. However, the lone fact that it even comes within a mile of that is justification for that failing.For Princess Mononoke is truly a masterpiece, a masterpiece of story, subtlety, and movement that is only superseded by few other films from the studio. It has a dilemma in a way, for it is not very suitable for children, whilst adults will probably be put off by the slightly surreal tale. However, stereotypes such as that can't explain why it was so popular in the first place. The story that depicts the struggle between humankind and nature masks what is really a love story of prince Ashitaka and the Mononoke-Hime of the wolf tribe. The alternation between these two arcs is superbly pitched, and adds depth to the otherwise fairly simple tale.Of course, despite how well paced and emotional the story is it's the animation people would be most interested in. In a generation where animated characters are typified by stiff, unconvincing movement, princess Mononoke is ultimately refreshing. Due in part to director Miyazaki's insistence on hand-drawn animation, and the obvious work that's been put into bringing every scene to life. It superbly captures the atmosphere of it's several locations, populating screens with noise and movement. The excellent use of animation and sound gives objects weight and realistic movements. The characters are expressive and filled with life. It truly is a sight to behold.In terms of English voice talent, Princess Mononoke is typically short of it. Whilst the majority of the actors' performances are adequate. The worst of all is probably Ashitaka (Billy Caldup's) half-hearted performance. The Japanese voicing is a lot better, and yet the subtitles aren't well translated enough. One thing to try is to watch the movie in Japanese without subtitles, and thus see how much you can discern simply from watching the films alone. Princess Mononoke is a stunning animation in it's own right, and simply one of the best movies I'd ever watched. I'd recommend it, but be wary that it isn't the kind of film to sink well with everyone.8/10 Exceptional",Princess Mononoke
459,volko,Epic and fantastic!,9,19 August 2001,"I have never before seen such a beautiful work of Japanese animation!!!

Wonderful!",Princess Mononoke
460,h_jin3,Disappointed Miyazaki Fan,4,2 November 2001,"Miyazaki is truly a genius and so is Jo Hisaishi.  But in this film their ambitious intentions get in the way of what usually turns out to be a moving, inspiring and beautiful film.Mononoke Hime fails in that respect because regardless of what people say about the film's ambivalent perspective on the characters/sides it doesn't really teach us much.  It merely shows it and that doesn't provide any sort of enlightenment any more than reading a horrific episode of war atrocities of a little known faraway land in the newspaper does.  It doesn't go an to emotional level that his other films do.  It merely sits at the ferocious level (or game face) of the characters.  Which is why we can't really cheer or sympathize with any of the sides.  This leads to an indifference regarding all sides and the ending turns out to be unsatisfying as a result. I never really moved by San and Ash, the townspeople, or the Gods. Surprising since I've found other Miyazaki films one of the most moving experiences in cinema matched by only a few films.The music while the most grand of Jo's works is forgettable.  I cannot remember what the soundtrack sounds like.  In contrast, I cannot forget the music of Nausicaa or Laputa.Again the intentions of leaving something unforgettable gets in the way of what these two artists were accustomed to doing and ultimately turns out to be this film's downfall.",Princess Mononoke

465,Killah Kiwi,Enchanted,10,1 July 2002,"This is an anime that is simply so beautiful that even if it didn't have all of the other great elements that make up this wonderful film, it would still be great to watch.This movie is over 2 hours long, but I never felt like it dragged on unnecessarily. The story isn't amazing, but is above par nonetheless. The movie seemed to flow at a good pace, and never got confusing. The sound is definitely one of the great parts of the film. I watched the dubbed version, with an all-star cast of Claire Danes, Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson, and others, and the voice acting was simply amazing, and the other sounds, such as bows firing and trees falling were also very well done.
The best part of the movie has to be the art. It is so well done that it gives the movie a magical feel. Not a Disney magical, but an entirely new and more enchanted magical feel. The large open areas, and the close-ups were both beautiful, and the animation was superb. Overall I'd recommend this film, maybe not to people under 12, because it does have some violence and blood. I give it a 10/10, the slight weaknesses are more than overshadowed by the strengths.",Princess Mononoke

I don't know if ""silence"" is shown in any other movie,like it is shown in that ancient wood. Watching the film, you f e e l this silence. - I also liked the details - the plants, for example!

You can enjoy being in a wood in a new way, after watching this film. - By the way - The ""Emishi""- people really existed, and they were not the ""Ainu"". I heard, they lived in Hokkaido, too.

468,larsson-879-705964,Impressiv but Flawed,8,23 May 2011,I love Hayao Miyazaki and this movie stand well together with his other works. The films environmental commentary is subtle but very effective. the story is rich on unexpected turns & twists that keeps your intress awake. The character animation is great & many of the backgrounds are beautifully animated. The film is also not afraid to break the usual movie clichés to be more dramatic & original. As for flawes. I found Ashitaka to be a rather uninteresting protagonist (nothing more than a stereotypical hero). Some scenes are also less visually impressive than others. The thing I love most about this movie is that non of the characters are truly evil but has reason to do what other characters call evil.,Princess Mononoke

The vignette structure makes it feel like an epic set in a larger universe, and yet we still have a narrative tied together by our five major characters. Fortunately, those characters all have both a gradual period of introduction that provides some depth, as well as their own arc. The classic Miyazaki style of animation (with a few touches of CG) sets the stage well and provides for some stunning visuals. The voice work for the English dub does everything I'd hope to keep up with the animation.This movie isn't perfect as a film that uses visual elements to subtly tell a story in as rich a way as possible, but it is perfect as a film that engrosses the viewer in a fantastic universe by sending a hero on an epic quest through that universe.",Princess Mononoke
472,derlith,Wonderful!,9,7 January 2005,"I have never been a big fan of anime, but two weeks ago i saw Spirited Away on television. I can admit that i was stunned. It was so much more beautiful then the Disney/Pixar movies. After i had seen Spirited Away i tried frantically to find Princess Mononoke on the internet.Princess Mononoke is a story about a prince named Ashitaka. He goes on a journey to find a cure for Tatarigami's curse. On the journey he finds himself in the middle of a war between a human Iron-town and the gods of the woods. He also meets Princess Mononoke, a girl who is raised by wolves and is filled with hate against humans.I think Princess Mononoke was even better than Spirited Away. It outclasses its Hollywood-synonym, Lord Of The Rings. The plot is very good. The soundtrack is amazing, it's a shame that the Academy Award didn't notice it. The animation is beautiful, especially the characters. The only thing i can complain about is the English dubbing. Billy Crudup does a splendid job as the voice of Ashitaka, but they could really have chosen a better alternative than Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo.Overall i give this movie 9 out of 10.",Princess Mononoke

Now, without further ado, let us talk about the film itself.It is beautifully animated, good dubbed(for me at least!);wonderful dialogues and the main characters really have the control over the rest, and the talking beasts do take a good place in the scenes.Overall,there will be action;there will be love;there will be plots and counterplots.Amid all of this,the forest beings and human beings hang perilously in the Nature's balance, as each of them endeavours to achieve its goal.",Princess Mononoke
474,cyber___,Possibly the greatest animated movie of all time,10,27 June 2013,"Visually, Princess Mononoke shines right off the bat. The design and movement of the demonic boar god is among the most impressive bits of animation I've come across. In addition to the fluid and gorgeous animation, the action is done so well it will immediately pull you in. And we will witness several more sequences of this caliber before the end. Fortunately, it's beauty and action are merely the outer shell of it's brilliance. The most impressive aspect of Princess Mononoke is its ability to display each side of every conflict – and how well it all ties in with the movie's core theme: Man Vs. Nature. We understand what both the people of Iron Town and the inhabitants of the great forest fight for and why. We sympathize and even root for both sides to win. Even Jigo – the main antagonist – is given clear motivation for his actions, not to mention a likable personality. When speaking of the characters in Princess Mononoke, it has to be mentioned how great the performances are in the English dub. Best are Minnie Driver as Lady Eboshi, Keith David as Okkoto and Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo. Our hero Ashitaka is one of the reasons why this story works as well as it does. He is our viewing platform. We observe everything through his perspective and follow his ideals since he is our hero. He is neutral - so we become neutral. If he would have been fighting solely on one side, the film's ultimate message; man & nature needs to function more cohabit-ably together, or all will perish - would have differed greatly.In the end I'll simply say that Princess Mononoke is one of the greatest animated movies ever made.

Not only is the storyline unique, but the animation is incredible. It has a moral/theme that many adults cannot yet contemplate, and the visuals astound you. The characters are very well formed; I love that nobody's perfect here. Everybody is overwhelmed by their emotions at least once. The dubbing is good too, and in a way you can relate to all the characters, even the ones who aren't desirable to be. The ""evil"" Eboshi isn't that much evil as she just doesn't realize what she is doing, and San is only trying to find her place. The quotes are memorable, as well as the strong themes that exist here. I am telling you, I have seen people in shock of the beauty and color of the morals in this movie. It will just astound you. Those who don't like this work of art don't have to waste their time writing a review, since others would do good not to pay heed.

The film shows the side of nature, emotion, brutality, and humanity that most have never seen before. The towns and villages are filthy, hazardous places, while the forests are clean, fresh and beautiful. Everything is a treat to the eye. The dialog is great. The story is original. I enjoyed it very much, and it remains one of my all-time favorites.

Anywhoo for those who don't know what the heck I'm talking about I'm mean how Miyazaki always focuses on saving nature or how people are destroying nature and forests. (See Grave of the Fire Flies to really get me) If you like a Miyazaki movie that has good action and a sort of romance this is your movie. I give it an 8.5 of 10.

I used to watch it when I was very young (born 1999), and couldn't remember the least about it until a friend brought up a bunch of movies he used to watch when he was younger. After having my memory jogged I tracked it down, not the least bit surprised to find it in the top 30 of a bunch of lists. Perhaps a portion of my affection for this movie is the nostalgic trip I went on through watching it recently. Regardless, I was only more awe-struck to watch it. It was everything I hoped it to be, an absolutely amazing story of good vs evil, man against nature and values clashing against values.

There is a general tendency among adult audience to not take animation seriously, but I would be shocked if this movie did not leave a huge impact on anyone. This is one of my first reviews on IMDb, this movie has to be watched and internalized by everyone who is concerned about her future. If anything can move humanity to not inflict further harm and damage against mother Nature, it is this movie. If mother Nature had a form,it would closely resemble what Miyazaki has created in this movie. Even the thought of this movie chokes me, the stark unending sadness truly captures what Nature's wildlife is going through because of human activities.

This film totally lived up to what people said it was. The emotions I got while watching this film made it definitely worth watching. I would recommend watching the Japanese version with English subtitles though, I tried watching the English version and it didn't really have good voice acting for certain characters, because of this I didn't get the same feelings I always got when watching the Japanese version. The soundtrack is the most perfect soundtrack I have ever heard, there was not one song I didn't like. The film is beautiful, the visuals have aged well too. Everything felt on point, as I said the film gave very good emotions as I said, but it was after the film that it completely hit me with emotions, and it changed my worldview, in a good way. Never has a film hit me with emotions as much as this one. The film sends off a very good message about hate and what it does to people. I swear if you watch this film you are going to have an extremely hard time finding a better one, it's just that good, the film is unique. I rate this film so high that it goes beyond the boundaries of this scale of 1/10 and reaches another scale of 1/10 in which it gets the rating 11/10. My most favorite film ever.

The first half of the movie is great,protagonist gets to know the world around and understand the situation.After that he should be able to discern good from evil,just bcuz she saved a few prostitutes doesnt make this lady ebola a good person.You may think she had a change of heart but world doesnt work like that,she will continue her usual stuff.Also the monk has gone pretty much unpunished and hasnt even had a change of heart.so freaking stupid.",Princess Mononoke
484,Zak-9,A different movie between the ones of Miyazaki,10,25 May 2000,"I saw Mononoke Hime in Japan, on videotape, one year after its release (1998), and I found it fantastic. I knew other Miyazaki's works, always excellent, but this one is different from others. Music gives the idea of holy scenery of movie, surrounded by realistic colours. Genious like Miyazaky can't stop me of wonder!",Princess Mononoke
485,Whizbang,English dub wasn't too bad,9,10 November 1999,"Having now seen both the Japanese version and the English dub, I can say that the dub wasn't too bad.  Sure, I had problems with some of the voices, and humor was a little overemphasized, but it could have been a lot worse. I thought Minnie Driver as Eboshi was the only voice that really fit. Ashitaka and San came across as timid at times, lacking in intensity. Jigo's twang actually worked for the most part, with the exception of some out of place one-liners.  I'm very glad the fantastic soundtrack was kept, although two songs were redone in English.  The bgm played during the first fight with the tatarigami was oddly muted in the English dub, detracting from urgency of the scene, which was important to set the pace for the remainder of the film.  But despite minor quirks I still loved it. Mononoke Hime on the big screen is a wonder to behold.  As it stands, the English version of this magnificent film is excellent viewing that will appeal to wide audiences.",Princess Mononoke
486,nihon,An excellent climax to Miyazaki's career!,10,15 December 1998,"This is one of the most visually-stunning films I have ever seen. The story is paced well; the action is well done; I recommend this movie to anyone!The story follows Ashitaka, a warrior who must find a cure to the curse he received at the hand of a dying god. His journey takes him to western Japan where he finds San, a human girl raised by the giant wolf-god, Moro. She is engaged in a deadly war with Eboshi, leader of a clan of iron-worker.I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it. Suffice it to say that anyone, including those unfamiliar with Japanese animation, will find this to be a thrilling, action-filled adventure. The movie does contain scenes of graphic violence, so I suggest parental discretion.---n",Princess Mononoke
487,noah131,Amazing animation,9,21 April 1999,"The art in this movie is like none I've ever seen in an anime before.  The first time I saw it, I saw it in Japanese without someone to translate, and the art kept my attention.  The colors are amazing, but even more amazing is the attention to detail.  It is not too often that background animations are done, and even less often complex background animation.  And I've never seen many workers all completely animated in full detail in the background for a few minutes like I did in this movie.  This was the amazing part to me. Perhaps Miyazake's best film so far, it definitely lives up to his name. Not only is the art amazing, but the plot is as good as mythical creature plots come.  An anime worth seeing not just by anime fans alone.  I just hope Disney doesn't screw it up in its American release.",Princess Mononoke
488,rslavin,technically and thematically superior to any Disney film,10,13 June 2002,"Rich colours, a beautiful and wide variety of scenery, interesting species and individuals -- as a spectacle this movie lacks nothing. And its intriguing storyline and ambiguous moral message make it more challenging than most other mass-market films. A stirring soundtrack completes the package to make this the only movie so far I've given a perfect 10.",Princess Mononoke
489,mcsidious,Skip Pokemon and see this.,10,19 November 1999,"Really one of the best movies of the year, animated or otherwise. Princess Mononoke (or Mononoke Hime to all of you fanboys) is a wonderful example of anime freed from cliches and stereotypes. Plus it shows that English dubbing can be done right with decent actors, although I'm sure the story is better in the original Japanese. If you haven't seen this movie, why not!? Go to the one theater in 100 miles showing it and show them you support theatrical anime in the US! The only bad thing that can be said about this movie is that Miramax is doing a horrible marketing job. ONE theater in the Washington DC area? Is that a sad joke? See this now! If Princess Mononoke doesn't make any money, the only anime we'll get is Pokemon 2....",Princess Mononoke
490,LordLeto,Hayao Miyazaki's Masterpiece,10,27 May 2001,"Let's get a couple of things straight before I start this review.  One, I'm an avid anime fan and a fan of Miyazaki-sama's from long before.  Two, I'm also an otaku, a name that many serious anime fans frown upon as some American geek who thinks he knows something about anime, buys all the dubbed tapes, and throws around buzzwords like Dragonball Z.  Well, that's not the definition that I would use for myself...I love anime, but alas, I am limited to dubbed tapes that I buy at Suncoast.  That is, until I bought a DVD player.  Just buying my first DVD player (and placing it right atop my VCR player that had my Trigun tape in it) I proceeded to recollect my anime collection so that I could have the original seiyuu with the literal translations on subtitles...I bought Mononoke Hime, a movie I had seen before, but never in true Japanese, and that is why I write today...Mononoke Hime is the epic of Ancient Japan at the turn of the Iron Age, in a world filled with mystical spirits with larger than life manifestations throughout the world.  Each forest has a spirit protecting it, and none is greater than the Deer God, the god of life and death.  Our hero, Prince Ashitaka, has come from the West, cursed by a God that had been shot with an iron bullet, to search for the Deer God's healing touch.  He arrives in IronTown (I forget the Japanese name) to find Lady Eboshi, the ruler of the town, slowly incroaching upon the forest, fighting the animal gods and trying to claim more land to draw iron from.  Yet, the conflict doesn't begin there...While in IronTown, a wild girl comes from the mountains on the back of a white wolf, trying to destroy the town and Lady Eboshi along with it. Ashitaka steps in trying to prevent them both from killing each other, and this is where our conflict begins... ....and ends in the same swoop.  There is no clear good and evil.  I repeat: there is no good clear and evil in this movie.  Every side has a real drive for what they are doing, and the typical monolithic evil found in cartoons (which this movie is not, but for comparisons sake, I'll use that word), but a drive for what is best.  The animal spirits of the forests are intelligent, yet they are driven only by the force to protect the forest, not by their own intellect.  Man vs. Nature, Man vs. Man, Man vs. Oneself, all types of conflict are all here.  But, who is evil?  No one...all are human, and that's the point that Miyazaki-sama is trying to get across...Not everyone needs to watch this...by any means, this is not a movie for all.  If you didn't get ""2001"", if you didn't see what the big deal ""American Beauty"" was, if you really hate anime, don't watch this.  This is a confusing and deep movie with real human aspects that our senses have been dulled to by way of children's cartoons.  If you're ready for a deep experience, shell out the money and buy this...you'll get lost in a world so deep you'll never want to return.",Princess Mononoke
491,jasu,The best animated movie I've ever viewed,10,5 October 1999,"I've seen The Princess Mononoke from a taping on video of it's television screening in Japan (early 1999). Though I can't speak fluent Japanese yet, I found the movie to be one of the most captivating animations ever and a truly moving experience. The powerful imagery and heroic portrayal of the main characters San and Ashitaka lingered in my mind for many days after. With the aid of a partial Japanese and full English script from the net, I was finally able to fully understand and therefore appreciate the story.Mononokehime (original Japanese title) is truly a masterpiece from director Hayao Miyazaki, in the tradition of Nausicaa (13 years ago). Ultimately a love story (in my opinion), it also takes a look at a era when Japan was in a state of great change through technology (though not always progression), and parallels the fast and confusing state of the modern world. In these times, there are elements all trying to carve out an existence from a world of depleting resources.The humans in Princess Mononoke wish to create their own safe havens, in which they can live for ever (at the expense of the forests). The forest gods feel their territory ever-receding and wage war to reclaim it. Ashitaka seeks to free himself from a curse of death. San, the Mononokehime is the embodiment of the conflicting mind, torn between humanity and the forest. Through her we see that compromise is not possible, yet for each party to concede defeat is even less a possibility.The movie is so complex, if you wish to delve, but is also as an animation, the most visually stunning. The animation is flawless, and the backgrounds perfect and every attention to detail is given. After watching this film, other animated movies seem truly flat. The film is also violent, and I hope that no scenes are cut from it (I understand it is being distributed by Miramax), and also fear that hype surrounding the high profile voice actors might draw attention away from the true significance of this film.I look forward to watching it at the cinemas. If only I could find an Australian release date somewhere. This was written at the spur of the moment.",Princess Mononoke
492,jammrock,A beautiful animated movie that looks into human nature.,10,22 November 1999,"Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke in the USA) is an absolutely breath taking film.  I recommend this film to everyone, even people that normally would not like animated movies.  As a quick note, this is a MOVIE that is ANIMATED.  It is NOT a Cartoon, a cheesy Disney-esque animation or a traditional Anime (Anime is a type of Japanese animated feature).  Don't go to this movie expecting to see our hero break into song and dance, because it isn't going to happen.  MH is rated PG-13 for a good reason, there is quite a bit of animated violnce, but nothing really grotesque (thus it is not an R rated movie).MH's story revolves mainly around 3 types of people.  San, who is Princess Mononoke, was raised by the Wolf goddess Moro and is a defender of the forest.  San hates all humans (eventhough she is human herself) and is trying to drive the humans out from the forest.  Lady Eboshi is the self made master of Iron Town.  She doesn't care about the forest or the creatures that live there.  She is an indusrialist and pretty much wants to rule Japan.  Ashitaka is a Prince from a long since forgotten and nearly destroyed clan of Japan.  Ashitaka is the mediator of the conflict and fights for both sides in hopes that everyone will eventually get along. The whole story revolves around these 3 personalities and combined make an excellent movie.I have not seen the original Japanese version of the film, just the American dub, but for a dubbed movie, it is excellent (and trust me, I have seen a lot of anime and usually the dubbed versions are horrible).  Some people may be a bit upset with it, but anyone who can't speak a word of Japanese, I see no troubles.  A must see film in my book.",Princess Mononoke

I came out this movie wondering why this movie never did any better.",Princess Mononoke
497,vegserv,Holy $#!@% do I hate anime!,1,22 April 2001,"Let me start off by informing you of my prejudice against anime.  I don't have any conceptual or philosophical differences with it, it just grates on my nerves.  Nonetheless, I felt compelled to watch this movie, given the rave reviews by critics, its acclaim by the film students I know, its notable American voiceover stars, and the fact that my stoner friends popped it in the DVD player so it was either watch it or leave.Well, several root-canal painful hours later I felt I could hate anime in a whole new light.  I came away thinking that the movie did indeed have impressive animation that I still find obnoxious and tackled some environmental issues in a heavy handed way.  I thought that if American drawn characters could have been put onto the lusciously drawn backgrounds and the shrill jeremiads the characters were always launching into replaced with more subtle dialogue then I could at least give it a 5 out of 10 for not completely p***ing me off.But lo and behold I was wrong.  Or so I was informed by some pretentious anime fan.  Apparently all the environmental subject matter is really just a Western construct being super-imposed onto the movie by audiences who don't understand Shinto mythology.  Well Lah-dee-frickin-dah.  You mean I didn't even understand it?  Excuse me for not having a degree in Asian studies, but I don't think that should be a requirement to see friggin cartoon.  Am I uneducated and insensitive to Japanese film making?  Have I misunderstood Kurosawa's movies all these years?  Was I suckered in by the lack of constant yelling and screaming?  Was I merely projecting Western values onto his characters?  Or was he really a genuinely good director who could make movies about people from another place and time that transcend seemingly disparate cultures?Luckily, I don't think this film will ever supersede cult status so the rest of us who are too ""mainstream"" won't have to suffer through it again. Call me crazy, but I like the Coen Brothers, Coppola, Levinson, Whit Stillman, and of course Kurosawa.",Princess Mononoke

After seeing this for the first time, I could see why so many animators (especially disney animators) consider Mr. Miazaki a GOD! His animation style has the best ""flowing motion"" I have ever seen.The American dubbing team, whoever they are did an excellent job picking voices, they got top notch actors to do the job right (unlike most animes today). They even took on the hair-pulling task of RE-ANIMATING the mouth movements to match!This is by far one of the best films I have ever seen.",Princess Mononoke

500,songcoyote,Stunningly beautiful and though-provoking story!,10,25 November 2000,"Mononoke Hime (aka Princess Mononoke) is in my personal top ten movies of all time.  The screenplay by Gaiman is fantastic, the dubbing job is just incredible, and the story is most definitely not your standard ""good vs. evil"" fare.In addition to all that, the movie is absolutely beautiful.  I fell in love with the animation in the first couple of minutes when I saw Ashitaka (the male lead) climb a wooden watchtower - a beautiful piece of human motion. And the backgrounds!  Most other movies, live action included, pale in comparison.This movie may be a bit heavy for really young children, but is so thought-provoking that I would recommend it for anyone over about 5 years old.  A feast for the eyes and ears that should not be missed!",Princess Mononoke
501,alb_4,Outstanding example of the anime art.,10,12 December 2000,"Once again, proof positive that reality is for people who cannot handle fiction.  Writer Miyazaki cleverly shows that life is not black and white, as one might assume from watching Western animation and movies.  There is an interesting interplay of the forces of Good and Evil which shows that life is not merely black and white, but several shades of grey.  Western movies and Western tastes want and need a clearly defined good guy and bad guy. Unfortunately, reality is not this way and this movie shows it.This movie was the largest grossing movie in Japan (until ""Titanic,"" that is) with good reason.  The animation is of an amazing quality.  The plot is better than most live action movies.  There are many concepts dealt with, such as Man's place in the world viz. other men and viz. nature.If you like deep movies with substance, then this is one for you.",Princess Mononoke

How about that it really sucks to live in a country where beautiful animation like this is so unappreciated and goes unnoticed by the general public...hmm, actually, I think that might have been said already.  Hayao Miyazaki is a genius...nope, that's been said too.Anyways, the reason this movie is my number one pick is because it so refreshing to get away from the predictable Hollywood plots, characters, and motives (i.e. to make money).  Also, it has an ending that Hollywood would never think to do.  Princess Mononoke is not just a great movie, it is a work of art.  Miyazaki's works are never simple, as with Mononoke.  A lot of thought goes into the making of this movie, and more importantly, a lot of thought goes into watching it.  It challenges you to think that there is no clear-cut good or evil.  Who exactly is the ""bad guy"" in this flick?  No one knows!  But that's the beauty of it all.......*echh*  I'm going in circles again...Simply put, check this movie out, even if you're not an anime fan.  You'll either love it or like it.  Either way, you're sure to be entertained.",Princess Mononoke

And get this, I'm not much of an anime-fan.  Princess Mononoke has the best features of Anime and best features of American animation in one film.  The story is breath-taking (really!).  It's one of two major reasons why this film is so great.  The other reason is simply the animation in itself.  The Layouts, backgrounds, motions, and characters of this animation is so beautifully made, I could watch it all day.  As many of my friends would know, I don't give ""10"" rating to just any film.

I looked at the ratings demographics, and unfortunately, this trend is somewhat reflected by the scores.  Too many adults look at animation and automatically dismiss it as beneath their taste and interest.This film works on so many levels.  I enjoyed the absolutely stunning animation on the surface while becoming immersed with the powerful and gripping storyline.  For some reason, I couldn't help but remember an old cartoon on Nickelodeon called ""David and the Gnomes"" where a fox named Swift worked in harmony with the people who loved the forest.If anything, Princess Mononoke should remind us of the true beauty of nature.  Irontown is the proverbial New York City, using resources and growing at the expense of the land and wildlife around it.  I have a new appreciation for my mom's gardens after watching this film.This film is the pinnacle of anime.  Wonderfully voiced and beautifully directed, this is a must see for anyone.",Princess Mononoke
508,podiwa,"Timely themes, yet amazing and entertaining.",10,25 January 2002,"Princess Mononoke shows us the way humans seem to be increasingly at war with nature, instead of being part of it. That's the theme, and there is an interesting plot with many complex characters... none are simply good or evil.It's a spectacular movie, the scenery is excellent, but what is most amazing is the animated people and creatures with such exaggerated yet life-like movements, which couldn't really be done with live-action. Princess Mononoke also features enjoyable music by Joe Hisaishi (Hana-Bi), not to mention the best knife-swishing sound effects ever.The producers have clearly gone to a lot of effort to make the movie appealing to western audiences, with actors such as Gillian Anderson doing the voice acting for the english version. However, the dubbed version is not as good as the japanese subtitled version for a number of reasons. Lines are very different, and the voice actors have to keep up with animated mouth movements. The whole culture of the film is different. Is it right to americanise a foreign movie?

513,Aaron D,a triumph and a joy,10,4 June 2001,"This movie is a triumph for animation, and for moviegoers who want that something that is missing from the Disney features we are all familiar with. Hayao Miyazaki has created a wonderful world of full and fleshed out real human characters in a world changing from one of magic and wonder to the more mundane.  I've never felt so much emotion and wonder in an animated picture since watching a little-known animated flick called ""Warriors of the Wind"" (1984), which I'm now convinced must've been made by Hayao as well.Besides the obvious quality voice-talents of Billy Crudup as Prince Ashitaka, and other notables such as Gillian Anderson and Billy Bob Thornton who also do surprisinly good voice overs for main characters, the story itself was in no way swallowed up by the star-power in this film.  As a matter of fact, I was pleased that there were no opening credits... the movie just started right up and put me in it..and left me spellbound for the full 2+ hours. The movie is not about commercial ""wows""; it's a a heartfelt story about the magic of the world fading in the face of humanity as they strive top quickly to ""grow up"". Of particular interest to me is the soundtrack; the music is absolutely wonderful and was responsible for instilling in me the sense of adventure and wonder that pervades this movie, as well as conveying the breadth of emotion this movie contains. While this movie can be enjoyed on a certain level by children, it's plot and theme are very much in the pervue of adults as all the characters basically are at least human in their nature... just trying to hold on to the kind of world they want.  Don't wait another second viewing this... it's a keeper.",Princess Mononoke
514,melvinmah,"Cartoon isn't the word to describe this film, it's pure masterpiece",8,21 May 2001,"Directed by legendary Hayao Miyazaki who is well respected of his work throughout his reel life. I live in Singapore and such imported movies doesn't come cheap. I took the risk of buying an anime hoping it will be a light hearted family cartoon.Darn I was wrong! It was more than incredible and definitely not a family cartoon. Shortly after Ashitaka shot the cursed boar dead in the starting introduction of the film, it went bloody all over and disolved into a carcass immediately. When he was exiled from the village, he travelled west and witnessed a massacre, the first scene began a samurai chopping off a villager's hand. While after another 'hand missing' scene, Ashitaka shot an arrow that whizzed through a samurai's head like an apple of the head in William Tell.That was pure gore and definitely you can't get such actions on Disney or Nickelodeon. The story unfolds the cold truth of how evil Man is. The war between a forest and its Gods against humans who deforest for profitting interests. A love story develop when Princess Mononoke/San took care of Ashitaka when he got injured. Quite touching especially when she chewed the.. erm piece of wood for him to eat? I ain't too sure if that was wood they eating but Ashitaka had great difficulty eating it, even cried.The story isn't that all and it's up to u all to watch the remaining film. Although touching and family oriented, I would rate it for mature audiences as Princess Mononoke is a rather violent film.

The animation is beautiful, and the characters are intriguing. The film breaks down expectations of certain archetypes and makes you empathize with every side of the main conflict.

I was so surprised at how brilliant it was i had to watch it again straight away. Though on first impressions a children's movie its characters have a depth that transcend the works of comparable Disney films and even on occasion is shockingly violent with no distaste. What really makes this film beautiful though is the intricate story interweaving with the stories of the war between the people of Iron Townand the animals, the struggle to comprehend life and death and the impossible romance of Ashitaka and San. The fact that both the humans and the great beasts are shown to be both compassionate and ruthless shows a tragedy that human kindness and natural beauty may not coincide together and this is what gives the film its melancholic tone especially among its breathtakingly drawn action sequences and truly epic ending.",Princess Mononoke

522,amiliah,Wonderful!,10,16 March 2002,"Wow, Mononoke-hime is really one of the best movies I have ever seen, chronicling the fierce protection the forest spirits and two humans have of a beautiful old forest from iron workers in 9th-century Japan.The great wolf-god Moro and her human daughter, San, have discovered the plans of Lady Eboshi and her Iron Town to cut down the trees and destroy their mountain habitat for the iron buried underneath. Not standing for it, they enlist the hekp of all the forest spirits to protect Shishi gami, the very heart of the mountain. Aided also by a wayward prince named Ashitaka, they try to topple Eboshi's plan.At first glance, this would be any other good/evil combat, but Miyazaki has really fleshed out the characters, and really there are no protagonists or antagonists, only people/animals trying their best to survive. The animals will die if the forest is destroyed (duh), but the inhabitants of Iron Town cannot survive without it's only means of acquiring survival goods.I very highly suggest you to rent this movie in either subbed or dubbed format. The dub is quite good for any American theatrical-release foreign language film, and Billy Crudup and Gillian Anderson did wonderful work as Ashitaka and Moro, respectively.",Princess Mononoke

The movie's biggest accomplishment is it's ability to take the viewer through a wide range of emotions during the movie, and to keep you on the edge of your seat without the usual suspense plots. It also has the ability to teach you a moral and relay a massage without being preachy.The English adaptation, as written by neil gaiman, is superb and the voice work is one of the best dubs done in years",Princess Mononoke

528,trackster006,More American Blockbuster than Classic Miyazaki,6,24 June 2021,"If there's one thing I've learned from watching various highly-rated IMDB titles over the years, it's that average score often doesn't correlate to my own personal feelings toward a film. I liken it to the Rotten Tomatoes RT percentage: most everyone may enjoy a film with a top-tier score, but to what extent would be unclear. Such is the case for myself with Princess Mononoke: an enjoyable film with easily identifiable flaws that, if you're anything like me, will diminish the overall viewing experience.Let's start with what is classic Miyazaki: the animation, sound, and presentation quality. Now in the year 2021, it's hard to appreciate just how impressive Princess Mononoke was in those areas back in 1997. Whereas Disney movies tend to overwhelm you with glitz, glamour, and use of motion Japanese films---particularly Miyazaki films---succeed with their use of quiet, highly-detailed scenes. This film is no exception. The background attention to detail is routinely jaw-dropping with repeated viewings mandatory to pick up on all of the little things you may have missed the first time around. But, make no mistake, the film isn't a slouch in the more chaotic scenes, either. Characters run, jump, sprint, and fight in extremely gratifying ways giving such scenes a well-paced flow. The soundtrack of the film is also a selling point, with the main sweeping score highly effective in conveying both scale and emotion.Unfortunately, that's where the Miyazaki comparisons end. The rest of the film features a shallow, predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of subtly in messaging. Whereas other Miyazaki films ooze personality and charm, Princess Mononoke possesses little of either. The dialogue isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination and certain minor characters may elicit a smile from time to time, but I couldn't help but feel disappointed overall. The film doesn't just fail in these regards relative to other Miyazaki films; it fails on its own unique terms independent of its famous director and studio combo. This failure is made even more disappointing when you consider that the plot left room for the exploration of more complex moral themes, but never chooses to move beyond your standard allegory of harmony between nature and humans. A real missed opportunity.If you're someone for whom production quality alone would be enough to raise all tides, you are going to adore this film. But if you're looking for the charm of, say, Kiki's Delivery Service or characters/a plot with any amount of depth, be prepared for mild disappointment.",Princess Mononoke
529,johnnyp77uk,Perfect 10 Simply Epic Possible Spoilers,10,10 April 2003,"This is simply a brilliant film which displays many traits of great anime. The story is brilliant, the characters are conflicted and written with depth and the film has a real moral message. The characters are all human and because of this the film plays better than most films you will see at the local multiplex.  It has all the confusions of the real world, where there is good and bad, but between that there are vast areas of grey.Hollywood rarely has the guts to make a film which has so many issues running through and and where the area good and bad is so muddy.  I also love this film for having such a strong spiritual side something which Oriental films are generally very good at and which they should be applauded for, but which other industries rarely touch.There are many parallels with The Lord of the Rings, dare I say it, a young boy leaves a small almost unknown village to tackle a force of extreme spiritual and physical power of which he carries part of with him on his travels.  As he makes his way he take's on many dangers and faces many conflicts with him and within himself.   Both films also play out a battle between nature, the land, and the world of the future, industry which is coming in the film.  It is more obvious in Princess Mononoke, but it is an obvious metaphor in LOTR as well.If you didn't know Studio Ghibli who made this wonderful anime, ploughs all it's resources into every film it does.  So much so that if one film was a failure the Studio would go bust, that shows real faith to put in a film, if other film industries and studio's put so much on line, then we would see a great shift towards quality rather than quantity. In my dreams.And respect the original film if you have the chance, so just as it's best to watch Live Actions Films in Letterbox format so it's best to watch anime with subtitles in your chosen language with the audio on Japanese.  This is how the director wished it to be seen.  Watching the film with Gillian Anderson and Billy Bob Thornton, much as I respect them, dubbing it reduces the film to the style of a Pokemon cartoon which I abhor.  Call me an anime snob, but it's true. Oh and firstly this kicks big ass piles of sand in Forrest Gump's face, that argument is such a non-starter.  It deserves to be in the top 200.  And two this beats anything the US can do animation wise hands down, no wonder. This has everything animation, and films, should be in spades and then some. Watch and believe.",Princess Mononoke
530,YumeTenshi,Beautiful and perfect,10,13 June 2003,"I love this movie, it is my favorite.This movie is great. It takes place in ancient times, but it has a twist of fantasy(like with demons and gods and whatnot.) It whisks you into a different world from the moment you push play, but yet at the same time it is quite realistic and accurate. It's accurate all the way down to the number of arrows in Ashitaka's quiver. Even the people who usually don't like anime would like this movie, I think.The art in this movie is just amazing.This creator creates beautiful movies, so for all those art admirers, I would definately suggest this movie and the other Miyuzaki movies, like Spirited Away and Castle in the Sky.",Princess Mononoke
531,pjjeppson993,"A mature, intelligent animated film",10,11 November 2011,"Hayao Miyazaki (sorry if i spelt the name wrong) is a master film maker. I was first introduced to him through a Cartoon Network airing of 'Howl's Moving Chastle'. I loved the magic of the film and wanted to share it with everyone I knew. My mom in particular enjoyed its whimsical and fantastical world. Although it was made in Japan it felt like it equally garnered to the western audience. Yesterday I bought 'Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime')' and was brought back to a world of fantasy. The film starts out with Ashitaka defending his village from a possessed boar. He ends being struck by the demon and receives a curse on his arm. He then starts a travel to the west to find a cure and hopefully retain his life. Along the way he encounters many interesting and complex characters. I say complex because no one is really evil (or good for that matter) in this movie. When you look at it from the character's perspective they all want something that they deem is correct. The story deals with many themes such as enviormentalism, spirituality, and even what makes your identity. The art here is top of the line. When you watch this movie you feel like you've been in the mind of a genius (and you would be correct with that assumption). The animation is smooth and expressive throughout. The visuals for the spirit of the forest are immaculate. The English dub is hailed as one of the best ever done with Billy Bob Thortan, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, and Claire Danes. Billy Crudup in particular gave the performance a nice touch. The score is also excellent. I'm under the impression that score is the most important facet of a motion picture and it doesn't disappoint. 'Journey to the West' the main theme of the picture is very well done and will literally take your breath away when you hear it for the first time. For those with kids you may want to preview it first before you let children under the age of eleven or so watch. It is quite gory at times. But if your progeny are mature enough to watch this film please give them the gift of seeing what animation is capable of. This movie has a fair chance of putting 'Ben-Hur' at number two on my list.",Princess Mononoke

The humans are after the rich resources from the land, while the animal spirits just want to keep their forest and survive. A young man comes into the village and attempts to solve the problems and calm the warring spirits.Being a foreign film (Japanese), it was really good to find that the quality of the English dub was actually better than the subtitled versions I've seen.

It is a complex story to sum up in a paragraph, but let's just say that it strongly parallels Japaneese mythology. It is a story involving an epic struggle between the gods (animals) of the forest and the humans who are encroaching on their territory. There is no easy answers in this movie and the question - ""Where does man fit in the grand scheme of things on this planet?"" comes to mind on several occasions. A terrific movie with a terrific message. Long viewing time (around 2hr 20 min) so not for kids, but high schoolers and up should be quite enthralled.",Princess Mononoke

I won't give away any spoilers about the plot, you'll just have to watch it for yourself.I was a little repulsed by some of the stuff in it though, some parts are quite graphic and gross. My mum could hear me every now and then in the next room going 'thats disgusting!' If you are particularly squeamish, I wouldn't watch it. I don't know how many under 10's would like it, if I had been ten when I had first seen it, it probably would of freaked me out, its a very grown up film, dealing with quite grown up issues, I think adults and teenagers would get more out of it than kids would, its not happy little elves singing in trees, its a film that is quite brutal at times.Director Hayao Miyazaki is a genius, he must have the most incredible imagination, he's a great story teller.

It was both dark and wonderful, and I was little scared when first watched it. I love to get lost in the world of Princess Mononoke which is so greatly presented that looks like it really exists. It's outstanding both in animation and story and has soul and meaning in it, with great soundtrack. I'm a little sad when think of it, because it brings childhood memories. It has so special meaning for me, my life wouldn't be the same without this movie.

537,pparker_7,"not perfect, but pretty close",9,3 December 2004,"Action? Adventure? Romance? History? Sci-Fi? I think I know how to please all those tastes. Now,I'm not a fan of Japanese animation. I find the characters and stories of most anime movies quite over the top. However, this movie completely blew me away. I can sum up my perception of this movie in this sentence: It's not perfect, but it's not far from it either. Everything about this movie is astounding. The animation is an amazing, the music is beautiful, the characters are very interesting, but the story is by far the best feature of this film. I won't give anything away, because I just wouldn't be able to do it justice. It does deal with a lot of Japanese mythology, and that might turn some people off, but it didn't bother me, or take anything away from the movie. It's also a bit violent, so I wouldn't recommend it for young children. Another great aspect of this movie is that they got the voice's perfect. Voices are contributed by Claire Danes, Billy Crudup, Billy bob Thorton, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver, just to name a few. And it's done so well, you would never suspect that it was dubbed.This movie introduced me to Hayao Miyazaki, the writer and director. He's a legend in the animation industry, and almost a god in the Japanese film industry. It seems that Miyazaki just can't make bad movies. He was also responisible for Spirited away, and Castle in the sky, two anime movies that made quite an impact worldwide. So if it's action, or adventure, or romance, or sci-fi...heck, this movie has got it all, so you can't go wrong.",Princess Mononoke

The bad guys get away with it. A sad ending that leaves you in painful confusion.
If you like animals very much, stay away from watching this movie, which doesn't make much sense other than causing pain, anger and shame ... and with an almost unbearable ending.",Princess Mononoke
539,TheBitingMovieJunkie,A great masterpiece for The Master,10,1 December 2014,"This film is a project that comes from far away. Designed by Miyazaki already at the end of the Seventies, he prefer to it the also wonderful The Castle in the Sky. It returns in his hands at the beginning of the Nineties and he decides to make it, also facing a period of writer's block caused by too many similarities to films released in the twenty years in the middle, finally he decides to give the story an almost mythological cut, while inserted in a historical setting. Miyazaki starts the production, for the most part of it in traditional 2D animation with computer use in only two occasions: for five minutes of scenes particularly complex and 10% in the making of the color, the rest is all strictly made by hand. The Master has approved personally each of the 144,000 frames in the film, as well as he made the storyboard and the character design. Therefore from this great job it follows an impressive fantastic tale, one of the most ambitious works of the director, of strong moral rigor, that touches all of his big issues, all dear and always present in his filmography, lowered into the fascinating backdrop of medieval Japan (The Muromachi Period, ranging from 1336 to 1573 approximately). The film features the usual magical and indescribable aura that hovers over every work of The Master of Japan animation, capable like no one else to excite with a genre unfairly undervalued and often mistreated. Focuses on the struggle between humans and spirits of the forest, is the symbolic fantastic expression through which to pass a wanted ecologist message, so fundamental in every works of Miyazaki, in a fairy tale instructive, not boring or verbose despite the length, strongly influenced by Shintoism. The message, however, is not its only strength, as always also the backgrounds are of an unparalleled beauty, the characters have complex and multifaceted personality, there is no clear distinction between good and evil, the one is reflected in the other and vice versa, no one is innocent, nor among humans or among animals. All are fighting for a cause, right or wrong. Everyone has weaknesses. Are vital characters, some of the most beautiful characters in the filmography of Miyazaki.

So I watched Princess Mononoke last week and I was truly enchanted by the beauty and magic of this movie. The film is set in medieval Japan and tells the story of a young prince who kills a doomed boar and is know doomed himself. So he goes to an old forest in which the god of the forest lives, so the god can save him. But there is a war between nature and mankind with his technology and machines. Of course he has to join in and gets to know princess Mononoke. But if you think this is only a lame ""save the nature"" flick, you are wrong. No one in this movie is entirely good or bad, even the ""bad lady"" has her reasons and also are the ""good ones"" sometimes really selfish. Although they are all likable. And this is the point of the movie: You always have to find a compromise before it is too late.

In this movie, for my point of view, nobody is a bad guy and a good guy.Everyone live on what they believe in and express on they are living for. All the characters have different strength and different way of living but they all are same in just one thing, its called ""HOPE"".They live what they hope for and eager on what they believe.

The other positives are maybe that it's cannot be fully understanded - that's what I love in Miyazaki.

Miyazaki's long infatuation with technology verses nature and man's relation to God (or gods) weave throughout the film as does his trend for strong women characters. Even with the language barrier, the film is of such intense emotion that it caries you through to the end. The change in dynamic between the crashing fight scenes and the quiet scenes of healing by the lake is so broad and so well paced that I can't remember a film where my emotional state was so expertly varied.If you have a chance to see this film, in any language, I recommend you do.",Princess Mononoke

As some of you may have noticed, that movie was intensely disappointing. Perhaps Lucas got greedy, but I was turned off of movies for a time, until I learned that the best movies are frequently not made by big Hollywood studios. Do animated films from Disney seem simplistic? There's the strong, individual protagonist; the totally vilified enemy; the small, cute, funny sidekick; and the formulaic plot; not to mention the irritating versions of the songs that you will never avoid for the rest of the year. Or, do the romantic comedies leave you embarrassed for the characters and annoyed at the writers? Do action films leave you disgusted at the glorified violence? Predictability is a staple of big studio American films, and personally, I am no longer surprised that my two favorite movies this year came from overseas, Lola Rennt from Germany, and Mononoke Hime from Japan. We begin with a spectacular blend of detail and simplicity in the animation style, and we are drawn into the film with a village attacked by a demon, defeated at a cost for our hero, who is sent to find the evil's source-- and then good and evil fade in to shades of grey that are rarely seen in American films. Characters have too many dimensions for our country's movie viewers, and we are disturbed by the frustratingly unpredictable sequence of events. And yet one scene seems to follow naturally from the last. Virtually every aspect of the movie was astonishing, and almost all of those were pleasantly so. If only Hollywood would give us some credit.Of course, this movie is not for everyone. This movie wasn't sent to America for years because the Japanese creators of the film knew that true American movie themes were not honored very respectfully. Only after it became the second highest grossing film in Japan was an American release considered. If you find talking animals in an animated film disturbing, then you may find this one to be too much for you (along with most Disney films, which have little in common with Princess Mononoke in other respsects, which I'll get to next). If you want to know the end of a movie before it happens, or if you want to focus on the romance between the male and female leads, or if you want the bad guys to die and good to triumph in a blood bath, or if you love the countless other elements that thrive in American films; well, don't see Princess Mononoke. It's not for you. Otherwise, I'll see you at a film festival sometime.",Princess Mononoke

558,FromTom,One of the best animation movie ever.,10,31 October 1999,"The magic of Miyazaki's touch is at work here. While kids may like it for the action and characters, I suppose it's better not to take them see this movie because of the 'gore' scenes. But for teenagers and adults, it is a great help to understand some important aspects of japanese culture.And without that, the quality of animation, the beauty of the backgrounds, the original plot are worth seeing. If Disney could come back to match those, which they have lost since the death of Walt, I would surely appreciate their movies again. For the moment, I stick with japanese animation.",Princess Mononoke
559,mika-petri.lauronen,"Well, more praise never hurts!",10,1 November 2000,"Miyazaki has always been THE maker of animated films. His works are intelligent, touching and beautiful to watch. What makes Mononoke Hime so special is that it surpasses all his previous works.I've seen this movie five times on video, with English subtitles. It is still a stunning experience. Not merely beautiful, but a pure work of art. The soundtrack and the sounds have to be heard to be believed. The story is excellent, and... well, you get the picture.Mononoke Hime puts Disney and other western fellows to shame. It will be the ultimate cartoon for years. Even if you do not like animated pictures, take a look at Mononoke Hime. It is an excellent movie by any standards. It will stand (along with Disney's Fantasia) as a classic to which all other animated films will be compared.Thank you, Miyazaki. Thank you very much.",Princess Mononoke
560,SoraKirei,I love this movie!! Miyazaki Rules!!! ^_^,10,3 November 1999,"Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) is a visually spectacular film.  The artwork in this animated feature is really amazing considering 90% was all old style hand drawn and painted cels with the remaining done with computer graphics.  The forests, hills, valleys etc look so alive on the screen. You really feel immersed in this world.This movie is a must see.  The story is deeper than would be expected from an animated film but leave it to Miyazaki to create a film with timeless themes such as coming of age and leaving home, man vs. nature, or relations between different worlds.Hopefully Mononoke Hime will break out of the American stereotype that ""all animation is for children"" AND ""all Japanese Animation is only about sex and violence.""  This is the best Japanese Animation film I have ever seen in visual beauty and story depth.  I hope a lot more people get to see this Miyazaki Masterpiece.",Princess Mononoke

The time they took to draw, write, edit this is time well spent (it must of taken ages), see IT!",Princess Mononoke

563,admin-7,Excellent movie. A must see.,10,5 December 1999,"I really enjoyed this film for several reasons.  It did not have a clear cut 'winner', or beginning/end.  It was a piece, out of a saga that had been going on for years before, and will continue on for years to come.  The characters were wonderful, and they took your emotions on a rollercoaster from excitement, to sadness, and deep feeling.  Don't let the fact that it is animation disuade you from viewing this excellent piece.  It's a world, where there are no limits, and is certainly lives up to expectations.",Princess Mononoke
564,ssj4domo,You HAVE to see this movie!,10,7 December 1999,"With vibrant color, and fluent battle animation this piece of anime was in my opinion, the best animated movie I have ever seen.  I would recommend this movie more to guys because of gory scenes.  If you don't care about your kids seeing violence than take them because there isn't any other explicit content (if you catch my drift).  The story is great which makes for an awesome movie.  You don't have to be an anime fan to like this movie, trust me you'll love it!",Princess Mononoke
565,A2Louie,An amazing movie,10,21 December 1999,"Normally, when someone recommends an anime film to me, I'm a bit leery. After all, there are a lot of anime fans out there who LOVE the style, and will tell me to see films which, honestly, are pretty mediocre.  Add on to that the fact that Mononoke was dubbed, not subtitled, and I was a little bit sceptical. Well, this movie blew my mind.  To call it anime, I feel, demeans it in a way.  Many films may be great anime without being great art.  This was both. Visually, it was stunning, and for once the dubbing was not a liability. When a foreign film is badly dubbed (or badly subtitled, for that matter), it distracts me from many good qualities, and I have to temper my praise for the movie.  The voice actors here were truly quality, and it showed.  I thought that they all did well for themselves, and made the movie a bit more comfortable for me, an english speaker, than had Japanese voices alone been offered. To address plot, I felt that this was where the movie shone.  The film portrayed many characters in many lights... just when you want to hate someone, they have a noble side that brings you up short.  I was initially let down by where the movie went, but upon seeing it again, love it even more.  For me, one of the best aspects of this movie was its feminist quality, something not exactly common in medieval Japan.  If you haven't seen Princess Mononoke, do yourself a favor and make it a point to do so.",Princess Mononoke
566,alvaradj,A true work of art that takes animation to an entirely new level,10,1 February 2000,"I saw Mononoke Hime on its USA release back in late December 1999 under its U.S. title Princess Mononoke.  I had read quite a bit about this film and its director but was still totally overwhelmed by the beauty and brutality of this movie.  The complexity of this movie is something never seen in the United States in an animated movie and even exceeds that of most live action movies as well.  It combines love and hate, war and romance, nobility and deception in ways rarely seen in movies today.  Lines of good and evil are anything but clear cut and in the end is hope but no guarantees, no promises.  This is truly an adult movie but my children, ages 12 to 15 all loved it and talked about it for days later.  Even my wife who holds a strong prejudice against Japanese animation enjoyed this movie.Go and see this movie.  You won't be disappointed.",Princess Mononoke
567,loiku,"very different, very beautiful",9,6 March 2000,"This movie is one of the most beautiful animated movie i've ever seen. It's very different from ""My neighbour Totoro"" and much closer to ""Laputa, the castle in the sky"". The fight between the spirits of the forest and humans discovering steel technology is realistic. I mean, you don't have any good guys or bad guys, only two side fighting for survival. It's the same good Miyazaki's story : Nature versus Technology, or should i say : wrong human use of technology. I didn't mention the incredible direction, design, picture and sound, because it's a Miyazaki movie, the best reference in animation all over the world.",Princess Mononoke
568,joel-82,"Liked it. Good, but not great.",6,28 December 2000,"Overall I liked the film.  It left me wanting to see it again just to capture all that I may have missed the first time.  The dubbed version with American actors was distracting as I kept picturing those actors in the parts rather than letting the story take shape.  I look forward to watching it in the original language on DVD.  The pace of the film is rather slow and repeated viewings is a must if you really desire to appreciate all that the movie has to offer.  In my opinion, it's not for the kiddies as the gore and blood may be too much for them.  Don't let the cover of the dvd fool you. I wouldn't call it ""Star Wars"" of animated features.  It may be ""Star Wars"" because some consider this film the best of animation.  I would consider it good, not great.  I only gave it a 6 out of 10.  See it for yourself and judge for yourself.  But do watch it with an open mind and not too late at night . . . you may need some caffeine for the last half.",Princess Mononoke

This is a unique experience that some people won't understand. I can't blame them because it's so different from that we're used to find in animation. This is the work of a man awaken in his dream.

This is a rare occurrence, indeed (Yes, Pokémon made it, but.. c'mon, it's Pokémon).  I started reading about Princess Mononoke, or, as I soon came to call it, Mononoke Hime, online, and learned about its popularity in Japan.  I was at the theater the day it came out.  Then the next.  Then again during the following week.  And one more time before it left the theater.  I LOVE this movie.  The animation in incredible.  The musical scoring is incredible. I bought the soundtrack and I listen to it in my car all the time.  One final point... finally an anime film with good English voice actors.  I've pre-ordered this off amazon.com.  You should see this movie as soon as possible.  It comes out on DVD on August 30, 2000.",Princess Mononoke

Comparing this movie to some of the other masterpiece that Miyazaki has made it s in my opinion THE absolute best. In the beginning Miyazaki had made the story of a young girl that was forced to marry the wolf god (thus become the Mononoke Hime) as a children's book, but it was rejected at the publisher (a few copies still exists). Later on he used the story as a follow up to Nausicaä (the manga is probably the best ever written), a story about human courage and the pollution of the earth. Most of the production crew of this movie was volunteers working for nothing, and when you know Miyazaki, you understand why. Over all a really great film with beautiful scenery and music, great character designs and high powered action.",Princess Mononoke

Veteran anime film maker Miyazaki once again demonstrates his genius as writer and director of this gem. Even at a lengthy 2 hrs 15 mins this movie goes quickly with as each scene flies by with stunning beauty. The story follows the cursed prince Ashitaka as he finds himself caught in the middle of a war between the industrious Iron Town and the animals and spirits of the forest. The animation is of the highest quality and the characters and locations are rendered with stunning beauty. Although it is not as well known in the US it was Japan's second all time highest grossing film. The movie is more than deserving of this honor. It is one of the best films of its genre ever made and also one of the best films period.",Princess Mononoke
575,Offnor,"As of year 2000, the best film I ever saw. Go see it.",10,17 August 2000,"I went seven times to the theatre to watch this movie. I had never done that before. Globally, I saw this movie with more than twenty different people.Some were nconditional animé fans. Some, like me, liked animé without going up to fandom. Some where here because it was a Studio Ghibli film. Some really did not like this kind of movies, but we had convinced them to at least give the film a try. Some saw it dubbed, because they really hated subtitles, some saw it subtitled, because they really did not like dubbed versions. Some where there for action, other for the japanese 'aura', others to check the quality of modern animation.Every one left the theatre amazed. Me, my friends, the other visitors. The vast majority of people agreed to say this was a great film. The debate was on wether is was ""the"" best film, one of the best films, of ""simply"" a very good one.I strongly suggest you go see it to a theatre, if the film is still played near you. The French distributor had made the audacious move to program the film, for its initial release, in a relatively sparse number of theatre, all of which being high quality theatres, not really accustomed to this kind of movie. The result was incredibly good.But what about the movie?Well, lots of good reviews have already been written, so I do not have many original things to say. I think the most important characteristic of Mononoke-hime is that it embodies characteristics of a wide range of movie kinds. You have a love film, an action film, an animé, an ecological film and a humane film. But it also is a samuraï film and mythological film. It has aspects of documentaries, and of sociological films. And all these kind of movies fit together very well, thanks to the remarkable work of the team at the Studio Ghibli. It could have just been a patchwork of scenes from those different kind of films, just like a film produced to please everyone. But no. Everything fits together perfectly well -- smoothly.I think that one fact is not mentioned enough in the reviews. This film, just like many other Miyazaki productions, gives a very important place to women. Not in the sense of duration or other measure of screen occupation, but in the sense that lots of women I went to see Mononoke-hime with really felt Miyazaki had touched something profound with the role he gives to women. They are not submissive, dedicated to their men. But they do not dominate them, either. They are, in the profound sense of the term, free.In fact, in Mononoke-hime, men and women stand equal, just like human and nature do. Neither wins, they just manage to live together.",Princess Mononoke

But certanly one of the main things is the will of the caracters. Fight without doubt, face the enemy looking right to his eyes, and look inside hiding nothing to yourself. The duty is there to be follow, but not as simple as that, in this movie, you can undrestand the enemy like you´v never done before, and when you do this, How to follow fighting? How to choose a path and go throug?. And I´m very sorry if this comments are a bit bouring, but I´m not a poet, and that is what ""Mononoke Hime"" is all about, the battel, the way, the powers of nature, the magic and the love.",Princess Mononoke

If anyone has ever played ""Jade Cocoon"" for PSX you'd have an idea of what the environment is like in this movie. Very ""ancient Japanese"" in the ways that the people dress, and how they fight. I was suprised that MIRAMAX/Disney included the Japanese dub in 5.1 Dolby as well as English and French. I'm glad Disney took the extra effort to do that. Thats about all I have to say, if you haven't seen it, its worth a rental at the VERY LEAST, but you'd probably buy it anyways.",Princess Mononoke
578,captain_longshanks,Perhaps the most beautiful & tragic film I've seen,10,4 December 2001,"Before this anime, I had seen few anime features.  Transformers the Movie is really entertaining, but even Optimus Prime gets a little old when you're 23.  So I'm not the most well-informed anime critic, but Mononoke has so much more to offer than just good animation.  The images and action in the movie are good though, very clear, and the colors and shading are stunning.Beyond the allure of animation, however, is a fantastic epic.  Seeped in fantasy and mysticism, this is the story of a boy-prince that must go on an arduous and lengthy journey to uncover and stop a great evil.  That evil ends up being the selfish,violent, unyeilding hunger for power/status/possesions of humanity.This story does much to speak to the sad state of humanity's ability to coexist with nature and lack of understanding of its place in the world and the inherent right of all life to flourish unmolested by the destructive arrogance of men.",Princess Mononoke
579,ozzyme,Maybe the Best Animated Film,10,5 March 2006,"I have always loved animated film and cartons, but this film truly blew me away. To me this film is the animated film version equivalent of Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'. The film creates a world in such detail than the viewer feels as if he/she has been there. The film is beautifully drawn from characters to backgrounds. The characters are not as simplistic as one-dimensional cartoon characters, i.e. the hero is all-good and the villain is pure evil. The two main combatants, Princess Mononoke and Lady Eboshi are shades of gray, thought personally I love the character of Lady Eboshi. The ending also is not cartoonish in that everything is not tried up into a neat little package at the end. See this picture with an open mind and hopefully you will find it as enjoyable as I did.",Princess Mononoke

I sat up having nothing to do, and just for fun I thought I might watch this new movie I had, Mononoke Hime. I started out just wanting to see a little of it, 'cause I was really tired at the moment. But the story kind of took hold of me, and I was sucked in. I sat up, watching the whole movie, even though I was dead tired.I think the reason this movie is so good, is because the storyline is so amazingly good. In the start you get fired up from the actionpacked start, and you get curious what is to happen with this boy.Personally, I'm a great fan of fantasy movies, and this one is exactly that. In addition I've started to like animemovies too, and seeing my two interests joining powers in this great piece of anime art, is simply wonderful!",Princess Mononoke

I never figured out where this movie was headed, and in the end, I was disappointed and confused.This movie is too violent for kids, and too tedious for adults.

This is a beautifully constructed and realised film.  It has a complex visual style and storyline, with an almost unrelenting pace.  That said, there are moments of simplicity and silence that are absolutely breathtaking.See the Japanese language version of this film.  There is a certain feel to the film with the original voices that cannot be matched no matter how good Crudup, Anderson, et al might be.  The passion and emotion brought to the roles of Ashitaka, San and Eboshi by Matsuda, Ishida and Tanake are commendable and very powerful, even if you are not able to understand the language.

587,PC_Girl_1,"Beautiful, lush and moving",10,12 October 2002,"Without a doubt, Hayao Miyazaki is the most inventive and incredible director in or outside Hollywood.When I heard that ""Princess Mononoke"" had opened in Japan in 1997, I was anxious to see it. However, when I learned which company had the rights to the North American distribution (Miramax, a division of Disney), I was disappointed.True to my expectations, the dub was horribly miscast. Billy Crudup's emotionless Ashitaka was unbelievable, Claire Danes degraded San's noble character with a whiny tone and Billy Bob Thornton was the worst choice of the bunch, with a Texan accent that destroyed the character and the setting.However, even this all-star Hollywood cast could not completely dampen the superior art and story of the film.
(Plot details, not quite spoilers):The film follows Ashitaka, a prince of a disappearing tribe, who is cursed by a boar god and must journey to the west to find a cure. Along the way, he encounters San (The Princess Mononoke), a young human woman fighting to protect the forest and Lady Eboshi, the head of Tatara Ba (Iron Town). Ashitaka is forced to find a middle ground between the two ambivalent forces.Although it is an animated film, parents should be aware that, yes, there is violence in the film - but is it possible to depict a war without blood?Based on Japanese folklore, ""Princess Mononoke"" is a riveting piece which is moving and touches upon subjects that are still relevant today - questions of war, ecology, morals and principles.If you're looking for a film with beauty, culture and an actual plot, watch ""Princess Mononoke"" - and find a subbed version.",Princess Mononoke

The relationship between the people of the iron town, and the inhabitants of the forest show to the viewer that if we don't respect nature, then it will fight back, and we will not win.

The plot was at first a bit confusing, this is a movie that you have to watch more than twice: Its hard to get at first.With beautiful backgrounds, carefully chosen seiyuus, Mononkoe Hime entertains both adults and kids.The first time I watched Princess Mononoke, I was a bit confused about the characters. I wasn't sure what was going on, and who was this movie about again, who is this ""Mononoke Hime"". But as I watched this movie over and over again, the plot started opening, and I began to understand and realize things I didn't notice before. I have always loved the way Miyazaki draws his characters expressions. Unlike some other anime movies I've seen, Miyazakis characters are more easier to read. And this is where the difference of reality and cartoons steps in. Its easy to overdo your characters expressions, and so spoil the movie, and make it look stupid, even childish. This isn't a mistake that Miyazaki would do. A big bonus for that!Mononkoe Hime surpasses even the famous ""Nausicaa, the valley of the wind"". Im totally impressed!",Princess Mononoke

However, even when looking at the movie with as little bias as possible, I can still honestly say that this is one of the greatest animated films I've ever seen, if not one of the greatest films of any type that I've ever seen.First off, the mastermind behind this film, Hayao Miyazaki, is a living legend in the eyes of many, including myself.  Under his belt are titles like My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, and the brand new Spirited Away, not yet over on this side of the Pacific. The majority of his films are moral-filled ""child-oriented"" movies that can be, like films such as The Lion King or Labyrinth, watched and thoroughly enjoyed by any age group.  This film can be enjoyed by any age group, but isn't as much for the younger audiences as are Miyazaki's others.The film opens up with some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen, and doesn't let up on the visuals until the end credits start rolling. Lush forests, rolling fields, old villages and booming industrial towns (of medieval Japanese standards, that is), with not a detail spared.  The character designs are fantastic and, in the case of some of the creatures, very whimsical, and use of computer animation is practically seamless.  Not only are the visuals stunning, but the soundtrack to accompany the beautiful eye candy was absolutely amazing, done by Jo Hisashi, who has done practically every Miyazaki soundtrack to date.  To see only the landscapes and hear only the soundtrack in the theater was more than enough for me.Miyazaki doesn't just leave things with sight and sound, though.  Within minutes, the viewer is drawn into a plot that not only holds its own against some of the best movie plots of all time, but also has enough imagery and symbolism to make all but the hardest critics of straight-forward, unsubtle plots happy.  Nature vs. Technology, East vs. West, the classic arguments of history are represented in this film to a degree that practically anyone can understand and enjoy, yet not ""dumbed down"" to the point of boredom and blatency.I'll stop right there with any description of the plot.  Practically everyone has heard of this film and, to some degree, what it's about, but to any that haven't, I'll ruin nothing.  All I'll say more is that the film was worth a 90 mile drive to a small theater and a 90 mile drive back, along with being late for work that night, and that I recommend this to anyone who likes...well, I recommend this to anyone.  Period.",Princess Mononoke
597,hrwoodruff,Best Animated Film Ever,10,28 August 2001,"I have always loved animated film and cartons, but this film truly blew me away.  To me this film is the animated film version equivalent of Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'.  The film creates a world in such detail than the viewer feels as if he/she has been there.  The film is beautifully drawn from characters to backgrounds.  The characters are not as simplistic as one-dimensional cartoon characters, i.e. the hero is all-good and the villain is pure evil.  The two main combatants, Princess Mononoke and Lady Eboshi are shades of gray, thought personally I love the character of Lady Eboshi.  The ending also is not cartoonish in that everything is not tried up into a neat little package at the end.  See this picture with an open mind and hopefully you will find it as enjoyable as I did.",Princess Mononoke
598,lnelson-96608,One of the best movies of all time!!,10,27 June 2021,"When someone asks me to recommend them a movie, princess mononoke always comes to my mind first. The animation is breathtaking, and the characters are very well developed. There is a perfect balance of romance, action, and adventure. The art In some scenes is astonishing, and this movie has turned into a comfort movie for me. This is definitely one of studio ghiblis more violent movies, but this balances perfectly with the story line. All of the mystical creatures are very powerful, and the soundtrack pulls it all together!! I HIGHLY RECCOMEND. If you have not watched this yet, go to your nearest device and sit back to enjoy the best animated movie in the world.",Princess Mononoke
599,Movie_Man_1,An cinematic masterpiece,10,10 September 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This film, Princess Mononoke, is one of those movies that makes me tremble with excitement  - it is such an astounding example of what cinema as a creative medium is capable of. It is a perfect example of what an art film-making can be, and it is also grand entertainment of the highest order.
Now I won't spoil the story for you (besides I can't according to the IMDB rules, lol), but I will give you a few of the important details that may pique your interest. For starters, Princess Mononoke is an animated epic mythological fantasy set in 14th-century Japan that deals with themes like mankind's relation to and place in nature, the destructiveness of ambition, and the capabilities of human nature.The film begins as young prince Ashitaka (of a fictional 9th-century empire that was overthrown and forced into hiding) is returning from hunting with his trusty mount Yakul, an intriguing beast that seems like a mixture of elk, goat, and maybe bear. He is told by three girls, one of whom is his younger sister, that something is approaching the village, and he heads out again to investigate. In a rousing action sequence he confronts and flees from the now-attacking presence - a gigantic boar-god possessed by some demonic curse that makes it faster, stronger, and of course, uglier. Covered with writhing, stunningly animated wormlike purple goo that spreads out at its bidding, it clutches Ashitaka's arm when he attacks it in a valiant attempt to protect his stumbling sister , its closest target. Ashitaka slays the creature with his bow-and-arrow and it dies in agony, proclaiming its hate for the `loathsome rabble' (humans). After the battle the prince returns to the village, his arm now sporting a festering purple scar in the spot where the ooze had grabbed him. He is informed by the local wise-woman that he is cursed. Also she informs him that an iron ball was found in the boar's body, and that it was the cause of its transformation into a demonic force. He is commanded to leave the village permanently and  to journey to the boar's homeland and `see with eyes unclouded (meaning essentially to find out what is wrong and help fix the trouble).' She tells him that perhaps, if he is succesful in his quest, he will find a cure for his curse in the land of the Deer-God (the god of the forest), which is where the boar he slew came from. So he heads out with Yakul to the land of the Deer-god to meet his fate.I really would feel a little guilty going on too much about the plot, but to be general, it is a tremendously unconventional film in a number of ways.
Ashitaka later encounters the ferocious young woman  of the title, San Mononoke (the word Mononoke I believe is translated from Japanese meaning `spirit of the beasts')  who was raised by a wolf-god, and (I imagine you can guess this anyway) he begins to find himself loving her after a while, and she also falls in love with him. Their romance is unusually convincing - it never falls into the hokey `I love you, John, you big masculine hunk! I love YOU, Jane, you hot thing!' trap. They both know they love one another, and they respect each other as much as they love one another. The ending is bittersweet in a very original and believe it or not, thought-provoking manner.Another important and unusual element of the story is the industrious Lady Eboshi, a beautiful woman with money on her mind who is determined to tame the land and overthrow the gods of the forest. Her iron-foundry and the muskets of her soldiers virtually rape the serene natural habitat of all its beauty, but garner her great wealth and power. The fascinating thing about her is that she is essentially a good individual. She has given lepers work, hired peasant men, bought out the contracts of brothel girls, and given them work and her respect. She is simply blinded by ambition to the fact that she is causing havoc with her destruction of nature. She is a very realistic and dramatically effective character.The entire story is excellent and thematically rich, but probably the most astounding aspect of the film is its staggering visual splendor. I have watched films, analyzed films, written reviews of films for newspapers, and studied film techniques and history for a while now, and I tell you, in all seriousness, that this is the most astoundingly (hand-drawn) animated film I have ever seen. The fantastic sights such as the Night-Walker, a giant ethereal god, would not be able to be brought to the screen any other way than through animation. The animation is so good you would swear it is computer assisted, but every source I have checked says it is not. The visual style, artistic use of color, and camerawork are all superior to any other animated film I have ever seen, capturing the epic, contemplative, and often fast-paced nature of the film. The cinematography (yes an animated film can have `camerawork') and film editing are not only without peer in the world of animation, but  would hold up fine to the classics of cinema, such as The Godfather, Seven Samurai, or Citizen Kane. As for the soundtrack, the score is incredibly evocative, and the sound effects and especially sound editing are grade A-1. The original Japanese voice-acting is more natural and is superior to the well-done English-dubbing. The original dialogue is more poetic and epic than the good but often modern sounding dialogue of the dubbed version. This is one of those movies that has to be seen letter-boxed as well. Hayao Miyazaki's direction is superb, handling the pacing of the film flawlessly, timing the key scenes perfectly, and contrasting life-giving nature with man-made artificiality. The film is a monumental achievement and easily one of the 100 best films I have ever seen. See it.",Princess Mononoke
600,alasdairdavidson1987,The greatest animated film of all time.,10,9 January 2007,"This film would be inside the top 10 films of all time were people in the west only more aware of it. In England we grow up on an unappealing diet of Disney tripe, but we don't realise it is so shoddy because it's all we have. This is because we don't have a strong animation industry of our own really, with the possible exception of Aardman Animations, and we are gripped by America's commercial stranglehold. The lower classes in this country love America and anything it produces, because they are ignorant, pure and simple. The sad fact is that the average person in the street has not heard of Studio Ghibli or Miyazaki. Consequently they think that Disney films are the acme of animation, and show their children Disney films and take them on holidays to Disneyland. It was such a revelation for me to see my first Studio Ghibli film (Spirited Away) and when I watched more of Miyazaki's masterpieces, most notably Mononoke-Hime, I realised what animation can and should be. There still persists in this country the idea that animation is somehow a lower art form than live-action films, but the more people see this film, the more things will change. Using animation allows a director to fly effortlessly into the realms of fantasy, and Miyazaki is masterful at it. It amazes me that although western animation has been commercially successful for so much longer, the greatest imaginative leap the directors seem to able to make is talking animals. Brilliant. The Studio Ghibli films, however, are not afraid to make films where almost all of the characters are people (Kiki's Delivery Service) because they are not afraid to take on live-action films on their own territory - they don't feel the need to retreat to the safety of talking animals, where live-action will not usually follow. But the thing about Studio Ghibli films is that they have people and fantastical creatures in the same film, and what's more, interacting with one another.But I'm speaking too generally. Mononoke is for me the best of the best - see as many Studio Ghibli films as possible, but I think this one is the most brilliant. Personally I prefer the Japanese versions of Studio Ghibli films with the subtitles which match the Japanese script, because the American cast are pretty poor. It is definitely the most beautiful film I have ever seen, fantastically well drawn, but it doesn't hide behind a pretty facade. The story is cracking, great action scenes mixed with truly poignant ones, and the overall environmentalist theme of the story gets more and more relevant with every 8-mile-to-the-gallon American SUV sold.In a word: stunning. In two words: see it.",Princess Mononoke
601,hayama,An epic masterpiece head and shoulders above many American films,10,5 October 2001,"This movie tore me apart in ways I cannot even begin to describe in words.First off, the plot is truly unique to the American film market.  In a time where sex and violence is king and characterization and plot are merely regarded as afterthoughts,this movie bravely stood alone as an example of how to do a film correctly.  It paid a great price for doing so; the sales were dismal compared to many other movies that debuted in 1997, and unfairly so.  It takes the conflict of ""man vs. nature"" and elevates it to a whole new level, adding many interesting characterization aspects in the process.I do not wish to go into great deal regarding the plot; that has been done many times before.  What I do want to say is that this movie will give you a great deal of insight into human nature and our attitude towarsd each other and towards the natural level.  What you realize midway through the film is that there is no true ""Hero"" in the traditional sense in the film. Ashitaka is merely a figure of neutrality in a battle of man versus beast.  Is the animals' desire to butcher the humans and drive them out of their forest any different from the human's hunger for wealth and iron?  And what about Jigo; is his greed different than Eboshi's?  Neither side is right or wrong, everyone is fighting for their own interests and nothing else.  Toward the end, your perspective may change a bit, but I do not wish to get into spoilers here.All I can say is, watch the movie with an open mind and you will enjoy it like no other.  A lot of negative reviews that I've read through are silly, one person claimed to ""not understand it"" when they couldn't even remember the characters' names; had they paid any attention at all?  This movie is really not difficult to comprehend in the least if you're willing to actually watch it.  And if you think it's stupid because ""Ashitaka couldn't do this, it's impossible etc etc"" have you become so jaded that you can't invoke a little suspension of disbelief once in a while?  This is fantasy, not a physics lecture.In summation, I want to state that is that this is a powerful movie for the whole family, despite some bloody parts -- but in most places the gore is no different than what you might find in Star Wars.  This is truly an epic film, easily on the level with movies such as Braveheart.",Princess Mononoke
602,tia140250,Princess Mononoke,10,21 January 2007,"Princess Mononoke is a story of adventure and yet love too. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did!

If you are a true fan you will like this movie. This, to me, is one of Miyazaki's best movies. I hope he continues to make these movies and animate and design. Although there is a rumoor going around saying he's retiring. Miyazaki is the best anime director for me. Someday I hope you appreciate anime as much as I do.

(i did it for half a month and still awestruck for another half a month) it is beautiful in the scales of animation and live movies. it has beautifully carved out characters to their dialogue, voice, and their background to hold their beliefs.i am a young teenager. i saw this movie 5 times. this movie makes me think what are we doing to earth and does it need to be done for the development of the human race? what have we done that nature needs our help to survive? where are the ""gods"" to rebel against us? this is a questioning movie that we may question for days for answer we may never receive. as there are movies to make us laugh and forget about the 25-hours a day society, we need movies to make consider about the origin of where man came from and how serious this problem of man vs nature is.",Princess Mononoke
605,beardyfriesen,An extremely good movie that superseded my preconceptions about the animation style it is presented in.,8,21 April 2007,"A few years ago I would have tossed this film into a collection of movies I like to call the rubbish pile. Recently, however, I have forced myself, with great difficulty, to open my mind and look at the entire picture. Instead of focusing on one or two aspects of the movie I do not like and formulating a biased opinion based on my hasty and clouded notions, I can now decipher both the good and bad points of a given flick. Upon watching Princess Mononoke, I must say I first thought it would be very difficult to look past the animation style and see it for what it was- a dynamic film directed be the highly acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki. After about ten minutes of dwelling on the follies (and there are, in my opinion, many) of the ""anime"" style of art, I became enthralled with the quickly unfolding plot and the subsequently dire fate bestowed upon Ashitaka, the protagonist of the film. After Ashitaka leaves his village to search for a treatment to remedy his affliction, I no longer cared that this was an animated feature; I was on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I no longer disliked that every character had abnormally large eyes (though not over-sized to the point of utter absurdity) or that the English overdubbing was a little choppy. In fact, I even began to enjoy the accomplished yet subtle computer generated effects interspersed throughout. By the last half hour I was hooked to the screen, eagerly awaiting the conclusion I wanted so badly to end the bitter conflict of the plot. By the end, I realized that this movie carried a powerful moral with it: man's continuous tampering with nature brings about as much savagery as it does progress, as much suffering as it does good, and that a sound compromise must be struck between nature and civilization. I do not harbor any negative feelings towards those who rated this movie poorly, as I used to be one of those people. All I have to say to them is this: look at a both the visual and symbolic attributes of a movie before rating it harshly. If, after observing all these features and idiosyncrasies, you still wholeheartedly hate the film, then by all means give it a one. After all, what would the world be like if we were all did not criticize or question our surroundings?",Princess Mononoke

So i decided to buy the DVD when it came out. WOW nothing could prepare me for realising just how good this film was, this was my first Hayao Miyazaki film. Boy have i been missing the mother load of anime. The first thing i will say about princess mononoke because i like it so much is the best music i have ever heard in a anime, forget that ANY film live or animated i have ever heard in princess mononoke. Joe Hisagi (spelled wrong) is amazing i love Japanese composers. The next thing is the amazing attention to detail in the animation, the only other time i have seen this much detail was in Akira. But i reckon this is better than Akira mainly because it has more moral meaning than Akira. I think is good with professional actors doing the voices.All in all this film is well put together and has put me onto a Hayao Miyazaki collection spree, i just brought Laputa Castle in the Sky, Iam off to watch that, just do yourself a favour and watch Princess mononoke just at least once and believe.",Princess Mononoke

610,grace_carroll,Its so good,10,20 October 2008,"This film is good simply because it is one of the only film that lives up to the grandiose it carries itself with. What i mean by this is that there are so many big budget action Hollywood films that pretend that they are more influential and better made then they are. Which use ""clever"" camera shots stolen from a much better movie and in which the main character holds an intensely false serious look on his/her face throughout the entire movie. I can't name any specifically, but everyone knows the ones i mean, they churn out about five a year and they're fine, if you like that sort of thing. Me personally, in the cinema when the main cop American guy says something like ""you're stepping way out of line there man"" i can't help but scoff and think ""calm down,for gods sake this is such an average three star movie, why you getting in such a huff?"". I can't take them seriously, i prefer my cheeky little romps were not much happens but there is plenty of jokes and soul searching and tings. The ones that offers themselves to you with a shrug and say ""here dude i made this movie, it's kind of cool"" and don't try to suggest they will change your life or deeply move you. This film though is different, very very different. As soon as it begins it slams it's fist down and says ""Listen to me, i am not to be played int he background,I am not just a film, i am a piece of art"" and unlike many films it frigging delivers. It manages to pull off lines such as ""i want to see by eyes unclouded by hate"" and talk about river gods and forest spirits and not at one point do you scoff. It is one of the only serious films i have honestly been caught up in, and not at one point joked about. It's one of those films that while it's playing you just think ""how can i care about my washing or the state of the house or how much work i have to get done when this is happening?"".As a viewer i can only really comment on the effect, and don't really like breaking the film up into it's key elements and commenting on them but i will just say it is very beautiful, best animation i have ever seen. There is no good or evil in this film, which is nice because too many films focus too much on good vs evil as if that is what life is like (star wars am talking to you)""Good vs evil"" plot lines inspire single mindedness and that is bad 'cos it leads to racism and such. In this film instead of good and evil there is two opposing sides, both with different priorities and motives. It shows characters as having more than one dimension, no one is purely good nor evil (as in life). Instead of rooting for good the audience can root for the main brave character, The Prince. The real hero of this movie is San, the movies main girl and namesake who is just brilliant, it's always good to see a feisty girl in a film, I've had it up to here with drips. She exudes such passion, which lifts the film right up and her character blooms lovely against the conflict filled storyline. The film carries serious issues and the epic storyline very well, and there is also a love story that is hinted at but never quite reaches it's peak ( which is how true love stories should be),which makes it more beautiful and heart wrenching which adds passion and lights up the film magnificently. see this film, it deserves it",Princess Mononoke

Everything about this film is perfection, the script, the music, the voice acting (both in English and Japanese)...Having seen every Miyazaki feature at this point, I still believe that Mononoke Hime is the best work he has done to date, despite the fact that Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (Spirited Away) won the Best Animated Feature Oscar...

Of course when you sit down to watch the movie it can be a bit long, but every moment of it is enjoyable as long as you're into these kind of movies. At the first look it might raise a few questions, especially regarding those cute little buggars in the forest.

This film says the opposite. When one believes something, one must GIVE in order to get the best solution to a conflict. This way of approaching a problem, cannot be better displayed than Ashitaka in the film. Wonderful. I've seen the film in Spanish so perhaps then sentence is different, but the one saying ""I've come to understand without being influenced by hate"" could be very profitable for human kind.

I eat beef and i love it! don't get me wrong! after you see this film and more of Miyazakis films like ""Nausicaä of the valley of the winds"" or Takeshi Kitanos ""Pom Poko"" i hope you will take another look at the world like i have and see like i see! thanks to this movie!

621,DragomirKarakolev,"A true story that makes you realize the eternal conflict builder of the ""progress""",10,19 November 2013,"Princess Mononoke is the japan version of The Little Prince - no matter how old are you - you can find in something amazing. Every time you watch this movie you can find something new, something different no matter how many times you had watched it. This is a ""true"" story about life - the clash of ideals, the collision of words and one soul and one soul doomed ""to see the world with eyes unclouded by hate"". The journey of Ashitaka is a journey of free will to create, to help and not to destroy, journey of Utopian ideal which will face the human progress destroying the ""old"" world. We have here the opposition, seen in many movies and books, presented in a story in which there is love, hate, hope, faith...a story that ends in a way that makes you think,even to make some choices because the end is so real, so ironically true.",Princess Mononoke
622,ajb694,Miyazaki Masterpiece,10,3 May 2012,"I was 17 when I had seen this movie for the first time, and I was blown away. For the longest time I had Star Wars as my number one movie, but Princess Mononoke instantly bumped it out of first place. The plot line was amazing, and the acting was superb. The voice actors, both the Japanese and the English dub did an amazing job of getting the emotion that needed to be portrayed felt by the audience. You could hear the subtleties in their voices that let you know there was a change in how the person felt. I great example was when Ashitaka was leaving his village his sister came up to say goodbye. She joked around with Ashitaka, but quickly became sad, and you could feel the mood change when it did. If you listen to how she talked her voice had a minimal change in sound, but it was just enough that you felt the pain in your heart of how sad it was that she was never going to see Ashitaka again. Another time you can see, actually hear, the amazing voice acting is when Ashitaka talks to lady Eboshi for the first time. The power in his voice when he says, ""to see with eyes unclouded by hate,"" drives home the feeling that he is serious about what he does and that he lives by that phrase. Watching other animated movies, I had never felt the emotions spoken so well as I did watching Princess Mononoke. Thinking about it, another part that helped drive emotions home was the astounding soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi. The soundtrack that plays throughout the movie is beautiful. It helps bring to life the emotions felt and helps tell the story. You feel like if you closed your eyes, turned off the dialogue and just listened to the soundtrack, you would still know the story. It almost seems like the soundtrack tells the story as its own entity. The swells of the strings, the woody vibrato of the Oboe, the shimmer of the harp all bring the spiritual world shown in Princess Mononoke to life. The final point I want to make about this movie is the images that you see. It astounds me how every frame of this movie was hand drawn. 160,000 frame cells were drawn, a number I can't even fathom. Miyazaki brought to life the world he envisioned with the moving art that he called Princess Mononoke. When you see the forest gods walking around you can't help but be in awe. I suggest you buy this movie and watch it over and over. It brings great fantasy and happiness while bringing powerful ideas to the table. A 10 out of 10 is still not enough to talk about how amazing and powerful this movie is. I say to you,""GO WATCH IT NOW, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!""",Princess Mononoke
623,ted496,Beautiful film about our battle with nature and ourselves,10,23 January 2004,"This film examines humanities conflict with nature, change (moving toward an industrial society) and other peoples and it does it in such a way as to show you that each group or entity has its reasons.

624,rvothlama,One of the Director's Best!,10,4 July 2012,"Whoever hated this epic film are either retards, or those never understands anything about anything. I love this movie since AKIRA, and even though the paste is a bit slow, it's still the best. Love the action and the environments...if only if there is a sequel, but the director never makes sequel. Still, like the director's previous films and AKIRA, this is a classic. No one should hate this film. Haters never know why everybody love Princess M. But you know what they say: Haters are a bunch of idiots. It's everybody's opinion...but opinions should be positive about the film. Negatives always loses.10 out of 10!",Princess Mononoke
625,candrillim,The greatest movie ever!,10,18 April 2012,"If you are looking for that movie that just completely sweeps you off your feet, one with a fantastic story, characters that you adore, and an intense beauty that chills your spine and causes goose bumps on every square inch of your body, then may i present to you Princess Mononoke!Princess Mononoke is by no means a cartoon, and simply because it is an animated movie doesn't mean it is solely for children. It is a very mature movie with its dealings with the intricacies of life and death, but can be loved by children, like I did the first time I watched it when I was 10. To put it simply, its story line is the best I have come across, even better than the Godfather in my opinion. Its message of environmental awareness is prevalent, but very subtle, allowing you to watch the movie without having ""Don't destroy the forest!"" jumping out at you like the movie was filmed in 3D or something.And what's a story without characters. Princess Mononoke has many greatly developed characters. Jigo, Ashitaka, and San are my favorites, with San being my favorite movie character of all time. Her intense nature, body language thought the movie, little wolf-like quirks that she has (Because she was raised by wolves), and her being the most beautiful thing I've ever laid eyes on makes for a deeply complex, yet completely understandable, making her, in my opinion, the perfect character. Even the background characters have a lot of development, which significantly adds to the movie, and make it stand above the rest.Lastly, the music in the movie is phenomenal! I was never into orchestral music before watching this movie, but now I listen to it all the time. The light cheerful winds and piano mixed with the ominous and sinister stings makes for the listening experience of a lifetime! If you listen to only the soundtrack, you could still pretty much draw an almost spot on summary of whats happening at the time in the movie. There were several instances while watching the movie where I had put on a blanket because the music sent such a chill down my spine!The only complaint I have with this movie is that it brings me to tears every time I watch it, but its everlasting beauty will surely bring you to tears as well.Overall I give this movie a perfect score, 10 out of 10. It is an amazing watch, stunningly beautiful; I highly recommend it.",Princess Mononoke

The story line was so easy to get into, the characters themselves were briliantly created, and the music is breath-taking. The american voicing cast wasn't too bad in the dubbing of the movie, though i would prefur the japanese subtitled version in a heart beat, they were still pretty good. I can't say enough about the music though, how it all fits with the movie so magnificently (and i dont care if i can't spell) that it made me want to persue a film scoring career.

I get goosebumps whenever I hear The Legend of Ashitaka Theme playing.Characters are likable. There were no definite heroes and villains.Story is epic.

Full utilization of the power animation has to transport you to a strange and lush new world, while at the same time touching your heart.The scenery is extraordinary, but no more so than the writing, which pits humans against nature, other humans, and the conflicts within themselves as they all try to carve out an existence and live among each other.Highly recommended viewing for all ages.",Princess Mononoke
629,lopa-nhom18,The most frightening and happy experience,10,5 September 2012,"I know I'm a fan of Haku, but I must say this, Mononoke is way better than SA (in my opinion).The first time I've watched Mononoke, it was half a year ago. Back then, I was an angry, bad boy, who always got into trouble. But one night, the movie was on Disney, I turned on to see the movie. At first, I looked at the time. 133 minutes. That was way too long. But I was a fan of Ghibli's anime, so I tried my best to watch the movie. Although some parts of the movies was cut, I was happy. And from then, my life was changed. I'm not angry boy anymore...The thing I like about Mononoke is the character (which you can find on Wiki), especially Ashitaka. You can see him rarely smiling (just like my old self. When I saw him, I though he was the bad guy. Because I saw him killing a boar (which later I found out that the boar was a demon). But no, there's no ""bad"" or ""good"", just normal character like we can see it. The movie was about keeping the environment, so it was very meaningful. Back then, I was watching in the dark room alone, so the part when he killed several of samurais, I jumped off the couch. Heartattack. And then at the end, when Shishigami's head was falling down, I can remember what I did. I was running around, turned off the TV immediately, and ran out of the room. That was the first time I know about heart attack. But the ending is so touching. I was almost cry when seeing them saying goodbye (although it wasn't a goodbye).Miyazaki had done a very great job. Thank you for all the movie that can make a ""demon"" like me change into a ""near angel"" :D. He deserve an Oscar for the best director of all time (and he did :D)10/10. Perfect. Terrific. Scary...",Princess Mononoke
630,Giggles-at-funerals,Easily in my Top 5,10,10 March 2015,"I remember the first time I saw it, it was right when this title came to DVD here in America. I wasn't yet double digits, and it was the first time I felt fear without having to look away or needing someone there near me. It was not a fear I had felt, and in fact calling it fear may be the wrong word, but to me moments got my heart racing, my hair rising on the back of my neck. It felt like there was a real risk within the first scene of the movie.There were so many things I didn't understand, but I remember the thing that stood out to me the most was there was no actual villain. The gods were killing humans to preserve their world. The humans were killing the forest to preserve their species. No one was 100% right nor 100% wrong. Even the worst person in the film was praised for seeing lepers as real people, for saving girls from brothels and teaching them to fight.I will absolutely be showing this to my children when they are around 8 or 9. I think showing them that in the real world there is no obvious bad guy is important. Everyone has a side, everyone is doing what they think is right, be it for their betterment or the betterment of those around them. We do not do things to purposefully take from others, only to give to ourselves. It's an important lesson and Princess Mononoke gives us this lesson in a movie with absolutely stunning musical accompaniment, some of the best animation I have ever had the pleasure of seeing, and great voice acting from people you might not recognize right off the bat.I'd recommend to absolutely everyone to see this movie at least once.

I must say, just like the other films I've watched, I was blown away.It's an awesome movie with wonderful animation and a soundtrack that compliments it excellently. The story is also captivating and has a variety of different morals, depending on how you interpret it. And, even though I was surprised by some of the violence that's absent in most other Miyazaki films, it was still awesome because I love all that gory stuff. :-D Overall, I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a great story with deep characters, and such wonderful forest scenery and action that you almost forget it's animated.",Princess Mononoke

Ashitaka is captivating (what a strength, what a heart, what a soul!); San (the Princess Mononoke herself) is intriguing; and Lady Eboshi is ambiguous -is she the villain? I don't think so. After all, who can blame her? Don't let the over exploration of themes related to ecology discourage you. Go ahead and watch Mononoke. It's a totally new way of treating the conflict between men and nature, which is far from its ending.

637,vanillalune,Beautiful and relatable with a wonderful message.,10,18 February 2014,"Princess Mononoke is one of Hayao Miyazaki's finest films. It takes the viewer to a beautiful fantasy world of nature, spirits, and explores humanity's place in it all. Blurring the lines between good and evil the story of Princess Mononoke is not clear cut black and white. By the end of the film some may feel it should have ended a different way than it did. That the resolution wasn't the right one. With masterful story writing Hayao Miyazaki created a story that's much like the real world.The characters are each one unique and easily identifiable in their personality and unique appearance. Even minor background characters are still given likable roles and are all unique. Studio Ghibli has yet again with this film, continued to uphold their stellar animation style. Displaying beauty and the hard work the developers put into the film with each and every frame.And to accompany the movie is a sweeping and very moving score by Joe Hisaishi, who writes the music for almost all of Studio Ghibli's films. Listening to the score alone can paint a picture of the movie all it's own, but put the two together and it's like combining strawberries with chocolate, you end up with something unique, beautiful to look at, and delicious to taste (in this case, hear).",Princess Mononoke
638,FulguritePoems,shorttttttt,8,10 March 2014,"i have to say that, even 15 years since the first time i saw this film, it is still a wondrous world Hayao Miyazaki has constructed. at no point in time do you find yourself questioning that there is an elf-looking deer god who dictates life and death within a great forest full of giant boars and treeghosts.the art is amazing; but that is to be expected with a Miyazaki film. i was struck by the gore within the film; it is still a ""WTF moment"" to see characters get their heads and arms cut off in a single blow.this film is a classic; you should watch even if you're not into animated films. it is more than an animated film.",Princess Mononoke
639,chameleonguy33,One of the two greatest animated movies,10,22 May 2005,"This was the first experience of anime for my family, and every anime we watched afterwards was forever stuck in its shadow; that is, until we saw Spirited Away. These two movies are not only the two masterpieces of Miyazaki (which is saying a lot all by itself), but are in my opinion the two greatest of all animated movies ever made. Apart from the invariantly message entwined throughout, there are images in this movie that will stay with you forever (for example, the main character, Ashitaka, parting two women who are fighting, as blood drips from his recently inflicted mortal wound and concentrated evil writhes around the three of them). i promise that the end (which i won't disclose) will leave you shivering.",Princess Mononoke
640,Thadlerian,Problematic Epic,7,22 July 2008,"Of all films directed by Hayao Miyazaki, there is no doubt Princess Mononoke is the highest regarded by his fans. Taking place in medieval Japan, it is the story of a cursed and exiled young prince involving himself in a war between man and the spirits of nature. The iron-producing town led by the strong Lady Eboshi is pitted against a mysterious young woman running with the wolves. Other cynical players enter the conflict for their own gain.The virtues of this movie are many: A largely credible set of ambiguous characters, a grand plot wrapped in a dramatic and moving story, a stunning soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi, an ecological message, as well as Miyazaki's famous attention to detail, which contributes to main as well as back story.The movie has a serious problem, however, which prevents this reviewer from ranking it among their top Studio Ghibli. The protagonist, in sharp contrast to the rest of this movie's ambiguous world, is completely faultless. Prince Ashitaka has got to be one of the most boring characters ever encountered in storytelling. Despite all his trials, he is never more angry than required, always courageous, kind, and ready to help. This deprives the story vastly of its sophistication.It is, nevertheless, possible to interpret this as another virtue. By seeing San and Lady Eboshi as the real protagonists, you can say Ashitaka is really a metaphor for new and progressive thought, the emergence of which makes it possible to mitigate deep conflicts. But whether or not Miyazaki intended it this way, it is hard to say whether such an interpretation is shared by the fanbase. Also, the movie strongly pushes Ashitaka as the protagonist, not encouraging the alternative interpretation.Also, keep some distance from the English dub. There are two reasons. First, Neil Gaiman, writer of the dub script, obviously saw Miyazaki's own sense of humour as insufficient, and decided to add some dialogue jokes on his own where the animation allows it - rather poor jokes. Second, Claire Danes' rendition of San is a painful experience. She makes the brave warrior princess sound like a whiny teenage girl, so much like those familiar to readers of Robert Jordan. Billy Crudup is not really helping either - his temperless voice adds to Ashitaka's infuriating lack of character.In short: Whether this is a good or a great movie really depends on your interpretation. And try to get a subtitled version.",Princess Mononoke
641,pjadams96,Fantastic film w/ meaningful analogical content,8,30 September 2014,"Princess Mononoke, simply put, is an epic tale of ""man vs. nature"". The film itself is fantastic, with an amazing soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi, top notch animation by Studio Ghibli, and of course, a fanciful setting and plot created by Hayao Miyazaki. However, beneath the base entertainment value of the film, a whole new level of meaning and importance hides. When I watch the movie, I find that I can't differentiate who is/are the 'bad guy(s)' and who is/are the 'good guy(s)' in the end. This blurring of the traditional moral binary – right or wrong – in the movie reveals truth about the environmental crisis in the modern world. In the film, each main party (the wolves and Princess Mononoke, Lady Eboshi) is doing both good and bad. For example, we see Lady Eboshi fighting off the local wildlife but also offering refuge for the lepers and the brothel girls she has recruited to work for her. Likewise, the wolves and Mononoke are protecting their home, but killing people to do so. Through Ashitaka, we ""see with eyes unclouded by hate"": the viewer is shown all sides and the respective justification for their decisions. Similar to the modern environmental crisis, the film proposes that the sides of right and wrong in this situation are questionable: the ethics of such decisions are dependent on an individual and their situation and beliefs. Essentially, the film entertains the idea that there should be a gray area between what is good and bad when dealing with issues tied to the environment. For example, Patrick Allitt reports that some reviews of The Closing Circle – written with an environmentalist viewpoint – criticized it for refuting the existence of a gradient of the moral binary that Princess Mononoke carefully depicts (Allitt). The morality of pro-environment and pro-humanity stances have equal credence. As depicted by the movie, Ashitaka does not choose either stance, but being from a culture with tremendous respect for nature, ""choose(es) the (decision) that will produce the greatest balance of good consequences over bad consequences,"" which is the ""correct ethical action"" (Warner). He helps the people of Iron Town because they deserve to be treated like humans. Likewise, he helps the different wild spirits because they should be protected, as they are alive as well. The movie places its audience in a position in which they can see what being an intermediary force encompasses. For example, a scene that sums up the gray area the best it possibly can is the scene in which he intercedes between Lady Eboshi and Princess Mononoke as they are about to go head-to-head in a fight. It parallels the balance between the two sides of environmental stances. Summarily, Ashitaka is Miyazaki's representation of how to deal with the moral ambiguity that exists in making decisions about the environment (pro-man or pro- nature). The design of the plot and the characters in this film contribute more to the meaning of the film than the plot. To be honest, I think it actually makes the plot harder to follow and, on occasion, confusing. However, that may be because that is the way the viewer is intended to receive the film's plot and characters. There is the occasional slow part, but watching the whole work is an especially rewarding experience. Following up on my confusion of the plot in the film and consequently reaching the realization about the inner workings of the movie and the decisions made in terms of the character design and the central conflict, I've only managed to like the film more. Not only is the film an extremely entertaining piece to watch, but it is, in a manner, a dialogue about the ethical decisions that are being made all the time about the environment in the modern world. I certainly have been prompted to actually entertain a new way of thinking about the specific changes and results of decisions made in this aspect. Princess Mononoke is yet another masterpiece by Hayao Miyazaki. It does what it must and more: it is entertaining while also sending a message and bringing attention to an important aspect of modern society. Overall, I'll give the film an eight out of ten only because it does have some seemingly drawn out scenes. Regardless of that, it's still one of my favorite movies of all time. Allitt, Patrick.

647,jadentortiz,A Great Anime Film And A View Of The Environment.,10,4 December 2015,"Princess Mononoke is a 1997 animated film by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. The word Mononoke is a Japanese word for specter or spirit. The film was received positively by critics and won 4 awards in Japan. A central theme of the movie is the environment and humanity's fear of the unknown. Industrialization is also a key factor as iron town wants to expand mining for iron into the forest. The forest gods do not agree with this and that is how the whole conflict starts. The story revolves around a boy Ashitaka who became cursed by a demon and must rid his curse or die. He travels to the west in search of the forest god to lift his curse. Meanwhile a group of villagers are traveling home and are attacked by the wolf clan. Ashitaka meets the wolf clan along the way and befriends them. Princess Mononoke is the adoptive daughter of the wolf god. He travels to iron town events transpire and the humans and beasts battle for the forest. Ashitaka and San (Princess Mononoke) must save the beasts and humans or suffer the destruction of both.Ashitaka has an understanding of the unknown and knows he must rid the curse he has. The people living around the forest and in iron town, are afraid of the beasts and what they don't know lurks in the forest. How they try and overcome this issue is with guns, burning down the forest, waging war with the forest animals, and killing the forest gods. They don't try and problem solve how they can fix it, they just start shooting the place up. This could be carried over into today as people don't try and solve their problems by working with others and go in head on. Wars and other problematic events occur today because of that unwillingness. Today we have people who care too much and some who don't care about the environment. The issues that Princess Mononoke discusses are still relevant today. The taking of land to expand an empire has been around for a long time. Today we have cities expanding and taking up natural land. San is an example of someone who cares about the environment and will do anything to maintain the peace of the forest and the forest gods. In order to protect the forest San goes to the iron city to kill the leader so they will stop destroying the land. She fails to kill the leader and this drives the conquest to destroy the forest to increase. Ashitaka knows that the forest is a vital part in the ecosystem. He tries to help San save the forest and stop the bloodshed. While in the iron city he takes a bullet and ""dies"" to save San. San takes him to the forest god to heal him. The forest god sees the potential within Ashitaka and brings him back to life. Ashitaka then goes to reason with both parties to save the city. A monk and the leader of the iron city follow Ashitaka back into the forest and kill the forest god. This makes a deadly goo that kills what it touches. The monk takes the head of the forest god. The god forms into a being and takes aim to reclaim his head. Ashitaka then stops the monk and gives the head back to the god. This brings balance to the world and restores the land to a healthy state. Him and San go separate ways to restore what once was. Ashitaka is the example of what people need to do today to protect what is important to them. By going on his journey he shows a motivation to protect what he cares about. He goes willingly knowing that he will not see his family again but that they will be safe. He later learns to care for the forest and does what he can to protect it. He is a strong example of if you care about something you will do anything to protect it. This is a strong character trait throughout the anime genre.",Princess Mononoke
648,megamajdo,Very interesting and relaxing to watch,10,6 September 2015,"After watching Spirited Away by Miyazaki, I decided to check out some of his other work. I was not disappointed with Princess Mononoke. In fact, I was amazed by how many emotions this piece of art has to give. It is an interesting movie which offers much tensity through its story progression but doesn't lack relaxing moments either, thanks to its beautiful landscapes and music. Miyazaki, once again, doesn't cease to surprise with his detailed characterization. The story itself is, compared to Spirited Away, very easy to follow, as it doesn't contain so much symbolism and is interesting to watch all the way. All in all, very enjoyable and suitable for all group ages!",Princess Mononoke
649,hunterbrady,Princess Mononoke: Cornerstone of Anime,10,4 December 2015,"Anime is an escape from our everyday lives, it allows us to view an amazing new world while in our own. What makes anime such an enthralling escape is the moral lessons and teachings found in them that the viewers don't usually get in real life interactions. The world renowned Manga and Anime author Hayao Miyazaki struck gold with his 1997 hit Princess Mononoke, a tale of love, the human condition and ethical values. Combining all of these features turns this movie into a Classic hit that will forever go down in the Anime books as a masterpiece.Princess Mononoke is a story based around feudal China. Humans are encroaching on the natural habitat causing a backlash from the forest' inhabitants. Our protagonist, Prince Ashitaka who has been cursed by a demon and forced to set out to find the source of the demon, comes upon a village called Irontown that is raping the forest for its minerals. A girl named Princess Mononoke,or San to the wolves, spearheads the assault to stop the humans. Later on Lady Eboshi, the leader of Irontown,decapitates the Spirit of the Forest and sets loose an evil that threatens all living inhabitants of the forest. Ashitaka and San return the severed head to the Spirit and settle the crazed god. After the chaos settles and the antagonist (Lady Eboshi) realizes her wrongs, San returns to the forest to protect it and Ashitaka helps rebuild Irontown.Throughout the movie, the presence of a romantic bond between Prince Ashitaka and Princess Mononoke is evident. He gets shot in the chest while saving San in Irontown by lifting the main gate that takes 10 men to raise all while bleeding profusely. Ashitaka passes out and San takes him to the Spirit of the Forest in order to save his life. These two care for each other deeply and go to extreme lengths to save the one they love. Ashitaka even dives into a demon infested boar king named Akoto to try and pry San out of his evil encrusted clutches. This movie proves that love, no matter how recent, can be worth fighting to protect. The connection between the two characters can be felt by any viewer regardless of being an Anime fan or not.Lady Eboshi is a prime example of greed and pride corrupting ones soul. She lets her personal obsession with controlling the iron trade completely block out any sense of right and wrong, good and evil, ethical and moral choices in general. She teams up with the Jigo (the fat ninja monk) and together they try to completely eradicate the animals of the forest to get to the precious minerals beneath the mountain. The promise of fortune and wealth blinds both of them to what the repercussions of their actions are. They don't care that they have disturbed the natural order of the forest, that animals gods have been forced to turn into demons because of the hatred brewing inside of them. The driving force behind the greed is, overall, the emperor who pardons Jigo before he even kills the Spirit of the Forest because he wants the recipe for eternal life. Just like modern day politicians or corporate tycoons, these two show us exactly how corrupt the human condition can be with the poison of greed.Princess Mononoke is a poster child for revolutionary Anime in the Western world. Unlike other Anime of the time like Dragon Ball Z and Inyuyashi that are all about fighting and comedy packed dialogue, Princess Mononoke focuses more on a serious, emotional background leading to a completely different experience than the aforementioned Anime. It contains all of the ingredients to an amazing Anime; Romance and family bonds, excitement and action, deep emotional connection with the storyline as well as the characters, a completely different spin on any fantasy/parallel universe and much more!",Princess Mononoke
650,Che-Kang_Chang,The great work of animation movie,10,21 August 2017,This Animation is really! The story and music are awesome. Highly recommended. The film talks about human have to protect environment. The score really attached the story and the characters. It appropriates kids and adult to watch. It also talked a lot of issues about how human protect environment. We should face them.,Princess Mononoke
651,Jacob_D_Old,Masterpiece!,10,23 February 2019,My favorite animation from the mind of Hayao Miyazaki. The film is beautiful in its art style and really goes to show how effective hand drawn animation is.,Princess Mononoke
652,codystokes,Must See,10,15 July 2017,An absolute must see classic. Any fans of animation will enjoy this movie and want to see it again and again. I love every last detail about this movie. This flick carries a powerful moral message and a quickly unfolding plot. Many people seem to have a hard time with the animation style but if you can look past it for 20 minutes you may find a film you'd love.,Princess Mononoke
653,louiefnoriega,An All Time Classic,10,21 July 2017,"I just saw Princess Mononoke for probably around the 20th time and I have to say that every time I watch it I am immediately drawn into this world in the same way I did as a child when I first saw it. It's story in very compelling in emphasizing on human nature. Each character had a clear goal and motive in their lives. It was clear that each character was true to their nature; even down to Toki, worker of the bellows in Irontown and husband to Kohroku. Most of the action scenes were animated so fluidly. It's always amazing to see the amount of detail incorporated into every character's gestures and movements. You never know what will happen next, from beginning to end. If I was to quickly jump from the first 15 minutes to the last 30 minutes, I'd think that I'm watching a completely different movie. The creativity involved in the story's setting still gets to me. Unlike most of Hayao Miyazaki's other films, this film certainly keeps to a more serious and darker tone which suites the subject but we still get that classic Miyazaki style with the Kodamas and the Forest Spirit. This will forever be one of Hayao Miyazaki's greatest films and should continue to be screened till the ends of time as it offers entertaining joy and very relevant subject matter.",Princess Mononoke
654,harmonies_for_the_ha-1,One of the best movies ever...,10,13 November 2005,"This entire movie from start to finish is a thing of beauty. From the start, you are treated to gorgeous animation, brilliant voice acting, and a the theme of nature and humanity unfolding in an epic tale of action, romance and fantasy.The storyline is a pure heart-wrenching, emotive and action packed piece which really gets to you about half way through the movie and you begin to wonder why no one has recommended this to you before, or why no one really raves about it so much. The reason its not known so much, is its japanimation and was never a blockbuster when it came out. You will find yourself in love with this movie the more times you watch it too.From my personal point of view, it is Miyazaki's best work. Its one you can see he wrote with personal feeling to the matter, and spent a long time working on. For anyone of all ages, all tastes, i recommend you to see this movie now. Watching it alone also helps.",Princess Mononoke
655,theduckgoesquak,Watch This Movie,9,17 October 2017,"From the title Princess Mononoke ,one may think that the movie's main center is around the story of a princess ,but in fact it is not. The movie Princess Mononoke follows the journey of a prince named Ashitaka as he leaves his homeland in search for the someone to reverse the curse he received. In comparison to many animated motion pictures this movie contains violent scenes. Although, these scenes are partnered with the voice of nonviolence and its aim is to achieve peace through understanding each other's perspective. By using this, the director and writer ,Hayao Miyazaki, brings to life his story with his excellent directing skills, making this one of the best animated motion pictures of all timeIn the first few minutes of the film the violence already begins. Ashitaka takes on a demon infested boar as it comes charging toward his town. As he is fending off the boar, his arm becomes burned, leading him to become cursed. This cursed arm protects him as he leaves town ,but does so by enchanting his arrow, causing him to decapitate enemies more than once throughout this film. Because of the humans' destruction to the forest, many of the stronger animals seek vengeance upon the humans. These animals such as the wolves lead by Moro, attack the humans and try to kill the leader of Irontown, Lady Eboshi. Throughout the film the violence escalates between the two sides and the corpses of some of the creatures are depicted. This violence, although strong at some points, is used show how violence can escalate into more violence.The violence pictured in the film is used to show how understanding each other can be more beneficial. Throughout the film both sides, the animals and the humans, constantly see each other through their own view lens. The humans are at first shown as the evil character in the film ,but as the movie begins to unfold reasons are made for both sides. Lady Eboshi destroyed the forest for land ,but had good intentions to use it for her people, while the animals care for the land and are just reacting to what the humans had done to it. Ashitaka is the one who acts as the mediator between both sides as he tries to stop them from attacking each other. He does not chose a side and is more interested in preventing other creatures from dying. In the end it shows how violence and seeking revenge can be destructive. This is shown when Okkoto, the boar spirit, leads his stampede of boars to attack the humans ,but is instead surprise attacked by the people. This allows the people a chance to follow his dying body to find the forest spirit and take it's head, causing the forest to be destroyed until the head was returned and the forest was reset. Hayao Miyazaki beautifully brings this complex story to life through his brilliant directing. Each character throughout the movie has life to it whether it is San ,the girl known as Princess Monoke, or a minor characters in the background. Body language in the characters are skillfully thought over as Yakul's feelings after the wolves begin attacking Ashitaka's body is shown. Yakul, a red elk creature, is shown trying to buck San off and even when San tries to get him to come over he paws at the ground in uncertainty. The small white spirits called kodama are also all given varying expressions as some would be appearing in different places. When each appeared they would be shown doing various things like tilting their head or carrying each other. The music choice and timing fits the action and dialogue, especially in the beginning when the monster is shown attacking the village. The music begins speeding up in apprehension and even changes as the monster comes closer to the people to show apprehension of a looming fear.Princess Mononoke is a beautiful movie about conflict that will take any viewer young or old away into it's world. It cautions the viewers of the movie about the effect of only understanding one view and teaches how learning about others reason can help to bring to a mutual understanding that is closer to peace. Each frame of careful constructed animation makes this movie not only one of the best animated movies in Japan ,but the best movie of all time.",Princess Mononoke

The characters are great the prince and the princess. Shows me a lot what i can do when I'm older, movie is very touching and also very 'breathtaking'.

661,sashajanjic,"Awesome, Must See Movie!",10,24 January 2006,"When I rented this movie I was not really into anime but this is my grand exception. I watched it (about) 6 times in a row and it never got boring or old. In my opinion, the worst part of the movie was when I had to return it. The message is there but mostly goes un-noticed due to the constant ""WOW"" factor. This movie is a MUST SEE for everyone. This movie has a great story line that will keep your attention. Some movies have 5-10 minute parts that drag on and bore you as you wait for something to happen. Even in the timid parts of this movie you do not loose your focus on the story. The movie is not overly complex-it's easy to follow and you don't get lost. I recently saw ""Crash"" and although it is a great movie, I mixed up a few characters and didn't always understand what was happening. Crash is the type of movie you need to see more than once to understand, Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime) is the type of movie you WANT to see more than once.",Princess Mononoke

665,mraima,Movie ideas,8,18 December 2018,"This movie is the best at showcasing how important are some things in life. We should't do some stupid thing for money or honour. In other words we should consider what iressponsible actions can lead too. Those choices could make us pay a huge price. In case we don't value what we have. Also this movie shows us that anger is not good for trying to solve certain problems of two different groups. Anger can make us become evil demons who want to destroy others by giving up on emotion. Lastly, life is very beautiful thing which we should love and try to improve by living it the best we can.",Princess Mononoke

667,jtijr2005,"I was glued to the TV, mesmerized...",10,25 March 2006,"In the past I have felt I could admire Japanese anime for the effort it put forth but never was really a fan. The characters looked childish, stiff and jittery most of the time. From the limited ones I have seen they were quirky and too much ""in your face"". But Princess Mononoke, WOW! I was channel surfing and saw it on the Cartoon Network and I could not stop watching it. I even kept bugging my wife (NOT a cartoon fan) saying, ""Honey, you have to see this, just watch a little more!"" even when she was trying to make dinner. I won't take the time to repeat what others have said about this film (yes, I said film, not cartoon) but please read them as they are all very accurate. What I want to add is the ""feel"" of this movie. It takes its time very well. There are pauses that are very natural to human beings which allow you to feel the essence of the story. And the mystical moments of the film, and there are many, made you ""feel"" what the characters felt. It was purely enjoyable. The closest movie I can relate it too was the feel of some of the eerie yet mesmerizing moments in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It has that tempo, that timing of a good Spielberg movie. I don't know how Miyazake did it. Nothing was rushed but it didn't feel slow, it felt perfectly timed. Well, that's all I wanted to add. Again, I agree with all of the reviews I read, even the criticisms of voice choices. Enjoy this movie!",Princess Mononoke
