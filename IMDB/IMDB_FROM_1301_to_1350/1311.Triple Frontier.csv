0,Leofwine_draca,Generally effective,8,9 June 2019,"TRIPLE FRONTIER is a twist on your usual heist movie, with a much more expansive storyline and exotic setting. The story involves five ex-special forces guys, down on their luck, who reassemble for one final job: to relieve a drug lord of his unnecessary wealth. The drug lord lives in a heavily-defended compound in the middle of the jungle, so lots of planning is involved.The first 45 minutes follows said planning in an engaging way; this is a dialogue-heavy movie but the lines are snappy and character-revealing. The cast is appropriately hard-bitten, with reliables like Charlie Hunnam and Pedro Pascal doing well, Ben Affleck with a bit more edge than you usually see from him, and Oscar Isaac holding it all together. The film has a realistic edge without too much in the way of CGI and over-the-top action, which is all for the better. The location scenery is wonderfully utilised, the tension is generally superior and the director isn't overreliant on music to create suspense. The last half throws in the usual big twists and surprises to keep you watching, and that's exactly what I did.",Triple Frontier
1,SnoopyStyle,good overall,7,20 May 2019,"Santiago ""Pope"" Garcia is a military adviser working beside the Colombian police taking down the drug cartels. With his beautiful informer Yovanna, he gets intel about the location of a drug lord hide out and his loot estimated at $75M. He recruits other disenfranchised ex-military; Tom 'Redfly' Davis (Ben Affleck), William 'Ironhead' Miller (Charlie Hunnam), Ben Miller (Garrett Hedlund), and pilot Francisco 'Catfish' Morales (Pedro Pascal). They plan to kill the drug lord and steal his money.This has good action and good locations. It's got good actors and some good tense thrills. A few of the group's move do annoy me. They are well organized but they make a few annoying mistakes that frustrate me. The first annoying contrivance is when they start talking about their plan at a local hang-out. It's kind of annoying when they won't shut up. It's bad enough that they are showing their faces there. On the other hand, I have no problem when Redfly starts pushing back the timeline as he greedily grabs the money. That is a very human concept. Although I have a real issue with not killing the guards. Why don't they have silencers? Why aren't they killing the guards? Are the guards innocent in their eyes? It's awfully unreal like one of those 80's action movies. Then they make the stupidest mistake. The first drop should be the net. It should always be the plan if they don't make it over the hump. They should drop the net on an isolated peak and plan to come back for it later. It's poor planning and they're supposed to be smart. They could still write in a mechanical failure and a crash landing. I just need the guys to be smarter. As for the hike across the Andes, it's somewhat unrealistic to carry that much cargo on foot. At the very least, they should eat one of the mules. There's no way they are carrying that much food. The calories needed to carry that weight would be enormous. Despite the unrealistic turns, I do find the action well done and the thrills intense. The movie is a little long but good overall.",Triple Frontier
2,claudio_carvalho,Another Overrated Production by Netflix,5,25 March 2019,"""Triple Frontier"" is another overrated production by Netflix. The story of greed is lame and insinuates but never tells the country where the drug pin is hidden. The conclusion is stupid, considering that Ben Affleck´s character is separated from his wife. Further, the guys risk their lives to steal the powerful drug dealer, but are incapable to plan to retrieve the money left behind in the Andes. Netflix as usual prefers to invest in marketing instead of in a better quality of their productions, with better stories and screenplays. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Operação Fronteira"" (""Frontier Operation"")",Triple Frontier
3,nogodnomasters,Safe House,5,21 March 2019,"A small group of former special forces/mercenaries decide to hit a cartel leader near the Brazilian border. Things are well planned and it all goes well. Too well. There is more money there than they can possibly carry, but they try. This slows them down and eventually they are traveling by foot, fighting indigenous along the way.The film had some good scenes, but lousy cardboard characters. Looks like the cast took turns phoning in the bad dialogue. I expected more from Netflix.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Triple Frontier
4,kosmasp,So much talent ...,7,23 July 2019,"But it seems to be almost wasted. Or as another reviewer put it: Great potential, unused. I would add though ""slightly"" - because it's not that the talent is not being used. There is quite a bit to love here, like the action sentiment, some of the character motivation and some of the general depiction of Army but more importantly politics and corruption.But it does have threads it opens that it leaves just laying there. It's a bit annoying and would have been more satisfying if it would concentrate on certain things. The ending is not really helpful by being overly dramatic and completely ... well it may be realistic to a degree but it doesn't really make much sense. You can show respect and brotherhood in other ways ... or maybe I'm just a cynic? Whatever teh case, this is decent but still has quite a lot of flaws",Triple Frontier
5,bobcobb301,Triple Frontier,8,25 April 2019,"Certainly not a perfect movie, but if you like action or military dramas you will get something out of this.A lot of chaos, a lot of crazy situations, good throwback to films of the 90's.",Triple Frontier
6,blanche-2,"hot-shot military men, a huge heist, and a lot of trouble",6,25 December 2019,"Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, and Pedro Pascal star in a Netflix movie, ""Triple Frontier"" from 2019. This film started out with people like Johnny Depp, Leonardo diCaprio, Tom Hardy -- I could go on, but you get the point. They all dropped out for various reasons. One reason might have been the script.The first part of the film was very exciting. In South America, military men get together to wipe out a drug lord and steal all of his money - put it this way, as they put it, the house is the safe. And they weren't kidding - every inch of the walls was top to bottom with money packs. It was a decent plan, but their greed causes problems when they try to flee the country. You can guess most of it.I found the end stupid, and I had to ask myself, why did they go through all that they did? And then I asked, why did I?",Triple Frontier
7,searchanddestroy-1,Is it a joke or what?,1,19 March 2019,"Oh my god what a deception. An awful movie, far far below my worst expectations. The basic topic was so exciting, but what a waste. A movie made and loved only for sissies or the wole entire family, including grand ma and auntie. Characters and the last part are so lousy, nearly laughable, foreseeable at the most. I expected a few months ago, when I read the basic scheme, as a kind of WILD BUNCH but what a disaster, a painful experience for me. Forget this crap at all costs. Follow my instructions please. Only the breathtaking settings are worth. Nothing else.
That's not a disaster movie but a movie of disaster.",Triple Frontier
8,CinemaSerf,If only they'd spent some more time/money on the writing....,5,1 May 2020,"Another decent cast get together to perform an audacious deed from under the very nose of a ruthless South American drug lord that is so riddled with plot holes so as to render it little better than an celluloid version of a string vest. A group of former American Special Forces colleagues head south to relieve the fortified home of the drug baron of $75 million. Initially reluctant, Ben Affleck joins forces with Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, Pedro Pascal & Garrett Hedlund and needless to say their carefully planned raid goes awry and they find themselves struggling to flee from the wrath of their foe. The story is all over the place; the acting except, perhaps, Isaac - who manages to holds this all together better - is as gung-ho as their antics and unfortunately the whole thing just descends, quickly, onto a well trodden path of cat and mouse capers with an obvious ending written with well over half of the film yet to go.",Triple Frontier
9,zardoz-13,A BAND OF BLUNDERHEADS,5,17 April 2019,"The premise of ""Triple Frontier,"" Netflix's limited theatrical release about retired special-ops who rob a South American drug trafficker, sounded promising. ""All is Lost"" director J.C. Chandor and Oscar-winning ""Hurt Locker"" scenarist Mark Boal focus on a team of sympathetic, hard-luck, military types who should appeal to any red-blooded connoisseur of American action cinema. Furthermore, these heroes see this mission as their chance to start over. Despite their faithful military service to Uncle Sam, they received neither proper recognition nor sufficient compensation. Now, they embark on a campaign to plunder millions in blood money from a notorious narcotics honcho. Everything boils down to black and white simplicity. Our heroes are cut from the same clichés as Sylvester Stallone's far more seasoned cronies in the ""The Expendables"" trilogy, and they do come loaded for bear. Nevertheless, these guys behave like amateurs, compounding one mistake after another, and undermining their own best efforts. Since the good guys must be sympathetic, the villains must be repugnant. Cartel drug traffickers qualify as ideal heavies. Reviled in real life as much as on the screen, they kill without a qualm and hold nothing sacred. They deserve to die a thousand times. Our heroes should be virtuously white, while the villains should be shady as sin. Comparably, James Brolin led a group of amateurs on a similar mission in ""High Risk"" (1981), but everybody survived with their loot intact for a triumphant finale. ""Triple Frontier"" had potential, but it wastes its powerhouse cast (Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund, and Pedro Pascal) in a hackneyed hokum about the malevolence of greed. Like we don't know the corrosive nature of greed. Presumably, Chandor and Boal must have cut their teeth on the Humphrey Bogart classic ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948) because ""Triple Frontier"" contains a similar storyline. Unfortunately, this escapist oriented, testosterone-laden tale turns sour in Chandor and Boal's hands. Imagine what ""The Expendables"" might have been if they lost, and you may pass up watching ""Triple Frontier.""Technically, ""Triple Frontier"" is a crime movie instead of an adventure epic. Our heroes initiate a home invasion and loot a wealthy cartel mobster's premises. Initially, they search without success for his safe, until it dawns on them the house is the safe! Meantime, since the villain lives beyond the law, he cannot blow the whistle on them without running the risk of the authorities intervening. Greed enters the picture, and our heroes take too many duffels of loot. Until the 1970s, Hollywood maintained a strict censorship policy that crooks never delight in their ill-gotten gains. This policy was part of a larger rule Hollywood struggled to enforce: Crime must not pay! When the Clint Eastwood & Jeff Bridges heist caper ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot"" (1974) came out, the studios gave these criminals greater flexibility, but not without the usual life and death consequences. In ""Triple Frontier,"" we are rooting for our heroes to haul off millions when we realize they've completely lost their minds. Poor planning sabotages their heist. Indeed, they pull off the robbery, but pulling off the getaway is something else. Stallone and his ""Expendables"" cohorts would have gotten clean away, but these loose cannons must pay the piper. ""Triple Frontier"" takes a tragic turn around its 90-minute mark, and you have to ponder whether you want to shed a tear for this band of clowns-in-camouflage. Naturally, The character with the greatest amount to lose inevitably gets it. This kind of old-fashioned morality takes the joy out of what could have been an audacious adventure epic. During the getaway section, our heroes behave like trigger-happy amateurs. They find themselves against odds even more incredible than those of the cartel. Primarily, they find themselves at the mercy of the local population. The getaway occurs in sprawling, spectacular, mountainous scenery, with Hawaii standing in splendidly for Brazil. Our heroes exfiltrate in a wobbly helicopter with their ill-gotten gains dangling beneath it in a cargo net. Foolishly, they have loaded more than the chopper can accommodate and fly over the Andes Mountains. They disintegrate into their own worst enemy.""Triple Frontier"" gets off to a promising start as Chandor and Boal introduce the heroes and their particular predicament that has prompted them to commit a crime. The chief protagonist is Santiago 'Pope' Garcia (Oscar Isaac of ""A Most Violent Year""), and he is a private military contractor who coordinates drug busts with the local authorities. Pope has a confidential informant, Yovanna (Adria Arjona of ""Pacific Rim: Uprising""), and she knows the whereabouts of the local drug trafficker. She also knows that he has concealed millions in his walls. She provides Pope with everything he needs to know about this despicably murderous narco. Pope enlists four of his old service buddies and outlines a scenario that each of them could tote off duffels stuffed with multi-millions in cash. Eventually, Pope consults Tom 'Redfly' Davis (Ben Affleck of ""The Town"") and asks him to draft a combat plan. Reluctantly, Davis designs a scheme with a timetable. Pope persuades a pilot, Francisco 'Catfish' Morales (Pedro Pascal of ""The Equalizer 2""), to fly them across the Andes to a ship on the coast. After Davis agrees to accompany them, William 'Ironhead' Miller (Charlie Hunnam of ""King Arthur"") signs on, and his little brother, MMA fighter Ben Miller (Garrett Hedlund of ""TRON: Legacy""), joins them. Afterward, everything goes sideways. Greed overrides good sense, and one of the five takes a fatal bullet in the head. ""Triple Frontier"" never recovers from the tragic death of this character. In part, he brought it on himself. At this point, our heroes whine like knuckle-heads who bit off more than they could chew and are choking on their own greed. The performances are uniformly robust, but the filmmakers have given each actor little to work with to make their respective characters memorable, for example, like ""The Magnificent Seven."" If you're hoping for thrills and chills, ""Triple Frontier"" provides few.",Triple Frontier
10,bombersflyup,Worthwhile.,7,15 March 2019,"Triple Frontier is a decent crime adventure film, nothing lasting.It could of done without the thirty minute prelude. Affleck and four other guys were pretty full of themselves, to think they could pull off this heist without the risk of casualties. They didn't plan it that well for an elite group and got themselves into trouble frequently. They had time to drop more money from the chopper or to discuss it prior to getting in the chopper and give more to the guy in the plane, to look after it for a profit. I just can't accept that their thieving lives are of more value, as Affleck's character shot and killed three or more of the cocaine farmers who didn't attack. He deserved to be hunted down and shot, so the ending is hollow. Solid film though.",Triple Frontier
11,phd_travel,If you need a Narcos type fix,8,15 March 2019,"For those who have Narcos withdrawal symptoms this is a cure. It's a heist movie with a Narcos flavor set in Colombia. A famous cast including Ben Affleck, Pedro Pascal, Charlie Hunnam and Garrett Hedlund helps to keep the different characters distinct. Oscar Isaac is as always watchable and keeps the interest through the slower first part when he rounds up his old buddies to pull off a heist and kill a bad drug lord at the same time. After the heist things start to go wrong on their escape journey through the mountains to the sea by helicopter then on land. The camaraderie between the group is fun to watch. One good point is it's quite clear what is going on especially when things go wrong. Not like the Oceans type heist movies where things get confusing. Worth one watch.",Triple Frontier
12,trashgang,not about the action,7,31 May 2019,"Another Netflix flick with some really good thespians in it. The flick itself wasn't that bad. Can't say it's an action flick. It does contain actiona dn it do has suspense but it's more about things go wrong and how do you solve it.
So don't think you will see another The Town (2010) or Den Of Thieves (2018) which have a bit of the same summary, go for the money and then things go really awry.Don't get me wrong. it isn't that bad if you can dig a story that looks like an action but is more about friends for life and how to move through life with some terrible issues.
Still worth seeing because the movie was over before you know it even as it clocks in over 2 hours.

13,deloudelouvain,Easy entertainment.,7,19 March 2019,"Don't expect great life changing conversations when you watch a movie like Triple Frontier. It's an action movie about five super soldiers commiting a heist somewhere in the jungle in South-America. The story is very simple, most of the time predictable, but there is alot of action and that's exactly what I expect to get with a movie like this one. The cinematography wasn't bad at all, certainly one of the positive points of this movie. The acting wasn't bad either, but their lines were just not great. Oscar Isaac and Pedro Pascal were enjoyable to watch, Charlie Hunnam on the other hand seems to be only capable to play the same role over and over again, it's like watching Sons Of Anarchy all the time with him. Ben Affleck, not immediately my favorite actor, did what he was supposed to do. All in all Triple Frontier is a popcorn action movie, lay back and relax, just don't expect too much of it.",Triple Frontier
14,namashi_1,An Engaging Action-Thriller!,7,22 March 2019,"J. C. Chandor is a Director to reckon with. With three consecutive brilliant films in his repertoire (Margin Call, All Is Lost and A Most Violent Year), Chandor has proved to be a distinctive voice. And with his latest entry 'Triple Frontier', the talented storyteller has given his fourth winner. This Netflix Film works, and Chandor brings an ensemble, of whom all, prove their prowness yet again.'Triple Frontier' Synopsis: Loyalties are tested when five former special forces operatives reunite to steal a drug lord's fortune, unleashing a chain of unintended consequences.'Triple Frontier', as good as the film, begins dull. Yes, this otherwise compelling has an uninteresting first-act and may make you feel a bit underwhelmed. BUT hold-on, Chandor builds up the narrative in his pace, but once the actual drama kicks in, 'Triple Frontier' comes forward with its pleasures. The entire setting, the characters and the heist they're asked to pull and beyond, is engrossing. Also, despite a so many characters being in the frame at many a time, each and every character gets his own story and arc. Chandor doesn't deliver perfection here, but what he does deliver, without a shed of doubt, is an engaging action-thriller, that leaves an impact. Chandor must be commended for creating a human-drama out of a generic heist film, and to those who are aware of Chandor's taste for the unusual, would only feel further delighted with this film. Chandor's Direction is top-notch.Chandor and Mark Boal's Screenplay could've been more crisp in the first-act, but it gathers enough momentum there-on to earn itself some well-deserved praise. Roman Vasyanov's Cinematography is skilled. Ron Patane.s Editing is good. Art and Costume Design are first-rate. Action-Sequences have been nicely choreographed and executed.Performance-Wise: Osscar Issac and Ben Affleck lead the pack. Issac, the man in the centre stage here, takes full use of the opportunity and portrays his part with complete ease. Affleck is superb here, delivering a winsome supporting turn that leaves a solid mark. Charlie Hunnam continues to be a commanding presence on-screen, while Garrett Hedlund and Pedro Pascal are admirable in their parts, as well. Adria Arjona is perfect.On the whole, 'Triple Frontier' is a yet another success from Director J. C. Chandor. Make time for it.",Triple Frontier

16,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Ambitious but undelivering action yarn,4,18 March 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday NightDuring a round up of a drug lord's inner circle, a young woman escapes, however it's all a front, set up by Agent Santiago 'Pope' Garcia (Oscar Isaac) as a front to put a plan he's hatched with the girl into action. Meanwhile, back in the US, his old army buddies Tom 'Redfly' Davis (Ben Affleck), William 'Ironhead' Miller (Charlie Hunnam), his brother Ben (Garrett Hedlund) and Francisco 'Catfish' Morales (Pedro Pascal) are scraping by and struggling to adjust to civilian life. Garcia returns and persuades them all to take part in a plan to go to Colombia and steal a fortune from a drug lord. Naturally, things don't go to plan...Original concepts and ideas are all but dead in the field of screen-writing, and so the only real alternative seems to be to make distracting variations on old themes. And so director J.C. Chandor has rounded up an impressive, all star cast, for another spin on a most familiar genre: the heist thriller. To be honest, the premise would suitably frame any number of low budget, direct to DVD non-entities, never mind a more high profile production such as Triple Frontier. And so, it's all the more baffling how Chandor seems to want to wring as much depth out of something with so little meat on its bones.With its set up, featuring a slew of beefed up Hollywood hard men in military gear, it seems billed primarily as an action movie, but despite some subliminal promise of this, the first half at least drags by without much in the way of any exciting action sequences, instead trying to ferment a tense atmosphere. It does get a bit more juicy towards the end, but it's a long wait, in a film needlessly pipping at just over the two hour mark, without generating the tension or emotional investment in the characters, whose behaviour as seasoned military men at times beggars belief, to sustain it for that long.Chandor has taken a well worn genre and tried to take it in new directions, with less than successful results. Everyone involved appears to be desperately trying to resuscitate a dead horse. **",Triple Frontier
17,MOscarbradley,"A good action picture, nothing more.",7,25 May 2019,"A disappointment but only slightly. ""Triple Frontier"" is directed by J.C. Chandor who co-wrote the screenplay with Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow is one of the Executive Producers. It's an action picture, a Colombian drugs movie and a heist movie. There are fine set=pieces and it looks terrific; the mostly Colombian locations are beautifully photographed. The problem is for a Chandor/Boal picture there isn't much depth.This is a buddy movie in which the good guys cum bad guys are played by Ben Affleck, (who never really learned to act in a fairly long career), Oscar Isaac, (who needs better material than this if he is to make an impression), Charlie Hunnam, (who's actually not too bad here), and Garrett Hedlund and Pedro Pascal, who are both cast in very one-dimensional roles. It is, in other words, formulaic even if the formula isn't a bad one but it's no ""Sicario"" and it's certainly no ""Salvador"". It's brainless and it's exciting and we've seen it all before, (""Three Kings"" had a not dissimilar plot and was a much better film). Chandor and Boal can, and have, done better.",Triple Frontier
18,ThomasDrufke,Camaraderie,7,5 May 2019,"Assembling an all-star cast of prominent actors, Triple Frontier is a riveting action-heist film about a team of war veterans reuniting to pull ""one last job"" against a drug lord in Columbia. The first thing to note is that the camaraderie is easily believable between Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Garrett Hedlund, Charlie Hunnam, and Pedro Pascal. In just a few scenes, director J.C. Chandor establishes a bond and a history between these five guys, and you never need to see a single flashback to do it. And really the entire first half of the film is about building up the team, whether that be through dialogue or action, only to enact a brutal second half. One that certainly has payoff, but never truly capitalizes on the building intensity of the first & second act. However, I really liked the last few scenes, which gave the entire film & mission extra weight.7.8/10",Triple Frontier
19,Cineanalyst,Bloody Ocean's,4,14 March 2019,"Another forgettable and flawed heist movie, ""Triple Frontier"" also tries, but largely fails, to inject some social commentary into its action-packed dramatics. It reminds me a bit of ""Widows"" (2018), which I also saw recently. Both would've benefited from a singular focus on the heist, if not developing its characters more or articulating the social themes better. The dialogue in this one is especially atrocious, as the characters bloviate about being underpaid warriors, being brothers in arms, family, masculinity, war and corruption. All of them wear their emotions on their sleeves and will scream out their various feelings of anger, greed, joy and melancholy throughout. Much of the runtime is spent on recruiting the team for the heist, yet the narrative never manages to add much depth to any of their lives. One was idealistically fighting the war on drugs and has a romantic relationship that's hardly explored, another is a motivational speaker who hypocritically encourages reenlistment, one is struggling to provide for his family, and the two others apparently aren't important enough for any meaningful background story beyond pilot without a license and MMA fighter.The ""Ocean's"" series may not always do much better in establishing its bevy of co-conspirators, but at least those movies tend to do so with some cinematic flair, a light touch and snappy dialogue. ""Triple Frontier,"" on the other hand, drags and is heavy-handed both in commentary and characterization. Plus, it's hard to swallow all its talk against violence when its violent action scenes are the only thing worth seeing here.",Triple Frontier

Pacing was also excellent because at 2 hours run time i was not bored by a second and was glued to me screen. And while ""Triple Frontier"" is a pure fiction, screenplay by Mark Boal (""The Hurt Locker"") was very involving.Overall, some might and will dislike this movie probably because it lacks tons of action.

21,Platypuschow,Triple Frontier: Action flick? Check. But a dumb action flick? Also check,5,16 March 2019,"Triple Frontier is a demonstration of just how far Netflix movies have come, a huge scale action movie. But does it deliver?Well immediately I'm bias, I'm not an action movie guy and never have been. Call me picky but I want more substance from my films than a wafer thin plot, gunfire, explosions, car chases and brain dead dialogue.Here we have Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam (Who I can't stand but don't know why), Oscar Isaac and Pedro ""Dude where's my head"" Pascal in a rip roaring big budget action heist movie.Telling the tale of former special forces guys *Yawn* who are roped into a mission, an assassination where they can also rob millions of dollars and turn their lives around. Deep in the jungles of Brazil the heist begins, but as is always the way things don't exactly go to plan.Sadly this is exactly what I feared it would be, a brainless action flick. It suffers all the usual cliches, it brings nothing to the table that we haven't seen before and quite frankly most of the cast just look bored. Like they're there for the paycheck and can't wait to go home.Triple Frontier succeeds in looking good, visually its impressive (Even though that's clearly Hawaii not Brazil). But a movie needs a lot more than impressive visuals to be enjoyable, sure they do a good job in its creation but this would have been better suited in the 80's/90's when action flicks had more credibility.Is it the worst out there?

Yes, the plot may be redundant of a heist thriller again. A group of paramilitary retired soldiers stealing from a drug cartel's home and as they escape. Everything goes wrong which they will have to travel in a hostile country to get out. It is one intense and exciting journey to see this cast ensemble on screen. Which makes the movie worth watching.The plot follows Pope (Oscar Isaac) a private military advisor who gathered intel that a drug cartel leader has all his money stored in his home in the middle of the jungle in Columbia. Pope recruits his old team Tom (Ben Affleck), William (Charlie Hunnam), Ben (Garrett Hedlund), and Francisco (Pedro Pascal) to come to Columbia and plan a heist to rob from the cartel leader. With Pope's informant Yovanna (Adria Arjona) in the inside job working for the cartel. They rob from the house. But escaping with a huge load of money out of the country becomes very difficult with the cartel right on their trail.The plot is a redundant heist story. But it does have some intense thrills to keep you entertained. With the story involving ex paramilitary soldiers who are done with the life of killing and struggling with PTSD. When they are faced in a situation were they will have to fight for their survival yet again. It does become a survival thriller journey when there helicopter crashes and they have to carry loads of money across the mountains to their extract point on a beach.The cast is great. Ben Affleck was good playing a tired soldier who is struggling with a day time job of trying to be a realtor. Oscar Isaac playing a private military who wants to do one job to get out of the life in the military. Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund, and Pedro Pascal were good playing their characters.The film does have some gritty action sequences with these groups of guys trying to fight for their lives as they escape. It does have that intensity build up that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Even when they are travelling through the mountains. They will have to stick together while their loyalties are tested against each other. If carrying a huge load of money is worth more than their own lives.Overall, Triple Frontier is a good film. It does have a good amount of action to keep you entertained. A script and sharp direction to keep the suspense and thrills at bay. A great cast ensemble that works. And heists plot to add to the list of other films.",Triple Frontier

Starring Ben Affleck, and Oscar Isaac in this heist drama, this film had much surrounding hype around it during upon its release. After being in production and gone through many changes over the years, Netflix finally picked it up and was its releases suitor. One can tell as the film did have a feel that it could have easily been released into theaters, given its cast.Triple Frontier starts off very interesting and intriguing with Oscar Isaac in the opening sequences, then as it introduces its characters, we starts to get a feel and begin more hooked on what is about to occur, such as their heist plan.Though after midway through the film, it starts to stall and feels lesser than interesting and goes downhill (around the time Adria Arjona exits from film), then once again once *Spoilers* Ben Affleck's character gets shot and kill (which was surprising to say the least, given his star presence and top billing- as he was the only member of the five leads to die).The film isn't bad but the second act wasn't as great, and there were severely no twists or turns or anything given much of suspense. Things felt very straightforward. It was also surprising how honest the friends were, as in typically these heist films involving several groups of friends archiving large sums of money, there is often usually one character of the group to turn rogue and betray the others. However, this was not the case here.Perhaps some twists would have made the film feel a lot more authentic and overall give it more of a edge and intrigue. It did lack suspense and thrills. In the end, this film was slightly disappointed given its hype as we feel it could had the potential to be something great.",Triple Frontier
26,eddie_baggins,"Another ""almost"" Netflix film",6,15 March 2019,"Like so many other of its unfortunate Netflix compatriots, Triple Frontier is yet another ""almost"" film for the streaming service.On paper this is a film that screams success.Helmed by young and proven director J.C Chandor, who on the back of his first three films Margin Call, All is Lost and the criminally underrated A Most Violent Year has established himself as one of the must-watch directors in Hollywood and with this film starring a cast of proven performers in the forms of Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund and Pedro Pascal, Triple Frontier feels like the type of all-round production that Netflix has mostly missed so far in its original offerings.Despite the on paper qualities, Chandor's film never film never breaks the shackles holding it back, there's moments of genuine cinematic spectacle and execution and the seasoned cast all give it a good crack but there's a constant, nagging feeling that the thrilling concept and potential of this men on a mission tale misses the mark more than it meets or exceeds it.It's not to say Triple Frontier is a bad film, the film looks great and features some beautifully shot moments of quietness and carnage and still at times gets the pulse racing with its heist concept that goes from bad to worse very quickly for Isaac's Pope and his fellow ex-elite American special forces agents as they attempt to rob a drug kingpin of hundreds of millions of dollars in the depths of a South American rain forest.The main problem is the films solid and gripping moments are too frequently disrupted by a sense that things remain throughout rather underdeveloped or under-explored, particularly evident in the character stakes that never allows us to connect meaningfully with any of this crack team, meaning the stakes often feel lower than they should due to the fact we don't really care to much what fate lays ahead for these well-oiled operatives.It's a shame Chandor and his cast couldn't elevate things here from a passable and polished time filler to something truly of note and with Triple Frontier at various times starring some of Hollywood's elite in previously developing inceptions, you can't help but feel like what we are left with is the bare basics product of a story that could've provided something special had everything aligned up in a more comprehensive fashion.Final Say -A classic case of an ""almost"" film, Triple Frontier isn't horrible and is at times elevated by its shine and polish and a cast that is always watchable but you never escape the feeling that this is a tale that could've provided a lot more, culminating in a finale that makes the whole experience even more forgettable.3 tickets to Sydney out of 5",Triple Frontier

29,southdavid,Mule On Rouge,5,21 March 2019,"I've commented in other reviews about how Netflix has become a bit of a dumping ground for disappointing sci-fi films to avoid the critical glare of the box office and claw back some money from Netflix views. The good news is that ""Triple Fronter"" isn't that - the bad news, it's only not that because it isn't science fiction.Oscar Isaac is Garcia, a former US marine who has spent the last few years trying to dismantle the network of a South American drug lord. When he finally locates the drug baron's central compound, he also discovers that he keeps all of his considerable cash supplies on site. He enlists several of his former colleagues, played by Ben Affleck, Pedro Pascal, Charlie Hunnam and Garret Hedlund, from their civilian lives to undertake a risky heist of the cash.What I find most baffling about the whole film, reading about it here, is why there was so much passion to make a film that is so ordinary, so run of the mill, that is might as well still not exist. Why actors with these profiles wanted to be in it, let alone the litany of talent that were attached, or passed in the years that the film has been made is bizarre. I can only assume that the desire to hang about in Hawaii was the determining factor.It can't be anything to do with a pedestrian script and well-worn story, which offers precisely nothing in terms of shocks or twists. Maybe the tiny bit of musing on what value the skills of a soldier have in civilian life and the nature of greed read deeper than they play out in the end product - but again it seems doubtful.This is not to say that ""Triple Frontier"" is a bad film. The cinematography, particularly the helicopter shots, and the musical choices, are good. None of the performances bad either, although by the same token, none are particularly notable and that largely sums up the whole film.""Not particularly notable"".",Triple Frontier
30,imseeg,"A bit tedious for an action movie. NOT credible either, with cheap sounding dialogues. Acting is ok ish...",6,31 August 2019,"I expected a lot more from this movie, with these kind of great actors involved, like Ben Affleck and Oscar Isaac. They both werent acting really bad, but they certainly never excelled either. This movie felt more like a casual tv series, instead of a suspenseful movie. It was just going through the motions, like any other formula action movie, never rising above average. I never experienced a moment of real tension or drama either, even when specific plot turns would request such an intensity.The direction, photography, soundtrack and the story are all kind of mediocre. It's not a bad movie, just a bit tedious and predictable. It felt more like a computer shooter game, turned into a movie, without any real characters one could sympathize with. And the action wasnt particularly special or exciting either. Seen it all before.The story: a group of american ex-soldiers are planning on robbing a brasilian druglord. The heist doesnt go according to plan. Will they be able to get out alive?",Triple Frontier
31,subxerogravity,It's a movie that has the type of all-star cast that I want to see ensumbled together.,8,15 March 2019,"Oscar Issac is one of my favorite actors. He works hard at diversifying himself and he makes it look so easy.Charlie Hunnam is another dude who cares about bringing variety to his resume even when he has that outlaw outsider with a a heart persona down packed.Than you have Ben Affleck whose has been making a lot of movies that I love lately. Not feeling that tiny gut he's grown lately as it seals the deal that he's no longer the Dark Knight (Which I think sucks cause I liked his Batman).Garrett Hedlund is a very charming actor.And Pedro Pascal is a new face for me among these dudes that has popped up on my radar since his amazing turn in the Netflix show, Narcos.The five men are fine actors and have great chemistry together. It never weavers that these guys are old friends in combat, such a outstanding mosh up.It's a heist movie where these guys are going down to a South American country to pull a job. It's also a story about how not being respecting for putting your life on the line for your country can change you into something that you don't want to be and how a lot of money can make you even worse. It's amazing how people who seem to have all the integrity in the world can talk themselves into giving it up (Then again, the drug Czar or dictator or...I not sure if I caught who he is (not important) had enough money stashed in his walls that even Mister Rodgers would consider popping a cap up in somebody who would come between him and becoming the 2 percent)Hunnam recently got into a little trouble while promoting this movie due to him being into some ""Men's rights"" leader who post things on the dark web, but I will say, I think I understand why he thought his line of thinking would be OK. Simply because this is a movie about male relationships. Although you could make the argument that the movie is about Soldier relationships, which is true, but these soldiers (like most soldiers) are men, and this band of brothers thing was really working overtime in this film.The music following through the film works for me, especially the constant drop of Metallica songs (I always though Orion would make the perfect end credits song)Overall, the movie totally has me on the edge of my seat the hole time. Never a dull moment and you never know what to expect. It's way too real, grimm and bitter sweet, and the combination makes for such a complex and complete movie about the human condition.Way to go Netflix.",Triple Frontier
32,alindsay-al,An Average Action Film,5,30 March 2019,"This film has had a ton of marketing put into it and an all star cast so I ahve now seen Triple Frontier and i've got to be honest this film really disappointed me. The premise of the film sees a group of ex marines attempt to take down a crime lord and take the money he owns. Ben Affleck plays the lead in this film and he was okay in this film. His character has an interesting arc in the film which is more then can be said for some characters but I think Affleck has started to become a bit lazy. He seems to play the same thing in everything at the moment and maybe needs a proper break to revitalise himself. The supporting cast is large, Oscar Isaac has the most depth of any of the characters in the film and does a good job in the role, he really is a top class actor doing consistently good work. Pedro Pascal is fun in this film and adds a bit of extra flair into this film, however, I didn't really care about his or the characters of Charlie Hunnam and Garret Hedland. They were just a bit one dimensional and I wasn't fussed about what happened to them as the film progressed. The story has some promise at first seeing these different personalities come together for this cause and I liked a couple of the character arcs. But the second half of this film goes off the rails and is really drab and uninspiring, it crawls to the finish after a pretty strong opening. The script is completely average, some of the drama is used well and applied appropriatley, but others miss and the humour is non existant here. The style has some decent action scenes when they happen with some good gun action. But this film isn't paced very well and when it slows down it feels like it really slows down and takes ages to get back into the action. Overall this is a very forgettable film that unless you like some of the actors isn't worth a watch.",Triple Frontier
33,lukem-52760,EXCELLENT WELL MADE ACTION CRIME THRILLER & AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE BY AFFLECK!!!,8,16 September 2019,"This is an excellent movie, tense & exciting as hell, the Columbian jungle setting looks beautiful & scary & adds an old school 80s or 90s Action movie atmosphere to it!!!
The cast is excellent especially the older & more rugged ""Ben Affleck"" he gives such an intense & moving performance as a retired soldier who is a struggling sad & down on his luck, family man, Affleck is such a good actor & in my opinion one of the best leading men in movies but he seems to get hated on so much but why?
Affleck was the best thing about the underrated ""Batman vs Superman"" & the underrated ""Justice league"" both excellent movies with an excellent Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Affleck gave us the best,toughest & darkest batman so far,he was fantastic!!!
So yeah I'm an Affleck fan, he was also excellent as Daredevil also an excellent dark superhero film & we all know how great Affleck has been with his later more dramatic work with films like ""The Town"" ""Argo"" ""The Accountant"" & more!!! He's a great actor & director so yeah I'm sticking up for Affleck.
Affleck really does make a good action hero & i would love to see him take on more roles like this!!!
Here he feels like this point in his career he has nothing to prove to anyone, he looks comfortable in himself as an actor & you see it on screen in ""Triple Frontier"" as he's bigger in frame & by that i mean he's got an ordinary build/body like most guys & isn't ripped to shreds with huge bulging muscles & his look totally suits him for his age!!! Affleck doesn't need to look like how ""Hollywood"" thinks all men have to look like & Affleck looks AWESOME for it!!! The ripped up look is so boring now so when you get a top actor like Affleck looking like an ordinary guy it's great & here he has abit of a ""dadbod"" & looks better than the rest of the cast.
Affleck is a great Action hero.The cast is excellent here, you feel for each character & like each guy on this ""Expendables"" style team, these are retired soldiers/Commandos who come together for a last job to take out a crime lord & rob all his money to set themselves up for life as each man is struggling in life, it's a good human story & an exciting Heist thriller with old school brutal action & tons of suspense filled scenes, the 2nd best performance comes from ""Charlie Hunnam"" who really stands out in this movie!!! The rest of the excellent cast is ""Oscar Isaac"" ""Garett Hedlund"" & ""Pedro Pascal"" all who give incredible intense performances & make a great rag-tag team.This is a great action-Thriller with a great cast & there's real emotion depth as well as brutal intense action",Triple Frontier
34,TdSmth5,From great action to bizarre survival,7,19 September 2021,"A police team is about to raid some house in Colombia. The bad guys are well armed and put up a fight. There's an American involved in some capacity. Several girls are in the house as well and one of them manages to escape somehow. She meets up later with the American. She's his CI and tells him that she knows where the big bad drug lord is. Why she waited for this point to tell him is unclear. She's been working for the drug lord in accounting and delivering his money to his house. This guy doesn't trust banks so he keeps all his money in his house. That gives the American an idea.Now he's back in the US getting in touch with his former special forces buddies. He pitches this job: take out the drug lord without killing anyone else and steal his money, a couple million for each. Yet, none of them is particularly interested even though all of them are in dire straights somehow. It takes the movie about 30 minutes for our Reluctant Hollywood Heroes (TM) to finally agree to this darn job.So they're off to Colombia/Brazil/Peru. The job seems fairly straightforward. On Sundays the family goes to church with most guards. The drug lord stays home with a few guards. That's when they'll attack. They have a 40 minute window to take care off things and drive away with the money, take a helicopter to the coast and then take a boat to somewhere. Why they think flying a helicopter for hours in those areas won't catch the authorities's attention who knows. It all works out well up to the point where they reach the guy's office, except he isn't there, nor is there any money. Eventually they realize the money is hidden in the walls...not just a few million but hundreds of millions, and now finally the one super reluctant guy gets super greedy and wants to grab as much money as possible--window of time be damned. At some point the drug lord emerges from his panic room (duh) much to the surprise of the goofs. Now of course it turns into a massacre as the guards start returning from churchAs they leave with cars full of money they drive by the family and make no attempt to conceal their faces. At the airport they realize they have way too much money to fly safely across the Andes, but what the hell, why listen to the pilot. As they are about to reach the peak of the Andes, the chopper can't make it so they have to drop some off the money, but then the chopper gets damaged and they have to land in a small farming village, where things again go wrong and they have to kill some of the villagers. Now they off on mules loaded with cash to cross the Andes! Again things go sideways fast. Now they pretty much have to forget about the money and try to save their lives.This movie then is clearly divided into two part. One very exciting action phase and one beyond unbelievable survival tale with the obligatory drama. The action is really well done, you can totally buy these goofs as ex-special forces. The raid on the drug lords house is super-exciting and so well-filmed. But then the survival tale is a letdown. A shame that we can't get a a straightforward high-quality action movie that doesn't aim to expand into to other genres unnecessarily. But it's fairly common. Also common among these Netflix movies is a weird tone, as if the crew itself isn't convinced about their work which coupled with excess running time and slow pace makes for an odd B-movie feel.Still this movie is unconventional in many good ways as well, compared to the junk that's being produced these days by the dozens.",Triple Frontier
35,masonfisk,POOR PLOTTING PLUMMETS THIS PERIL...!,5,13 April 2019,"A actioner masquerading as social commentary currently streaming on Netflix starring Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Pedro Pascal & Garrett Hedlund. A south of the border military advisor gets wind of a narco's stash of cash so he decides to recruit his former combat brethren, who are going through differing stages of domestic ills (one is reduced to being a real estate agent, another a MMA fighter while another is a suspended pilot), to snatch the loot hoping their trained acumen will insure the heist will go off w/o a hitch (what do you think will happen?). No sooner does one recite to himself the old fortune cookie mantra of 'eyes being bigger than their stomachs' we see a successful plan in theory going to poop in a hurry. Working from a playbook best remembered from the old John Huston film ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", greed it turns out is not only not good but quite deadly as well as the money grab strands our soldiers of misfortune transporting their booty (their helicopter crashes due to the extreme weight of their moneyed haul) on pack animals to a waiting ship staying just that far ahead of the cartel hot on their heels to kill them & get their money back. Co-written & directed by J.C. Chandor (Margin Call/A Most Violent Year), the story sounds potent & of the moment but the execution & character motivation leaves much to be desired when the ensemble involved seem to have left their brains at home when the reality of the situation would dictate otherwise.",Triple Frontier
36,aidanratesmovies,"Bad pacing, and a meh script, in an otherwise exciting action film",6,28 March 2019,"Though its war film like setting and thrills may be enough for some, Triple Frontier struggles greatly at what way it wants to tell its own story. Its cast is great, and all try their best to give it their all, besides Ben Affleck who seems to fall flat at every big moment he seems to have. The cast unfortunately though is undermined by a overwordy script and a series of many pacing issues. That being said, Triple Frontier is certainly a stunning achievement in the action department, providing intense thrills and moments expertly, making up for its otherwise dull tone.

44,arungeorge13,"Gets the first and second acts right, followed by a third that goes steadily downhill! [+54%]",5,15 March 2019,"Heist thrillers are interesting for three major reasons: the planning, the execution, and the fallout. While the planning and the execution phases work out well in J.C Chandor's latest flick (starring Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund, Pedro Pascal, and Adria Arjona), it's the fallout that disappoints. Written by Mark Boal (Kathryn Bigelow's frequent screenwriting collaborator - for works such as 'The Hurt Locker', 'Zero Dark Thirty', and 'Detroit'), Triple Frontier was initially supposed to be yet another venture between him and Bigelow. I begin to wonder how Bigelow would have tackled this subject. I do not wish to undermine J.C Chandor's directorial abilities but going full war-veteran mode (and unabashedly commercial, in the process) may not exactly be his forte (as opposed to Bigelow). All his previous films have been subtle slow-burners that relied more on character development and the transitions the protagonists are subjected to (hint: 'All Is Lost', 'A Most Violent Year').'Triple Frontier' follows a bunch of former Special-Ops soldiers who come together for a 'final job'. The backstories of these operatives (apart from maybe Affleck's, to an extent) aren't the most fleshed out. Other than the 'I killed a lot of people and that hurts me' sentiment, there's not much going on for these guys (dubbed Pope, Redfly, Ironhead, and Catfish) to be favored by the viewers. There's a truckload of money involved and part of the heist involves getting rid of the drug-lord kingpin who's living shielded in his safehouse in the middle of a jungle.While the screenplay doesn't lay out reasons for viewers to like these ex-soldiers, what helps is the fact that they're being played by solid A-listers. It's almost as if writer Boal asked each of these actors to add their own imprint to the characters as he was too lazy to impart any broad strokes. Plus, a multi-starrer film always struggles when it comes to deciding who's who in certain significant scenes. While the film has been shot beautifully (by cinematographer Roman Vasyanov, a frequent David Ayer collaborator) in its entirety, the third act (i.e. the group's journey to safe-zone post-heist) isn't as thrilling as we'd expect it to be. Certain decisions are questionable, and certain dialogues preposterous. But the cast ensures that there's never a dull, uninteresting moment.Chandor could have used more original score by Disasterpeace in the film, instead of slyly chucking in a few old hits by Metallica ('For Whom The Bell Tolls', 'Orion'), Fleetwood Mac ('The Chain'), Pantera ('Walk'), and Bob Dylan ('Masters of War') amongst others, for more subtlety and less dramatic effect. The dudes, led by Isaac and Affleck, get the job done in terms of performances. Adria Arjona, the Puerto Rican beauty, is a good choice for the only major female character in the film.It's not to say that while the film definitely lacks in storytelling and thrills in the finale, there are scenes which remind you of what the film could have been, had the writing been more consistent. (Hint: Garcia throwing a wad of money at a confused teenage kid who was trying to kill them earlier). When the film draws to a close, one cannot help but let out a sigh, as there was tremendous effort in conjuring up the basic plot (only let down by subpar follow-through), and with a cast such as this in hand, 'Triple Frontier' should have been nothing short of a stunner! This could have been the ideal antithesis to Peter Berg's 'Lone Survivor', but no it isn't.The action scenes, however, are slick. The choreography is smooth, the pacing just about right. 'Triple Frontier' suffers from one-note characters and a screenplay that struggles to strike a balance between campy and artsy.",Triple Frontier

The film gives you just enough information and background about the main characters and puts them in enough believable peril. The movie's pretty predictable and by the last third of the movie the pacing slows down quite a bit. I enjoyed the moments the film presents though when the men are escaping.

The one where it becomes family friendly once Netflix gets involved. They weird movies up in a horrible way. It loses its artistic value. I've seen it with everything. Irishman, Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Velvet Buzzsaw, etc etc. They take great artists and make them worthless.If it wasn't a Netflix, it could have been top notch.

47,Troy_Campbell,Compelling action flick.,7,15 March 2019,"Arguably the biggest Netflix release so far in 2019, this action thriller is stacked with talent. J.C Chandor (Margin Call, A Most Violent Year) behind the camera, Mark Boal (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) on scripting duty, and the likes of Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, Pedro Pascal and Charlie Hunnam on screen. There's also clearly a lot of money behind this production as this crime saga - in which a group of former special forces soldiers plan an armed robbery on a drug cartel kingpin - not only shoots on location throughout South America but boasts some epic set pieces. Said action sequences largely take place in the first hour, opening with an exhilarating mid-town gun battle and culminating in a breathtaking heist that expertly builds tension and exudes bulk coolness. From here it turns into somewhat of a survival flick, slowing down the pace to become more contemplative and dialogue-driven. The second half challenges genre convention and attempts at a type of poignancy, which is interesting, but also a lot less exciting. The switch in tempo and tone is undeniably ambitious, and the impressive cast ensure a decent level of buy-in, yet I couldn't help but feel a little let down by the lack of action (a minor climactic car-bound sequence fails to pump the adrenaline) in the final act. Isaac's lead performance highlights why he's one of the most intriguing and enthralling actors working today, whilst Pascal is best of the rest in another charismatic and moving turn. There are no weak links though; Affleck, Hunnam and Garrett Hedlund rounding out a powerhouse ensemble. Doesn't finish as strong as it could have, but Triple Frontier is nevertheless a compelling and enjoyable action pic with plenty to chew on.",Triple Frontier

This is a story we've seen a thousand times, but I thought this group of actors could pull it together to make a watchable movie. This project proves that without competent writing you just can't make a decent movie.This started to come way off the rails right when the heist started going down and sunk to Mariana Trench levels soon after. And why, why, why did this run two hours? And you just know that they can't get away with it-that only happens in comedies because in dramas we always need to be reminded that stealing is wrong.If your escape plan entails going over the Andes in any way, shape, or form, you need a new escape plan. Why not fly east? Whatever. That was one of the least stupid parts of this moronic caper movie. Then they drag the money over the Andes.The dialogue was 1 star throughout the film.

49,Prashast_Singh,An enjoyable action-adventure film. Just didn't need to be so long.,9,20 April 2020,"Just watched it on Netflix. By the end, I felt exhausted, and in a good way. The action sequences were beautifully executed and the dramatic undertones worked well. But I felt the film didn't need to be stretched this much, especially when the tonal shift in the second half kills the excitement factor. Nevertheless, it's an engaging watch for those who enjoy action-adventure films.Triple Frontier starts on a promising note, with some explosive action sequences captured in a spectacular manner. Then we have this heist mission (as you can tell from the synopsis, no spoilers) but it takes its own sweet time to build up. Nevertheless, it proceeds well and the first half, despite having some slow parts, moves at a pretty brisk pace with exciting action and suspense. The tension keeps elevating and some sequences grab immediate attention. The story seems to have a hidden satirical element in it that works if you really think about what the film is trying to convey.But it starts to feel like a bit of stretch during the second half when the dramatic tone eliminates the suspense factor that comes alive only during the action scenes. This tonal shift could've been handled better and the slow pacing could've been fixed. That's the only issue I had with this film. Otherwise, the performances are impressive and so are the action sequences, cinematography, locales and some unexpected twists.Triple Frontier is not perfect, but then no film is meant to be and that's where the beauty lies. I'm deducting 1 star out of 10 due to the unexpected slow pace/stretched parts, but giving it a solid 9 for its rich entertainment value as an action film.",Triple Frontier

51,saptesh786,How to handle heist money !,8,15 March 2019,"If you rob a lot of money (really lot of huge cash) equal to full of two vans, then how could you manage them to take at your home ? Imaging and find possible answers. When done then see this movie you will really enjoy this bigger heist thriller. This movie is very alike from other heist plot movies. Here is making heist is not so tricky or with hi fi gazettes. No unnecessary actions. Villain is not so powerful and dangerous. Then what is in this movie? Well! Answer is above. How five ex-soldiers to manage such huge amount with them till its destination is an enjoyable journey of thrill and tension you will definitely likes. Both tension and thrill will bind you till the end. Must watch for result of cupidity of men for money and where takes them to for the same. Photography and camerawork is good. At acting side Oscar Issac is at the top position then come Ben Affleck and rest order team is okay. The story of robbery, greediness, sacrifice, friendship, braveness, grief is just watchable. You will be not disappointed even there is no usual action scene of bad villains or kick ass fights or meaningless gun fires. Also another brighter side of the story that out of five friends no one tries to betrayal each other even such huge money they carrying with them. As me this is the most desirable plus point of the movie. Must watch for difference. End is open for sequel. Waiting.",Triple Frontier
52,Richie-67-485852,TRIPLE WIN,10,5 December 2020,"Who doesn't like caper movies, trained killer NAVY SEALS, drug dealer shoot-outs, daring escapes and lots and lots of money if you can keep it? This is that film. Good acting, directing and story plot and do not be in a hurry to judge this movie in the first few minutes of which it took for it to establish itself and set up the next two hours and all the characters that follow. Just relax and it will begin. It is fun to watch highly trained, excellent conditioned military types do their thing providing it is done with class. This movie has that. Interesting locations and of course the age old lesson to be learned about ill-gotten gains is nicely presented. Millions of dollars acts on you as would tens of millions but when hundreds of millions kick in, it starts to become like a drug that seduces you and holds onto you tightly. It did that do the guy they steal it from too and do not think you are an exception either. There is a Universal law that states: whatever you get into, gets into you and that is non-negotiable. As you gain so does the dark forces as well each one taking a turn for the risk. Humans just don't handle greed too well. It can be a life and death game. Another premise which is the ability to have all you want is another non-negotiable law too. Overcoming considerations and never leaving the ""land of plenty"" puts one in a sedative state of mind making them dull and out of balance with their rightful portion. What then? Well if you have to lie, cheat, steal or kill to gain then it is not for you. Seek the balance and life makes sense. Yet man will continue to argue this point unsuccessfully I might add. Enjoy Ben Affleck who fills the screen with meaning with a devoted supporting cast of pros. Entertainment at its finest oh and one more thing. Have a decent snack or two ready with a tasty drink so you don't nail bite for some scenes and of course for movie enjoyment too. This is sequel food here. Lets see what happens during these trying times",Triple Frontier
53,thekarmicnomad,A heist-war movie with,7,15 April 2019,"Some ex army types decide to knock over a drugs baron and at the same time ""help"" the local communities.As expected the heist doesn't go according to plan and soon the ""good guys"" are unloading M4's in to trucks filled with locals.This film has a relative air of realism to it - there are no slow motion moments as the heroes dive in front of an explosion, or leap from cliff top to cliff top.
The action is fast and un-glorified.The main antagonists here aren't the drug lords themselves but the local people that have to coexist with them.
In this respect the film does hit a note about how quickly secondary agendas are dropped and the speed with which morality becomes a luxury few can afford.The film tries to poke at the human side of these big macho dudes but there really isn't scope in this story to uncover much.This is not an action film as such but at the same time there is not a great deal going on outside of the heist.People have pointed out a lot of plot holes, from what I read, seemingly ridiculous mistakes are common place in actual military operation.

54,educallejero,Finally a Netflix movie feels cinematic,6,15 March 2019,"This is a first, in my opinion.
It's a fine movie, not great.
But, there are more than a few things that wouldn't fly on a typical Hollywood production, so I'm going to forget some mistakes that otherwise would annoy me to no end.The characters, for example, are great and slightly ""off"" when compared to the normal stereotypes. All of them more realistic and complex than the action heroes Hollywood vomits on us.There are a few surprises on the plot too; the movie takes its time with character moments. Every decision and action has an impact. This is key, because often we are shown us something really dramatic o violent, just to continue after it with the characters unmoved like nothing really happened.
Not here. Every decision made changed the characters, the situations and their reactions.And even with a messy ending that comes really close to destroy what the movie built before, I'll give it one more point for the relative originality.",Triple Frontier
55,PartialMovieViewer,Six Stars Because I Saw the End,6,12 May 2019,"Not horrible, nor cosmically grand, but it was watchable. I'm guessing there is a very loose pedigree here...'The Three Godfathers.' Meh, what do I know or care for that matter. To begin I need to use a the word 'formulaic,' but in a good way. For me, formulaic parts of a movie often turn out to be pretty good. From what I've read on IMDB, formulaic is 'old and rehashed doo-doo,' and the counter to formulaic would be artistic (something new and never done before). Two movie come to mind when one talks about artistic; 1) ""Birdman"", unwatchable time-dragger, starring Mr. Michael Keaton, and 2) ""Police Academy"", a totally heroic, police saga starring the guy who makes those weird sounds, Steve Gutenberg, David Graf and Bubba Smith. I enjoyed one movie and not the other. Both movies are considered artsy flicks by different elite groups. In any case, I prefer formulaic stuff happening. I relate to something I know, and vomit in response to that which is not formulaic. This movie does wander into the valley of the new and unknown, but cooler minds must have prevailed. I will not see this movie again and am very glad I did not have to pay for it. That being said, it wasn't. Bad.",Triple Frontier
56,Holt344,Decent crime movie with a great ensemble cast,7,15 March 2019,"The locations that they picked to shoot the movie is just stunning, making us believe the scenery and story. It's a decent story but nothing special, the ensemble cast and characters helps out the slow paced story which I liked. The soundtrack was well put, probably not for everyone. The sound design was perfect and felt authentic. I liked the use of practical effects, always better in these kinds of movies and it helped the action sequences a lot as they were slow paced and not like an ordinary action movie, felt realistic thanks to how the characters move and act. J.C. Chandor did a great job at directing the movie for what it is, a crime movie. He didn't capture the action as good as the crime part but he created an entertaining movie with some suspenseful moments with decent characters.The ensemble cast is one of the two things that caught my eye with the five members of the team being played by Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Oscar Isaac, Pedro Pascal, Adria Arjona and Garrett Hedlund.

This film starts with some promise of being a watchable but disposable action flick, but slowly just degenerates into mindless macho tripe. Cliched nonsense is the best way to describe it. You know you're in trouble when arguably Ben Affleck is the least wooden actor in the film. This movie heads steadily down from a middling beginning to a lame and predictable end. I very much regret wasting more than two hours of my time with this junk, and would encourage others to steer clear, so you don't wind up kicking yourself too. There are so many better choices out there and only so many hours in a day. So, yeah, I wish this movie had never been made, and I wish I'd never watched it.

The action has it's tense moments. It's shot in a very nice setting. But the plot is very simple with few twist and turns which is something I come to expect from TV and movies starring these fine cast of actors. It's like we have Borne Identity/American sniper quality actors in a script that seemed meant for a Sylvester Stallone film. So I felt the film didn't maximize the acting talent. I was expecting a little bit more from the screenplay. This felt like a more grown up version of the 1980s A-Team. But it is what it is and I'll give it a 7 out of 10I suppose a two hour film cannot compare with the detailed plots of a tv series like Narcos. There is a lot of dialog padding in the first 35 minutes of the film. I think they could have worked on that better.Oscar Isaac was brilliant nevertheless.

64,kjproulx,A Very Solid Heist Flick,8,14 March 2019,"Netflix seems to be the way to go when a big studio doesn't bid on your film for theatrical release, but it is always interesting when watching a film on Netflix that clearly deserved to be seen by a larger audience on the big screen. While the core premise of Triple Frontier isn't all that unique or original, a good film is a good film, regardless of the tired story it's telling. Personally, a good heist story always impresses me, so I was looking forward to this one in general. I'm pleased to say that this is a very, very solid film and here's why it deserves more attention.Following a group of five retired Special Forces soldiers, Triple Frontier explores how their lives have become boring and that they are all still wishing for the hole that the action in their lives has left them. When confronted with the opportunity to travel to South America to steal millions of dollars from a drug lord, there's hardly any hesitation, as they feel the money could greatly benefit their families and their livelihood in general. Without giving too much away, not much of this story plays out in their favour, which makes for a gripping experience from start to finish.As aforementioned, I really do believe the formula of this film has been done countless times in the past, but Triple Frontier embraces that and delivers on some very fleshed out characters and a way of telling the overall story that had me on the edge of my seat. From the always great Oscar Isaac as the leading man to the very likeable performance that Ben Affleck always seems to give, to the downright career-altering turns in both Charlie Hunnam and Garrett Hedlund, everyone is giving their all here, and not the least of which is Pedro Pascal, who always seems to receive the short end of the stick when it comes to Hollywood films. His talent far exceeds the limited dialogue he's given here.Where this film truly shines is in the way it plays out. There are surprises throughout every act and there is one moment in the film that should've been expected, but ended up having my jaw on the floor, due to the fact that I honestly didn't think Triple Frontier was going to be the gutsy film it becomes throughout the third act. Whether being disgusted by the actions of the lead characters or simply just enjoying their banter on the surface of it all, I had a very enjoyable time watching this one.In the end, Triple Frontier begins as a generic film that re-forms the bond that their friendships once had, but ultimately evolves into a visceral survival flick that takes a couple turns that I wasn't expecting. Although familiar in terms of storytelling, I highly recommend this movie to fans of a good heist flick or those who enjoy any of these actors, because they're all bringing it here. Triple Frontier was a very, very good movie in my eyes and should've been given a theatrical release. It's now streaming on Netflix.",Triple Frontier
65,kuarinofu,Very forgettable,5,30 April 2019,"The setup was good, but the movie never really got even to the second act. It felt like it just paused right after all the introductions.
Again, this is nothing new, Netflix movies are often like this. Good cast, beautifully shot, empty in essence or plot. Run time is also an important factor in these, most of them are around 2 hours for no real reason but some sort of internal requirements of the production.
What sucks is that they had the talent to play good characters, they just weren't written into the movie. So even by the end you don't know any of the guys (besides greed being their only motivation) and they often contradict themselves in their actions.
The ending is understandable but it sort of defeats the purpose of the whole movie. I mean, the moral of the story is on the nose anyway.
Although I enjoyed how grounded the movie was, I don't think I will remember this movie in a week or so.",Triple Frontier

67,SoumikBanerjee25,"Thought one thing, Got something else!",2,27 June 2020,"'Ambitious with good intent but in the end failed to represent its case'. That's how I could sum up my overall thoughts on this!A Stellar ensembled cast with an interesting premise let down by poor Writing and Execution. In the end it goes nowhere. I kinda understand what they were trying to do with the plot; but there's a huge gap between thinking and actually doing the same when its needed. Screenplay and Editing made it even worse. There were times I felt like yawning as This was not exciting enough. I'm not complaining about it being a statemate or a slow burn, I love those movies as well if the content is good enough. But in this case I got nothing, Except some sparkling chemistry between the cast members and few and far between action pieces I seriously got nothing else. Even those action sequences seemed sluggish and choppy at times. They had potential, but Lazy thought process or should I state; an Incapable ameturish hand behind the camera couldn't simply deliver justice to them.
Meanwhile the Sound Design was disappointing too! Sound is an integral in every film, and can seriously alter one's whole perception. Here I felt it to be unfitting and underwhelming!In a nutshell, it's one of the worst that comes from Netlfix. If you are clinging to your hopes for an Action Packed heist/adventure movie! Well this might be an unexpected turnout! Beware.",Triple Frontier
68,maccas-56367,Could have been so much better,6,6 April 2019,"This tried to be deeper and more serious than it could manage. Instead, Triple Frontier comes across like a by-the-numbers action flick, where it was almost impossible to root for the main characters. They were just too arrogant and too greedy.You know a film has failed to make you invested in the characters' plight when you laugh at a death - yet, there I was. This is not soldiers fighting for their country, or really fighting for anything noble or courageous. Technically, it's ex-soldiers turned criminals, robbing from other criminals. Their greed gets them in all sorts of trouble, which is both frustrating and mundane to watch.There are some good actors here, capable of carrying an action film in their own right - they just seem poorly utilised. I didn't know the director name J.C Chandor prior to this - but looking it up after, it seems I now dislike 4/4 of his films.Some gorgeous scenery and intense action scenes keep things interesting, and the film did manage to hold my interest - but ultimately, it was all a bit underwhelming and not as good as I had hoped.",Triple Frontier

70,MrDHWong,A suspenseful story about five friends wanting to pull off one last mission together,7,21 March 2019,"Triple Frontier is an action thriller film directed by J. C. Chandor (Margin Call, All Is Lost, A Most Violent Year). Starring Oscar Isaac and Ben Affleck, it is a suspenseful story about five friends wanting to pull off one last mission together.In the jungles of Colombia, military adviser Santiago ""Pope"" Garcia (Oscar Isaac) works hard to extract information about an infamous drug lord named Lorea, who has eluded him for several years. Upon finally discovering Lorea's whereabouts, Pope decides to round up his former army friends Redfly (Ben Affleck), Ironhead (Charlie Hunham), Ben (Garrett Hedlund), and Catfish (Pedro Pascal) to assist him in storming the compound, taking Lorea out, and stealing all of the cash for themselves.Despite initially setting up as a heist film, Triple Frontier quickly changes into an escape film not long after the first act. However, considering how straight forward the actual heist is, this is perfectly fine as most of the film's drama comes from the group attempting to flee the scene. Both Oscar Isaac and Ben Affleck do a great job in their roles, even though they're unfortunately the only members of the main cast with proper development and arcs. The rest of the group just feel like they're there for the sake of moving the plot along and it never feels like they grow as characters by the end of the film. In spite of its shortcomings, this film is still an enjoyable watch for fans of either heists or your run-of-the-mill action thriller.I rate it 7/10",Triple Frontier
71,Alexander_Blanchett,Fine film but nothing new,7,23 March 2019,"It was a decent Netflix thriller and after all those years in development hell I was really curious to see it.
Its far from a classic and I feel it was. bit overlong but other than that it was a fine thriller with quite a good cast. Ben Affleck was generally decent and did not bother at all. The best performance came by far from Oscar Isaacs but I also did like performances of Charlie Hunnam and especially Pedro Pascal. Garrett Hedlund was the weakest link but I think the weak character development is to blame for that.
Like many other Netflix movies this really has a fantastic and memorable cinematography. Really great images and I think this as well as the editing were the two best aspects. Besides the Soundtrack which offered a variation of famous songs through many different genres.

The characters somehow manage to be likable assholes, the story sucks you in, and it is the most beautifully shot action movie in some time. That said, I wanted it to be more. Despite coming from a couple filmmakers who have excelled at showing and not telling, every thematic moment seems to involve awkward dialogue.

I'm not a writer and I never will be; but I once bought a book on character writing. I'll always remember the author saying 'make it believable'. When the audience start saying 'that wouldn't happen or I don't believe that' then you don't have a solid character. It's a shame as this could have been good but hey ho!

JC Chandor is just flexing his muscles, shooting a tight and absolutely seamlessly beautiful and engaging picture. The photography is sumptuous and crisp and all the major players bar Hunnam's dodgy accent are all superb; Oscar as usual, but unusually Affleck was one of my favourite parts.
The Three Kings-come-Usual Suspects with a dash of Sorcerer is lifted unequivocally from Boal's by the numbers script by Chandor's decisions to deliver subtlety and little clues, a few looks, some delicious shots; enjoying playing within someone else's sandpit.
One jarring thing is the music, switching jarringly between diegetic and non-diegetic, it was noticeable even to my girlfriend. With lots of headphones in the film, I wondered if it was a director's choice that failed to translate.
The action is gripping and realistic and because it seems to be inspired in that regard by tactical shooter video games, the small screen via Netflix seems like the perfect fit for this flick.

Despite a sturdy premise, ""Triple Frontier"" is curiously inert, shallow and un-involving. Despite a strong cast (Affleck, Isaac, Hunnam, Pascal and Hedlund) it feels like the characters are flimsy and inconsistent. The most tension filled scene is the robbery itself, which surprisingly happens early on into the run time. The length of the film is also a bit challenging at times and seems to drag on. As a result, it is a film that is competently made so you are not really seeing a bad film 'per se', but then it is also an uninspired film, so you won't see anything that goes above mediocre for most of its run time. It felt like there was a lot of potential here, but somewhere along the way it got lost and we ended up with its shadow instead.Rating: 6+",Triple Frontier

This is one piece of entertainment that just gets better as the minutes role by.
Many Netflix originals have a sense that they just couldn't cut it as a cinematic release so instead get palmed off on to this premium streaming channel.
Hey! It beats going straight to DVD!
Triple Frontier on the other hand is a well crafted movie with a stellar cast.
A film that would have probably benefited from a release in theatres.
The story tells of a group of Ex special forces operatives who plan to steal money from a reclusive drug dealer.
After a long career serving their country with nothing to show for it (except for a few bullet holes).
The band of brothers decide to go out and get some for themselves for a change.
As an unexpected turn of events cause their best laid plans to spiral out of control, the film tells a story of greed, loyalty and a test of morals.
Triple Frontier is an exciting heist movie. Elevated by its accomplished cast.
All involved put in a good performance but surprisingly it is Oscar Isaac that leads the film.
Ben Affleck takes a passenger ride here even though he has top billing.
Support from Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund and Pedro Pascal form the basis for this character driven picture.
Sure this is a action movie at heart but it thrives due to the development of its characters.
I don't think if the cast and scriptwriters hadn't have done such a good job we the audience would not care and be invested in their exploits.Directed by J.C Chandor, Triple Frontier is a good looking movie.
Cinematography is wonderful with some magnificent shots of the ever changing landscapes.
Presented on Netflix in 4K this film has a stunning image quality.
The use of HDR allow colours to leap from the screen.
A particular scene in a container compound is very vibrant. Each individual container having strong contrasting colours.
Jungle scenes are abundant with bright greens. Contrast levels are stunning with inky blacks.
Dark scenes never looking muddy.
This is as near to 4K Blu-ray quality that I've found from a 4K stream.Netflix have also provided a excellent sound mix.
Dolby Atmos is available for those with a able set up.
Sound is equally as impressive as the visuals.
Considering this is a stream the sound doesn't really feel compressed.
Ok I will admit that gun shots and explosions don't get as low and deep as a mix found on a UHD disc but still aural impact is excellent here.
Atmos gives good atmospheric effects.
Height channels are constantly in use.
Rain can be heard from above and the movies sound track will find itself reaching you ceiling mounted speakers.Triple Frontier was a welcome change.
Often Netflix original movies feel like an after thought.
Here we have a very well made movie.
Production values are strong.
From visual effects to credible actors. This film feels like a Hollywood blockbuster.
It's a movie must see if you have a Netflix subscription.",Triple Frontier
87,joelwatchesmovies,Well-made mix of heist thrills and survival adventure but the drama could've been written better,7,25 August 2019,"The music is strong, the editing is sharp, and the cinematography is sleek (lots of gorgeous wide shots of natural scenery). Isaac stands out among a solid cast and the plot is consistently engaging in its twisty mix of heist thrills and survival adventure. It's the drama that doesn't quite hit home: the characters are inconsistent, the moments of tension aren't followed up on, and the thematic reflections on the morality of violence are uncomfortably weak (and ultimately undermined in the end).",Triple Frontier
88,Lebowskidoo,An Action-Adventure Heist Movie With Twists,9,17 March 2019,"A cool heist-caper movie that reminded me a little of The Dirty Dozen or Sorcerer. The cast is an assembly of leading men from other movies coming together, sort of like the Super Friends...I guess I got that from Affleck being Batman?Naturally, things do not go as planned, do they ever though, in these kinds of movies?

90,Magow-Intermean,Triple Frontier Review,8,21 March 2019,"A vigorous attempt at a contemporary take on a The Treasure of the Sierra Madre-like yarn comes up a bit short in Triple Frontier. J.C. Chandor's fourth feature, after the estimable trio of Margin Call, All Is Lost and A Most Violent Year, shoves you viscerally into the world of some U.S. special forces veterans who, with little to show for their lives other than buff bods, try to pull off a hugely profitable heist of a South American drug lord's ill-gotten gains. Unsurprisingly, things do not go entirely as planned. Despite the heavy dose of action and numerous tense situations, this Netflix offering has trouble staying in high gear once it gets there and the characterizations remain one- dimensional - the men all speak exactly the same way. Not much better off, although perhaps slightly less bothered by it, are military instructor ""Ironhead"" (Charlie Hunnam) - most of these guys have nicknames - and cage fighter Ben (Garrett Hedlund). And then there's ""Pope"" Garcia (Oscar Isaac) and ""Catfish"" (Pedro Pascal), two smart vets who have more than done their bit and now see a way to cash in big. And, yes, this is a ridiculously good-looking bunch of guys, all in fine shape and with excellent hair, which mostly stays neatly cut and groomed throughout the entire adventure. Their contact and enabler, Yovanna (Adria Arjona), is a head-turner as well. Right off the bat, in an impressively staged opening sequence set in a hilly South American town, you can feel Chandor's ambition to take you somewhere you've probably never been before (Colombia, Oahu and Mammoth served as the actual shooting sites). Sure, there's some of this in Narcos and other south-of-the-border drug shows, but the elaborate set pieces in towns and, later, the jungle, above the timberline in the Andes and then in a spectacular coastal setting provide massively scenic milieux across which to spread the rugged action. The brains behind the plan is Pope, first seen in an exciting opening commando raid in a hilly favela with a lot of steep steps. Pope is tipped off by Yovanna regarding the whereabouts of a drug lord's huge stash of cash and, despite his buddies' solemn military vow not to profit from their pains, Pope doesn't have too much trouble convincing them that this is their one shot at turning their lives around; if he, the most righteous and upstanding of them all, is game for this, they're in. The operation is tense, the payoff beyond their wildest dreams. Hidden behind the walls of a lavish home in a dense jungle, the cash proves to be a gift that just keeps on giving - tens of millions of dollars of it, far more than they can pack up and make off with in their narrow window of time. Woody Allen used the title for his first feature 50 years ago, but Take the Money and Run would have suited this film as well, as that is exactly what the gang of thieves does here. At this point, where can this go but south? You know these guys aren't going to be able to just take their loot to some tropical island and live out a fantasy of booze and babes for the rest of their lives, nor will they be settling down and investing wisely. No, there's clearly nothing but trouble in store, a big price to pay for a big haul, and of course that's the story of the second act of Chandor's original but not entirely fresh drama. The landscapes the men must cross to make good on their escape are more than formidable. Pope has arranged for a huge Russian helicopter to take them over the Andes, but all the extra bags are too much for them to make it over the 11,000-foot pass, which occasions desperate measures and a truly eye-popping action sequence. There are mountains to be traversed, treacherous villagers to be dealt with and many miles to go before they sleep, if, indeed, that day will ever come. Reverberations from Erich von Stroheim's classic Greed increasingly pulse through this rugged yarn of king-sized dreams and miserable suffering, which is studded with agonizing moments at which the men must make instantaneous decisions between trying to hold on to some of their loot or escaping the peril of their immediate situations. For all of the story's great drama and periodic intensity, however, the yarn never really clicks into top gear and stays there. More individual characterization at the outset would have helped. Affleck's Redfly is alone among the men to be favored with a bit of backstory, and even then it's not much. Isaac's Pope is clearly the smartest one of the outfit and we meet him first, so he, above all, should have been profiled with rather more depth. Chandor has proved his skill at character writing and dialogue in his previous film; here, he clearly sought to establish some action bona fides, but another screenplay pass with attention to more character detailing would have been welcome. All the same, there are numerous startling moments that hit like punches to the stomach; these men, whose military careers have no doubt been marked by life-or-death decisions that had to be made in an instant, are put to the test time and again, the results of their decisions inevitably agonizing no matter what. This story creates a trail of such moments, along with increasing incriminations, finger-pointing and all other manifestations of fallings-out. As a writer, Chandor is quite drawn to investigating the relationship of (mostly) men to their money and the great tension its allure and handling create. Margin Call focused on an intense 24-hour period at an investment firm during a crisis, while A Most Dangerous Year centered on a family business during an especially bad economic moment. In Triple Frontier, the issue is ill-gotten gains and how to lose them.",Triple Frontier
91,dansview,Point Break in the Mountains,7,13 March 2019,"Kathryn Bigelow was involved with this one as producer I believe. It reminded me of Point Break which she directed. A group of adrenaline junkies bonding over a robbery A lead alpha dog, a little philosophy, some hair metal, one girl, crucial timing issues that can mess up a plan,, fire, a cop, etc.
I liked this one. Although they did make an attempt to establish a little background information on the guys, there wasn't enough. There was plenty of time during the first half to do so, but if could have been used a bit more wisely.The scenery is spectacular and the action steady in the second half. There is a little moralizing and I could have done without the Bob Dylan song. I am always on guard for some Leftist propaganda when Ben Affleck is in something, but it wasn't too bad. Some thoughts on killing and greed, but basically we were rooting for these guys. All they really planned to do was get one bad guy and some money.
Watch with some buddies and a couple beers.",Triple Frontier
92,Mike_Devine,"Could be better, could be much worse",5,9 June 2019,"What happens when we round up a bunch of recognizable actors of varying degrees of success and notoriety and drop them into the South American jungle to do a stealth heist job? Well, you get Netflix's 'Triple Frontier,' for one.The main draw in 'Frontier' is not the story, or the intriguing setting; it's the main cast. From Ben Affleck to Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam to Garrett Hedlund and Pedro Pascal, there's a lot of testosterone going around here. As you'd expect of any film that brings together retired special forces ops, there's also a ton of action, guns and bloodshed. If that's what you're looking for, this is probably a movie for you.But 'Frontier' also explores themes such as the human psyche, brotherhood and doing whatever it takes when one is pushed to the limit. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a prolific social commentary or anything, but it also isn't a film that would find itself in the same category as 'Rambo' or anything. Sure, it's clunky, poorly paced and pretty generic. The acting doesn't rise to the level of these actors' resumes (Isaac is probably the standout), but for a Netflix film, it's not bad.Don't expect to be blown away, but 'Triple Frontier' is semi-entertaining all things considered.",Triple Frontier
93,thomasjay-2201,Bland,3,15 March 2019,Good luck watching this and having any enjoyment from it. A good three quarters of the film is in absolute darkness so there's not much to get from the visual elements at all and to be completely honest a lot of the characters barring maybe Hunam (surprisingly) are mostly dislikeable so on the whole it's not much worth watching. In fairness the odd action sequence is fantastically choreographed/shot and executed almost perfectly but again it's not enough to save what slightly resembles a 'story'. Save it for a rainy day that'll eventually come but I wouldn't exactly say it's a must watch,Triple Frontier

They ended up doing the operation of attempting to steal the $75 million a lot sooner into the movie than I was expecting so I feel like the rest of the movie after that was pretty much unneeded. The rest of the movie had to be the way it was and had to be there because of the whole plot of the movie happened too soon. It may have been more enjoyable if their plan was more complex and took more time so they'd attempt it at least halfway into the movie.

97,thebricks,Solid movie with great cast but unbalanced,8,14 March 2019,"Great cast full of all-stars. Only problem is, it's the kind of movie that's a hard sell in theaters these days. Just look at the reviews from regular people, you'll see complaints about how it dragged or just people totally biased against it from the beginning because it's an action movie on Netflix. I watched it until the end, you'd be amazed how many movies that win awards can't even hold my attention for that long. Some people disliked the film after a certain point because it got depressing, but they're sheltered and don't live in the real world where bad things happen to people and you have to figure out how to make everything better.That said, I would think these guys would have had a bulletproof plan for accomplishing the mission without completely screwing everything up. These guys were skilled operators. They would have made sure they were out within a set amount of time and with a foolproof plan to get away. Why go through mountains? That makes no sense.It's a movie that's a silly morality tale but it could have been written so much better than this. Still, for what it was, it was enjoyable.I would probably bet the film was meant to be a take on the Treasure of El Dorado, but for obvious reasons, the studio nixed it, maybe thinking it would hurt the box office, if it was ever planned to be released in theaters.",Triple Frontier

But than you have the whole We'll fly over the Andes with a way overloaded chopper,part.
From than on out it's just goes down hill.I've seen some people complained on too little background on the players. That part really didn't bother me all that much. I didn't really need to know every little thing about their life up until now..But i nearly lughed when one of them is telling recruits not to go into the private sector,rather stay and fight for the government/USA and how proud he had been going into battle, with the American flag on his shoulder
That line really cracked me up. Cause everyone know the private sector pays way better for the risk you are taking,than Uncle Sam.There are a few plot holes though.
Like the bad guy having all his money plastered into the wall of his house. Which really don't make any sense.Cause if you receive that much money, your walls would have to be rebuild every time.And the room would become smaller,as the walls get thicker.Another oen that puzzled me,and gave away that it was gonna go bad from the get go,was the line about making it look like, it was done by another gang/cartel.
Since when did cartels or drug running gangs,take the time to subdue the guards,instead of just shooting them. *Doesn't make sense.But the movie is great up until we come up on the whole escape part. Which seemed was suppose to be the highlight of the story,but really was just dragging it down.

A group of ""Ex-commandoes"" now doing their own thing, come into a plot to take down a drug leader and liquidate him of all his money. Storyline context is about GREED, nothing more, nothing less.There is no real backstory of the main characters other than they all served together. We truly know nothing about them or what makes each individual who they are or what they represent. We know one was the captain (Affleck) and two of these guys are brothers (Hunnam and Hedlund), one was a pilot and one was in the unit.
The writing could have been much more authentic sounding instead of generic. I did like the cinematography and landscapes they shot in as that was picturesque in the film. The action sequences were rather dull and almost non believable. I felt the film dragged but had it's moments of clarity. I mainly watched because of Charlie Hunnam and Affleck.
In the end this film is about GREED, unity of brotherhood, doing the right thing and a bond. Ths is a nice afternoon filler on a rainy day.",Triple Frontier
104,Lewis_Heather787,"Its good, however it could have been so much more!",7,14 March 2019,"There were two things in this films favour before seeing it, one it has a fantastic cast and two it had an interesting trailer to go along with it. So with that in mind expectations for this film were at a reasonable level, basically all I wanted was a decent thriller, good acting, good action and some twists and turns. Essentially I think that the film does all those things, however it could have been so much better in its execution.Firstly the film is directed and shot beautifully, even though to the films advantage its shot in some pretty amazing locations it seems to really capture the feeling of the various locations. In some ways it makes you as the audience feel that you are there yourself , some really nice actions scenes through small towns and some fantastic jungle and mountain scenes that are breath-taking. J.C. Chandor has done a really good job in this area of the film, no complaints.The stellar cast is lucky really good in the film across the board, now and then even a film with a great cast cant be saved from being bad but this is not the case for this film. Oscar Issac is the main focal point of the film and is the main driving force behind the story the group of men go on. I have to say that he is really good in the role, even though you could say there is not much to it, he shows very well that he carries some metaphorical weight around with him whether that be in his past or in the mission they are on. The others Ben Affleck, Pedro Pascal, Garrett Hedlund and Charlie Hunman are all really good, which is a nice surprise because when do you hear of Charlie Hunman actually being good in a film without a funny accent.........to harsh??????The story for the most part is interesting and definitely has a lot of twist and turns in it some I didn't see coming, especially when Affleck gets killed. That was a powerful scene and something that I didn't think the film would do, kill off one of/if not the biggest star of the film is ballsy and I applaud it. Although saying that I would say the best parts of the story are before the event of Affleck being killed after that is where the film for me starts to drift. Other than that its a pretty well constructed story overall.Now the negatives or the things I think that could have been done better. Now there is no improvement from a directing or acting standpoint all of them are fine, however its main the story and some of the character decisions that I have questions about. Now before they carry out the mission that team do a lot of planning even to the smallest detail. SO how on earth did they not foresee that they might have an issue transporting the money out?????? Like is it me or would they have planned something better than an old Russian helicopter??? Another negative I have is once Affleck is dead the team decided to throw majority of the money down a canyon and just take his body back instead with a little money. Are you kidding me??????? No-one would do that, you've gone this far why all of a sudden change???? I dunno to me it just seemed to heroic or trying to be emotional, making the characters look like they never needed the money. There was never really a conversation between the characters about it they just did it quickly. The last gripe I have is the last 20 minutes of the film for me just drift away and there is no really suspense or tension that was there is the rest of the film. It was as if the screenwriters sort run out of ideas or enthusiasm, for me there was no big climax/ending to story.Overall the film was good 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, it was everything I though it was going to be but I was left wanting more, much more. All the ingredients were there; Good directing, Great acting and for the most part interesting story but a couple of decisions here and there stop this film for being anymore than just good for me. Which is disappointing. However I would recommend it, its one of the better films that Netflix has released as of yet.",Triple Frontier

110,RhapsodyReviews,"Great Execution, Great Action.",8,18 November 2019,"Review:
'Triple Frontier' is an action-adventure film directed by J. C. Chandor.
This movie tells a compelling heist story with lots of tension, but little character development. I know little to nothing about telling a realistic 'war' based movie, but I do see lots of reviews that are complaining how unrealistic and non-heartfelt this movie is. The way I personally see it, this is a action/adventure movie.
The film stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund, and Pedro Pascal as a group of former U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers who reunite to plan a heist job of a South American crime lord.
Talking about the cast. This movie has an amazing cast, who play each of their very different characters brilliantly. However, what brings this movie down is a lack of character development or growth throughout the film. Main characters are introduced and given a general back story, and then do not have any dramatic arc or depth to their journey throughout the rest of the film. To me, there wasn't one character or actor that stood out over the rest, the chemistry they had on screen was perfect and they all worked together. I will say, that I have never seen Ben Affleck like this before. That's not necessarily a good or bad thing, it's just nice when actors take on roles that aren't in their portfolio.
What this movie lacks in creative writing or compelling characters it makes up for with a brutal tension that carries it through it's 2-hour runtime. The movie kind of just grits its teeth and pushes past anything other than service-level emotions and reactions. Some of the action scene weren't as tightly put together as others and were a bit sloppy.
Overall, this movie has a great cast and well put together story. It was fast paced when it needed to be and slower when deeper story telling needed to be told.

They all had some depth and many had very interesting character arcs. There were a few plot holes and some parts were a bit predictable but it didn't ruin it for me. There were a few moral and meaningful discussions happening also between the characters and some bigger subjects touched upon briefly, mainly dealing with guilt and living with bad acts you may have done.

I would rate this a 10 but nobody takes your rating seriously if you do so I'll put 9 because I've rated over a 100 movies and I don't want this review to be taken lightly. There's actually a user review that said they didn't expect much from this movie, Well that same review didn't make much sense and had a bunch of misspelled typos so of course I didn't expect to learn much from that reviewer, I myself on the other hand did expect alot from this movie that I've been waiting to see for 3 months and it was well worth it. A tale of Validation, Redemption, Greed and Survival. The allstar cast needs no introduction. The character portrayals were on point showing the actors true age revealing faults while showcasing wisdom. The gorgeous Adria Arjona does outstanding with a limited role co-starring as she always does. The storyline is simple yet captivating filled with action sequences of adventure while strategically projecting psychological emotion through reality making it feel as though the film is based on a true story. The pace is perfect from the opening scene until the closing credits the writers and director Chandor & Boal literally do not waste a second of entertainment and this film will be considered a classic and most definitely lands in the all time top 3 Netflix films. Truth be told I'm a Netflix fan but there's always something that falls a little short with their original films, Many of them are good but noticeably flawed. ""TRIPLE FRONTIER"" however doesn't suffer that same fate and by most viewers will be regarded as a masterpiece.

The director doesn't stretch the strings too far and plays it in a very straightforward manner.The plot is not very original and reminiscent of older films from this genre. However, this fact works for the film. The story is lucid and offers good continuity.All the action sequences are impressive with a minimalist touch. The cinematography is good capturing diverse landscapes competing with adventure oriented films.The characters fit the narrative and needless complexity is avoided. The acting is decent given the moderate threshold imposed by the director.I loved the soundtrack for it offers a good dose of classic rock and heavy metal energising the scenes.With a highly conventional plot and good star cast the movie has scored well.",Triple Frontier

Did I miss something along the way that explains why this title was chosen? What are the three frontiers?Question: When did Oberon learn to fly helicopters? Just kidding. I was pretty damned excited to see him in the cast. I do love to watch him act, as he is truly a great talent as an actor. Perfection.Legitimate question: How is it that these five guys were prancing up and down in the Andes and all were miraculously acclimated to the thin-air mountain elevations? I found that one of the most unbelievable parts of this film, by far.More questions: I did the research, and if the bills were all (US) $100 bills , then each bundle of one million dollars only weighs 22 lbs. I know: kind of astounding, right? So how come we never saw the equivalent of 250 22-lb bags/suitcases of money? Ponder that (if you watch this movie, that is). Maybe the duffle bags were 44-lb bags? . . . Maybe? (The suitcases were definitely carry-on, 10kg size.)Last question: Why weren't the guys periodically sending one of their own back along the track to see if anyone from the village had followed them? I thought that defiant-standing-in-the-middle-of-the-path young guy from the coca-farming village made it pretty darn clear he was out for blood.I perused the other reviews and it's obvious a lot a lot of people didn't enjoy the movie as much as I. Just watching Oscar Isaac and Oberon made me happy. Sure, the movie has some massive plot holes, but it has some pretty exciting moments and it does look like nearly everyone reviewing hung on until the very end.

The story is good, the characters lively, but the lack of escalated conflict drops the potential of this one down to the mundane.The tale, half military covert ops, half heist flick, fits into writer/director JC Chandor's ongoing cinematic themes of dealing with the environment of a bad decision. Robert Redford did it in his old man and the sea film All Is Lost. Oscar Isaac tried to take on mobbed-up oil companies in A Most Violent Year. Looking for more, he's back with Chandor, but this time as a tired CIA agent. He wants the bad guys unequivocally stopped. He wants success for the grunts on his team who are clearly not successful back home in the real world. And he has a plan. But plans in heist flicks never go right. What's the point? There is excitement in that turmoil. There is entertainment in that edge. Triple Frontier maintains a steady pace that certainly makes for good visuals, but never raises the blood pressure. The turmoil never boils over; the edge is a wide avenue.An entertaining, steady offering from Netflix, Triple Frontier provides a real-life glimpse into real-life problems.

142,chet19,Screenwriting 101 errors,5,16 March 2019,"This two-hour movie is more like 4 separate half-hour episodes of a tv show. Movies that are like separate episodes instead of one steady plot throughout are a no-no, and this Triple Frontier (what does that title mean, anyway?) is like that. Episode one is Poe Dameron as a US soldier helping a foreign police force. This first 20 minutes had nothing to do with rest of script. Episode 2 was Poe trying to convince Ben Affleck to come out of retirement for one more heist. Such originality...a special ops guy being offered the proverbial one more mission. Never any drama, because we all knew Ben would say yes, so we wasted 15 minutes of him saying no before coming around. Seriously, did the director think the audience was surprised when Ben finally said yes?
Episode 3 was the heist itself, which some school kids coulda pulled off. The house is pretty much empty, except for 2 terribly trained guards against 5 elite US army rangers. Guess who wins.
No tension at all during the heist. We needed some truck coming up the driveway or some secret guards closing in on them, but nothing. 15 full minutes of men stuffing gym bags with cash. Meanwhile, these most elite and disciplined soldiers suddenly lose all discipline. They lose track of time, get greedy, and sloppy. out of character.
Episode 4. Next, the very safe and disciplined helo pilot knows the cargo is too heavy, but takes off anyway. Huh?
900 zillion acres of mountain and jungle, but the cargo ""just happens"" to land in a cocaine village.
Finale: the final obstacle to get home is an army of mercenaries at the port. Now the soldiers have a conscience and don't want to kill the drug lord's army. They might be young, so we can't fight them.

145,margulanabutrlov,Triple Frontier Review,10,21 March 2019,"Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund and Pedro Pascal star in J.C. Chandor's heist movie.
A vigorous attempt at a contemporary take on a The Treasure of the Sierra Madre-like yarn comes up a bit short in Triple Frontier. J.C. Chandor's fourth feature, after the estimable trio of Margin Call, All Is Lost and A Most Violent Year, shoves you viscerally into the world of some U.S. special forces veterans who, with little to show for their lives other than buff bods, try to pull off a hugely profitable heist of a South American drug lord's ill-gotten gains. Unsurprisingly, things do not go entirely as planned. Despite the heavy dose of action and numerous tense situations, this Netflix offering has trouble staying in high gear once it gets there and the characterizations remain one- dimensional - the men all speak exactly the same way.
Not much better off, although perhaps slightly less bothered by it, are military instructor ""Ironhead"" (Charlie Hunnam) - most of these guys have nicknames - and cage fighter Ben (Garrett Hedlund). And then there's ""Pope"" Garcia (Oscar Isaac) and ""Catfish"" (Pedro Pascal), two smart vets who have more than done their bit and now see a way to cash in big. And, yes, this is a ridiculously good-looking bunch of guys, all in fine shape and with excellent hair, which mostly stays neatly cut and groomed throughout the entire adventure. Their contact and enabler, Yovanna (Adria Arjona), is a head-turner as well.
Right off the bat, in an impressively staged opening sequence set in a hilly South American town, you can feel Chandor's ambition to take you somewhere you've probably never been before (Colombia, Oahu and Mammoth served as the actual shooting sites). Sure, there's some of this in Narcos and other south-of-the-border drug shows, but the elaborate set pieces in towns and, later, the jungle, above the timberline in the Andes and then in a spectacular coastal setting provide massively scenic milieux across which to spread the rugged action.
The brains behind the plan is Pope, first seen in an exciting opening commando raid in a hilly favela with a lot of steep steps. Pope is tipped off by Yovanna regarding the whereabouts of a drug lord's huge stash of cash and, despite his buddies' solemn military vow not to profit from their pains, Pope doesn't have too much trouble convincing them that this is their one shot at turning their lives around; if he, the most righteous and upstanding of them all, is game for this, they're in.
The operation is tense, the payoff beyond their wildest dreams. Hidden behind the walls of a lavish home in a dense jungle, the cash proves to be a gift that just keeps on giving - tens of millions of dollars of it, far more than they can pack up and make off with in their narrow window of time. Woody Allen used the title for his first feature 50 years ago, but Take the Money and Run would have suited this film as well, as that is exactly what the gang of thieves does here.
At this point, where can this go but south? You know these guys aren't going to be able to just take their loot to some tropical island and live out a fantasy of booze and babes for the rest of their lives, nor will they be settling down and investing wisely. No, there's clearly nothing but trouble in store, a big price to pay for a big haul, and of course that's the story of the second act of Chandor's original but not entirely fresh drama.
The landscapes the men must cross to make good on their escape are more than formidable. Pope has arranged for a huge Russian helicopter to take them over the Andes, but all the extra bags are too much for them to make it over the 11,000-foot pass, which occasions desperate measures and a truly eye-popping action sequence. There are mountains to be traversed, treacherous villagers to be dealt with and many miles to go before they sleep, if, indeed, that day will ever come. Reverberations from Erich von Stroheim's classic Greed increasingly pulse through this rugged yarn of king-sized dreams and miserable suffering, which is studded with agonizing moments at which the men must make instantaneous decisions between trying to hold on to some of their loot or escaping the peril of their immediate situations.
For all of the story's great drama and periodic intensity, however, the yarn never really clicks into top gear and stays there. More individual characterization at the outset would have helped. Affleck's Redfly is alone among the men to be favored with a bit of backstory, and even then it's not much. Isaac's Pope is clearly the smartest one of the outfit and we meet him first, so he, above all, should have been profiled with rather more depth. Chandor has proved his skill at character writing and dialogue in his previous film; here, he clearly sought to establish some action bona fides, but another screenplay pass with attention to more character detailing would have been welcome.
All the same, there are numerous startling moments that hit like punches to the stomach; these men, whose military careers have no doubt been marked by life-or-death decisions that had to be made in an instant, are put to the test time and again, the results of their decisions inevitably agonizing no matter what. This story creates a trail of such moments, along with increasing incriminations, finger-pointing and all other manifestations of fallings-out.
As a writer, Chandor is quite drawn to investigating the relationship of (mostly) men to their money and the great tension its allure and handling create. Margin Call focused on an intense 24-hour period at an investment firm during a crisis, while A Most Dangerous Year centered on a family business during an especially bad economic moment. In Triple Frontier, the issue is ill-gotten gains and how to lose them.",Triple Frontier

This film starts off with background to the characters and they were all together in the military but have gone there seperate ways until an opportunity arises to break in to a drug lords house and steal 75 million in Columbia.
So off they go and the plan is smooth until they find that there's a lot more than 75 million behind the walls. Ben Afflecks character gets greedy and this is where the film falls apart.
The helicopter can't carry all the weight of the money.. um ok so they have around $250 million were expecting 75 so why take the chance, let it go and cross the Andes head home and live happily ever after without crashing into another Cocaine plant and have to hike for days with all that cash strapped to the donkeys.
I felt the ending was rushed, and it was left with the possibility of a sequel.
I think that the cartel they robbed should have come after them rather than teenagers from the cocaine plant their helicopter crashed into.

Ben Affleck, he can be very much like Marmite, but I have generally liked him as a actor over the years and he can do action, Charlie Hunnam, even though King Arthur was a bit pants, he still is a good action star, Oscar Issac, It is Poe Dameron for Pete's sake! Pedro Pascal, the Viper and Garrett Hedlund, well I actually did not know him from much, but he looks the part. It was a risk at over two hours long but hey I am on half term and Shell is at work.So, Poe Dameron gathers ex-army types he used to work with to run a heist in a war zone/drug cartel-controlled area. These includes brothers King Arthur and Sir Kay, sorry Humman and Hedland (which is a great name for a Swedish pop group), ex-leader and family man with issues at home - Affleck and Howling Mad Murdock, sorry Pedro of the squishy head.

Helicopter crashes, mountain ranges, cocaine fields, local cocaine growers, drug cartels, big bags of money, the mule who thought they could fly and general greed and friends arguing ensue.There's not nearly as much action as this cast deserve and it is very slow in places, but it is actually a fairly interesting story and very well acted.

The rest of the cast is Oscar Isaac, who is terrible and some other actors I've never heard off.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD, meant to warn people not to watch this crap.The plot is that these former soldiers decides to rob a drug lord in Brazil of alll his millions of dollars so they can all retire early. They get away with the robbery way to easy. The security at the drug lords house is a joke. They kill a few guys, but the drug lord is nowhere to be found. And none of his men come after them. Afterwards their plan is to fly to the ocean in a helicopter with the 250 million dollars they've stolen, hanging from the helicopter.And this is where it gets really stupid.Take a look at a map of Brazil and you will see the ocean is on the right. These guys fly to the left, through Peru and through the Ande's. A much longer and completely unnecessary trip through an entirely other country, even though Brazil has its own coastline. Their load of money is of course too heavy so they have to dump a lot of it from the helicopter. And eventually they crash the helicopter into a valley anyway. They meet some people from a nearby village and kill some of them, because they see them as a threat. And pay the rest off to let them pass through and buy some mules. Eventually theyre under attack, not from the druglords men but from the villagers, that wants revenge. Ben Afflecks character is killed and these american dumb-asses carry his body with them even though it slows them down.Later on they have to dump almost all of the rest of the money. I cant remember why. They get away by boat.And after having been through all of that, these morons give the remaining 5 million dollars to some foundation. Which means they got nothing to show for all their trouble, including their dead friend. One of them however have the longitude and latitude of the ravine where they dumped most of the money. And christ: a sequel could be in the works.Avoid this at all cost!!",Triple Frontier

Stupid dialogs aimed at 14 yo'sThe movie manages to keep you watching until you are past the point of no return.

It can keep the viewer attentive for the duration. Movies with actor Ben Affleck are usually well done and with good scripts. This is one of them.

158,RobTortureWright,What A Great Comedy!!!,4,14 March 2019,"The first 30 minutes of this film are fairly dull but we do get to see a car exploding while police shoot up some random bad guys. Next we're introduced to our main character who casually strolls up and fires one of those pesky noob tube grenade launchers into the bad guys building instantly wiping out all intelligent forms of life inside. The cops then shoot the non intelligent survivors for fun and our 'hero' pretends to lose an arrested woman who turns out to be his informant, who he sleeps with, again for fun. Next we see bens character be a terrible Realtor and a terrible father so that's a thing. Next the crew gets thrown together and instantly puts a plan in action and decide to go through with it after looking over a wall and thinking 'We can totally take those guys and steal all their money'. With all that expert planning done they now show up on game day and begin talking over the radio like complete professionals and totally not like a bunch of guys messing around at a bar. They bust in and cant find mr baddie but they quickly figure out through a mindbendingly genius way that theres money in the walls so steal all of that because its cool to do so. The plan goes sideways and they shoot all the awfully trained guards and then find mr baddie hiding, shoot him for the sake of it and torch the place so it looks better. They take the money and place it on a helicopter which they got from some random guy charlie hunnam knows. Pilot of the year now calculates the weight of the cash perfectly and they attempt to fly over the andes mountains. Next we see some of the best CGI I've seen since the deer in The Walking dead or the final scene in Sons of anarchy as the helicopter flies over some mountains. Amazingly mr pilot was off on his weight calculations by a few grams so they need to throw some bags of cash out to make it. Drama alert as they are still overweight like 2 sumos in an elevator so have to ditch the main net of cash which of course falls into a field of cocaine. The helicopter crashes but everyone is absolutely fine and they all jump out and begin shouting at the locals. Ben affleck throws in the towel at this point and poorly reads his lines then shoots a bunch of civilian cocaine farmers because one of them pulls a 2 inch blade out to trim his nails. Charlie hunnam was shot earlier but now strolls about like he's Conor McGregor. Ben affleck pretends he's upset for killing the boys father but is now happy he has a shiny new pen knife. Charlie then strokes a donkey that is carrying roughly 1 million pounds of weight on its back and then they all head off to find carrots because the donkey is hungry. After being unable to locate a carrot they give up and decide to kick their feet up and put on their lovely little raincoats and talk about how they're all big tough guys with so many problems. Now we're really getting into some great filmage as they all edge up a moutain like it's a tomb raider game but because the donkey is so tired from lack of food it slips and falls off the mountain. RIP donkey. You will be missed. The non important humans make it up and ben nearly starts crying because he remembered he's still batman but thankfully he manages to pull himself together. All of the ""band of brothers"" are feeling chilly billy now but quickly begin laughing because they're all celebrities with lots of money so set fire to some of it and laugh some more at poor people. Ben dies.... In the film and then the guy who gets shot in four brothers begins throwing hands at charlie hunnam but mr green street holds his own. They throw the money bags off a cliff, store some in private areas and huff a dummy supposed to be ben down a mountain and onto a boat. They Make it out with pocket change which they give to bens family in some sort of moral pack which no sane human would do. The main character looks at a piece of paper with co-ordinates to the money they threw off the cliff, then walks away. The end. But is it really ? I think we all know what happened next right ? Clearly the donkey survived the fall, finds the bags of cash and hires human slaves to build a mansion made entirely out of carrots. What a terrific film I have witnessed. Truly great comedy, a must watch.",Triple Frontier
159,toddg-473-289818,Great cinematography but weak story and ending,5,26 November 2020,"I'm new to watching Netflix-made movies, but the pattern that seems to be forming is that Netflix has large budgets to film movies all over the world and hire well known actors. TRIPLE FRONTIER casts Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, and Charlie Hunnam as former soldiers who attempt to kill a Colombian drug lord and steal his money. What could possibly go wrong?Filmed in both Colombia and Hawaii, TRIPLE FRONTIER has great action scenes, as the soldiers attempt to make their way through the jungle, with many people on their trail. They began to question and doubt one another, but not enough to keep the story interesting. Their slow journey to seek their freedom is captured by grandiose scenes of nature, and introspective conversations. A more interesting script could have added value to how the pacing of the movie was slowed down.Without spoiling the ending, the movie concludes in a way that seems way too sentimental. The screenwriters really failed here.",Triple Frontier

163,Mike_O_Dwyer,Sad Affleck Lacks A Killer Instinct,5,21 March 2019,"There's not a lot to say about a movie that follows the most rudimentary basics of action-movie plotting, so rather than review Triple Frontier I thought it would be useful to list the 10 steps below. Feel free to tick these off as they apply to any action movie you've recently watched.Step 1:
Persuade a bunch of all stars to come together for a big pay off. If they're old or retiring soon, it will be for one last time. If they're young, it'll be a chance to rebel against the man. If they're middle aged it'll be because of some financial hardship that wasn't their fault. If they're any age and generally feckless, some form of addiction will be involved.Step 2:
Carry out surveillance of the target to be sure the proposed task is too difficult to succeed without step 3Step 3:
Have a disposable secondary character provide the solution without which the heist can't be undertaken. Make a plan that's over-complicated and reliant on the other side being complacent, and/or incapable of hitting a barn door with a rocket launcher.Step 4:
Make sure the task is carried out according to the plan and show, via lickity split editing and a cool soundtrack, that every step is carried out perfectly so that everyone looks professional. Have someone do something dumb/selfish/stupid so that the plan immediately falls apart.Step 5:
Have the heroes narrowly escape, preferably leaving a trail of one-shot kills in their wake while the other side butcher walls and dismember innocent vehicles in a hail of bullets because all the dirty money in the world (or, as it's otherwise known: money) can't afford to pay for classes in basic marksmanship.Step 6:
Optional car chase. The dull bit where no one involved (especially on screen cops, military types, or career criminals) has ever watched an episode of Cops to figure out how to run a car off the road. Obvs: everyone that matters narrowly escapes, although perhaps with some minor wounding to a character that they must then manfully struggle on for the next 10 minutes before forgetting to be injured.Step 7:
The escape: Pt 1
With 30 minutes still left in the movie, something else has to go wrong and an easy escape is postponed. Something/someone dies or beaks down. Shocker!Step 8:
The drama bit
Or, as most people prefer to call it: the saggy bit. A whole lot of yakkity yak and navel gazing longeurs, overacted coulda-woulda-shoulda sad faced banter interspersed with gloomy mid-distance stares that strive for the kind of humanity any wise old veterinarian would have easily mastered after years of telling 5 year olds that Tickles, their ancient toothless three-legged raggedy-eared mongrel dog, has testicular cancer.Also, if someone mentions their family it's highly likely they will die soon, especially if they're young and gullible, or, more likely in any action flick, if they're looking to redeem themselves for being a complete plum all their life.Step 9:
The escape: Pt 2
Lots of whizz bang bish bash boshery and generally reckless behaviour.Step 10:
Whoever is left walks away into the sunset or dies in a blaze of glory.",Triple Frontier

So for being a Netflix movie this was really good. If you compare this to movies like American Sniper or other big budget movies it's not very good but let's compare apples to apples. Yes it had some holes. I agree with many of you, as professionals they would have had someone cover them while they looted the walls and why did the put the windows down?

167,ivans536,Typical Action Flick,6,11 April 2019,"J.C. Chandor is known for delivering some slick and stylish, if ultimately empty, movies, and he doesn't diverge here. The movie has an interesting enough story to tell, even if it has been done better a couple of times before.The movie is tense and interesting enough in the first third, although for a buddy heist movie, it certainly wastes an opportunity to deal with the characters' characterisation in a dun and engaging way that we are so used to in the genre. Instead the characters are one-note stereotypes, and would be very difficult to distinguish from each other if not for the star cast.It loses steam about half way through, when the actual heist is done, and the subsequent shenanigans after the helicopter ride just aren't as gripping as the first half. The movie just services us until the rather unsatisfying and stupid ending. The characters act rather irrationaly and there is an abundance of plot holes, which is not surprising considering we don't really know enough about the characters. The dialogue is not bad per se, but it's rather unsatisfying as you are, for instance, left seeing Isaac's character apologising for something that's obviously Affleck's fault, leaving you to think that maybe if we knew these characters better we would care and invest more.All things considered, it's fun and passable enough and you won't be sorry you wasted time watching it, but netflix should have used the advertising budget to promote something better, like Roma or Love, Death+Robots.Liked: the action sequences

I'm a huge fan of Pedro Pascal, Ben Affleck and especially Oscar Isaac and was aware it was a sort of heist action film. That was enough for me. But I got a lot more than that. I found the characters to be interesting and respected their moral code, even when they broke it. The movie had moments that reminded me of Joe Carnahan's vastly underrated The Grey, and also had the touch of producer Katheryn Bigelow in there as well.All in all I got more than I was expecting from Triple Frontier. I had a satisfying cinematic experience. Just at home instead of the cinema. This also goes to show that Netflix is like any other avenue for watching films.

Instead of the heist being in the 3rd act, it actually takes place earlier in the movie and the rest of the movie are the characters dealing with what comes after.On top of the fresh story, this movie also has a great ensemble cast that has good chemistry with each other, and it has good cinematography and locations.

I usually like when a fundamentally human issue is added to complicate issues in a story. I find that it helps me relate to films easier and makes them more compelling. However, the morality that is brought up during the film is anything but consistent.

It features actors playing tough, ex-army rangers spouting lines that do not feel true to their characters. Most of the time, their dialogue is utterly devoid of subtext. Each character says PRECISELY what is on his mind, whereas in real life - where deep-seated emotion is concerned - we generally IMPLY our feelings indirectly.Not here, folks. These dudes talk like they're appearing on The Dr. Phil Show. So the flick is full of exchanges like:""I love you, man.""""Love you too, man.""And -""Do you ever think about it? All the people you've killed? Whether or not they deserved it?""And -""Hey, listen. About what I said back there. Sorry bro, I was- I was out of line.""""No, I was.""""No, me.""""No, ME.""Blah blah blah.They sound more like dudes in a friggin' ""encounter session"" opening up about their struggles with ""toxic masculinity"" than they do actual, living people.Is the writing on display in this film a byproduct of our new ""therapy culture""?

In that time of being rejected, it should have been revamped and made better before Netflix got its hands on it. As it is, the fact that it was made, brings us forward to me sitting here scratching my head, asking myself the Title question of WHY I DIDN'T LIKE IT.First of all, it has Oscar Isaac in it, and he's all kinds of hunky manly yummy in that not-so-good-looking-kind-of-way. It also stars Pedro Pascal, who can do no wrong in my eyes, except for maybe speaking too much while in the fighting ring with The Mountain (right now, however, I will not digress into tears); Charlie Hunnam, who I like; and Ben Affleck who I, most of the time, begrudgingly like. It has a very pretty actress who represents Latinas well - always good in my book; a decent story line; good acting, overall ... SO WHAT WAS MISSING?I have no idea, but it failed to connect.From the very first (opening) act, where the stereotypical bad cop does his thing and the girl does her thing which you can see coming a mile away, and the twist that is not really a twist comes into play between the main character and the girl ... it kind of just loses you, so by the time THEY get to the forest, you're on your way home.

This flick isnt too bad, just below par. Why ? The main characters are described as detail soldiers with 500% accurate planning and executing that plan. ok
1.) they have one big container fully of armory but they dont have silencers ? Silencers were perfectly suited for THAT kind of operation.
2.) they all are described as good mathematicians, they know how much money they are after YET then cannot figure what type of helicopter they need to safely picking hundreds of money + get across of Andes Mountains ?
RIDICULOUS. Third act is simply vanishing into facepalming and overall feeling about this action movie is that there´s no action at all and all operators missing key details..
dont recommend.",Triple Frontier

Its not fantastic, but it sure beats a heck of allot of other films out there.Good acting, special effects, cinematography and story line make this film work.The reason for only scoring this film 6 out of 10 is because it lacked follow through.

202,ComradWinston,Confused and Generic,4,16 March 2019,"Periodically moments of coherence and clear motivations present themselves, although those are largely smothered by the greater uninspired cartoonish mess that is most of this movie. At the start there's a decent attempt at character building which strongly hints that a story of substance might await along the rest of the two hours. But then its worst elements began to show. What first stuck-out was the disjointed use of rock songs periodically to transition from scene to scene. And done in a way as cheap and shallow as you might expect from a Call of Duty commercial.As the show goes on, I could only wonder why everyone got along so well. If more effort was put into character development, since Ben Affleck actually seemed pretty good for his role, it might've been a good movie. They could have easily cut away at the second half, done less stupid things, or at least better explain why they do stupid stuff but in the end it feels lazy. The end more or less summarizes how painfully predictable this turd soup with a seasoning of possibility is. And yet they had the nerve to hint at a sequel.",Triple Frontier

The close of the film is also satisfying as we are brought to a major victory for one of the leads.I do reccomend watching this film if you enjoy action films that are competently made.

The accompanying music is really excellent. Interesting plot development, although there are quite a few daft turns; illogical moments and inconsistencies which let it down - this the main weakness. Why don't they use military consultants on films like this? Nothing which ruins the film though; if you can suspend disbelief. Overall, excellent.",Triple Frontier

208,BestBenedikt,Chandor pulls it off again,8,14 March 2019,"Although J. C. Chandor is a skilled director, the average quality of Netflix Original movies tends to be quite low, which is why I try to hold back my excitement even for the more promising Netflix projects by now. Surprisingly enough, TRIPLE FRONTIER turned out to be an extremely well made and gripping film.Aside from the great cinematography, the best thing about this movie is probably its cast. Every character is given enough background and personality to understand each one's motivation for the heist in the first part of the film. Especially Ben Affleck's performance stuck out and gave the whole plot a morally ambiguous undertone that fitted the economic theme always lingering in the background of Chandor's films.My only issue with the film was the writing in the last act, which got completely devoid of said ambiguity and resolved the plot by a formulaic ending that made the story feel like a morality tale in true Hollywood manner. All in all, Chandor nonetheless delivered a thrilling experience and the best Netflix film of 2019 so far.",Triple Frontier

Ben also pushes the time envelope cause of his senseless greed. Otherwise it would be a smooth movie rest of the way. Why not store it somewhere if you cant load it up, then come back months later, oh common sense is lost again. Get a plane to handle the weight too.

213,popcolin,pointless.,3,16 March 2019,"I swear the best thing about Netflix movies is that they make me want to do chores around the house. You know, start the movie, wait until a ""yeah, right!"" moment, then get up and scrub the walls for 5 minutes before returning to the movie. It's great, I get to watch a movie and get stuff around the house done.
That being said I'm sure it's very hard to make a movie and so we should just be impressed anything got done. It's interesting though because the actors are there, (well known and not) the soundtrack is killer, the stunts and special effects are decent, the locations awesome, the cinematography is excellent, but man the story ruined it for me.
Not gonna spoil anything but when we have movies featuring ""Americans"" from the north going down and killing ""Americans"" from the south with little to no regard for what kind of message this actually portrays...Netflix we have a problem.
It's not actually a movie about what it sounds like, it's a movie very cleverly disguised as some sort of USA powertrip where money is worthless (cause duh this country is the land of plenty so it's not hard for big cash to fall right into our laps: you know what I'm talking about) and we can put anyone outside of the main characters of the movie in the category of ""unsophisticated animals"", (there in fact being a scene where a horse dies and one of the characters gets mad exclaiming ""why are you laughing that's a living breathing animal."" Oh great what about all the PEOPLE that die?!)
Not an offense on its own but when a movie takes itself so seriously I wish the writer/director/producers came up with a better way to showcase everyone else's talents, not just used it to desensitize the viewers even more than we already are.
Ridiculous, take it for what it is. Netflix has a run on us FOR SURE.",Triple Frontier

Chandor, in order not to ever again waste a second of my life watching a film made by him. Before watching, I read almost a hundred reviews all stating that there was a good plot badly administered and that the film went down the tube in the second half. ALL THIS IS TRUE.
This crap tries to sell us (and probably there will be some ""naifs"" out there who buy) the idea that trained mercenaries for whom murdering is everyday profession, go sentimental and they don't care for the money in the end.

The story and plot feels very used as it is not an original idea but the writers take on it keeping the story moving I felt was great. The cast did great and showed real emotion as I did see some BTS were the cast were trained to use the firearms as real mercenaries.

If you want a fun action flick for a slow Sunday afternoon, this is your movie. It has solid performances from the central cast and a strong enough premise to carry a familiar heist story. Think of this as a darker, grittier version of ""Ocean's 11"" where our heroes kill and can be killed with hardly a moment's notice. The best way to describe ""Triple Frontier"" is capable: it has an interesting but not very engaging plot, and likable but ultimately shallow characters. There are moments of compelling drama and convincing emotion that elevate the story and maintain your interest when the movie's narrative threatens to falter. I watched ""Triple Frontier"" late on a Saturday night to close out my day, and though I wasn't seriously invested in the story I was satisfied by a well-made and fun action movie. 7/10.",Triple Frontier

The cast is phenomenal, four of these five leads are well and truly top shelf actors which even further frustrates when it falls so so short. The story is 'borrowed' liberally from bits and pieces of others I shall not name and the grey area between our heros and villians makes the emotional investment minimal, however they're all seemingly capable of flip flopping thier morality when it suits the writers 'pen'.

He might as well call his next film ""I'm desperately insecure about my masculinity"". And all the characters in this film are vile, unsympathetic people, motivated by greed, violence, and self-pity to do stupid and predictably disastrous things. That said, there could have been a good movie here if they hadn't tried to play them as heroes - if they had done it as a black comedy, a la Fargo, where a bunch of bad people try to pull a heist and get they fate they deserve. But they didn't. Of course. Cause it's a dick flick.

All they had to do was to break the load down into two and nothing would have happened. They had a military grade helicopter at their disposal after all.The first half of the movie was actually quite good and the trailer uses almost exclusively material from that half. The characters were introduced and we understand why they would be willing to undertake such a high risk heist. It is the second half where viewers are completely let down. Just about everything after the five men enter the helicopter is beyond stupid. Like trying to cross the Andes with thousands of pounds of cash strapped to the backs of mules kind of stupid. It did not occur to them to seek motorized transportation and an alternative route? You also have inexplicable character changes like people turning on one another when they had been all buddy buddy the night before. Not to mention that these were seasoned combat veterans who had been part of an elite fighting force and who would know never to turn on one another like that.It is quite a waste.

That's a basic detail seen to by military people. Diligently. Since they had aircraft. True professionals never would say, ""well, we're overweight but let's try it anyways."" Because that's a death sentence. If you're overweight, you don't fly. Period. So their pilot was the best? Yeah, right.There's a ton of unrealistic things in this film.

This film is a perfect example of Hollywood scriptwriters walking their actors through a plot that fails to reflect, in any way, what would actually happen in real life. There are many instances that made me want to throw a brick at the TV, but here's just one:
Unable to carry all the money bags out, they decide to throw away all the cash by dumping it into a deep hole in the ground from which it can't be recovered. Anyone with any brains would simply have stashed it, walked out with enough cash on them to hire a helicopter no questions asked, and flown back to pick it up. Of course that didn't suit the screenwriters, so they instead make us assume that these guys are all terminally stupid. Is Ben Affleck really so dumb as not to question a dumb script?",Triple Frontier

260,danren121,Triple frontier,7,19 March 2019,"It's almost impossible not to find a kind of dreary charm
in the rainy horizon, half drunk tins of beer and the
colourless sky that hangs over the films early scenes.
It's kind of redolent of the steel producing Pennsylvania town
portrayed in the Deer Hunter.So Oscar assembles a team to procure a lucrative sum
of money from a drug lord for his gang. It's daylight robbery.They're going to rob the drug family while they're out at Church.
It's in Mexico.The greed factor during the robbery gets a bit silly, like a Saturday
Night live sketch. Hardened professional militants
suddenly start petulantly insisting on loading more money
with the clock ticking.Fortunately for the good guys the Mexican bad guys
are about as stealthy and combat effective as a group of
pissed intergalactic stormtroopers.It looks expensive but there are moments where it seems the
tension in the scene isn't developed properly. Maybe it's
a lack of close ups but things unfold without any editorial zip.Leading donkeys saddled with huge amounts of
cash along a fragile mountain ridge is surely a very bad idea
but that doesn't deter this lot. The group's tenuous bonds
begin to fracture as pressure to leave the local area
incognito with the loot mount.There is a dwarfs-go-looking-for-gold-in-the mountains only
to be thwarted by their own greed vibe going on. Maybe like
a prequel to show how dwarfs descended from men. And It's good to
see the group posses some moral scruples
when one character announces he's not prepared to
""wipe out every teenager in the town just to get
through with that cargo,"" that would be going a bit far.The tag line for the movie should maybe read (in that gruff voiceover that is no longer used to advertise new releases); they got the cast,
then agreed upon a topic, they just didn't work out a plot and
ended up making it up as they went along, sort of
going through the (epic movie genre) motions. But then
if they did that no one would watch it.",Triple Frontier

In setting up an assassination plot against a violent and oppressive criminal, things start to look especially interesting when it is revealed that our heroes' motivations are essentially based on greed.Yet the promise of an interrogation of the human soul is never truly paid off as the film broadly shirks the moral investigation with which it flirts. This is not to say there aren't numerous situations in which our heroes ostensibly become anti-heroes. However, as much as their behaviour is morally dubious, the filmmakers have taken pains to make the central characters empathetic.There is some great action and genuine suspense during the second Act amid the heist proper. There are even some would-be iconic scenes which are the result of some genuine craft from all concerned.Yet with a great cast and a promising setup, the film is ultimately less than the sum of its parts.

I am a bit worried about the script: the finicky of the group is the one that in the end makes the hit fail (real professionals would have kept to the plan) and it would have been enough to load the helicopter with its maximum capacity (better to be a little less rich that dead).

It takes no time to get into things, keeps you watching throughout and keeps the audience eager to figure out what will happen. All 5 special forces actors excelled with Oscar Isaac and Charlie Hunnam as the standouts for me.
The reason I didn't give it a full 10/10 are the little details throughout that seem inconsistent with how I'd imagine things would actually take place in that scenario. I also found parts a little frustrating as the characters made bad choices and errors that seemed obvious would cost them in the long run.

All they had to do was leave on time with what they planned to leave with and that chopper would have made it over the Andes, no problem at all. Sadly I can't recommend this.

286,towe-51620,Solid movie! You have to look at from only one certain view and it all makes sense.,9,8 September 2021,"First off if you aren't over 40 you won't understand this. Also the same people who say this sucks are also the ones around my age who have no problem with Rambo, Commando, Predator, any military flick since the late 70s. If you are my age, 53, and you grew up a superstar at everything you touched, playing sports, playing guitar, basically life was almost too easy. Ok now I've had a total knee replacement, I realize I can't go out and party every weekend anymore. I've lost my brother, sister, cousin and quite a few very close friends already and it hit me hard. I thought I could handle anything, boy was I wrong. It's taken me 10 years to get back to normal. So in this movie these guys are the best of the best for the best 20 years of their lives they were invincible! Life catches up. They are now in their early to mid forties, forced to retire. They miss being badasses but more than that none of them planned on anything after the military except for Santiago who has grown disillusioned with the CIA. He formulates a plan on a dime from info from a hot CI he is banging and this chick is in love. So the reason they aren't prepared is all on Santiago. If he had taken even 6 months of planning with his team they could have gotten all the money which looked like well over a few billion! But Santiago makes the wrong choice, asks the guys when he knows they're at their weakest and deep inside they know they shouldn't but greed is a mighty seductress! He tells them the night before it's all his plan, they act pissed for all of 5 seconds but know this is their one and only shot to be set for life and they aren't passing it up! Ben makes a good plan but it's still on a whim and only a few things go wrong. First mistake should have taken the time to plan it all out. 2nd mistake trying to get over the Andes in one try. They could have unloaded on one side left 2 guards, made 2 or 3 safe trips over and even though the other army was waiting for them could have and would have had to kill all those on the Peru side. They all don't want to kill anymore, but they did when they had to. Ben was actually right when he said they should have killed the girl snd her brother. They should have killed all the people in the cocaine village. Another mistake was not eliminating every possible threat or witness. Their weakness actually cost them cash and got Ben killed. Had they done it like a straight up military op they could've ended up with almost a billion each but because they had consciouses, were sick of killing they should have ran one last op by the books. That's basically the angle it makes sense. Their arguing, Ben's greed, Santiago's untruthfulness, basically Paschals character had it right yet no one listened and just argued and acted foolish to their detriment. They did the right thing in the end by giving the $ to Ben's family but I would love to see the sequel where Santiago finds the girl in Australia, calls them all back plus one other good buddy/soldier to take the coordinates and go back and get the rest of the money with a helicopter, large boat and a little more thought and discretion. Maybe they will, I love the concept, the movie and the way it was shot. I truly would love to see them redeem themselves and get the money! Hope I helped.",Triple Frontier

The fact that Netflix hired several famous actors for the movie would make one think they would give them a really good screenplay to work with, but sadly that is not the case.The plot is pretty cliche ridden. Typical Special Forced operator reluctantly gets involved in one last mission plot. The worst thing about the movie is that these seasoned professional soldiers make some real amateur mistakes.
-When reconning the house they're gonna rob they all wear civilian clothes instead of camouflage.
-They have the radio discipline of 12 year olds. They exchange banter over the radio with no thought given to if any of the bad guys might have a radio scanner.
-They have a shipping container full of weapons but no one brings a silencer on the mission.
-They ignore their own timetable and get greedy when clearly they have more money than they can carry.
-They overload a helicopter which crashes due to being too heavy. Why didn't they land somewhere and stash some of the money?
-One soldier takes a bullet through the abdomen, we see him check it once or twice, but he proceed to cross the Andes mountain with no problems.
-The whole time these guys are hiking the mountains we never see or hear of any food or water. What did they eat and drink for those days?There's more but thats what I remember off the top of my head.

Alice Walker.
Well not just Alice, Radix malorum est cupiditas a Biblical quotation in Latin too states that ""greed is the root of evil"" (or, in sentence order, the root of evil is greed). It can lead to any number of different kinds of evils, not that all evil is rooted in the love of money, but that's the most obvious case. That's exactly the theme of this movie 'triple frontier'.
Five former Special Forces workers reunite to plan a swoop in a meagerly populated multi-border zone of South America. For the first time in their prestigious vocations these unsung heroes undertake this dangerous task for self instead of country. But when events take an unforeseen turn and threaten to spiral out of control, their skills, their loyalties and their morals are pushed to a breaking point in an epic battle for endurance.Character building was kind of okay but could've been deeper in my opinion. They were all introduced in a hurry to get into the climax; however that part could've been spaced out.

For a fun and relaxing movie session it serves its purpose, but that is all.The plot is quite original, but the execution destroyed all the potential twists because hints are constantly dropped about what is coming next. In addition, there are many illogical parts, such as how the villagers reacted to their unexpected visit and the part where they took the money from the protagonists - they would know that it basically amounts to committing suicide. The characters are not developed well enough to support the emotional part of the movie either.The actions scenes are entertaining but not convincing - the protagonists do not behave like well-trained and well-seasoned special force members, completely losing guard when threat is still present, perimeter not secured for an extended period of time, lacking of discipline, situation awareness and initiative, the list goes on. There are also the renowned Hollywood-made nuclear-tipped 40mm grenade, and shoulder-fired air-fuel rocket that flips 3-tonne SUVs. Some of the money bags appear to be made from very strong, almost futuristic material that can withstand quite a lot of abuse.I can tell that Netflix has pondered the possibility of making a sequel or even trilogy out of this.

But even these criticisms aren't completely warranted when you are able to put yourself in the characters' shoes. I'm not a soldier, so maybe that is the reason why things such as no cover, quick triggers, questionable strategies, and greed don't bother me as much. But considering the circumstances and emotions that the men have been subjected to, it isn't unreasonable to believe that their judgment could be clouded (especially in order to provide for their loved ones).The narrative clearly isn't perfect and I do wish more effort had been spent on that, but this doesn't mean it's anywhere near awful. The pacing of the film is adequate and the action is as good as any film of this nature, making it worth the view and sufficiently rewatchable.Overall, Triple Frontier stays true to what it was likely created to be and is an entertaining thriller with surprises at every turn.",Triple Frontier

Unfortunately, its not as good as the trailer makes it look, however it isn't a terrible movie. All actors played their roles well - but I felt there was no real character development, could have had more action, maybe developed the antagonist better. You only really see him twice. The first 2 thirds of the film, i was genuinely liking it; the sort of heist premise, stealing a drug lords money then trying to escape with it was fun (albeit nothing new)... but then felt it didn't really go anywhere and the plot kind of dissipated slightly.

There is also some pretty good acting in this movie. but, the beginning of this movie was so random and confusing. it only showed a backstory of two of the characters, and all of the sudden they are in South America starting their mission. I had an idea of what the mission was from the trailer, but when they first arrived I had no idea what was going on. I also thought the initial mission happened a little too soon in the story and wasn't long enough.The mission scene was kind of unrealistic as well, I don't think they would be able to carry out that many huge bags of money themselves and that quick, money is extremely heavy. Plus, when the money was on the helicopter, it looked like way more bags than could even fit in two vans. One realistic aspect they added that I liked was the fact that the helicopter could not make it over the mountain because of how heavy the money was. The helicopter going down and landing in the village was a great scene, and really started the thrilling aspect of the movie.it is amazing how they still are able to recover all of the money and carry it all using mules from the village. Overall, this movie was decent, and entertaining for sure. My main complaint is the confusion aspect in the beginning and the missing plot points.",Triple Frontier

351,fosterino,Really Disappointing,6,15 March 2019,"Words almost cannot capture my disappointment. The amazing premise - a crew of ex-military guys teams up to rob South American cartels - is let down by a totally flat second half. If you want my advice, you can turn it off once they get to the helicopter. That would have left us with a really tight, pretty smart heist movie. If you get to the part where they are trekking across the mountains with donkeys, you've gone too far. They are ultimately undone because everyone acts as stupidly and obviously as possible. This is, of course, a common trope in heist movies, but it's just infuriating to watch in this movie because you believe all these characters actually are smarter than that. But the script demands that they be idiots, so they act like idiots.This seems to be a common problem in Netflix genre movies - all the effort is frontloaded into the first 40 minutes, and the remaining hour or more is just wheel-spinning. These movies need more notes from a studio-type presence; studio notes CAN lead to blander movies, but they can also help the filmmakers interrogate why they have certain scenes in the movie, what is supposed to be happening, what's the hook? This movie just wanders and wanders and arrives a totally unsatisfying conclusion.Separate from the details of the plot I just thought this was a boringly made movie. It's full of embarrassingly-obvious soundtrack cues. It appears to have a re-shot ending (is it just me, or is Pedro Pascal 40 lbs heavier in the final scene?). It doesn't actually have much action in it; some of it is very well done, some of it would be average in an 80s dad-action movie. The premise could lend itself to pulpier material, but I got the sense that Chandor thinks this movie above that. But it sucks as a drama, too. So it's neither here nor there.",Triple Frontier
352,confrank,Not a bad Narcos companion piece,6,13 March 2019,"J.C. Chandor dazzled me before with his nuanced crime drama A Most Violent Year. His next trick: pulling off an Expendables movie featuring five bonafide actors that either have played, or should have a crack at playing, Batman.This version of course has two clear advantages; these actors don't belong in a retirement home, and the direction has a tangible IQ. It's disappointing that these guys are mostly relegated to stock military profiles, but the effort put into the action and technical work pays off.

If you have a 4K TV capable of Dolby VISION though,this looks truly amazing. Especially some wide landscape shots. The music in the movie was pretty great as well.

Protagonists had 200+ millions in cash with them and they could not hire a second helicopter? Their resources were unlimited, they could buy a fleet of helicopters or hire a small army. Well, they burned money in the campfire instead, because it was so much fun. ""The best of the best warriors"" could not stand the hardships of the mountain trip and went into meltdown, with uncontrolled emotions, and sudden regrets. Also, ""the best warriors"" could not solve the easiest logical problem: instead of one trip over the mountain in the overloaded helicopter they could make 2 trips without crashing. It's not that they didn't have money to buy gas, did they? Also, they were so dumb that they could not instruct the runaway boat to move a few miles down the coast to avoid an ""army of teenagers"" in the city which they didn't want to shoot at (but then shot at anyway). So apparently the only other option available for them was to go 100 miles to the other city. In their universe boats can only be boarded in the cities (that's why they swam to the boat from he beach at the end).

You don't have to be a military genius to see that half of these decisions were poorly made by the writers. Too many plot holes to bother finish watching, which sucks because this was a stellar cast. I even didn't mind Affleck in it and I'm not a fan. Kinda bored of the stereotypical military brotherhood movies at this point as well.

In The Town, Affleck buries the money for the girl.
In this movie, they throw it into a crevice for a Sequel and they give away what little they extracted to the family of Affleck.
However, in The Town, they didn't do silly things like get too Greedy.This movie was just okay. Not great. Not terrible.I just don't believe that ex-Army Rangers and Green Berets would be talking so much and making other idiotic mistakes.The characters were developed some, but not quite enough.
Also, there was a little too much drama between them.
Again, in real life, they would have completed the mission and fought back in the US.Also, loading the Helicopter with 250 million was stupid. They cut it too close and they knew it. They could have flown out with 100 million and been set for life.Obviously, this was a Morality play. Greed. Greed. Greed.",Triple Frontier
375,Enthusiastic_Viewer,C+ for your efforts,5,12 June 2019,"Lots of big names in this one. I like the story line and I feel like they did a decent enough job developing the characters without diving into their whole life story. This wouldn't be a 3 hour movie worth watching. The pace starts out fine. Seems to flow at a nice, steady pace. It's not until the climax of the movie does it start to get slow. There's many plot holes but it's an action movie meant to entertain, not necessarily be realistic. Some of the holes are forgivable, some not so much. These guys are supposed to be seriously trained professionals, ""warriors"", as they put it, but make some decisions that I don't think 10 year COD players would make.
One thing I really enjoyed was the shooting scenes, aren't overly unrealistic. Too many times you see movies where guys are running through showers of gun fire with no cover and come out the other side unscathed. This movie feels realistic to some like myself, who is untrained in the arts of war. Overall, I'd say it's worth a watch. There's good acting and a great music selection.",Triple Frontier

Once we knew who everybody was, and got a glimpse of what made 'em tick, that aspect of storytelling seemed to go out the window. For some reason, everybody seemed to forget who they were just at the wrong time in the movie. I've no problem with character's ""changing hats,"" but only if it moves the story in a sensible direction. This... just didn't, especially with Affleck's character. Conflict between characters, especially in a movie like this-- again-- was never fully explored, but every such conflict-- rather than sustain some tension as a good story should-- was immediately resolved with a ""bro hugs"" and a few deep, a little overlong, ""eye contact slow nods."" Didn't work for me. There were also some moments where a snap decision was necessary and obvious to all involved, but the snap decision always had time for a little debate. The last third of the movie was a frantic slide to a pretty cliche ending as well.

The job is real and the motive behind the coordinator was real and beyond greed. Suddenly, all went downhill, and I am talking about the story, not the plot.The execution of important events went like ""swoop it happened, deal with it"" when the viewer was never invested in how big those events are and they really didn't feel that big. Then the ending came and it left you wondering, what... is... the... point?I liked the little twist at the end, but it does not justify what happened before. After all, it was all going PERFECT but for a simple dummy mistake that felt more made up than a real problem real professionals would ever put themselves into.

The only thing I knew about the characters was I didn't like them and didn't much care what happened to them. I just watched this film and I couldn't tell you the name of a single character.I'd love to give a more detailed review, but honestly the film couldn't hold my attention for the entirety of the film's ridiculous 2 hour run time, and the parts I did pay attention to have already been lost to the sands of time.I'm sure everyone in this film worked hard, but unfortunately it didn't pay off.If I had to praise anything about the film, it would be the effects department.

The very very beginning seemed absolutely dreadful with cheesy American patriotism oozing out of every pore and almost made me turn off, but since the description promised a heist movie I kept going out of intrigue and boy did it get much, much better and more exciting from there.
Yes, there are some holes and certain beats feel a bit hasty or glossed over, but all in all it kept me very engaged, was full of unexpected twists and in the end made a point that I'd never in a million years have thought it would go for.

The main characters are all meant to be ex special forces but run around like army cadets. Pretty much everything they do goes against common sense and elite level operators. From no silencers to nonchalantly walking about shouting a joking with each other.The other issue is I guessed pretty early on that by the end that they wouldn't recover the money and lose it all - And that's what happened. It gets stuck between being an action movie and trying to teach us all lessons in morality.From the trailer I thought it would be more hit and run action with them being chased by a crazed cartel leader wanting his money back. Instead the cartel part gets ended very quickly and the film spends on hour or so of them dragging money back to the border and making stupid decision after stupid decision.Oh and Affleck gets shot by a boy soldier who he allows to sneak up on him and thats the end of him, obviously his training wasn't so great. Then his body gets dragged about with the money in some never leave a man behind statement.I can't really give too many positives why it would be worth watching.

435,imdahoda,Kinda dopey but it tried hard,5,16 March 2019,"I like heist and action movies, and this looked gritty, but ultimately failed on some underbaked plot points like the underbaked heist plan. Oscar Isaac carries the preposterous plot like a bag of overweight money, but its main failing point is when they decide to carry too much of the money over the Andes in a helicopter that they knew couldn't handle it... why not stash half of it somewhere in the endless jungle they're hanging out in? Also they had plenty of other places they flew over where they could have stashed it for a few days.Instead, the ""best"" end up trudging through failure we all know is going to happen, and end up tossing and stashing most of the money anyway except in a much harder to reach location.A lot of the decisions made by the team were just dumb, and it's hard to believe these top-level actors weren't cringing through the doomed dialogue and petty bickering like I was. There still could have been a lot of good drama and conflict without these dopey decisions, but maybe we can all blame the guy who bit the dust anyway... so much potential and so much letdown, I'll forget about this movie soon enough.",Triple Frontier

Combined with a checked-out, low-energy Ben Affleck, who might need another visit to rehab, cast as the guy who's supposed to be a pro and know what he's doing, the viewer can't completely immerse themselves into the movie.

I found myself fast-forwarding through the second half of the movie. I wanted to know how it ended but I didn't really want to watch another hour to find out. It was that bad.

They have a small window, but spent half that time, bitching to each other. They are so concerned about not getting caught, so why then would they go in unmasked and show the faces to every body in the family they did not want to kill? Mind boggling.Who trained these special forces guys? The French?
Do I really need to mention the helicopter and the weight? Deary me.I switched it off at that point, never to return, but I did, I wanted to finish it off, I wanted to see them all die, I cared not one little bit about any of them.Now we have these superman, after they crash unscratched, they slaughter a few villagers, the mules was handy I suppose, but they was soon ditched and a trek over the rugged, freezing Andes, with multiple bags of cash, weapons, no food no water and no proper trecking gear? Yea whatever. Don't forget, one of them was shot and carrying a bullet inside him, such a treck never seem to affect him to the point he was able to get in a scuffle, he would never of survived. And to top it all off, they managed this in five days, money bags, dead body, bullet wounds all dragged over the andes. Mind boggling.I expect this movie to get down to about a 5 rating, after all the made up troll accounts stop giving it a 10. It only get a 3 from me, for simply the cast and scenary.If you are a fan of something like the expendable's, then great go ahead and watch this, you'll enjoy it.

Unfortunately the prosaic casting and direction dilute the striking premise where unconvincing characters and moral ambiguity reign supreme.It's not terrible - it's professionally mounted and enjoyable on its own limited terms but it sure ain't no Billy Friedkin movie and certainly won't stand up to a second viewing.I don't know why Affleck and Hunnam are given work.

462,Diogo_Verde,"With a cast like this, is this the best you can do?",6,16 March 2019,"A couple of weeks ago I saw the promotion for this movie and the first thing I thought was: "" Woow what fantastic set of actors put together ! "" Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Oscar Isaac and Pedro Pascal? All together? I'm in !But then I start reading a bit and I saw that it would be realised on Netflix and I started to doubt the whole thing...This might just be my opinion, but I have been starting to realise lately that usually movies that are realised through Netflix are not particularly good. Of course there's always exceptions to this but lately after watching this movie and previously Velvet Buzzsaw and Polar I can't seem to fall in love with any of them even though I pretty much love all the actors that were involved in all the 3 movies.Without spoiling the plot (then again, what plot ?), the only way I can describe this film (besides saying it's as forgettable as forgettable can be) is by saying that it was a challange for me to watch it 'til the end. The characters are so bland, so on-sided, so cliché that you start to wonder how can you have this all-star actors and not do anything of worth with them? Were they bad? No, of course not...were they been given a bad script ? hell yes ! The story goes nowhere, the dialogue is ridiculous, nothing of interest happens, nothing new, nothing at all....basically is a group of guys going from point A to B in the most boring and un-original way possible...and don't even get me started on the antagonist (If it can even be called that).The director for this movie directed some movies before like Margin Call and A Most Violent Year (Both ok, nothing special in my opinion) so probably he had some of the blame maybe I don't know. However, funny enough, I read a bit about the movie and saw that Paramount pictures, Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Marshalla Ali droped the project (with Affleck and Hunnam later returining). Even Leonardo DiCaprio, Johny Deep and Tom Hanks were at some point involved in the project but later negotiations fell though for whatever reason. Of note, Paramount pictures dropped out because Channing Tatum and Tom Hardy had droped the movie also because of the re-written script they didn't agreed with. I mean, isn't that a whole lot of people dropping out? Maybe they knew this would not be the holy grail of cinema.In my opinion, whoever wrote the story did a very poor job and that they had so much potential in their hands and didn't know what to do with it basically. Since I always try to see some positive aspects in a movie and not be so negative all the time, I can say that the movie is well shot and looks for the most part beatiful (besides one or two scenes where you can clearly see the use of CGI)....and that's pretty much it.For the TL;DR folks: Top-notch actors, very bad written story, skip this one.",Triple Frontier

This will not be to a lot of people's liking.To those of you who can see past that and enjoy the old cops and robbers tales rehashed and rejigged for the millionth time I think a lot of people will enjoy this.So as I was saying the film is about a group of armed forces guys who get intel of a big payday. That payday ends up being even bigger than they could ever imagine, which in turn the story becomes a story about greed, but there's more to it than that. Without giving too much away it then turns into a story of - ""How much is a life worth?"" and there in lies the real story. What price can you put on a life? In this day and age we have become so caught up with how much money that person has, social media, not being allowed to think a certain way, and being politically correct we've forgotten the value of life... What happened to remembering just how lucky we are to be here and being grateful for what we have and living our own lives to the best of our ability...

What lets it down badly is the dated, cloned all American characters that have about as much personality as the cans of cold supermarket beers they like to drink. From the off I am not remotely warmed to any of them so the film fails to connect on any emotional level.

472,Pugnisher,Triple Disappointment,5,13 October 2020,"Triple Frontier had every reason to be an exceptional action flick that would serve as a selling point for its steaming platform, Netflix. Unfortunately, it suffers from unlikeable characters (played by very likeable, capable actors), a tired story and a clunky narrative structure with all-over-the-place pacing.Initial trailers and teasers peaked by interests for this action flick, however, upon getting about thirty-to-forty minutes into the actual film, I found myself checking my watch and hoping for something to happen. When something does happen, it's essentially unsatisfying. When it comes to the slower scenes, they somehow add nothing to the world being created. Characters who are supposed to have some connection with one another seem disinterested, with actors seeming confused from either a lack of direction or confusion in how to interpret the script and actually personify their characters.You can tell there's been effort put in to trying to put together a decent film here, and that's where some of the extra points come in, bringing this one up to an average film at best. There are a handful of competently put together sequences with the very first instance of the film being the post impressive.

This part of the film is done quite well for the most part and does a good job at keeping you intrigued. Sadly, that doesn't last. A particular scene comes to mind where there's noone keeping cover while loot is being put into bags; and it beggars belief that trained, seasoned ex-military would get that careless even in front of a huge tempting mound of cash. During all of this, an armed antagonist doesn't seem to want to do anything about the banging and shouting going on in his house, but then decides to come out of a panic room only when there's at least Affleck, Hunnam and Isaac right outside its door, obviously looking for him.In addition, a momentary lapse in Affleck's othwerwise calm and practical character displaying greed could hint at struggles in his personal life that may have motivated him in that instance, however this trait surfaces repeatedly throughout the rest of the film, and is hardly objected to or acknowledged by the rest of the equally experienced soldiers, save for a few shakes of the head and a couple of disapproving comments. This and just overall messy screenplay for the remainder of this movie leaves you waiting for a redeeming moment that doesn't quite materialize.

Without the skills both vocationally and psychologically to be successful in civilian life and with the motto of always faithful looming in the background, five former service buddies gather to steal from what we are told is an evil drug lord his fortune. The plan which isn't fully revealed until it actually happens is fraught with more holes than a pound of Swiss cheese and it smells a bit like it, too. While other reviewers have pointed out the obvious flaws in the execution of the crime itself, I must add that the escape into the jungle and over the mountains to the ocean is just too unbelievable. They seem to endure the cold of the mountains and once the mules are lost/abandoned this group is able to drag hundreds of pounds of money by themselves up and over the Andes. Once must ask where the climbing equipment suddenly materializes. For me, the best part of this movie was the death of Affleck and with that they managed to carry his body all the way back...REALLY?

But the Netflix producers didn't have the experience and probably not the guts to pull up Chandor and get him to get the damn thing moving.

I would have given more stars had the creator of this film NEVER included the part where the coordinates to the rest of the money they lost in the mountains was given to the last guy, because that scene revives the same lust for money that this film should have been intended to warn us against.

Lots of ""soldiers having crisis of conscience"" type cliches, but I suppose that makes sense, since they end up committing a crime. I guess you could argue that their doubts about their military service drove them down that path, which adds a decent psychological edge to a run of the mill genre piece. It just bugs me that the implication is that everybody who ever kills an enemy in war is supposed to be conflicted and torn up about it.Ben Affleck is terrible, by the way. He should just retire.

505,amlegon,Interesting start. Goofy unrealistic development.,4,2 May 2019,"The film starts well, with maybe a little ridiculous action scene when the only American easily solves a situation the local military clearly can't handle.
Later on, the movie gets seriously flawed with very unrealistic events and cheap morality issues, that make the characters seem like a bunch of idiots rather than honorable war pros.
Geographically speaking, the plot makes no sense at all if you know a bit of South American landscape. Good have easilly been avoided with a little study of the matter, but evidently the film makers don't care much about making it look or feel real at all.
The phisical concept of carrying those bags through the mountains on foot (whith a wounded man, and then also one lees man and an additional corpse), seems offensive to the public. Hiding it and recovering later on seemed too obvious an option, but the possibility is never even mentioned, until the final cheap moral issues arise.
Finally, the movies manages to ruin the ending with the final donation of the money, nonsensical from my point of view.",Triple Frontier

Ben Affleck's star power isn't really fully utilized to the extent I was hoping for.The ending made me feel that this would have worked better as a 3-4 episode miniseries, where this film would have the first two episodes and then maybe one more to wrap up the events what happened after this film ended. 5/10",Triple Frontier

It does have a made for TV feel to it, despite the stellar cast.
Oscar Isaac is good and holds it all together. Ben Affleck by contrast really phones in his performance and looks like he'd rather not be there.
Charlie Hunnam is probably only in it as they needed a blonde character to contrast all the darker haired members of the group.
Pedro Pascal fulfills the Hispanic category, and Garrett Hedland is perhaps the weakest of the main characters as he tries to portray a moody tough guy, but bears absolutely zero threat whatsoever, and to me is totally miscast in the role.

Shortly after he chases a way too pretty prisoner in the cleanest jeans I have ever seen on a man. Not a spec of blood or dirt to be found. And that's how the rest of the movie looks and feels. There's one scene at night right after the first recon job, where the 5 guys are standing around talking about the mission. I've never seen a prettier group of dudes. Beards, hair, eyebrows, all on point. One guy just had a UFC cage fight and looks like he had spent the last 10 weeks at the spa. Even Mark Boal mailed this thing in. In the opening lines of the movie, Charlie Hunnam talks about losing his sanity in a cereal aisle at the grocery store and grabbing some dude by the throat. It harkens back to The Hurt Locker and a much more effective Jeremy Renner looking lost in a cereal aisle at the end of that movie. Without any words you see how not for this world Renners character is, it's a powerful piece of story telling. Boal takes that scene he wrote for the Hurt Locker, adds a choke hold, then has a British Charlie Hunnam recite the scene into a camera. Needless to say the effect is not effective at all, you just don't believe it. And that's what I'll say about this and most Netflix movies, I just don't buy it.",Triple Frontier

The setup and heist are well executed. After this comes a unexpected change of pace which is still good and keeps the tension going. Tension is built by the group constantly stumbling past they're own mistakes. Just when you think ok they're always going to make it, they don't. (This happens just when you think the tension has gone) After the slower pace and characters moments which don't really hold any weight the films picks up again.

Anyone who takes this genre seriously is missing the point and is clearly not the intended audience. This is an exceptional filmmaker just playing in the sandbox to blow off some steam in between his more substantive projects.Chandor also expertly demonstrates just how to photograph a film like this, which many of his Hollywood contemporaries could learn from.

And it ruins the Movie experience.I'm no expert, but I pleasantly enjoyed this film. The cast is fantastic, overstuffed with talent, and lets just acknowledge the obvious: Their all extremely good looking.
This film has great acting, great character-build-up, dynamic, chemistry and background story. It hooks you in from the start, and keeps you intrigued, there's some really enjoyable scenes just between the character interactions themselves. The beginning is especially great.This movie isn't necessarily notable, memorable or phenomenal by any means, but it really is enjoyable. It's nowhere near bad, just not outstandingly remarkable.

For the most part he looked like he was sleep walking, out of shape and distracted with probably way too much say in the production and direction it seems. I loved that scene where they tossed a billion dollars down that giant plot hole in the Andes along with any sensible plot direction. Too much buddy talk and pandering to moralistic ideals I'd say. OK, they all loved Tom but, really, why give Tom's family everything they fought tooth and nail for, to escape there miserable wretched lives, remember. Are we to believe their reasons for doing the job in the first place were completely bogus? This all seems to be a huge virtue signalling exercise injected into the middle of a fairly good idea for a movie... yep, Ben Afflek I'll betcha. It all seemed a tad amateurish from the moment they decided to throw caution to the wind and take extra time to moralize over GREED aaand, that's what the movie was all about, wasn't it.

Second, they killed everyone in Laura's house and left Lauras family nothing but have second thoughts about killing narco plantation owners and their kids.
Third- many drug Lords had stored money in that house but after knowing their money is missing, no one comes and looks for it. No search squad and no trackers were deployed even though they are super rich drug Lords.

The story follows battle hardened and weary soldiers, who take up one last mission, beyond the law, for profit and an end to the boredom and lack of support offered to veterans post combat. The film quickly reduces itself to a series of simple and poor mistake after mistake bordering on stupid. It's really quite unbelievable after having all the support they needed to be reduced to waking the money over the Andes.

577,MortalFrailty,The Best Netflix Original Movie Yet.,8,13 March 2019,"Netfix has a lot of good original TV shows, but very few good original movies.Triple Frontier, however, breaks that mold and gives a powerful flick with a great cast, huge budget, great special effects, and solid writing.Pros: some meaningful and noticeably great cinematography with lots of jungle, mountain and village/favela environments that are reminiscent or similar crime drama/military flicks such as Sicario or City of God (Cidade de Deus). Here, we have a lot of scenery that we've seen before in similar set movies, but we god some interesting angles and shots beyond the usual- nothing stellar, but great nonetheless.The cast is solid with red hot star Oscar Isaac (Drive, Ex Machina, Annihilation, Star Wars sequel trilogy), who continues to deliver intense and memorable performances in whatever he appears in, as the lead in a special ops role close to retirement who is seeing the writing on the wall for his deteriorating physical ability and lack of rewards/long-term pay-off for his years of military service and private sector work. He gathers his former spec ops buddies to lay out a plan (off the book, they come to realize) to make a lot of money, take out a drug lord, and put their unique skill set to use to get some retirement money they feel they've 'earned' over the course of their dangerous, war-torn lives.Ben Affleck (Batman DCU universe, The Acountant, Argo, The Town) co-stars in a role that has a great character arc who has tried to put his military and private security background to rest, yet is coming up short in the 'real world' with a failed marriage, disappointing his daughter, and hating his real estate job that he sees as fruitless. Ben has become comfortable in dark roles as a man who's seen his fair share of killing and violence, and he pulls it off again here. He's reluctant to get on board with this potential secret mission, but eventually helps prepare a plan to successfully navigate this highly difficult mission where the risks are high and potentially deadly and criminal if they are caught. Ben's character eventually dives in head-first and becomes the most eager to grab as much cash to help his bills, college for his kid, and divorce costs.The rest of the cast here is very strong: Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy, Papillon, Pacific Rim) is getting better with his English accent and is more believable as a tough guy/military role as he continues to play these characters, and he gets more screen time he to shine as the conscience of the group who can't help but keep track of numbers (kills, military recruiting speeches, missions, etc). Garrett Hedlund also continues to shine in his performances- I've always dug his charisma in his roles, like in Tron: Legacy, Death Sentence & Mudbound. Hedlund play's Hunnam's younger brother, a military guy turned MMA fighter who tends to enjoy the thrills of fighting, flashier liefstyle, and is the youngest in the group of experienced warriors. Pedro Pascal nicely rounds out the main cast as the military pilot of the group- a man seeking to put the wars and killing behind him as he focuses on his family and young child. Like the rest though, he cananot help but be lured by a job that could prove very rewarding for his life outside military and private contracts.
We don't get any performances that are groundbreaking here, but we get believable character-driven parts that fulfills the plot perfectly.The writing is strong, and the unique premise for this heist movie is not the logistics and means of pulling off the score, but also killing a drug lord if possible, rescuing some locals wrapped up in the drug life (Isaac's inside connection to the intel he has for the mission), and literally escaping with more money than they imagined being inside this target location. The realistic issue of transporting the amount of weight ($250 million... just what they take) is presented as an absolute ongoing issue as the men struggle with their vehicles, animals, on foot, and later injuries and running low on supplies and energy. They realize that the initial plan and scope of the mission is more than they intended, and the greed pushes some of the characters to forego their training and instincts in making rash or quick decisions that later come back to bit them in the end. The main characters are written well and their military actions with regards to motions, maneuvers, and lingo are also believable for the most part.The special effects are great here- the budget is noticeable with large scale environments, huge scenes with extras and military hardware that are all realistic and closely detailed by what seems to be some military advisors behind the scenes. There are good chase scenes, sprawling and beautiful environments, and I will add a somewhat memorable score (something Netflix originals tend to really struggle with).Cons: Very few here! The characters momentarily fall into tropes of movies past with similar circumstances, but the writing saves them from being completely stereotypical. The movie progressed in ways I did not expect, and yet I was not disappointed, which is a testament to the writing and cast performances. I feel like some key cinematography that changed some camera angles for close-ups or lingered in some important moments (like the village elder in a precarious position who cannot help but go along with the situation in front of him) would've made this film even better and help it to go down as not just one of the best Netflix films but something that would grow beyond it.I gave it an 8/10 stars and definitely recommend this for anyone who likes these actors (they all deliver) and really likes crime dramas, war movies, heist films, and suspense.",Triple Frontier
578,mendress99,Dont fall for the negativity here,8,16 March 2019,"I appreciate when critics point out unclear storylines, implausible decisions by the characters or plain logical errors. >90% of todays movies and series are just stupid and an insult to the viewers intelligence. However, in case of Triple Frontier I think while some of the storyline criticism is merited, it led to some very undifferentiated low ratings, which the film does not deserve at all.In my opinion you can find a lot of quality in the film: great actors, beautiful landscape shots, camera work, soundtrack and the action scenes per se. I also think the film had just about the right length, it was exciting and well paced from beginning to the end and had some suprising twists.Conclusion: if you are looking for a well-made action movie and are not going mad over a few, minor storyline glitches, watch Triple Frontier and have fun.",Triple Frontier

It seems that everyone involved in the making of this movie was just as greedy as its main characters since they decided go ahead and put it on their resume. Such a shame!What is the purpose of spending 2 hours watching 5 greedy guys robbing a narcobaron because they feel they deserve it, I do not know. I only watched it for Charlie Hunnam and it was still almost unbearable. I found no sympathy for these characters. There was no noble goal to their actions. Well, Oscar Isaac wants to ""help"" the unnamed country by killing this narco boss, but really, the primary reason for this mission is money, money, money.I am no military expert, but even I know that much of what the movie shows is ridiculous. The 20min recon mission is a joke, no camouflage, details of the mission are being discussed on the spot as if no planning went into this...I could go on. But nothing made me slap my forehead more than the ridiculous trek over the Andes. No food, no water, no mountain gear, yet the characters are lugging their loot over the freaking Andes! For days!! Are you kidding me?? At that point I was laughing angrily, but I still hoped for some clever final twist that would make the 2 hours worth it. Alas, no.The storytelling was slow, light on plot and heavy on talking. Even Charlie Hunnam couldn't save this movie for me.

The first thirty minutes I was super into it, and thought I was gonna like it more than I thought I would. Then the heist came and went and there was still more than an hour left in the film. Should have been more buildup for that. It was a great cast (Affleck...was....Affleck) and the premise WAS there. But the writing and subsequent events really turns you away from the film. So many errors were made by seemingly 20 year veterans and it became clear they were willing to do anything for greed. It's starts off strong with character building, midway through you don't like anyone cause they shot innocent people for millions, then at the end you find yourself thinking ""am I supposed to like these guys?""The acting is great, but there is only so much great actors can do with bad writing.

The bad: If you're like me and expect poor acting out of Affleck, you won't be disappointed. It's as though he kind of just showed up and winged his performance with little to no emotion. He's a hesitant warrior, but supposedly becomes a greedy, broken monster at the possibility of money. Everything bad that happens to the team is because of him.
There are a lot of continuity issues in this film. There was a lot more money in the net than there was on the donkeys, for example.
Charlie Hunnam was a bit Rusty on his accent.
The Good: Oscar Isaac, Garrett Hedlund, and Pedro Pascal all put in great efforts. Charlie Hunnam was a little rigid, but I enjoyed his performance as well.
Some well done action sequences.

(Yet I still do like the action scenes. They looked pretty solid to me.)The plot-line is pretty simple with the struggles of ex-military soldiers and the morality question about what is important. Yet I do not believe that a movie is about how complicated the story is about but that it is about how well you convey it.All five of the actors were good casts for their roles.
The downside was that there were parts that seemed like they were acting out of their characters. Sure they were to show how the characters react and change through the movie but it just wasn't that subtle.Overall, however, it was a good movie. The actors and the chemistry between them puts you on your seat and it is never a boring movie if you know what to expect.

595,ntaradilis,Covering all frontiers,9,13 March 2019,"J.C. Chandor is known for creating tense, and atmospheric films, and Triple Frontier is yet another example of a truly fascinating director masterfully manipulating and challenging his characters with taut and frantic situations.Triple Frontier boasts a Triple-A cast: Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, Pedro Pascal, and Garrett Hedlund. While each is given a moment or two to truly shine, the film sits squarely on the shoulders of Affleck and Isaac. The heist itself plays second fiddle to the characterisation, and the movie is all the better for it. We get glimpses of the shadowy morality at play in both the world and characters' minds, but also receive humanised versions of the precise ex-special forces killing machines.As expected, everything is gorgeously shot, with rural scenery swathed in lush greenery, contrasting nicely with the gritty favelas and mountainous terrain. The expertly handled camerawork is meticulously edited, there are plenty of quippy action scenes, and more extended character incursions, all forging a great cinematic experience.Triple Frontier mixes the flavours of Narcos, American Made, and 13 Hours, to create a thoroughly enjoyable action ride with interesting characters in genuinely perilous situations.",Triple Frontier

The cinematography and lighting were excellent. The colors were distributed throughout and every nuance of where the action was supposed to be vs. where it may have actually been filmed were on point. I can only imagine the conversation between the storyboard artist and the cinematographer for the initial scenes for the gun war by the discotheque. So many camera setups, really well done.Maybe it wasn't but regardless of where it was filmed it looked like at times miserable conditions. Kudos to that if it wasn't.Charlie Hunnam and Oscar Issac were excellent. Its a fictional Action Film (ACTION FILM) the acting will never seem natural but I love Ben Affleck's resistance initially and then his leader of the pack demeanor later.Personally for me this was a great action, Netflix film.",Triple Frontier
598,samellery,Decent film with fantastic acting,8,13 March 2019,"One of the best feelings about this film is the uneasiness it gives you by making you think anything could go wrong at any particular point.
In terms of action it's sparse but well handled, the film is mainly carried by the 5 actors that played the main protagonists, The standouts being: Oscar Isaac and Garrett Hedlund. It's more of a film about focusing on these 5 very different and broken people as opposed to a typical action film which took me off guard considerably.
Where the film faltered for me was the pacing and structure of the first act which felt slightly slow and choppy. All in all I do really like this film and the director and actors and everyone who made this film deserves praise for creating a solid gritty suspense film. It's just if the first act was structured a little better I would truly be able to call this a great film.",Triple Frontier
599,wlfithen,"Bad story, the end",4,14 March 2019,"This film offers many more things to criticize than to compliment. Others here have pointed many of them out. So, I won't repeat them.I will say that the climax of the story came way, way too early, or alternatively, the film was too long, padded with a depressingly meaningless wind-down.There were some contrived ironies. The biggest: the group wanting so bad to get the one character on board they thought was necessary to pull this off, only to have him (and only him) making fatal mistakes that ended up crashing the entire venture. Repeatedly. But if the irony was supposed to be subtle, it wasn't. And it soured the character that we all thought we were supposed to be identifying with and rooting for. But when the bullet came, I found myself surprised at my relief, I'd come to hate him so much by then. I kept thinking he'd redeem himself somehow. But no, he turned out to be the weakest, basest of the group. And that was a really dirty trick on the audience because there was no hint of such fundamental weakness until it burst out in spades. He lost situational awareness and cracked--retired soldiers just don't do that. Period. Bad writing.By that point, it took to much energy to switch identification/allegiance/rooting to another character; they hadn't been developed enough to invest in. I really didn't care if any of them made it back or not.All in all, a rather disappointing ride, the last third of which I spent frequently clicking the skip ahead 10 seconds button. Did I really need to see them trudging through jungle, crossing rivers, and climbing mountains? During which the least boring thing that happened was watching a poor defenseless mule bounce down a mountainside. Seriously? Click, click, click. Move along. Nothing to see here.I will pick one nit:Who were those two loan gunmen on the ridge anyway? I say, a plot device to relieve us of our misery at that point. At least, that's how I chose to take it. They take $250M, burn up that much more, kill the head honcho, and they send 2 guys? Right. I expected it to be the yellow shirt boy from the village--at least that would have made sense. So, I say we ignore who they were and just go right on. Who was supposed to be watching their 6. They'd just crossed a peak; I trivial look back over the shoulder at the top would have revealed them easily. Soldiers don't forget their 6. Not living ones anyway.",Triple Frontier

The Director could have improvised on it and made the characters more interesting by going deeper. Sometimes you feel like, is this person really who I think he is, essentially confusing us about the whole motive.The Thrill factor, well the things that happen in the movie were either obvious or confusing. When the Movie is in the momentum of giving us chills, it suddenly stops and takes a downhill.The Actors were SPLENDID. But, an Actor can only do what the Director tells him/her.

650,IMDbommie,Riding the New Frontier of Hollywood Action-Realism,8,16 March 2019,"(THE QUICK AND DIRTY)
This is the TL;DR version. Full review is below the synopsis.If you are expecting a fast-paced military-style action film centered on a heist, then you will not like this.If you like great cinematography/directing, A-list actors, and a script that interrogates ideals like brotherhood and ethics, then you should give this film a shot.Make no mistake, this is NOT an action flick, so erase that expectation. It is a drama that happens to have a handful of gunfights.(SYNOPSIS)
Oscar Isaac plays Pope, a former special operations soldier who has spent three years attached to a Colombian anti-narcotics police force in an advisory role. Frustrated by the corruption that protects Lorea, the Escobar-like ruling drug lord, Pope takes matters into his own hands and recruits four of his fellow retired soldiers (all of whom are as close as brothers) to stealthily take out Lorea and possibly receive a huge payday in the process.As the operation unfolds, the 5 men find themselves navigating the unforgiving South American landscape as they confront their interpersonal issues, immoral actions, and the life-threatening problems that naturally stem from a dangerous mission.(VISUALS - 10/10)
J.C. Chandor does an incredible job as director. The film opens in the claustrophobic Colombian streets, rife with every-day human activity interrupted by a violent cartel/police standoff. This chaos is then contrasted with the lax, suburban streets of Everytown, USA. We're quickly drawn back to South America to see the absolute jaw-dropping panoramic beauty of the lush, dark-green Amazonian wilderness, as well as the span of the mighty Andes mountain range. One can't help but stop (perhaps even pause the film for a moment) and admire the view Chandor provides to us.Though it is not the focal point of the movie, the frenetic and unapologetic violence that does appear is tamed by Chandor's very deliberate and non-shaky framing; there is no mistaking what we are seeing. Everything happens in real-time; there is no high-speed camera slow-motion to add style and pizzazz. In uncut shots, men crumple to the floor when shot in the head rather than dramatically flailing; injured men beg for death and a release from the pain of debilitating gunshot wounds. Chandor is not romanticizing the violence; he's presenting it as is.The color palette is dark, befitting the tone of this film, but it is still rife with vitality. Cinematographer Roman Vasyanov is no stranger to this kind of movie, having worked on nearly all of David Ayer's films (""End of Watch,"" ""Fury,"" etc.). The dense greenness of the Amazon is simultaneously alluring and terrifying; the entire screen pops with its hue, inviting us (much like the protagonists) to explore it and potentially never return.(STORY - 8/10)
The skeleton of this screenplay has tons of potential: former soldiers, who many would consider heroes, struggle to reintegrate into American civilian life. One is a mediocre MMA fighter; one regurgitates 'inspiring' speeches of his exploits to active duty military members; one struggles to sell apartments for a living and has to support his ex-wife and daughter; another has legal and drug issues.They all yearn for a sense of purpose that's long since disappeared with their respective military discharges, and Pope offers them that tantalizing hit of adrenaline with his new mission.Anyone familiar with war-journalist-turned-screenwriter Mark Boal should not be surprised by this military spin on the heist genre: he's Kathryn Bigelow's go-to guy for screenplays and has penned her films ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" as well as the crime drama ""In the Valley of Elah."" All 3 of these films involve the military, so it's clearly a comfort zone of his.A lot of the other reviews here criticize the writing as stilted, the characters as shallow, and the pacing as slow. I think they're all correct to some degree, but for me, it's not so cut-and-dry. Some of the light-hearted banter between these close friends might come across as juvenile or even cringey, but it's all in the name of ball-busting (which is common in testosterone-fueled occupations like the military).The characters, in a vacuum, may appear 'underdeveloped,' but this is not an origin film; we begin 'in media res' (i.e. in the middle of things). All the characters' issues and backstories are implied rather than explicitly stated. It's a minimalist approach. Each character is an iceberg, only the tip of which is visible despite the gigantic mass that lurks beneath.I appreciate writing that doesn't explain every nuance of a character; all these guys go back years, decades even. Why would they need to monologue ad nauseum to each other when talking about their families or past histories (all of which would already be familiar to the other characters)? To me, that would just be forced dialogue and exposition for the sake of looping in the audience; that's not good writing.The pacing, however, I can agree with. At the very least, I can say that the film doesn't suffer from pacing inconsistencies. In fact, it moves at a rate that is entirely consistent: slow. The action is slow, the drama is slow, the exposition is slow. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially for fans of slow-burn films that don't rush from beginning to middle to end. But I will concede that a few scenes could have been shortened or even excised completely without affecting the film's integrity.There was enough intrigue throughout this film where I was asking myself, ""What's going to happen now? Is there a betrayal afoot? How are they going to get out of this situation?"" At no point did I know how it was going to end: that's a plus in my book.(ACTING - 10/10)
It's hard to find deficiencies in a film's acting when guys like Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, and Pedro Pascal are its anchors. Each of these actors (Hunnam and Hedlund included) completely inhabit their characters; each is distinct from another.Isaac is the headstrong workaholic trying to rid the world of evil one bad-guy at a time; Affleck is the devoted family man who is torn between his yearning for combat and his desire to provide for his family; Pascal is a troubled helicopter pilot who fell through the cracks upon returning to civilian life; Hunnam and Hedlund are brothers, the former of whom tries to stay as close as possible to the job he misses by giving speeches to current military members, while the young Hedlund, though happy-go-lucky, is rudderless without the structure of military and has chosen to languish in MMA anonymity.As the film progresses, the stakes get raised higher and higher, and the tension between these 5 comrades gets ratcheted up accordingly as things go wrong and emotions run high. Each actor draws from the depth of their respective characters, with quite a few surprises in store that reveal the emotions that they all feel, ranging from despair, to loyalty, to compassion.(SOUNDTRACK - 2/10)
For me, this is easily the worst aspect of the film. It's not that it's necessarily a 'bad' soundtrack... it simply feels as if it's nonexistent. There's only one moment in the film that I can even recall a segment of an original soundtrack. But it was neither a recurring theme nor emotionally-relevant. It was just kind of 'there' because nothing was happening on-screen or dialogue-wise, so I was forced to notice the music.The rest of the film is punctuated by various pop-culture songs: the film is book-ended by Metallica's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""Orion,"" while Pantera's ""Walk"" makes a brief cameo as the entrance music for Hedlund's character during an MMA fight. Older classics make appearances as well, including Bob Dylan, Fleetwood Mac, and Creedence Clearwater Revival.Rather than a 0, I gave the soundtrack a 2/10 because the pop music that was used actually fits quite well: the aggression of older Metallica and Pantera reflects the pent-up aggression within the protagonists; Fleetwood Mac's ""The Chain"" frames Affleck's family dilemma; CCR plays as these former soldiers navigate a country they shouldn't be in, evoking imagery of Vietnam; Dylan's anti-war protesting accompanies shots of these five invaders in a foreign land.(FINAL THOUGHTS)
As the title of my review states, I think ""Triple Frontier"" capitalizes quite well on this new wave of action-realism that's beginning to flood Hollywood: the hyper-attention to detail in terms of efficient gun combat and squad-based tactics.Though we had tastes of this in similar heist films like ""The Town"" (2010), ""Den of Thieves"" (2018), and even Mann's ""Heat"" (1995), ""Triple Frontier"" draws from the attention-to-gun-detail spurred by Keanu Reeves' ""John Wick"" (2014) and fuses it with the gritty and less-fantastical worlds of the aforementioned caper flicks. It puts a further spin on it by using ex-commandos (rather than criminals) as its protagonists, therefore navigating the gray area of ethical robbery (i.e. of a vicious drug lord) instead of overtly painting them as run-of-the-mill lawbreakers stealing from banks solely for personal gain.It's clear that all the actors put in quite a bit of time with firearms and combat training just from seeing the way they hold their guns and the tactics employed. If you're a fan of procedural and realistic combat, you'll appreciate those small details like the trigger discipline all the characters display.In the end, this film deserves a chance. I think the issue is that it was marketed as an action-packed military-style heist thriller when in fact, it's a more of a dramatic character study (that just happened to involve a heist and some gun action). Those who expected the former felt duped, while those who enjoy the latter had a pleasant surprise.Hopefully with this review, you can now approach the film with an open mind (or at least, some idea of what the film entails) and adjust your expectations accordingly.",Triple Frontier

Of course Ben's character was going to go nuts after being exposed to the cash, think of the hardships back home he was dealing with.Besides that, sure their could've been more firefights or standoffs. But this is a really enjoyable movie, a solid plot with a great cast that alone is worth the viewing.",Triple Frontier

Therefore, it needed to be a blockbuster, containing action, a bunch of cool actors, money and a exotic place. In random order.So that's what happend. Period.Ben Affleck shows up, learned a few fancy words, puts a gun in his pants and sprays some bullets while Oscar Isaac copied that. Meanwhile, they try to show you what it looks like to be a soldier that works for money only: a mercenary in the 21th century. In addition, the director wants you to sympathise with them by showing you their kids while 'the bad guys' execute people that you won't be introduced to so that you will think that they were innocent at least.Next, a numerous amount of illogical decisions occur while plot holes are frequent, unfortunately.

This film was nothing more than a high fives and fist bumping tough guy movie with antics that only americans believe denotes expertise in the field of military operatives. Americans and american movies, in the vast majority of cases, annoyingly portray elite military as loud, cocky hotshots, with the remainder of the story depicting how bad they actually are at their job, by stringing one cockup after another until the mission fails and most of the characters die as a result of unprofessional behaviour. As the film progressed, I became increasingly frustrated at how the stupid decisions and actions of the protagonists laid a path of failure ahead of them, despite the typical build up that shows them all as elite soldiers.
One of the very few exceptions to this floored (american) genre was Generation Kill where the military were portrayed as professional, capable and disiplined, resulting in great critical acceptance but hollywood being true to form just want to make fantasies that perpetuate american stereotypes accpetable to a dumb audience.
It's so disappointing that this movie is no different from so many other awfully cliched Hollywood templates where even the most gullable american movie goer should recognise as unrealistic rubbish. Seeing Kathryn Bigalow's name attached to this film suprises me but I'd be willing to bet that she squirms in her seat every time she watches it.

The cast was stellar, no question about it. And their chemistry was terrific as well. The cinematography was beautiful. I even liked the cliched use of vintage, fist pumping metal anthems. What I could not abide was the sub par script and lack of character development. When Hunnam's character is describing choking out a stranger in a grocery store, a visual flashback would have helped us understand the depths of what he's casually talking about in that scene. When Afleck references the many ways and times he's let his estranged wife down, again a flashback would help us feel something for him. Their is no discernible soul searching before they quickly decide to embark on this heist. Much has already been stated about the holes and ridiculous mistakes these guys make. I was cringing when no one was standing watch as they pulled money from the walls. And then Affleck's character goes rogue without any set up to suggest we might expect that from him. I didn't buy it. If the filmmakers wanted us to believe that, they should have used flashbacks to show us something similar in him or the opposite: show us how tight and predictable these guys' movements were in the field previously. When Hedlund's character is hooting and hollering and talking about buying a Lamborghini I thought, ""These guys deserve to get caught"". I tapped out when the mule fell to its death. After that, I fast forwarded through it stopping intermittently to see if the film had managed to redeem itself at all. Sadly it did not.

One last example of the overriding flaw - they are tracked down easily by a teenager on foot even though they traveled by helicopter for hours before crashing.

I could easily see how men, even those with years of military experience, would react the way they did in this film given the circumstances they were faced with. It is a testament to the director's understanding of basic human nature in the face of such situations that made the film so good.

691,Petedwall,Thoroughly Rediculous,3,27 March 2019,"This movie had so many flaws it was just absurd. Why they didn't use drones or any kind of surveillance to scout out the area. They could have also gone in in the nighttime with night vision, smoke and flashbangs like any special forces unit would.Used suppressors to reduce the noice, or even crossbows / compound bows (like the SAS often does). Then they choose to overload the helicopter with $250m because $150m between 5 people just doesn't go anywhere nowadays. I think Hollywood actors are getting a bit out of touch with normal economics. Then ***Spoiler Alert *** they loose almost all of it anyway and one of their guys.And then *** Spoiler Alert *** they choose to fly over the Andes. The Andes, the second highest and one of the most hostile mountain ranges in the world. Then when the helicopter starts to fail from the extra weight like 50m from the apex, they keep pushing until the engine is destroyed and then they turn around and head back down the mountain, instead of just having a bit of patience and dragging the money over a snowy flatter part (therfore only lifting half the weight), or better yet just don't fly over the Andes or leave some of the money.There are so many other flaws, at the start of the movie Ben Affleck explains to everyone that they cannot go back to their lives afterwards, that they'll need to start a new life (totally correctly, because if you stole $250m from a DRUG LORD, they would definitely not just give up looking for you any time soon, and they'd likely offer a large portion of that I.e. $35m to bounty hunters for its recovery and your heads, which, hundreds of people have seen???)And then at the end of the movie they're all going back home because they have given all their money away. Wow, such nice guys. Too bad they're all going to die now sitting at home waiting for the cartel to come blow them up????

Yeah, the evaluation of those actions is right, but they made total sense in the moment of the film. And to those who said that the characters weren't developed enough... are you kidding me? What more do you need, flashbacks? It's a blessing there were none of those, they ruin the flow of the story! One had marital problems and two households to maintain with an unsuccessful career, another was a motivational speaker with a fighter brother, there was a disgraced pilot and a disillusioned police officer. They became greedy, then they ignored the capability of their helicopter, they were too trigger-happy with defending their cargo, resilient to the extreme, had this one moment of just letting go after having lost a large portion of their money and just having fun by making the most costly bonfire ever.

728,RehmanBD666,"Triple Frontier: of Soldier, Duty and Morality",7,24 November 2019,"How does the Army functions- we all know that but how does the army operatives live with us is a less asked question, let alone enquired properly. Apart from all the mythical extravagances of a soldier, both retired and on service, Netflix original Triple Frontier (2019) features a dispute over skill versus soldier, service versus morality, loyalty versus life. Starring Ex-Batman(!) Ben Affleck and Ex-Machina (2014) star Oscar Isaac, this unconventional action thriller doesn't offer any solid resolution to those serious issues but Director J.C Chander ensures a solemn yet suffocating meditation on the philosophy of expectations and reality. Guns and guilt, bullets and badge, fights and friends- J.C. Chander equips these with few retro Metallica, Pantera and Bob Dylan masterpieces - pumped enough? Let's dig into all of this together because Triple Frontier entails an epic quest, a grand odyssey and a tragic homecoming with all these yin and yang built along with it.The title did a fascinating amalgamation of geography and psychology. Triple Frontier is a junction where borders of Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil meet. Visually the film is there but metaphorically, it says something substantial to human behavior. When everything goes south in the narrative, all the characters are mentally challenged to prove their worth. Their skills, loyalty and moral strength are examined like Bangladeshi elections are observed by the international communities. At some point, it exceeds their reach and remains open to the audiences to interpret their survival strategies. When it comes to survival, you automatically murmur: Survival for the fittest. But do the fittest always survive? Does survival mean physically alive or is that just existing? It is satisfying enough to see this film accompanies a sublime contemplation over this classic dilemma. Any ardent audience will detect a polemical assertion in the film's evident criticism on military services and experiences, its disruptions and discontinuity, trauma and post traumatic treatment. Nevertheless, romanticizing the duty as pure and proud, the operatives are fed with a vague, hollow and fake promise of belongingness. Often times, there are moments of internal conflict between individual judgement and authority that displays an uncomfortably numb state. One of the character epitomizes the rising tension between worth and reward by saying: ""If we had accomplished half the things that we have accomplished in other profession, we'd set for life"". Apart from this heavy stuff, the film incorporates few brilliant visuals: That epic shot seeing Ben Affleck through fire will be remembered with cinematic tribute for a long time- clearly illustrates greed and pride simultaneously. They had a camp fire out of dollar bundles on top of the mountains: can this be an ultimate irony of piling up huge money just to see the world gets a little more disturbing, problematic as it ever was?
This Netflix original is unusual in action genre where action seems to be the secondary motive and reaction and reflection being the primary. Anybody remembers the epic quest cinema ""Red River"" (1948) by Howard Hawks? Well, Triple Frontier could be its proper descendant: A grand journey into the wild, an unforgettable quest and a heroic homecoming - no R rated 150 minutes feels any better.",Triple Frontier

737,mohitd-63747,A good opportunity with an excellent cast but a lost plot,6,26 June 2019,"The movie started off good showing us the not so happy lives of former special forces operatives and how they struggle with being out of action for years. They have families and the money isn't enough to sustain the kids and education and upon hearing about the opportunity they are a bit skeptical but decide to grab it.
The way they went about the heist/homicide felt like they're some cheap mercenaries and something you don't expect from special forces. No silencers and absolutely poor stealth skills (shooting that person in the leg when a simple stock hit on the face could've knocked him out) and okay they were supposed to make it look like a rival gang but at the cost of giving yourselves up is a bad idea. Also how the heck didn't they figure out Lorea could be hiding in a concealed place like a panic room and the wardrobe was pretty weirdly placed something which I figured out as a person with zero military experience. Also is it so difficult to figure out that the amount of money that was taken will be way over the amount a helicopter can hold at the height required to cross the Andes and okay they got greedy but they are special forces and they know that being sloppy isn't what they're necessarily good at. Also when Pedro Pascal is like it won't hold this weight above 2000 feet why not dump a few bags cause according to them it was way more than 75 million, more like 250 million so why not just dump a 100 million dollars and they would still be left with double the money they came for.
Also a teenager with a basic rifle is more stealthy then five special forces operatives and they can't detect him being on their tail and also why didn't they cover the rear because they surely could've flanked them from a spot way behind them.
Ben Affleck dies and it comes off as a shock but how are they gonna get his body over to the USA and explain the bullet hole in his head coming back from South America. They could've just buried him somewhere in those lands but it's just like they became emotional which you wouldn't expect from highly trained soldiers. I'm sure each guy could've carried 2 bags and give one each to his family.
Overall it was an enjoyable movie with such an amazing cast but somewhere I feel they should've taken their time with this movie and it could've been one of the best heist went wrong movies.",Triple Frontier

Many of the decisions made in the movie could be likened to an someone shooting themselves in the foot--something these guys would never do.The movie should have contained more action during the actual heist and less time doing things rookies would never have done.

In reality, a bunch of American heroes being recruited back to steal $75m from some South American Drug Lord requires some stretch of imagination. The movie tries to portray the motives for each individual to do so but frankly fails to make acknowledge that war heroes would NEVER act like this.As the movie progresses, Ben Affleck (or his character) develops a level of greed for money that then gets everyone into trouble. The team then pulls itself together and makes it through half South America back into safety with 1 out of 5 dying.I switched this off 10 min before the movie finished and am really not sure why the likes of Ben Affleck gave themselves to this. Some good acting, probably a high budget judging by some of the great action effects, ,but extremely poor story line with very poor consulting/advisory from people who have been in these types of situations.

What it lacks in creative writing or compelling characters it makes up for with a brutal tension that carries it through it's 2 hour 5 minute runtime. This tension is developed in part by desolate locations and situations mixed with what feels like excellent chemistry between most of the main cast.What brings this movie down is a lack of character development or growth throughout the film. Main characters are introduced and givin a general back story if any at all, and then do not have any dramatic arc or depth to their journey throughout the rest of the film. The movie kind of just grits it's teeth and pushes past anything other than service-level emotions and reactions.Also, and this is kind of nitpicky, Triple Frontier uses too much pop music. Instead of a dramatic or emotion swelling original score the film defaults to Metallica or CCR for dramatic effect. I think this is kind of a waisted opportunity on the film's part.",Triple Frontier

769,zJanuary,I found the last 2/3 of the movie quite interesting.,8,13 March 2019,"The storyline said ""events take an unexpected turn and threaten to spiral out of control"" and I had thought the five were to be faced with some unexpected villains but it is not how the story goes.The movie is more like an allegory. I found the last 2/3 of the movie quite interesting. They planned the robbery because of being bad-off, but had to throw away the money during the escape. To lessen the weight of the helicopter, to comfort the villagers, mules falling of the cliffs with money spreading all over the valley, burning cash to keep warm and throwing away the bags so as to carry Tom's body, and finally, give all the money to Tom's family. It makes me think of The Old Man and the Sea. The old man lost his oars, his spear and snapped his knives and returned only with the spine of the marlin. But not exactly the same, after all the fortune they had been craving for had turned into a totally burden.The girl reminded that the money they had stolen might have caused them trouble and people might come after them. However, avengers had not showed up. It was more like a metaphor of their futuristic troubles. They had perfectly planned ""one last deal"", runaway and enjoy their lives however, the situation got totally out of control, much above they had anticipated, just like Urashima taro opening up the magic box.At the beginning they referred themselves as ""warriors"", ""pure and pride"". With mercy they avoided Lorea's family and kept it low. But later on the civilian were shoots and finally they were fighting against teen soldiers. ""If thou long gaze into an abyss, the abyss will gaze into thee."" Quite exactly.The story was really well-written but the characters, well. When Tom saw the paintings in Lorea's house he sighed (or hesitated? Not sure), and later on he shoot the villagers in the conflict. I think the director may want to show the controversial personality and humanity of the character, the morale dilemma but it seemed to be a little bit weird, maybe much too intentional. I would like to compare this to Affleck's Town, you can just tell the story and let it happen.Anyway quite a good movie and have a special taste of the music.(Don't speak English so I might have missed some details and sorry for my misspellings and wordings)",Triple Frontier

I will just state the most absurd one, on which, by the way, the whole plot is built on.
How can five men carry at least 40 bags full of cash (each with a weight of surely more than 40 pounds, which makes it a 1600 pounds load, plus weapons and military equipment) overpassing the Andes without any food or water supply? ...by foot.
They are even shown hoisting the bags up the mountains, how much time would it take for five men to hoist 1600 pounds of cash over a single mountain? What about the entire great mountain range of the Andes?
It is unbelievable how the creators of this movie are unaware of the absurdities that they thought about, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

The second star I gave goes to the mentions of PTSD, and financially difficulty despite the hero like efforts and patriotic killing the vets did for 'America'.Further into the movie the team develops a slapstick plan that is riddled with loop holes and an even more so unbelievable execution. Spoiler alert***
You're telling me this big bad guy Lorea who stuffed what appeared to be a cool 500+ million in his house walls and controls the police and people in his nation, yet has only a small handful of guards who are not surrounding and patrolling the premises, has motion detectors but poorly placed camera pointed in the wrong areas and only makes it on to the screen to close a book and die?Now they have the money and are about to get away, the army men (who we still barely know), are greeted by a pilot we don't know, with a plane to small to carry them and the money they just killed a bunch of people for, and rather than leave some money behind they take it all, knowing I'm advance they won't make it out of their due to the heavy load.
Then Ben afflecks character turns into a real asswipe and starts berating the woman who was the only reason they could get the money in the first place, asking what their names were, suspicious. Btw, how and when did the brother get out of jail?After the plane crashes a bunch villagers come out and surround the money, rather than leaving a bag or two for them they decided to kill half of the villagers armed with old looking handguns and knives.Now they are travelling over the mountain and have to fight their way through a bunch of teenagers.
I'm one incident they burn bags of money to stay warm, and when confronting a teen enemy they tie him up to show their mercy and kindness and give him a tiny stack of money totaling no more than a couple thousand. Then they catch a boat that somehow waited days passed what he was supposed to, and is someone we never get to meet.When they finally arrive they are left with 1 mill per person (5 shares) out of 250 million.This is where my third star comes in.
After killing a bunch of kids they are left with nothing. They deserve that nothing. Way to show how Americans can rampage another country pretending to want to help the people and really are just there for money.The ending was one of the guys (idk who because they were all white aside from pope) hands Pope coordinates for the abandoned money. The look on popes face shows he wants to go get it. After losing a camrade and killing a bunch of people, you want to go back and do it again? All of these characters are trash except for the woman who did all she could to get her brother out of jail.The only thing this movie is good for is highlighting the trash veteran system in America. Treat veterans better so they don't runaway to foreign countries and kill teenagers for money.",Triple Frontier

not following a plan,being greedy,not asking yourself the question how much money is enough andprioritizing being close to the money now over getting home safe and being able to spend the money later.And then that ending ... did they donate the money to forget or feel less guilty about being part of that heist?

It had so much potential.I was hoping and expecting an action / thriller with lots of cool / spec ops action.
We keep hearing all the terrible stuff the cartel does...and I though this movie would represent a good opportunity of some good ol unofficial revenge and justice against them.
These guys are supposed to be the best of the best...where was all the special tactics, camouflage and use of cool gadgets ? silencers ? sniper rifle ? cool weaponry ? mini-drones / surveillance cameras ? meticulous planning and execution ?Lots of unused plots points : being double crossed by the girl ( ben affleck guy questioning her etc.. ) , being constantly hunted down by the other cartel members whom cash they stole / burned etc... perhaps finding some hostages or sex slaves at the compound n having the dilemma to rescue them etc..The whole mountain hiking trip was very unrealistic : 5 days with no food and water ? hauling 30-40 heavy bags with one injured man, over steep terrain etc.. ? come on !It seems they didn't know what kind of movie they were making ? PTSD post war redemption story ? survival in the wild story ? military heist movie ?I mean, the acting was good, cinematography was good, the few action scenes were decent...but I expected some much more , especially story and action wise.",Triple Frontier

812,cullen-mauritzen,Such a letdown for so much potential.,1,14 March 2019,This movie was a tactical nightmare. From the way they clear the house and cover themselves to their contegency plans. Openly showing their faces and going so far to roll the windows down and stare at people. No sat phone. No improvisation to drop the cash and come back for it. They had theoretically unlimited money to complete the mission they needed. The characters even went so far as to say they were the best of the best. Usually that has certain implications but I guess not. Netflix completely failed in this movie. I was seriously excited about it and they showed they aren't ready to hang with the big boys when it comes to the movie sector of the business.

It's basically the same concept as this movie executed properly.Overall, I like the premise of this movie, but the ending, and how the ending came to be, ruined it. So, they get all this money, and things don't go perfectly to plan, but close enough for them to get away from the ""scene of the crime"" with the money with only 1 non fatal injury. The movie could've ended here with a happy ending, but what fun would that have been? Instead of giving the characters a valid obstacle to overcome, the writers were too stupid or too lazy and came up with the most invalid easy to solve obstacle and it just completely leads to the plots downfall. SIMPLE, make 2 trips over the mountains with the helicopter. Everyone makes it home with all the money they got.

That after murdering a bunch of villagers who took an unaccountably bizarre exception to them crash landing a helicopter in the villagers field.

Both started out just wanting enough money to be comfortable, then as the lure of greed overcame them, they were willing to risk everything to hold onto more than they needed or could handle. When I first heard about this movie I thought it was going to either be a heist gone wrong film or a heist with the bad guys chasing them for the rest of the movie. What I discovered was how greed can override even basic common sense. In one point the pilot tells Affleck's character that there is too much weight and they had to leave some behind If they would have left even half behind they would have made it over the mountains. Affleck wouldn't have murdered the towns people, he wouldn't have died. They would have escaped with more than enough money for all of them to live comfortably for the rest of their lives. Instead they fell into the greed trap. Not too different than the drug dealer they stole the money from. He had so much money that he was walling it into his house to hide it from the world. What good is all that money if it makes you paranoid beyond reason, or go against your basic common sense, or commit acts you would normally never do. It is useless.

The blood she'd would need to be spilled of one of the drug Lords rivals and that, in that part of the would doesn't need the decimation of valuables, treasures and money, a wrong statement could start it and then there would be 100s if not 1000ß dead. The story is im probable. Again, if the US had interest in it, the would broker a deal with those governments and go take care are of it, hence Delta, Seal Team 6 and MARSOC. worst the story is boring Add to that 'Jax' (Charlie Hunnam) gives the best acting performance of the group, and that's standing next to Oscar Issacs with a golden Globe and Ben Affleck also with Golden Globes- both for writing a movie and for acting)globee and dozen other awards. It was not even a fun action flick. Nor suspenseful. It just is. The do not come close to showing what the Triple Frontiers lawlessness truly is, nor showed that it is a melting pot of all kinds of killers, yerrorist in hiding and a cacophony of launguages and people's...not just southern brizilian. I am not saying it was a waste of my 2hrs 5m, but I definitely could have done something better with that time, like watch the beginning of Sons of Anarchy again, that would have been worth the time spent.

Great cast, interesting plot and unexpecting moments. Sure I can agree, some parts are aggravating and could've been handled another way, but the director didn't want that. He wanted his audience to be at the edge if their seats. He wanted the audience to get aggravated at the crews decisions. That's the genius behind it. Sure, the plan could've went a lot smoother and they make a clean get away but, what kind of movie is that. He was trying to make it more realistic. These guys were obviously trained and had a plan but, once they saw all that money, they went in shock. All they're training went out the window and greed took over especially with Affleck, the one guy who didn't even want to go is now the greediest and wasn't stay in point with the plan. That right there shows you the power of money and how it alters your way of thinking. So, based on the greed, they went through the following consequences that unfold.

It's like the writers wanted you to hate the movie and waste good talent.The villain filled the walls of the house with money, and that's a poor insulator. Who is the contractor that keeps walling up the money and saying nothing?Then here's a long list of issues:
1) trained military sneak into a house with no silencers
2) couldn't find the villain in the main bedroom during the main sweep of the house
3) villain come out knowing that 3 of the 5 people in the house are right outside the door. He has cameras in the house. the villain also doesn't call for his gang to come back early
4) searching for the villain even though you are going to burn the house down
5) if you know you are overweight to cross the mountains, there's lots of weight to through out of the plane (weapons, fuel, then money)
6) bullet wounds don't impede a persons ability to trek for 5 days
7) risk burning out an engine instead of dropping a couple extra bags of money or taking two trips over the mountains
8) wet bills weight a lot, the bags didn't look waterproof to me still able to travel days no weight problem
9) took as few mules as possible
10) there's two shooters with the element of surprise that choose to fire in broad daylight.
11) when being shot at from a higher point, everyone goes to flank the shooter, no one stays to draw fire. The people flanking never reach the shooters before the original decoy.
12) each person could've just given 1/2 of their share to Ben afflecks family and that would still be great. His family would have 2.5 M vs 5 M and none of the rest of the team would have to struggle to get home.The worse issue of all, is that I spent time watching it....",Triple Frontier

Those of us who took the oath to defend this country did so knowing full well we would NEVER be adequately repaid for what we were going to have to do, but rather, it was the pride of having done so that we treasure.Having said that, everything about this movie screams ""I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THE MILITARY, BUT I'M TRYING REALLY HARD TO LOOK AND SOUND LIKE I HAVE!!!"" At no point did any of the actors make me think they could have been veterans. The dialog is hammy, their movements are stiff and rehearsed, they behave in ways special forces would never (demand a fire and risk detection? After 15 odd years of SF? Yeah, no. He'd either be out of SF or dead before this occurred) and the way they interact with each other is how Hollywood THINKS vets interact, not how they really do.

But this movie was just awful in terms of plot in these movies generally you would try to like these vets that had stolen a druglords money (like the good bad guy) but I felt literally no affinity towards any of the actors characters, and literally the most stupid mission of all time for supposed warrior vets that looked like a bunch of amateurs in the field.

941,wesreidel,Meh...ok,6,13 March 2019,"This movie I would say is with the time to watch and it keeps you interested the majority of the time. What concerns me is the realism of what a ""war"" movie should look like. The soldiers in this movie are apparently all ex-special forces of some kind and they make a bunch of mistakes that I doubt any seasoned veteran would make. Some of the events just aren't believable. (Spoiler Alert). Charlie Hunam's character was shot through the torso and then continued on a 5 day trek through the mountains looking none the worse for wear. There was no sign of him treating the wound with any antibiotics or alcohol.
The soldiers had to travel through rough terrain for 5 days, dragging huge bags of money that looked stuffed full of pillows. There was NEVER any mention of the food and water they would have to secure to complete such a journey.
This movie was mostly entertaining, but not very realistic.",Triple Frontier

The next 30 mins also kept my interest, however after that it was just mistake after mistake. Why on earth with Catfish call out they're not going to be able to climb the mountain with the cargo, why on earth wouldn't they just find a somewhat safe area on both sides, have 2 men guarding each side and make it over a few runs, instead risking the only transport they got.Also towards the end, could he not have ask the damm driver of the boat to move it out of city area, so they could safely get to it?",Triple Frontier

Character development lacked a bit as well. However, this is a story of a group of military men challenged by their conscience, which I found refreshing. Guided by greed at first, their moral compass guides them further towards intrinsic value of a human life. Even though these men have admittedly killed numerous people throughout their careers, their collective paradigm is challenged when their ""leader falls"" as a byproduct of their ""collective greed."" I fear the moral of the story is something that alot of viewers/reviewers are no longer interested in.",Triple Frontier

The actors are nothing more than robots and the dialog is downright terrible. The action scenes are less than stellar. Thanks a lot netflix.

Oscar Isaac is at his finest in this movie. Great cast,with fantastic,believable chemistry.",Triple Frontier
955,briansmovies,Triple Frontier,6,16 March 2019,"First things first, I have to say that this movie annoys me because of the potential it had. The five leads in Isaac, Affleck, Hunnam, Hedund and Pascal are all badasses in their own right and you can tell they are meant to be badass here too BUT they aren't. From the start you are told of these soldiers past their best and its the classic let's get the gang back together for one last mission. The main problem is that the only character who's backstory is interesting is Oscar Isaac's, because he is the main character, I think.Like I said the story is one last mission, but that mission goes from finding a target to being a heist mission. So here we are, the heist is done, the lads have gotten $250 million, but we are only half way through the movie. What happens then? They live happily with the money until they are hunted down? No. The rest of the movie is spent getting the money away from the place from the place it is stolen from. Genuine. The bad guy is seen once as he is getting killed.On a positive note I do think there were some good performances, mainly Isaac and Pascal and there's this one scene where they are in a helicopter and I like that scene and the fact the house is made of money. Apart from that I struggle to find many positives. This is a movie I think suffers from the writing and I'm not sure if it was studio intrusion or what, but it just makes for a mundane movie.",Triple Frontier

957,dberry367,"Started Off Good, Got To The Point Where It Was Laborious To Watch",4,7 October 2021,"Not sure what happened, was enjoying the cast and the plot, I was buckling up getting ready for a good movie. I consciously thought the directive to not show the MMA fight after he takes a massive punch and they pan straight to South America was brilliant, was thinking this is going to be a movie that is different from others where you have just overly gratuitous and predictable fight scenes.Unfortunately, it was at this point where it started to go badly wrong. Outside of it feeling rushed, character development and back stories are extremely weak. Here we are getting ready for the best to go in and complete a mission with professionalism and tact, knowing they are going to have some struggle, but instead every obstacle is created because they are acting like their fresh out of basic training. Entire scene when they are in the safe house, I am on the edge of my seat, suspense only added by how careless and nonchalant this ""elite special forces"" team becomes. If only it stopped there, every decision and every action from this point forward has you asking yourself, why?Outside of the team looking like it's their first day on the job, the movie spends so much time adding context that never materializes. Few examples, the drug lord is a non-issue, the window rolling down on the VIP van foreshadows nothing, the brother of the woman (again no back story, just magically there) while the helicopter arrives acting overly suspect and skittish, nothing. All of this would not be an issue if they would have done a good job of developing the plot but again, you are left with so many questions, while all of this unnecessary filler was present.I almost believe that they made the movie with so many optional scenes and the edit came out disorganized to the point where the movie becomes a joke.Here are a few things that made me say WTF:They opt to use local guns to make it seem like it was an opposing gang, outside of the one AK, the other guns are fully decked, not sure why they could not outfit with suppressors, never fear though, open gun fire causes no issues. They only want to kill the Drug Lord, why? Even though they end up killing everyone before it is over. The movie goes back and forth so many times of minimizing death to fiending for it.The best operator leading the thing who has been overly cautious the entire movie all of a sudden turns into a bumbling idiot trying to get a few more bags of money...... ok.Once again, the best team they could assemble, they have a container of weapons, they have coordinated a helicopter, but they did not anticipate the flight path with weight? But wait, you are going to tell me they took more money than they intended to take, and I am to believe that this helicopter, made to transport freight, is not going to be able to lift the extra cash over the mountain...... the abundance cash they had to unexpectedly extract from the walls within their 40 minute timeframe of hitting the safe house.I cannot even fathom how we are to entertain the logistics of them hauling all of this cash, with no food, no water, across the pass, wait for one member to get to the boat to hold it up, walk back then have to deal with beach parties and gangs waiting for them as if they know exactly where they are going without causing problems with this boat sitting out there or advancing to the mountain which has no cover to attack.As I went to write this review, I saw where Channing Tatum and Tom Hardy left the project, I can completely understand why.",Triple Frontier
958,jonlaanemae,Ben Affleck and his movies,3,21 April 2019,"Why are all of the movies Ben Affleck is in so bad?
Yes fun action, but just full of b-film mistakes all the time. Always some ridiculous scenes that just doesn't make sense.
The guy is running after a girl and when they meet up a few minutes later they speak in english. No, sorry, after three sentences they speak spanish again. No, now they speak english. Was it difficult for the director to decide what language a guy and a girl he knows speak when they are alone? ""Hmm they are in south america so they probably speak spanish"" ""No wait, if they speak spanish people in USA won't understand, so speak english"" ""Yes but if they say some cool stuff in spanish in the next sentence the mexican immigrants in USA will feel more like they are welcome""
Is it just the 16 year old director who doesn't understand how to make a good movie yet because he comes straight from film school? Or is it that Ben Affleck has such a bad influence on people that the movies just become bad when he is in them? Or does Ben Affleck only choose movies that are bad?",Triple Frontier
