0,TheLittleSongbird,Cult of scary fun,7,3 January 2019,"The Chucky/'Child's Play' franchise was the most recent one to be watched and all the films reviewed, as part of me being on a quest watching some of the horror franchises not yet seen (yet the intent had been there for a while). Part of my want to see them was my fascination to see if killer doll Chucky deserved his horror icon status. My conclusion seeing the films is that he does deserve it and is a hugely entertaining and creepy character, though quite a bit better than the films he features/stars in.'Cult of Chucky', of the numerous and uneven sequels, is one of the good ones despite its faults. Not a film that blew me away and will never be a favourite but it both scared and entertained me, as the main objective for the franchise that is a very good thing. It does not beat the first film, which would have been a very tall order, but it is one of the better entries in the 'Child's Play'/Chucky series along with 'Bride of Chucky' and 'Curse of Chucky'. Despite saying that the franchise is uneven, that is not saying that any of the films are unwatchable, actually found things to like about the weakest entries, which for me were 'Child's Play 3' and 'Seed of Chucky'.Really appreciated that 'Cult of Chucky' did the same as 'Curse of Chucky' in returning to its roots, capturing the tone of the first film while also feeling fresh that stops things from getting tired. Although there may not be an awful lot of surprises here, 'Cult of Chucky' continues the feeling felt in 'Curse of Chucky' that the franchise had been revived and given new life. There is again far more of a reliance on horror, and genuinely scary and suspenseful horror it is too, than the comedic approach adopted by most of the sequels, which varied greatly. The opening sequence is truly foreboding and the kills are imaginative, gloriously gory and freaky, without veering on being too tasteless.Yet 'Cult of Chucky' doesn't take itself too seriously, again the same with 'Curse', the wickedly funny one-liners, dark humour and dialogue remain still and there are some dementedly hilarious moments. Chucky is as frightening and entertaining as ever and Nica is a likeable protagonist that one roots for. Brad Dourif voices Chucky as ever with relish and malevolence and Fiona Dourif gives a spirited performance too. Jennifer Tilly enjoys herself, if not as much as in 'Bride' and 'Seed'. Like the rest of the franchise, 'Cult of Chucky' looks great, very stylish and haunting with terrific effects, even in the lesser films the production values were always among the good things. The music is suitably eerie and could really tell from the direction that Don Mancini had a lot of passion and affection for the franchise.Not that 'Cult of Chucky' is perfect, but the good things far outweigh the cons. The story is not much special, is pretty thin and a bit low on the surprises, though at least it made sense and wasn't dull. The rest of the supporting cast are a touch on the bland side.The ending felt anti-climactic and rushed and some of the character decisions are rather silly.Otherwise, good and one of the best in the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Cult of Chucky
1,SnoopyStyle,continues to be good,6,30 October 2017,"Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is still haunted by Chucky (Brad Dourif). He keeps lots of guns and the decapitated head of Chucky. However, nobody is willing to believe him. Nica Pierce (Fiona Dourif) faced electro-therapy after her wrongful conviction for Chucky's murders. She gets 'better' and is transferred to a clinic under Dr. Foley's supervision. Visitor Tiffany Valentine (Jennifer Tilly) claims to be Alice's guardian and after her death, leaves the Chucky doll with Nica. Nica starts to suspect her delusions about Chucky may not be so delusional as Chucky begins his rampage.Don Mancini continues the Chucky franchise. Unlike other long-running horror franchises, this has not deteriorated into bad camp. Much of that has to be attributed to Don who keeps a singular voice in the series. He isn't going to win any big award but he keeps a cohesiveness in the run. It's nice to still have Alex Vincent even if he's not the greatest of actors. That's part of the cohesiveness despite some conceptual detours. It has some nice turns and horror moves. It continues its dark humor although it's not the scariest of franchise. It is better than most straight to DVD movies. Its cheaper budget does keep it from being theatrical. It's a fun watch especially for any Chucky fans.",Cult of Chucky
2,claudio_carvalho,Exhausted Franchise,4,3 June 2018,"Thirty years ago it was released ""Child's Play"" with the cult Chucky, a killer doll possessed by the soul of a serial killer. The sequels are watchable downfalls of the original movie, but unfortunately ""The Curse of Chucky"" was a breath to the franchise. However ""Cult of Chucky"" shows that the franchise is completely exhausted, with a boring and stupid story. The worst: the ending is a cliffhanger for another sequel. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""O Culto de Chucky"" (""The Cult of Chucky"")",Cult of Chucky
3,nogodnomasters,Woks for me.,9,25 September 2017,"The film opens up with the original Andy (Alex Vincent) all grown up and being played by the same child star. He keeps the tortured head of Chucky (voice of Brad Dourif) locked in a safe where he hits it with a nail gun from time to time. The main plot concerns Nica (Fiona Dourif- Brad's real life daughter) who was the wheel chair girl from the ""Curse of Chucky."" She was convicted of murder and is now in a medium security facility for the mentally ill. Jennifer Tilly, the Human Bride of Chucky delivers a Chucky doll to the facility that already had one which they use for therapy.Perhaps the major change is that the soul of Chucky can enter any Chucky doll at will, allowing the series to go on forever, into space, time and maybe end up in a cage match with Robert and Annabelle. Nica who has been in a wheel chair from life managed to maintained muscled legs the whole time, perhaps the most unbelievable aspect of the film, except for maybe that one scene. I like Nica in her new role. Very fitting. The film had a number of memorable lines. Great characters. Good franchise popcorn film.Guide: F-word. Wheel Chair sex (add to bucket list) . No nudity. Graphic gore, although not too realistic. On the laughable side.",Cult of Chucky
4,kosmasp,More Chucky than you can handle (?),6,16 October 2017,"We get a direct sequel to the previous one (they all kind of build off each other, Chucky movies that is), this feels just even tighter knitted to the one a couple of years ago. Of course it has to do with Fiona coming back replaying her role. Guess she hadn't had enough of her father coming after her (her real father is the voice of Chucky, in case you didn't know that).So while I thought the previous one was way funnier that it had any right to be, this tries the same formula in a different setting. And overall I'd say it succeeds. It's not as good as it's direct predecessor, but if you don't mind the mixture of humor and horror, you will be entertained with this too.",Cult of Chucky
5,jboothmillard,Cult of Chucky,5,17 March 2019,"The Child's Play/Chucky franchise has been a mixed bag over the years, the original and Bride of Chucky are considered the ones that stand out, but straight-to-DVD entry Curse of Chucky was a surprisingly good revival, this sequel followed four years after, directed by creator of the killer doll, Don Mancini (Seed of Chucky). Basically following the previous events, grown up Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) has the original head of Good Guy doll Chucky (Brad Dourif), which is conscious and deformed after being repeatedly tortured by Andy. Meanwhile, paraplegic Nica (Fiona Dourif, Brad's daughter) has spent the past four years in a mental institution after being framed by Chucky for the murders of her family. Having had therapy, she is now convinced that she was responsible for the murders and that Chucky was a manifestation of her psychosis. She has been transferred to the medium-security Harrogate Psychiatric Hospital by her doctor, Dr. Foley (Michael Therriault). In group therapy, Nica meets Malcolm (Adam Hurtig) who has multiple-identity disorder; elderly Angela (Marina Stephenson Kerr) who believes she is dead; Claire (Grace Lynn Kung) who burned her house down; and Madeleine (Elisabeth Rosen) who smothered her infant son to death. Dr. Foley introduces a therapy technique involving a Good Guys doll, most of the patients are unsettled by the doll except for Madeleine, who treats it as her baby. Nica is visited by Tiffany Valentine (Jennifer Tilly), the legal guardian of her niece Alice (Summer H. Howell), she is devastated when Tiffany tells her that Alice has died, apparently from a broken heart. Tiffany leaves Nica a Good Guys doll, which she claims was a gift from Alice, it is Chucky, who that night comes to life and discovers Nica has attempted suicide. The next morning, Nica finds that her wrists have been stitched up, with a message saying ""not so fast"". She discovers Angela has been killed, leaving the message ""Chucky did it"" in the puddle of her blood. Nica realises Valentine was the last name of the girlfriend of serial killer Charles Lee Ray, Chucky's real name. Fearing Madeleine is in danger, Nica has Malcolm try to warn her, but Madeline, throws both the doll and Malcolm into an empty grave, Malcolm is rescued by the orderlies. Claire realises that Chucky is alive, after trying to throw him down a chute and him biting her. She panics trying to warn Dr. Foley, but he drugs her on an operating table, paralysing her, and Chucky kills her by shattering the glass of the window above, decapitating her. Andy learns about the murders reading online articles and realises Chucky has somehow managed to transfer his soul into multiple bodies at once. Nica agrees to be hypnotized by Foley in a private session in order to access any repressed memories about her involvement in the murders. Foley, who has been sexually abusing Nica, is hit from behind by Chucky, the doctor believes Nica assaulted him but is willing to keep quiet in order to blackmail her for sexual favours. Madeleine smothers her Good Guys doll with a pillow, forcing her to confront the repercussions of her real child's death, the orderlies bury the doll in order to appease Madeleine. Determined to end the carnage and save Nica, Andy turns up at the institution and is committed by assaulting one of the security guards. Foley is delivered another package by Nurse Carlos (Zak Santiago), it is another Good Guy doll, while Madeline is visited by her own doll, she allows the doll to kill her so she can finally be with her dead child. Foley attempts to assault Nica, but one of the Chucky dolls knocks him out, and he wakes up the second Chucky doll that Andy had sent. The three Chuckys reveal that the original Chucky found a voodoo spell which allows him to separate his soul into multiple host bodies. Alice was one host, but she was killed, then all the dolls then kill Carlos in front of Nica. Tiffany returns and kills a security guard by slashing his throat, while one of the Chuckys transfers his soul into Nica, giving her body the ability to walk again. He stomps on Foley's head until it is crushed, he stumbles on Malcolm who admits killing Nurse Ashley (Ali Tataryn), he is then killed by Madeleine's Chucky. A short-haired Chucky appears and attacks Andy, but Andy reaches for a gun he had planted in its stomach, he shoots the doll before stomping its head, killing him. He then shoots at Nica Chucky, only to discover that he has no ammunition left. The institution is sent into lockdown, resulting in Andy being locked inside his cell, Madeleine's Chucky going into hiding, and Nica Chucky escaping. Nica Chucky reunites with Tiffany before driving off together with the Tiffany doll, which is revealed to be alive as well. In a post-credits sequence, Andy's former foster sister Kyle (Child Play's 2's Christine Elise) enters Andy's house, Andy sent for her to continue torturing the original Chucky's severed head. Like the previous entry, this is trying to be scary or tense than funny, the new concept of multiple killer dolls can get a little confusing, but Dourif remains likeable as the possessed toy, and Dourif's daughter is a welcome return as the heroine, and there are some clever references to the past films in the series, it is much more violent as well, I will admit it is not a fun as previously, but it's a reasonable horror. Worth watching!",Cult of Chucky
6,BA_Harrison,Chucky's back. And so is Chucky. And Chucky.,6,30 September 2017,"Nica (Fiona Dourif) is transferred to a medium security hospital where, once again, she finds herself tormented by serial killer Charles Lee Ray AKA Chucky.If there's one good thing that can be said for Cult of Chucky, the seventh film to feature the iconic killer Good Guy doll, it's that it really delivers on the splatter, with some wonderfully messy kills: Chucky (once again voiced by Brad Dourif) decapitates one victim with the creative use of a compressed air cylinder; a hospital orderly is stabbed, gutted and drilled to death; a doctor gets his head stomped to a bloody pulp; and one poor guy get a drill though the back of his head, the spinning drill bit emerging from his eye socket.There are, however, long 'dry' stretches to contend with, the majority of the gore coming towards the end of the film after a lot of chat and tiresome 'filler'. 'Cult of' also introduces a new plot device that messes with the lore of the previous 6 films: traditionally, Charles Lee Ray must perform a complex ritual in order to transfer his soul completely to another host; in this film, he is able to swap bodies with the simple utterance of a few magic words, not to just one new host, but to numerous hosts, effectively building an army of serial killers. While this adds something new to the well worn formula, it's a little silly, leaving this viewer wondering just how many duplicates of himself Charles can make: one hundred? one thousand? one million?",Cult of Chucky
7,paul_haakonsen,"So there is a cult now, eh?...",4,17 June 2018,"I have been watching the Chucky movies ever since the first one, and I am one to say that the franchise has been on a downward slide for a long, long time. Granted, I haven't been much of a fan actually, although most of the movies are enjoyable for what they were, but never reaching anywhere near along the likes of Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger.""Cult of Chucky"" is, at best, a less than mediocre movie. They should have stopped this franchise a long time ago. It is now at a point where it starts to become embarrassing to the franchise.So now Chucky can suddenly possess multiple bodies at once? Right, sure, evolution, why not?I will admit that the actors and actresses in ""Cult of Chucky"" did put on some good acting performances. And they actually assembled a good cast for portraying the various characters and roles throughout the movie.The movie definitely has good special effects, which also do carry the movie quite a way.When it comes down to it, then ""Cult of Chucky"" wasn't a particularly thrilling addition to the ""Child's Play"" franchise, nor was it a particularly memorable movie by or in itself.",Cult of Chucky
8,Coventry,Too Many Chuckies,4,29 October 2017,"Perhaps I just was in an exceptionally optimistic and generous mood when I watched it, but I quite liked the previous installment ""Curse of Chucky"". Especially after the dreadfully awful ""Seed of Chucky"" in 2004, ""Curse of Chucky"" felt like a far more mature and good old- fashioned horrific revival of the franchise with the emphasis on suspense and plot rather than on stupid slapstick one-liners. Unfortunately it was a lucky shot, as this direct sequel is once again a largely ludicrous and inept hash. The slayings are still joyously blood-soaked and the mysteriously captivating Fiona Dourif (daughter of) returns as leading lady, but the screenplay is pure nonsense and Chucky is again a sneering jester instead of a menacing killer. The story continues quite logically, with Nica Pierce submitted to a heavily guarded mental institution after the bloody events of the previous film. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Foley, arranges for Nica to be transferred to a less strict clinic and participate in group therapy. Andy Barclay, Charles Lee Ray original target victim, is also still around and keeps the heavily mutilated leftovers of the possessed Chucky doll in a safe at his house. Meanwhile, a number of Good Guy dolls are being sent to the clinic and they ALL appear to be possessed with Chucky's cheerful persona. The explanation for why all the dolls are simultaneously possessed is cheap, imbecilic and downright preposterous. Don Mancini sort of made his life's work out of the ""Child's Play / Chucky"" series. He wrote all films since the 1988 original and took over directing them since 2004. He'll probably never make anything else, but maybe he should. I think we've seen enough Chucky movies by now, even though the gore & splatter always remains worthwhile. The seventh installment contains, for example, an ingenious decapitation and a delightful head-crushing.",Cult of Chucky

10,kannibalcorpsegrinder,An exciting and thrilling entry,9,10 October 2017,"Determined to rid himself of his burden, a man haunted by his history with the deadly killer doll finds that he's still alive and targeting patients at a remote mental asylum where his previous victim is staying to recuperate and must band together to stop his deadly plans.This is quite the fun and engaging end to the series. One of the many enjoyable aspects to this one is the fact that there's quite a healthy connection to the past which helps set this one solidly in the universe. This one manages to fill in some key gaps in the series based on the different entries so there's a fine history already established here to dive into, with the dwelling on the last film and how she ended up in that position in the mental hospital which gives this a decidedly strong connection to the past. Even filling in character backstory's and giving them a history in between it all so there's even more to really enjoy here which really makes this one engaging. Doing this makes the film really fun when it switches over to the fact that he's out loose in the facility going through his usual routines the film has a sense of genuine tension with the unaware staff trying to ensure it's all part of the healing process and allowing Chucky free reign to move through the residents and patients with relative ease, giving this some absolutely stellar stalking features here with the twist in the slit-arm patient, a great voyeur sequence of a victim being dumped into an open grave or trapping a victim on a gurney and offering a rather spectacular finishing move that is a real highlight offering. Other fine moments here come from the inability to recognize he's out there in the asylum giving an extra dose of suspense to the affair by going for some really tense moments including the one patients' belief that Chucky's the doll of her son or the psychologically disturbing hypnosis sequence which is chilling on several levels due to the belief that the doll isn't alive. That fun leads solidly into the rampant action in the finale where it has plenty of truly chilling and enjoyable with the series of fine revelations which signal a really strong twist in the finale that has a devilishly delightful spin that really is a fantastic end to the franchise. As well, given the high quality of the gore here in some absolutely fantastic kills and plenty of truly stand-out special effects work on the numerous Chucky dolls, it has a lot to really like here. This does have a minor issue to contend with, in the fact that there's no real reason why Chucky is going around the asylum with his plans to build his army, which makes no sense and really doesn't have an explanation for what he's doing. This really could've been just a singular doll running amuck on the patients in the asylum so the reasoning for him to do that could've been given but in the end, it doesn't really come to much here which is the main issue to be had here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, a mild sex scene and drug use.",Cult of Chucky
11,FlashCallahan,Chuckys cuckoo with this one......,5,19 January 2018,"Confined to an asylum for the past four years, Nica Pierce is convinced that she, not Chucky, murdered her entire family.But when her psychiatrist introduces a new therapy to facilitate his 
group sesions, a Good Guy doll, a string of grisly deaths begins to plague the asylum, and Nica starts to wonder if maybe she isn't crazy after all. Andy Barclay, Chucky's original nemesis, races to Nica's aid. But to save her he'll have to get past Tiffany, Chucky's long-ago bride, who will do anything, no matter what, to help her beloved devil doll.The Child's Play films have gone through a strange transition since its debut thirty years ago. You could say that they are three different franchises.The first three films were a trilogy, they were good movies, but by the third, they had run their cause and due to media exploitation, became obsolete.Bride and Seed came later, and I feel that these were made because of the elevated interest in ironic horror thanks to the Scream franchise. Whilst Bride was refreshing and very self aware, Seed was terrible and was just a cash cow.Now these new incarnations are nothing more than straight to Blu Ray movies because the doll has a following, and I feel that these films will go on and on, because like myself, fans of the original films just want want a film in this franchise that will hark back to its heyday.This isn't the one unfortunately. It has some very good ideas, multiple Chucky's is a wonderful inclusion, but the rest of the film is poorly written, with strange characters, and it feels like a weird hash of Cuckoos Nest, and Elm Street 3.The Asylum setting has been done to death, as have sinister doctors, unprofessional nurses, and inmates who may or may not have an ulterior motive.Chucky has some decent scenes, and it alone is the sole reason to see this, but it's a shame that the story had to be convoluted to the point of you not caring less for the characters.It's a shame because out of all the iconic horror characters from the eighties, Chucky is one of the most interesting, but writing hasn't done it justice.",Cult of Chucky

And the doll does do offer some good moments. You can't compare it with Annabelle, therefor the budget was too low but what it does is using more gore then Annabelle. It isn't all about the jumpscene's , this is all about gore. And I must say that it worked out fine, no CGI but on-camera gore and it looked old school, so for the old geeks this is a must see but for the youngsters used to watch the Hollywood horrors this isn't going to be one for them.

13,Hellmant,"Fans of the genre, and Chucky, will probably enjoy it.",8,20 October 2017,"'CULT OF CHUCKY': Four Stars (Out of Five) The 7th installment in the Chucky horror movie franchise, which brings back cast members (and their characters) from all six previous installments. The story deals with Chucky now having the ability to possess multiple different dolls, and he uses them to torment the survivor of the last film, Nica, who's now living in a mental institute. It was written and directed by the series creator Don Mancini, who's written all seven films and directed the last three. The movie once again stars Brad Dourif as Chucky, and it costars Fiona Dourif, Alex Vincent, Michael Therriault, Adam Hurtig, Elisabeth Rosen, Grace Lynn Kung, Marina Stephenson and Jennifer Tilly. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was released directly to video and VOD. I'm a fan of the series and I enjoyed this installment as well.Nica (Fiona Dourif) has now been accused of the murders of her family, and is living in an asylum. She's also been hypnotized into actually believing she's responsible for their deaths, and not Chucky, by an abusive doctor (Therriault). The doctor also starts bringing a Good Guy doll to therapy, and Nica, and other patients, are deeply disturbed by it. Grisly deaths begin occurring as well, and another doll shows up too. Nica soon starts to believe it was Chucky that killed her family after all, and he's now tormenting her again.I'm a pretty big fan of the franchise, and the Chucky character, and I've actually really enjoyed every installment (to varying degrees). This new chapter takes the series in some interesting new directions, and it looks like there will probably definitely be more sequels. For me it's not quite as good as most of the other Chucky films, but it's still better than a lot of other B slasher movies. I think fans of the genre, and Chucky, will probably enjoy it too.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/oV2G3RUT234",Cult of Chucky
14,thesar-2,Cults de Chuckies,7,7 October 2017,"Nice to see the series' second reboot cult up the previous attempts.While I am a Chucky fan to the end, there are less great ones than even good ones. I'm stuck in which is my favorite: Bride of Chucky or the original and incredible Child's Play. What horror fan could deny Andy and Chucky's first experience wasn't masterful? But, to me, the oh-so- meta, Bride, made my heart soar for the series again with good kills, great laughs and the wonderful addition of Jennifer Tilly. So, while the Child and the Bride duke it out for the top spot, Cult of Chucky is certainly my 2nd or 3rd favorite of the seven films.** - Cult is 2nd best if #1 and #4 are a tie.While I appreciated sixth entry, Curse of Chucky, as trying to get away from the humor of #4 and #5 and get the series back on a horror track, it was rather dull for me. It wasn't terrible, but it was just ""eh."" (Still, better than numbers 2, 3 and 5.)Cult is a direct sequel to Curse and ties in the entire series with the exception of Glen/Glenda that even Chucky wants to forget. So, before seeing this, you definitely need to see the so-so Curse. Actually, it's not wrong to see them all, but in all honesty, you really only need to see 1, 4, 6 and 7and I wouldn't even recommend 6 if this wasn't so tied to it.Spoiler (for 6): Chucky's real-life daughter in and out of the movie (more meta?) reprises her sentenced role for having to take the rap of Chucky's murders in #6. She's in a mental ward with Dr. Not-Dr. McDreamy when several Good Guy Dolls show up and it's on. You know the rest, but now Chucky has friends. Sorta.Oh. And sorry Jack, Andy's Back! #Coolbeans!While there are enormous plot holes (just ask yourself where Perez Hilton got those screengrabs?) and it's kind of incoherent with motivations, lack of police procedures and poor edits at times – probably too much editing as important plot points went unanswered, it was still a ton of fun. And despite the lack of kills for the first half, when the blood hits the fan, it's probably the most gruesome of the franchise.Totally recommended and it's nice to see the whole gang back, I mean, sorry, Glen/Glenda. But, we are all glad you're gone.***Final thoughts: #1 It was great to meet both Brad ""Chucky's Voice"" Dourif and Alex ""Andy"" Vincent at a horror convention a couple of years ago. I had heard he came out of the closet and that was awesome ~ especially since he's gorgeous. He did seem to think I was stalking him as I happened to bump into him a few times in and outside the convention and he kept giving me dirty looks #2 Wow, I had a thing for Jennifer Tilly, a girl-crush, if you will. Boy, she has let herself go a bit, unfortunately. But, she still looks very good and always love her voice!",Cult of Chucky
15,bowmanblue,Back on (crazy) form,7,10 September 2018,"I've been a fan of the 'Chucky' franchise since its first 'Child's Play' films which depicted a murderer transferring his soul into a children's toy doll, only for the doll to continue his foul deeds. Along the way the franchise obviously decided to concentrate on the doll himself (Chucky - perfectly voiced by Brad Dourif), rather than the - no redundant - 'Child's Play' aspect of the series. The first three films were 'straight' horror, whereas the fourth and fifth then changed to more black comedies, part 6 tried to go back to the horror roots and emulated some sort of weird 'who-dun-it' (even though by the sixth instalment we know full well who's doing the killings!) so I had no idea in which direction part 7 would go.With other horror franchises, you may be forgiven for thinking that by the seventh outing the formula would simply be reproduced ala 'Friday 13th' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' brands. However, one of the main things I like about Chucky's killing sprees is that they are quite different from each other (whether they work or not is down to personal taste!). Now, with the 'Cult of Chucky' we're treated to a bit of a hybrid of everything that's gone before. We have everything from throwbacks to almost all the previous instalments to humour, to gore to... well, a story that goes in completely new directions.If there's one word to describe this film it's 'crazy.' I really had no idea where it was going as it bounces around with characters and narrative. Now, you could also call that sort of story a 'mess' - if you were being cruel. However, I have to confess for enjoying the sheer 'not knowingness' of this horror movie. Normally, with the genre, you're introduced to a bunch of (mostly forgettable) characters, then they're gradually whittled down to just one (girl?) for the final showdown. Not here. And the film is all the stronger for it.Brad Dourif is, as usual, on form as the murderous doll, but, once again, he's ably assisted by his (real life) daughter Fiona Dourif as the lead. And, once you know they're related, you'll find it impossible not to see her father in every expression she pulls (she's also got his maniacal laugh down to a tee!). I suppose if the film has a bit of a weakness it's that it's a direct follow up to 'Part 6' and you really should have seen that one to fully 'get' everything that's now going on (although, saying that, you really need to watch everything that's come before it to FULLY get every last little reference).A lot of people (even those who worked on the franchise!) said that Part 3 was the weakest of the franchise. Personally, I thought Part 6 was - mainly because there wasn't enough Chucky in the first half for my liking. Luckily (for me) in Part 7 we have more Chucky than I could cope with! I loved it, but perhaps my only gripe was that it's clearly a 'middle chapter' of a story that the producers want to add more to. Therefore, things are set up which don't get resolved here and left me wanting to see what comes next.I hear the story is going to be continued on TV (maybe?), but at the same time more films are in the works. I don't know whether either of those online rumours are definitely true, but I do hope they continue this story rather than finishing it all here and going for some (completely unnecessary!) reboot. The Chucky saga is evolving and each instalment is different enough to attract new audiences while hopefully not alienating its core fans. If you're looking for a cheeky, darkly-comic and horror movie, you'll definitely find it here.",Cult of Chucky
16,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Child's Play 7 - don't laugh, it's good",8,4 November 2017,"While most 30-year-old horror franchises would be running out of steam by the time they hit a 7th instalment, Chucky has had a surprisingly solid run so far by constantly reinventing himself (pun intended) and having fun by reversing audience expectations. I credit writer/director Don Mancini and producer David Kirschner with this curious quality control. They have been with the series from the very beginning and are careful when it comes to telling a new story rather than just cranking out a cheap cash-in. It's strange to think that Chucky, as a series, has far more integrity than any of his peers.Fiona Dourif (hauntingly beautiful and her dad's exact double) returns as Nica, now confined to a mental hospital after no one believes her claim that Chucky is alive. But one person out there does believe her - Andy Barclay. He's lived his life in seclusion and become a loner after his struggle with Chucky in the past, to the point where Chucky has imprinted on him in some irreversible way. They might even be friends (to the end) in a strange twist.Nica's psychiatrist produces a Chucky doll during their sessions to help get over the fear and find out what is truly going on in her head. Meanwhile, two more Chucky dolls show up in the hospital and fellow patients start dying horribly. Which one is the real Chucky? Are they all Chucky?Mancini handles the suspense very well and takes a far more sober and sombre approach (especially when compared to the 5th movie) with a quiet, chilling winter atmosphere (dare I say Xmasy) and the right amount of teasing and fake-outs. Brad Dourif is hilarious once more, bringing back the humor that was missing from the previous movie, while Jennifer/Tiffany hints as something else brewing outside of the hospital.Cult of Chucky is one of the best in the series so far. I just wish that Mancini would bring back Graeme Revell as his themes from Child's Play 2 and Bride of Chucky were the best of the series. Joseph LoDuca does a fine job however.Don't brush this off as a cheap cash-in. Chucky is not going downhill just yet and fans of the series will surely love this one.",Cult of Chucky

Basically that's what we have here, they have decided to drop the traditional Chucky and instead shake up the lore altogether and though interesting it doesn't really work.On the flipside this brings back Curse Of Chucky's Nica and series veteran Andy. Ontop of that we also have a surprise previous character pop up in the post credits scene.I loved the fact it brought these characters together, even Jennifer Tilly returns as Tiffany Valentine (Despite being killed off in Bride Of Chucky 1998). Thankfully that and everything else is explained, but sadly it just isn't very good and is too much change to the Chucky franchise.Cult Of Chucky is a watchable effort but the changes made to the franchises lore were all too much for me and can be nothing but damaging in my eyes for future movies.The Good:Nice homage to the franchiseOne death scene was awesomeThe Bad:Too much changeStory is a bit crap",Cult of Chucky

23,subxerogravity,Wow! another Chucky movie!!,6,8 October 2017,"Loved how sick and psychotic this it started out. After the events of Curse of Chucky, you would have thought Andy, the kid from the original movie would have been done with his good guy doll ( I would have assumed it's been over with him since Bride of Chucky since he was not in it, but...). The problem is that he's still being hunted by the ghost of Charles Lee Ray. But just like with the start of Bride, the Chucky era of this slasher film franchise puts Andy as a back story to Nica, played by Fiona Dourif (Who happens to be Brad Dourif's daughter (You know, the guy who plays the voice of Chucky in all the movies (That's got to be a record for slashers, right?). Nica who was in the last movie returns and was put in a insane asylum because everyone (including herself) believes that she made up the fact that a toy from the 80s was a killing machine, but of course we know the truth, especially when Chucky comes after her, and like with Bride of, he's not alone (Sort of)One of the factors of not using the title Child's Play anymore and sticking with the Chucky titles is pointing out the sure camp that Chucky has become. No longer scary or met to be scary, the movies are fully fun to watch. Adding to the fun is the a fact that Chucky's doing his killing in a confined space like a loony bin filled with, what's on the surface, seems like helpless victims but deep inside are just as derange as the monster itself.Cult of Chucky seems to focus on this factor a lot more. The actual killing is inventive but not as awesome as I would expect of a Slasher from the 80s (A bit of a mix of modern special effects with not so interesting characters). It's got a psychological thriller edge to it that makes it a better movie than any of the slasher horror parts, but Chucky can still horrify you in the most demented way possible. After all, it's a doll on a murderous rampage. So not a bad entry in the Chucky titled era of the Child' Play film franchise. It's more for fans of the series which is great in this day of nostalgia, very trivial,  but a lot of fun.http://cinemagardens.com/",Cult of Chucky
24,jtindahouse,The final 20 minutes saves it from being completely terrible,5,27 September 2017,"The 'Child's Play' or 'Chucky' series (whichever you'd like to call it) has been all over the place over the years. Which is strange when you consider they have all been written by the same person, Don Mancini. The atmosphere of these films has ranged wildly and unpredictably between extreme horror and comedy. You never really know what you are going to get going into the film (though there will always be a murderous doll, that much is for sure). I had actually really enjoyed the previous entry in the series 'Curse of Chucky' and so was quite looking forward to seeing where they went with the story on this occasion. Sadly, they got it more wrong than right this time.The setting of an insane asylum should have been an ideal one, however it didn't really work. When people have lost their mind and barely know they're being murdered it simply is not scary. Also the concept of multiple 'Chucky's might have sounded like a novel one in the writers mind, but in reality it was just messy. It certainly didn't add any scare-factor to the film.The final 20 minutes or so of the movie do pick up the slack a little and there is actually some well shot scenes in that time frame. Also the ending could lead to an intriguing next edition to the series. Mostly though, this entry is fairly forgettable and adds little to nothing new to the series.",Cult of Chucky
25,jadavix,Dull and underwhelming sequel,4,13 February 2018,"For most of ""Cult of Chucky""'s run-time, I was thinking that any fan of the series could have come up with a better movie than this. But then in the last twenty or so minutes, I saw a bit of what the movie should have been for its entire length. Chucky is barely even in it up until these last moments, and there is barely any violence, or attempt to scare.The title ""Cult of Chucky"" seems to imply that the movie features a quasi-religious ""cult"" who worships the killer doll. This is not true, but it would have been interesting. Rather, it features more than one killer Chucky doll, at the end at least. It doesn't do anything with this idea and it hardly seems to matter to the plot. Instead it goes for the whole ""heroine from the last movie is now in an asylum because nobody believes her story"" route. It's pretty underwhelming.Fans of the series might nevertheless be interested in seeing Alex Vincent, the actor who played Andy in the original three Childs' Play movies, returning as an adult. Jennifer Tilly also makes a few appearances, presumably for the sake of tying this movie to ""Bride of Chucky"" and ""Seed of Chucky"" in continuity. She doesn't really do anything here other than appear.Fiona Dourif, daughter of Brad (the voice of Chucky in every entry, including this one), also returns as the protagonist. She's really the bright spot here; her performance is about the only spark of creativity in the whole movie.

Sadly I have to say that I came away slightly disappointed. On the plus side there is some great and gruesome gore, plus some old characters. What I did not like was that the film just felt like a stepping stone to continue the franchise, it lacked a good story line that could be found in say Bride or Seed. The colour white I also found to be over bearing - the movie is set in a mental institution, where all of the walls are white - and it is snowing outside.

This movie is directed by Don Mancini (Seed of Chucky) and stars Alex Vincent (Child's Play), Allison Dawn Doiron (Lost Girl), Brad Dourif (Dune) and Fiona Dourif (Shameless). The storyline for this is okay but not great and feels like an excuse to make another movie rather than being creative. The movie is a bit uneven. The kill scenes are just okay other than the glass decapitation sequence. The wheelchair sex scene opening was random and kind of funny as was the woman who thought she was a ghost. I wasn't a fan of the Charles flashback scenes but I did like the ending. This is a hard one to rate but I'd score it a 5.5/10 and recommend seeing it for fans of the series.",Cult of Chucky

Meanwhile, the killer doll has some scores to settle with his old enemies, with the help of his former wife.One thing I was extremely happy about was the amount of gore and practical effects used in the movie. There is no noticeable CGI Chucky. It looked like the majority of the Chucky doll scenes were done using animatronics and puppetry.Fiona Dourif's put in a delightful performance as (Nica) the Heroine of the film. You can totally see the genetic code to her father Drad Dourif's in Fiona's eyes . Kind of a trip... Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky was obviously a standout. The villains steal the show. Chucky and Tiffany, (Jennifer Tilly) are fine villains (and probably better than most of Marvel's), but the real star is Michael Therriault's Dr. Foley, a quite disturbing/disturbed secondary villain. Even Chucky admires this guy. And he admires him so much that at some point he's not sure whether to kill him or take notes.Cult of Chucky is part self-spoofing slasher, part lowbrow bloodbath and all guilty pleasure.

Michael Therriault plays the aforementioned character, to his credit he does a decent job.Fiona Dourif is, away from her father, the star of the film though. Solid performance from her, just like in 'Curse of Chucky'. Adam Hurtig is noteworthy as Michael, while it's cool to see Alex Vincent properly return as Andy. There are some pretty nice death scenes too, which is important.This is another strong production from Don Mancini, I like all of his Chucky films with the exception of 2004's 'Seed of Chucky'.

Hooray?While I will admit that none of these films are great movies, most of them are pretty fun. The character of Chucky is so ridiculous, and the way in which he goes about killing people is often so absurd, that as a genuine horror fan I often found it hard not to enjoy myself. This film sort of wraps up Chucky's story... I say sort of because, in the immortal words of Chucky: ""I always come back."" As of now, there's still a Brad Dourif-voiced Chucky television show in development for the SyFy Chanel, and Don Mancini is supposedly pretty involved with that. And of course, there was the 2019 remake ""Child's Play"" starring Aubrey Plaza, which I still haven't seen as of the moment that I'm writing this review, but I've been told that it sets up for a sequel. Chucky isn't going away, but this film did sort of feel like it had a touch of finality to it. I didn't enjoy this film as much as I did ""Seed of Chucky"", which is where I think the series sort of peaks; it's an okay ending to the Brad Dourif era of ""Child's Play."" This series has never been anything remarkable, but the films usually provide enough entertainment to warrant sitting through their short runtimes.

31,a_chinn,Surprisingly durable franchise still satisfies!,7,7 October 2018,"I've been quite surprised with the longevity and consistent quality of the Chucky/Child's Play franchise. The first film is still the scariest and best of the series. Part 2 and 3 are the weakest, but the series was revitalized with Part 4, ""Bride of Chucky,"" which introduced a lot more humor and a lot more gore. Throughout the seven film franchise, Don Mancini has written every film and directed the last three, including this installment, which picks up with the survivors of the last film now in an insane asylum. This film also reintroduces Andy Barclay from the first film, who's also revealed early in the film to be in possession of Chucky's sentient severed head. Unbeknownst to Andy, Chucky is able to now inhabit other Good Guy dolls, which Chucky's ex-girlfriend Jennifer Tilley conveniently drops off at the above mentioned mental institution. Chucky then terrorized the guests of the asylum by possessing multiple dolls and is as demonically funny and terrifying as ever, voiced by the great Brad Dourif. Mancini even makes from funny nods to Dourif's memorable role of Billy Bibbit in ""One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest"" given this film's setting. Overall, ""Cult of Chucky"" is nothing brilliant, but it delivers to horror and dark humor that you'd expect from a Chucky film, if that's your sort of thing. Mancini has certainly left me looking forward to the next installment (which at this point looks like a TV series!).",Cult of Chucky
32,vengeance20,Not getting any better (sadly),3,17 November 2017,"Just finished watching Cult of Chucky & have to say it was disappointing & not all as great as I thought it was going to be. I mean the film as a whole was ""ever so slightly"" better than Curse of Chucky, but only by a whisker as this film wasn't all that different from it's 2013 predecessor. The film carries on from the events of the previous with Mica, who is now in a mental hospital after recently being transferred. She still believes the Chucky Doll is real while everyone around thinks she is crazy as the Doll is nothing but a ""fantasy"" to them & the authorities.The film sees some iconic characters returning, with Alex Vincent as Andy Barclay & of course Brad Dourif with the voice of Charles Lee Ray/Chucky, not to mention Brads daughter, Fiona, returning from the previous film as Mica. The film was decent enough for what it was. Though it wasn't anything special. It took place in the asylum for most of the film with other scenes taking place in either Andy's house & the restaurant at the start of the film, aside from them 2, it's pretty as confined as the setting of the film is. The deaths were OK, 1 of which was pretty creative. While the others weren't all that. They weren't ""Dark"" or ""Sinister"" enough. We need the REAL Chucky for crying out loud! Where's the vicious killings? The stabbing? The grim, yet dark deaths he carried out on his victims!? I miss them! Badly!I also feel the issue with this film (like the previous) is that it lacks the old school feel of the late 80's early 90's! That feeling which is absent in these sequels which although are miles better than Bride of Chucky & Seed of Chuck especially! Though them films didn't feel ""tacky"" if that makes sense? But I'd have to say Child's Play 1 2 & 3 (especially) are the best ones!The story-line which was alright just had a dumb arse twist at the end which was both politically correct & just dumb & weird! I mean, what ever happened to a straight forward story-line with Andy rescuing Mica from the asylum? Hm? No it has to be a less off session with Chucky's GF along with another weird yet confusing revelation! I did like the post credits scene, but even then, that couldn't save this film from getting any better!The gore was decent enough, but could've been better! You'd of thought for today's generation in films being modern, that Chucky would dominate it, sadly not & this film wasn't much of an improvement over Curse of Chucky, which was quite disappointing!I hear there's an 8th instalment of Child's Play coming & shock shock horror horror shock shock horror... is set in outer-F**kin'- space! Seriously? I mean this film itself was 87 minutes long yet we couldn't get some easy straight forward story-line with some gruesome Chucky class deaths? No, of course we can't! Overall the film wasn't all that, it was disappointing considering the new age we live in & the anticipation of what could've been a good horror film with a classic Chucky laced into it!

33,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Cult of Chucky""- A slick sequel that rewards longtime fans and takes many fascinating risks... though it's unorthodox story and noticeably low budget may turn off some.",7,3 October 2017,"For near thirty years now, good-ole' Chucky the killer doll has been terrorizing audiences the world over with his killer antics and twisted gallows humor. He's an indisputable horror icon, so it was never any surprise that even after a prolonged absence starting in 2004, he would eventually re-emerge. And that he did with 2013's surprisingly accomplished franchise-revival ""Curse of Chucky""- a fiendish chapter that won back many of the fans whom had drifted from the series. ""Curse"" reinvigorated the character and the story, and reminded fans of just why they fell in love with that delightfully demented doll in the first place.And while it took four long years of waiting, our anticipation for a follow-up to ""Curse"" has finally been answered with director Don Mancini's ""Cult of Chucky"", the seventh film in the ""Child's Play"" story. And while ""Cult"" did receive a warm reception from both general and horror film critics, with plenty of positive buzz built from a successful festival stint... the public unfortunately hasn't been so kind, with it having polarized viewers into either ""love it"" or ""hate it"" camps, with no in-between.And that really is a shame, because as a fan of this series for many years, I though ""Cult of Chucky"" was a slick, stylish and incredibly enjoyable installment that only furthered my appetite for future follow-ups. While it definitely does lack the inherent freshness that permeated from ""Curse of Chucky"", ""Cult"" is a very organic extension of that film's mood and tone, and builds off of it very well... all while also managing to organically re-introduce some of the more fantastical and comedic elements of the series. It's a good mixture that balances the best of both worlds, while furthering the series narrative in strangely unique and risky ways. Sure, it does fall back on clichés a bit too often and it does have some issues with tone and pace, but honestly... I really had a blast with it!Four years later. Chucky's original mark Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is still suffering the ramifications of his past, while his most recent target Nica (Fiona Dourif) has spend the past few years cooped up in an insane-asylum, blamed for the death of her family. After convincing herself that she was responsible and that Chucky was merely a figment of her imagination, Nica is transferred to a medium-security facility in an attempt to be rehabilitated. However, things take a dark turn when the head therapist introduces an interesting new therapeutic ""device"" to assist in Nica's aid... a Good-Guy doll. Shortly after, another startling turn happens when a certain bride of a certain killer doll (Jennifer Tilly) drops off a yet another Good-Guy doll to Nica. Which doll is just a doll? And which could possibly hold the soul of the serial killer Charles Lee Ray? And how can Chucky even be there when Andy seemingly has his still- living disembodied head? These questions will lead to a series of startling revelations that will leave Nica and Andy questioning their sanity as a game of torture and death plays out around them...""Cult of Chucky"" is at its best when it dives full-blown into the insane and deranged madness we've come to expect from these films. And thankfully, these moments do come quickly and consistently after the end of the first act. Writer/director Mancini relishes in piling on questions, mysterious and plenty of twists and turns that will leave the viewer constantly on edge and unable to quite work out what's happening. And it provides a lot of great entertainment value. The fact is, for a low-budget, direct-to-video follow up that is the seventh installment in a decades-old slasher film franchise... this is pretty darned decent, and it's clear a lot of love and care has been placed into the film by all involved. I also was quite taken with Mancini's keen visual eye for flow, composition and design. This is a gorgeous looking film. This only made all the better by the consistently good performances. Particularly of note is Fiona Dourif, who continues to play Nica to perfection and has made her possibly the most likable lead of the series. She truly is a remarkable actress, and I hope to see her get more recognition in the future. It's also great fun to hear our friend-till-the-end Brad Dourif once again as the voice of Chucky. He continues to own the role and you can tell from his voice that he's having a blast. And of course, the delightful scenery-chewing Jennifer Tilly is back once again and with some more screen-time to boot. Tilly has added a lot to the franchise, so she's always a big plus for me.Unfortunately, I can't help but admit the flaws here, and they do bring the movie down a few pegs. The budget is noticeably low, and the movie does at times have a sort-of cheap feeling to it that can take you out of the film. They're trying to do so much with so little, and it doesn't always work. The first act is a huge drag following a rather brilliant opening, and it feels very patchy and thrown together in comparison to the better- structured ""Curse."" And yeah... the movie does rely a bit too much on the old tropes and clichés, particularly early on. It makes the first half- hour or so a chore to sit through. Thankfully, by the midway point, it course-corrects, and the rest of the film is pure horror bliss.""Cult of Chucky"" might not quite be the breath of fresh air that its immediate predecessor was... but it's a very slick and entertaining follow-up that should please most longtime series fans and leave you wanting more. I'm gonna give it a pretty good 7 out of 10 as a fan of the series, and I would definitely recommend giving it a shot with an open mind. It's not perfect... but it's incredibly enjoyable.",Cult of Chucky
34,arungeorge13,The final act is the redeemer! [+44%],4,2 October 2017,"'Cult of Chucky' is definitely not the worst in the series but it doesn't reap maximum benefits from those deranged new ideas that writer/director Don Mancini comes up with. Chucky can now implant his soul into different dolls / individuals thereby upping the terror quotient, yet the film reveals its true intentions only when it gets to the final act.Almost the entire movie takes place at the mental institution that Nica (Fiona Dourif) is put in - it's an uncanny ambiance, although never really put to good use. The characters of the fellow patients and orderlies suffer from bad writing and second-tier acting, while the perverted Dr. Foley who's at the helm of it all, happens to be the worst of the lot. The storytelling style of Mancini is pretty straight-forward and devoid of many surprises. He resorts to practical effects over CGI - which is a mix of good (because it still carries the vibe of the late 80s) and shoddy (because it looks cheap as hell and totally befits a TV movie) - the gory scenes towards the climax are well- crafted and should please splatter-fans.The Chucky movies were never high on atmosphere and this is the case with 'Cult of Chucky' as well. The engagement factor is certainly higher when Chucky speaks. Placing Chucky in a ward filled with mentally unstable individuals gives rise to hilarious exchanges (between the killer-doll and the inmates). Mancini tries to convey the fact that even Chucky has got a sense of humor (although an awkward, offensive one). The screenplay sensibilities still seem to be stuck in the 80s - the most obvious (and gory) murders are adjudged ""suicides"" or ""accidents"" by the supposedly sane doctor and his aides; another scene where Andy Barclay wants to obtain access to the doctor / Nica but a cop denies him - so what does he do? He smacks the cop right in the face, and immediately, he's arrested and locked up in a room (laughed hard for this one!).Then again, the question stands - if Chucky can gain control over people by chanting a 3-word mantra, why does he take so long to slay everyone? The answer to this lies in the hideously bloody final act when the film embraces its gruesome roots. I'd have liked a few more red herrings on Chucky's newfound ability, along with what he intends to do next. 'Cult of Chucky' felt like mere gap-filler for most part, until it managed to slightly redeem itself during the climactic showdown.Verdict: Liked a few things, hated a lot of things!",Cult of Chucky

I was kinda disappointed with 'Curse of Chucky' a few years ago, because it was such a slow burner, but it has grown on me since. Now we have Cult, the 7th film in the series. I was not disappointed with it. I truly enjoyed it. Very intriguing, great references to the previous movies, lots of new twists and turns and a great open ending to more Chucky films. This review may contain spoilers, but I'll try to be careful! I'm so happy that Alex Vincent has returned to the series as Andy Barclay, the original survivor of the Child's Play series. When I was a kid, I had always wondered what became of him. I finally have my answer! Fiona Dourif is back as Nica, the survivor of the last film. This time, she is locked away in a mental institution. Since Chucky has completion anxiety, he goes to the asylum and tries to finish the job. Four years have passed since the last film. Now, Chucky is back again and dealing with the colorful inmates of the asylum like Carlos the Orderly Dr. Foley, Nica's doctor who convinces her that she was the murderer all along. Malcolm, the patient with multiple personalities. Angela, an old lady who thinks she's a ghost and Madeleine, a disturbed patient who thinks Chucky is her long lost baby. Andy Barclay rushes to the rescue and tries to kill Chucky once and for all time. Will he be successful? Check the movie out. Out of all the Chucky films, this is the most visually beautiful with great cinematography. This'll be great to watch, now that it's October and almost Halloween! I highly recommend CULT OF CHUCKY!!!",Cult of Chucky
36,IonicBreezeMachine,A very busy but still entertaining entry in the Child's Play/Chucky franchise that continues with the strength of its predecessor.,6,23 October 2021,"After the events of Curse of Chucky, Nica Pierce (Fiona Dourif) has spent the past four years in an institution for the criminally insane where it's been drilled into her mind by Dr. Foley (Michael Therriault) that she suffered a psychotic break and was responsible for the killings which she'd claimed Chucky (Brad Dourif) committed. Nica in recognition of her progress is being transferred to a medium security facility, Harrogate, to continue her treatment in group therapy with other disturbed individuals. Nica's progress is interrupted with the arrival of Tiffany Valentine (Jennifer Tilly) the legal guardian of Nica's niece Alice who informs Nica Alice has died leaving only the Chucky doll. With the dolls arrival, deaths once again start occurring. Meanwhile, Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) still in possession of Chukcy's still living severed head continues his attempts at thwarting Chucky's evil.Following the success of Curse of Chucky series writer Don Mancini and producer David Kirschner announced their intent to produce a seventh entry in the series utilizing the ""multiple Chuckies"" concept that had been toyed with for Child's Play 3 before being scrapped for budgetary reasons. Mancini once again returns to write and direct having spent intervening time between series entries working on TV horror series Hannibal and Channel Zero and that refinement in craft really comes through with the movie's style and atmosphere drawing you in, despite a very busy and cluttered narrative.Mancini once again brings that same style and flair he brought to Curse of Chucky, but where Curse was very evocative of Manor/Mansion set horror, Cult of Chucky is more evocative of Insane Asylum set horror films like Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors or Hellraiser II: Hellbound. The movie's setting at Harrogate psychiatric hospital is nicely labyrinthian and eerily empty with overly sterile hallways that feel very confining surrounded by flat, desolate, and uninviting snowscapes. The performances are really strong for the most part with Fiona Dourif once again playing a sympathetic lead who makes a strong emotional core amidst all the literal and figurative insanity as she's blamed for murders we know she didn't commit but even she's beginning to doubt herself. Michael Therriault is also despicably good as secondary antagonist Dr. Foley who at first seems like a benevolent caretaker only to reveal his less than noble intentions as the veneer is peeled away.The other actors in the group are decent even if they're basically playing ""types"" because of the limited run time with the exception of Adam Hurtig as ""multiple"" Malcolm so named because of his Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). Hurtig isn't entirely to blame as the character and the movie's understanding of MPD are very antiquated to put it mildly. Malcolm's MPD manifests in such a way that his ""personalities"" are all based on real life people like Mark Zuckerberg or Michael Phelps and while I know little about MPD this seems less like actual MPD and more like a ""serious"" version of Dan Akyroyd's version of it from the 1990 movie Loose Cannons. The movie also feels like it's juggling a lot of elements with Dr. Foley's lecherous leanings, Fiona questioning her sanity, one of the other patients forming a maternal bond with one of the Good Guy dolls, Andy Barclay's workings against Chucky, and of course returning character Tiffany Valentine/Jennifer Tilly. As you can surmise from that heavily abridged layout of major points in the film, there is A LOT going on here to the point it can get a little overwhelming. These are really good ideas and Mancini is certainly going in creative directions to keep the series fresh and interesting but with how cluttered this movie is, it's probably for the best the series moved into television with the next entry with the TV series Chucky so it had more room to let its ideas breathe.Cult of Chucky continues with the goodwill form Curse of Chucky, but admittedly feels a bit overstuffed with too many elements. While still enjoyable and watchable thanks to a mostly strong cast, good design work, and creative usage of the ""multiple Chuckies"" gimmick, the movie will satisfy the appetites of the series fanbase and then some with a yet another series entry that walks that line between silly and scary.",Cult of Chucky
37,Fernando-Rodrigues,There's a freaking sematery behind that mental hospital?? why??,4,4 February 2021,"This one doesn't make sense at all and is weak (although it has one of the most beautiful death scenes I've ever seen on this franchise- yea, I'm talking about Claire's-). I think the theory I presented on Child's Play 3 review was true but ignored in the sequels: the tank on the factory, in the beginning, produced a lotta murderous Good Guys with Chucky's blood. But it just doesn't feel right, it's not even explained how so many dolls show up there. The ambiance here is crappy, as the actings.",Cult of Chucky

True: The script is incredible. Not perfect? Of course. But the characters are mostly awesome, contrary of what is usually used on horror movies (Child's Play 3).

39,phanthinga,More Chucky more fun,8,14 October 2017,After Don Mancini brought back the Child's Play franchise with Curse of Chucky with a more serious tone Cult of Chucky finally here to terror the horror cinema with more questions than answers.This movie feels very different than the rest of the franchise and i like it.It more stylish but also more slower when it come to the kills.The acting is very good in my opinion when we know more about Nica and the return of the original survivor Andy Barclay.There many beautiful shot and interesting conversation with each mental illness patient cause the movie took place in a asylum.Chucky still snappy and crazy as ever now with his new spell that can create multiple copy of himself so the future of this franchise is pretty exciting.Don't pirate the movie go to see it or buy it when it release on Blu-ray,Cult of Chucky
40,fernandoschiavi,"Cult of Chucky is violent, trash but its narrative is far from the classic Child's Play was, and worse is there will likely be more unnecessary sequels",5,11 July 2021,"The film presents itself with the obvious technical innovation and modernized approach to the horror brought about by the killer doll. There are no more frights as free as in older movies, although here the fidelity of the deaths takes on a greater weight within the confines of the psychiatric hospital for insane criminals. The construction of the narrative within the second and almost inhospitable location credits the film with its effortless slice of terror. Though unlike the other films, where Chucky literally manages to achieve an extremely sinister symbiosis with the cramped residential environments and rooms, here he is declared to be just another passerby through the many corridors and doors of the dimly lit hospital. The tiny staff is enough to create a clear expectation of isolation as the killer engages his homicide session.The great insight of Cult of Chucky was the new direction taken by Don Mancini so that Chucky continues to terrorize in future films, returning to something that had been lost amidst the humorous tendencies of before. The terribly possessed doll has discovered a new ritual in which it manages to split its soul into several different bodies. The cult is indeed shown as a way for Charles Lee Ray to be ""eternal"" in this world. So Chucky will be able to follow his diabolical plans in several different bodies (mostly Good Guys dolls). From there, countless Chucky dolls appear and you will never know for sure if they are alive or not.This sequence returns to invest in a more serious tone, despite not leaving aside the acid humor of the main character. Chucky is more fun than ever, and has a lot more lines than in the previous movie. The doll's visual and practical effects are very good, especially from the early scenes where he interacts with Andy. This is also by far the most violent movie in the franchise; extremely brutal and gore-filled deaths, scaring even Chucky himself, as he says in a certain scene. The script makes good use of its premise, blending reality and fantasy, including nightmare sequences, that will make the audience wonder if what's happening is really real or not.The idea here is to make a crossover between the stories of Nica, the only survivor of the massacre in the previous film, and Andy, the child protagonist of the original trilogy who is now an adult seeking revenge for his lost youth, all in the most serious possible atmosphere. If the sense of continuity with the connections proposed in the joining of these stories already seemed forced, its derivation only demonstrates how much Chucky's classic voodoo mysticism no longer works. Because he reaches his maximum in this movie, which re-establishes rules in a completely random way only to provide a free and pleasant slaughter to the nostalgic ""fan"" of the franchise. After all, the more dolls the better, right? If the damage is already great with one, imagine with four? Sounds cool for fans. The various versions of the doll with minor behavioral variations help create (believe it or not) good dialogue for comic relief from the script. The seriousness well brought by Nica's performance even opens up the possibility of the plot rescuing a suspense long lost in graduality since the doll's first films. Anyone who follows the saga from the beginning or marathon at once comes to understand that while the style was lost to reinvent itself, it was also destroyed in order to recreate itself. It didn't take long for the knife itself, nostalgic as it is, to disappear within the possibilities that arose.In addition, this film approaches some very complex and delicate themes without the slightest tact, and even with a good dose of prejudice. Let's have a quick list: sexual abuse, infanticide, child abuse, medical maltreatment and prejudice against the mentally ill. When I say that the script addresses these themes, I'm not saying I'm discussing them or using them to build horror. They're just thrown there to shock and offend some people. Also, this is one of those movies that had no internal coherence or minimal coherence with the real world. Does a psychologist really believe that making a woman who is trying to get over the loss of her child hold a toy and pretend it is her child is a good idea? An entire hospital has only one doctor and two nurses. The most bizarre thing is that the film as a whole takes itself very seriously and loses all the bizarre black humor that exists in other films.Added to this is the fact that doctors discuss crimes with psychiatric patients, several dolls start arriving at the hospital and no one finds it strange, a famous murderess enters the hospital claiming to be a child's guardian and delivers evidence of a crime to the accused person. Of such a crime, a man who beats a policeman at the door of an asylum and is hospitalized with mental problems because of such a punch. Nothing makes sense. A hospital where many deaths happen and nobody does anything. Several Chuckys start to appear and there is still a side story with one of the old characters, from the previous movies, who became a kind of killer doll hunter. The premise of this movie franchise was never neat or something that required complexity, but it never took itself seriously, and some movies were blatantly comedies, which smoothed out the weirdness.With measured digital effects, Cult of Chucky explores the doll's creativity in violent acts, betting on dismemberment and some careful doses of blood, but with nothing that hasn't been seen before. In fact, what is new are some off-screen deaths, going against the character's visceral trajectory. Despite the positive points being of great prominence, Cult of Chucky still lacks in some points. In some important scenes the synchrony of the animatronics with the voice of actor Brad Dourif (who gives voice to Chucky) fails absurdly. Another detail that takes some of the shine off the production is the weak supporting cast. Some actors perform so poorly in important scenes that they are a little embarrassing.But that doesn't make the script less confusing and with characters with little development, in fact, they are too many characters for the plot and they weren't able to put them properly. Don Mancini's direction is rushed and before the scene being shown can be developed, he jumps to another scene that follows, making it impossible for the viewer to immerse themselves in the story. The death scenes are quite creative, although they don't make any sense. The script still tries to somehow deceive this new gift of Charles Lee Ray to be able to share his soul with more ""Good Guys"", taking advantage of the asylum to try to apologize in a speech that ""everyone is crazy"", taking advantage of the fact that the real Chucky is imprisoned with Andy in another context, but it doesn't work because it's already clear that the other two dolls are alive. It doesn't surprise anyone because the scenario itself is a narrative facilitation in itself, any death that happens there will be treated as a suicide or an accident, and whoever accuses the doll of being the culprit will be tied up by madness. Thus, the killing rolls loose, without scruples and without budget too, for the first time entering in half-finished digital effects in the beheadings and various mutilations that occurred in the caricatured victims without charisma and ""stupefied"".The third act is so absurd that it looks like it was written by a second person who hasn't read the first and second parts of the film. Worst of all, they are accidental nonsense funny. The movie still manages to be boring, even with a small army of murderous dolls loose in the asylum. And his revenge plan ends up sounding silly, not being justified in the final sequence, which already opens the door to a sequel, something that was never very common in the franchise. With this new approach to the doll, the game definitely loses its fun and weakens the mystery that involved a villain who had to act through the dark corners of the environments to reach his victims.Besides, the main attraction, which is the crossover between the two characters in search of rematch, never occurs or creates a growing sense due to the mess in the organization of the nuclei in the edition. When the moment finally arrives, towards the last few minutes, it simply doesn't get carried away by the tacky, illogical and inconclusive anticlimax, just leaving more loose ends to tie into a ""new trilogy ending"" that will never happen. This is just not the worst part of the franchise because it has an unintentionally fun moment or two, but it's pretty clear that the franchise after here needed to let go of its creator to go further.Whether for remembrance or curiosity, Cult of Chucky is a good final entertainment for any good connoisseur of contemporary slasher who doesn't take his feet off the carefree cinema of its golden age. The usual length of the film is not broken and the death toll remains high. Forget the many dolls in this new movie. The violent portrait here comes from the margins of shocking, not exactly from the gratuitous bloodbath inherited from other works. Dragged, tiring and repetitive from half to end. What went well until the discovery of multiple Chuckys becomes a catastrophe and throws in the trash everything he built. It's not enough to make a movie with just a different story, they want to add new elements thinking about future sequels. Cult of Chucky is far from the classic Child's Play was, and worse is there will likely be more unnecessary sequels.",Cult of Chucky

How is it even possible?OK now let's talk about Cult. Some interesting ideas, nice surroundings, goodish actors better and darker execution and a very nice work from Fiona Dourif. Jennifer Tilly, I could live without as she is a point starter from where the absurd was inducted into the new series. Overall a 5, close to 6 but some more work was necessary if so.

44,kjproulx,A Fun Instalment For Fans Of The Franchise,8,16 October 2017,"The Child's Play franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine, due to the fact that most of the sequels are complete rubbish, with a couple exceptions. Back in 2013 when this franchise was revitalized with Curse of Chucky, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed that film. Now, Cult of Chucky has hit the shelves and I must state something that I didn't expect when going into this film. This is one of the best films this franchise has ever released. Obviously nothing will be able to touch the simplistic, yet special world that the original film created, but this may just be the best sequel yet. Written and directed by Don Mancini, who has written every film since the very beginning back in 1988, it has been very clear that he enjoys having these films take place throughout very limited space. Whether in an apartment, a house, or a toy factory, these movies have always felt very self- contained, which I can definitely appreciate. This time around, Cult of Chucky takes place entirely at an insane asylum, where previous, as well as new victims linger. Playing with the audiences mind as to whether or not this doll has just been a hallucination all along, I found myself engaged the entire way through, which is far more than any of the other sequels have done for me. With the help of old friends, this movie seems to truly bring the franchise full circle, which was nice to see. If you've never seen this franchise before, I can guarantee that this film won't do much for you, and if you've seen it and didn't enjoy it in the past, then this one won't be the one to win you over either. This is a solid little horror flick that's elevated by past characters and events, so it really is a franchise piece. I'm stating these things, because those who thoroughly enjoy these movies know that they shouldn't be taking them too seriously. Yes, there are some genuinely terrifying moments of gore throughout Cult of Chucky, but the fact that he's a fowl-mouthed doll is just meant to be charming and entertaining, just in a gruesome way. When watching this film, it gives you a sense that there will sill be more films to come throughout the years, due to to its open ending and need to throw in new-age pop-culture references in order to warrant its return. That being said, some of the forced pop-culture references feel out of place and lead to some pretty terrible dialogue in an otherwise well-planned film. This is where by biggest flaw with the film comes into play. I actually thought that the overall plot of this film was terrific, as far as this franchise goes, but some of the dialogue really had me cringing, and that's not good, because I couldn't tell if they were trying to go for something comedic or genuinely serious.In the end, Cult of Chucky is honestly a far better film than it has any right to be after all these years, but if you sit through all of its predecessors before viewing it, then I believe you'll be pleasantly surprised like I was. This movie isn't going to win anyone over who hasn't been along for the ride in the past, but this is some solid horror flare that demands some attention around this time of the year. Now available for rent and streaming, I highly recommend this film if you're a fan of the genre. Newcomers need to be weary of the tone that these movies go for.",Cult of Chucky
45,acidburn-10,Love or Hate It?,7,30 April 2021,"Well I must say that its always nice to have a new Chucky movie & even as even after 30+ years the director Don Mancini still clearly has a love for this character & always thinks of new & inventive settings and part 7 is no exception as this latest instalment shakes things up rather nicely, adding so many twists & turns in the 2nd half, while the first half was a lot more subdued, thanks to its location of a psych ward, with sets that are sparce & eerie with a clinical, clean-looking aesthetic that immediately stands out from the rest While the movie's budget wasn't very big (this was the 2nd to go start to DVD), Mancini still makes the most of the limited resources & setting.Fiona Dourif is yet again awesome as Nica, proving to be an excellent foe to Chucky, as her character grows stronger & to the next level by the movie's end. It was also nice to have the original Andy Barclay back with Alex Vincent reprising the role for the first time since Pt 2 & has become the kind of man you'd expect, he's a grown man ready to take care of himself & accept the fact that Chucky will always be a part of his life. Brad Douriff once again gives a splendid performance as the voice of Chucky as well as an amazing cameo from Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany.The morbid unsettling atmosphere of the first half was very intriguing, but once things get revealed, things get ridiculous quickly, with some cool death scenes one of which has a slight nod to one of the previous sequels & plus love how this tie in all the past sequels together, & while many fans will either love this entry or hate it, personally I find this as one of the strongest entries in this long running series.",Cult of Chucky
46,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Sometimes I scare myself""",7,27 May 2020,"The Child's Play franchise has always been one of my favourites in the horror/slasher genre since I first saw Child's Play on VHS as kid in the 90s over the years the franchise and Chucky have come so far and have changed in so many ways from a terrifying first movie about a killer doll to Chucky getting married, having a kid and then going full circle and becoming scary again trying to kill his original best friend Andy and while there have been some good and bad moments in the franchise over the past thirty three years Cult of Chucky is the perfect balance of dark, twisted comedy mixed with blood, guts and more than one Chucky to be afraid of.Reading the reviews for the movie a lot of people didn't seem to enjoy Cult of Chucky claiming it broke the rules of the series, changed things to much or they simply didn't like the multiple Chuckys storyline. I honestly never thought about a Chucky movie with multiple Chuckys running around mainly because one is scary enough but I'm glad we got a movie that expands on the ideas and characters taking them in different and new directions instead of sticking to same formula over and over again like every other popular horror movie franchise has done since the 80s and while this movie does change the rules of the franchise quite a bit by having multiple Chuckys it's also a nice change of pace and opens up new story ideas and we get to see everyone's nightmare come true a whole cult of Chuckys running around.The movie is a little slow with it's build up and we don't get any real on screen Chucky moments until about half way through the movie but the suspence and character developments are interesting and different to what we've seen before in Chucky movies and when we finally do get the see Chucky kill we are treated to some of the best kills in the franchise since Chucky killed John Ritters character in Bride of Chucky so it's more than worth the wait.The different camera angles used in this movie are interesting and are very different from the other movies in the franchise using overhead shots of Chucky really makes watching him move around a room really creepy there's also some close up on Chuckys face that are creepy much like the original we see the innocent side of the Chucky doll then when we see him move just his eyes we know he is pure evil.I highly recommend watching this movie especially if your a Chucky fan or just a fan of horror/slasher movies with dark comedy elements in them don't listen to the bad reviews this is a way better horror/slasher movie than the 2019 Child's Play remake and is better than most modern day horror movies.",Cult of Chucky
47,TalesfromTheCryptfan,"Hands down the WORST CHUCKY MOVIE EVER, the death of the franchise!",1,14 November 2017,"5 years after the events of ""Curse of Chucky"", Nica (Fiona Douriff) has been committed to a mental institute after being framed for murder she didn't commit and blamed it on Chucky (voiced by Brad Douriff). Andy (Alex Vincent) who is 35 years old living on his own in a cabin in the forest miles away from the big city where he had a date but then she turns him down due to finding out his history. He has the head of Chucky which is still alive/moving after 5 years which also talks as he likes to torture it even have fun with it especially in sharing smoking joints with it. Dr. Foley (Michael Therriault) is trying to help with Nica cope with her problems and so called ""delusions"" about Chucky as they just received some packages of Chucky dolls as now Chucky discovers after searching on a website on voodoo that he has the power to copy his soul into other dolls even in other living humans to do his bidding to make a ""cult"" with the help of his girlfriend Tiffany (played by Jennifer Tilly once again) as only Andy can stop this cult.AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER OF A FILM AND SEQUEL! Don Mancini, what in the flying hell were you thinking writing and directing this horrid piece of total crap sequel? you should be ashamed of yourself as you are destroying this franchise. The movie's title is a sham as there is no ""cult"", just clones of Chucky as each of the new Chucky dolls have new personality to them when it should be about an actual cult of Charles Lee Ray fans who learns from Tiffany about transferring souls into dolls to join in this army to bring Charles Lee ray into a new Chucky doll and have Andy with Kyle to battle them for one last time would had been a great idea and better than this travesty of a film. Another direct to video made piece of junk from Universal and this movie is total proof the co-creator of Child's Play when Tom Holland should be the one who needs credit that Don Mancini is a clueless and worthless hack of a filmmaker and writer.Such dumb lines like when one of the patients tied to a gurney as Chucky holds a little tank of compressed air then reads it saying ""Compressed...do you think i know what that means?"", i mean great Mancini you made Chucky a total moron to not think what it means. The story is totally senseless as this movie makes no sense despite Chucky explains how he jumps from body to body in a similar way like in Jason Goes to Hell only he clones his soul, the one part where Dr. Foley gets murdered is a good practical effect but some of the gore/violent shots are poorly edited and all as the editing in this movie is terrible even the use of Ang Lee Hulk split screen in a few parts. Chucky finding a website saying ""Voodoo for Dummies""? i mean Mancini, you fail at writing and that was a dumb thing to say for Chucky to say.Brad sounds tired as hell playing this role and just did it for paycheck even Jennifer Tilly, Alex is okay reprising his role as Andy as he has not acted in a film for a long time. Some of the practical effects like Chucky dolls for example are quite nice but the film is just a senseless pointless mess of a movie as it has a scene where one of the Chuckie's is gonna get buried then Chucky flips off is a sign that this franchise has been screwed and being dead and buried.Don't get me started on that idiotic ending plus the cop out surprise ending with Kyle (Christine Elsie) about to torture Chucky when she should had been in the film all this time to help with Andy. It's as bad as the cop out surprise ending in the end of the last one when it should had been the movie but no, Mancini has to screw it up once again.Let this franchise lay dead and buried and keep Mancini away from this franchise as he is a poor writer and director who thinks he wants to be Artsy but he sucks badly.",Cult of Chucky

49,meydiana-65242,Dull and underwhelming sequel,1,18 October 2020,"For most of ""Cult of Chucky""'s run-time, I was thinking that any fan of the series could have come up with a better movie than this. But then in the last twenty or so minutes, I saw a bit of what the movie should have been for its entire length. Chucky is barely even in it up until these last moments, and there is barely any violence, or attempt to scare.The title ""Cult of Chucky"" seems to imply that the movie features a quasi-religious ""cult"" who worships the killer doll. This is not true, but it would have been interesting. Rather, it features more than one killer Chucky doll, at the end at least. It doesn't do anything with this idea and it hardly seems to matter to the plot. Instead it goes for the whole ""heroine from the last movie is now in an asylum because nobody believes her story"" route. It's pretty underwhelming.Fans of the series might nevertheless be interested in seeing Alex Vincent, the actor who played Andy in the original three Childs' Play movies, returning as an adult. Jennifer Tilly also makes a few appearances, presumably for the sake of tying this movie to ""Bride of Chucky"" and ""Seed of Chucky"" in continuity. She doesn't really do anything here other than appear.Fiona Dourif, daughter of Brad (the voice of Chucky in every entry, including this one), also returns as the protagonist. She's really the bright spot here; her performance is about the only spark of creativity in the whole movie.

He kills people laugh and that's all there is.Except that now Brad Dourif got is daughter Fiona in the act. She is cuit in her own kind of way and i guess its normal that he wanted her to get some acting role, because we have seen her mainly in B horror movies and lets face it most of them where not very good.This Chucky goes on in a mentally ill clinic and once more he kills everyone in it, not to imaginative or original plain and boring lets hope its the last of the Chucky and they will put an end to this franchise.",Cult of Chucky
51,baileycrawly,I Loved It!,9,26 October 2019,"Cult of Chucky is one of those polarizing movies. I happen to be on the positive side of the fence.
Once again, Alex Vincent returns to play Andy Barclay (of course he had a cameo at the end of the previous one, but that's hardly notable). This film has a couple of guest stars that are well known to those familiar with the franchise, which is a real treat for the viewer.
This film is beautiful to look at. The way Don Mancini played with the colouring to make Chucky pop is absolutely phenomenal. And the story, while a continuation from the previous film, is different enough to be much more interesting and engaging for me as a viewer. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The plot had lots of unexpected turns as well. I found it to be great fun!",Cult of Chucky
52,akshatmahajan,Strong continuation,8,1 July 2021,"Cult of Chucky (Child's Play 7) is solid continuation of Curse of Chucky. After seeing DVD collections, I thought it would be disappointing sequel but no, it was a proper continuation with so much new additions. It is totally dark, horror and slasher.Movie is properly made. The concept is executed beautifully. There are plenty of shocks and scares, pretty good acting and lots of violence. The direction and editing work is done beautifully. The pacing is so much good that you might not know when the movie is over. I don't know why company thought not to release Curse and Cult of Chucky in theatres. Both were good movies and should have been given wide release.Overall, this movie is treat for psychological horror and Child's Play fans. You are gonna love it, for sure.",Cult of Chucky
53,Donatien3,A Fittingly Gory End,9,8 January 2021,"After losing its way with a couple of meta horror-comedies in the late 1990s, 2013s ""Curse of Chucky"" brought the ""Child's Play"" series back to its more serious horror roots.""Cult of Chucky"" is a direct sequel to ""Curse"", and brings the series full circle with a grown-up Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) having a prominent role. After the events of ""Cult"", Nica (Fiona Dourif) is locked in a psychiatric hospital. But that doesn't stop Chucky (Brad Dourif) coming back to have some fun.The film really kicks into gear towards the end, with multiple Chuckys, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) returning, and Nica possessed by Charles Lee Ray's spirit.While ""Curse"" was a slow burner, ""Cult"" amps up the gore: it's arguably the goriest ""Child's Play"" film since the original trilogy. Right from the start, Andy tortures Chucky's severed - and partly blown away - head with a blowtorch. The body count rises when Chucky gets into the psychiatric hospital: there's a lot of gore, jump scares, and creative kills: one hospital employee is simultaneously killed by three Chuckys - by scalpel, power drill, and a broken bottle; a patient is beheaded by falling glass shards from a ceiling; while another patient has her throat ripped out by Chucky, with Chucky's arm stuffed into her mouth to make it look like a suicide.It's not all bleak, as there's a couple of meta gags, including Nica mistaking Tiffany for Tilly and one of the Chucky's bemoaning the end of the ""Hannibal"" TV series.With ""Child's Play"" receiving a reboot recently, ""Cult"" is the end of the current film franchise, though some of the storylines will continue in an upcoming TV series.",Cult of Chucky

 in my opinion the original trilogy, curse and bride of chucky were great films.
 seed was the worst and cult of chucky was somewhere in the middle.
 It had it's moments....good laughs and finally a plot twist with chucky finding new ways to explore terror......(no spoilers)
 Andy barckley is back and we have a huge surprise as u will never guess who is returning also in the post credit scene. tilly as always is GORGEOUS soundtrack enjoyable and u will be pleased from the film excluding parts which were silly and idiotic. unfortunately some things did not made sense and the kills were not all great stuff. this will be the final chucky film (for now) but we will get a new chucky tv series soon with season 1 consisting of 8 episodes following the events of cult of chucky.

56,zac-04879,Massive Killer-Doll Fans Might get a Kick,5,30 October 2021,"Cult of Chucky's blood and guts might appeal to someone who's looking for a mindlessly foolish slasher movie. It was completely and utterly obvious that the seventh instalment to the Chucky franchise was going to be a load of dreary 'entertainment', but wow, it's main theme is a total flaw.The most previous Chucky movie before this one, Curse of Chucky, was at least fairly entertaining and seemed to ditch the crass comedy genre. Although Cult of Chucky doesn't approach the comedic aspect again, it's a pretty flat execution with a bland plot. The first half of the film fetched the classic friendly-doll-goes-psycho theme, but unfolds in an ignorant manner.Again, don't expect decent characters or award-worthy performances, because the complete opposite is portrayed here. What you can surely expect, especially if you've loved all of Chucky's tales, is a familiar blend of previous silliness and the good old psychological aspect. It's not an entire fail. The story still had the chance to at least avoid an unexciting closing.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Cult of Chucky

I loved the originals, and i think curse of Chucky returned to what i like about them, and this follows on nicely from that.Yes its stupid, some jokes just don't come close to whatever mark they were going for, but isn't that the point? I think where curse of Chucky went back to it's routs to get back on track this movie does offer something different yet keep the same feel of a Chucky movie.Cheesy lines, Chucky dolls, scatter of footsteps, strange deaths, and of course knives. You already know if you'll like this or not",Cult of Chucky
58,MonsterVision99,Does not disappoint.,6,31 October 2017,"I like all the Chucky films, all of them are enjoyable, some of them are better made than others, but all of them turned out to be entertaining. ""Cult of Chucky"" its another pleasing sequel, in many cases movie sequels made after a long time tend to ignore many of the sequels that came after the original, but the Chucky series always respected its continuity and I love that.You can say that this movie tries too hard to please its crowd, by adding all these cameos and elements horror fans like, like gore or cheesy one liners form the killer but I will say that most of this movie works pretty well despite having a few flaws. Almost all of the comedy falls flat I believe that's intentional, but many ""humorous"" lines were really predictable and not creative at all, as a matter in fact, this sequel isn't very original, it takes place in an Asylum, a place we have seen in many horror sequels (like Elm Street 3) but I will say that, while not innovative, ""Cult of Chucky"" is fun to watch. I cant wait to see where the series is heading.",Cult of Chucky

Meanwhile, the killer doll has some scores to settle with his old enemies, with the help of his former wife.The film has a couple of interesting set pieces but fails on almost every level to make sense. The graphic violence is a way to juice up a limited story. The director over saturation of white makes this movie at times very annoying.

There's nothing cult like about the mere 3 people in this movie, what so ever! I was really looking forward to this movie and seeing an actual cult of chucky, and after watching it I am so confounded as to why they would name it that. It is simply about 3 people in a psych ward who have been effected by chucky, thats it. And the movie is so uneventful, barely anything actually happens in it. It's one of those complete wastes of time that you spend watching and just waiting for things to happen but they never do. I don't know why this movie was ever made. It's got no story, horrible writing, a bunch of unknown actors who can barely act, and worst of all it takes one of the greatest horror movie characters of all time and it turns him into something boring and stupid. He barely even appears in the movie! If you like the chucky movies like I do, do your self a favor and don't watch this, it will just frustrate you.",Cult of Chucky
61,FKDZ,Much better. Great follow up to Curse of Chucky,6,2 October 2020,"Curse of Chucky was a huge let down to me, from doll design to the kills, slow pace, and many fake-outs. But Cult of Chucky does none of this and improves it tremendously.Let's start off with the good. The acting in this movie is great, a notch above the previous and most of the actors gives good performances with a great one by Fiona Dourif again. The characters actually have some interesting backstory/depth and its used later on in the movie in some creative ways. Most of the characters I found interesting and compelling.The writing was great as well, this movie does a decent job at keeping you guessing and pretty confused until the obvious answer reveals itself: that chucky can just become anything he wants. This does kinda...feel like a cop out. Because from Seed of Chucky we build up this ''lore'' that they can have kids. But I guess they wanted to have cloned Chucky's instead of different characters. I do remember the director planning that concept for one of the older movies, but budget didn't allow it. So here it is. Honestly to me, the concept of being able to possess anything is a bit cheap, and I definitely favor the SoC way. Though.. I did love seeing the multiple chucky's as confusing as it was.Malcolm's character was great as well, with you the viewer thinking chucky possessed him during the graveyard scene, but in actuality he was just impersonating Charles and even going as far as killing the nurse. I was kind of already guessing this was the case, but initially I was convinced he was possessed.The setting and whole asylum thing was pretty bad, honestly this is the most unrealistic depiction of a asylum I've ever seen. And I just couldn't take it seriously. It looked more like some weird assisted living center. The aesthetics though of the whole building and interior was great. It really differentiated itself from the other movies.Now the kills, boy did they turn them up to 11. They were incredibly gruesome and visceral. And the special+practical effects were really good. There are really some cringeworthy (in a good way) scenes in this one that the other movies don't have too much. Also combined with the kills was some great directing, this movie in general has solid directing which was nice.Now about Chucky, I feel like it's pretty much 99% there of how he needs to look. The fact that they finally have achieved it t make the static doll looks the same as the animated chucky is fantastic. When the doll became Chucky in the previous movies, you could always tell because it had a different head. Here you simply can't. But the franchise is so far ahead, that you can't really use that suspense anymore so it doesn't get used as effectively. Still, I will always favor the anger and visceral look chucky had in the original trilogy, nothing has beat that look.Also continuing that, the humor and comedy writing in this movie is lessened a lot sadly. Something that drew me from the very first movie. It could be that maybe I just got used to it. But I still had a great time with SoC so I hoped this one would have had a little extra here and there. But its not as lackluster as Curse of Chucky for sure.The ending is odd, it basically ends with Chucky winning when he possessed Nica, and here acting as Chucky was a little iffy but maybe it was just me, or perhaps it's just really hard to pull it off because she doesn't really have that voice for chucky. And Andy, loses in the end? Although we're not sure I guess but we're supposed to assume he gets arrested and maybe go to prison. It really feels like this franchise needs a sequel to finally wrap things up. But with Chucky being able to possess anything, he could literally be all over the world. So you can't kill it.The movie also has an after credit where we get to see Kyle which is cool.. but she's just gonna torture *one of* the Chucky's. So it doesn't really feel like revenge/payback.All in all, after having seen the entire original franchise I can say I enjoyed almost all of them. This one gets a 6/10 and I wouldn't hate to see it again. I can really appreciate that this franchise tried to really keep it all together. In retrospect is sloppy yeah, but considering other slashers (like F13, Halloween) and their awful continuity chucky does it pretty well.So yeah, I'd recommend this franchise, you can skip the poor ones but they do hold some plot that won't be explained later so its better to watch them all.",Cult of Chucky
62,utahman1971,Awesome Sequel!,10,5 October 2017,"Man, I am tired of reading stupid reviews, that just people are not all there. The one that says the title, and then they were confused that there is no cult. What The? How could you not see the many dolls that look a like except one with a weird hairdo?Come on, those dolls were brought to life from Tiffany, to have chucky soul in each of them. Like multiplicity but the cult was the extra dolls following chucky's killings in the first place. Did you see the same movie as us? Not that hard to figure out.Some people are just not there or are but not trying hard enough. Not trying to be totally rude, but jeez, there are just some people that make you wonder what is wrong with them. There is also at the end where there is Tiffany as a human and the doll in back seat as possessed Tiffany doll.Cult is a following of what is being done. That is what is happening in this movie. The extra dolls are following chucky in killing people. Not that hard to figure out why it is titled ""The Cult Of Chucky."" I say that this is gory but not as gory as they claim.I watched the unrated, and it just seems to be pretty tame for an unrated. Most unrated are not much more than the R anyways. There are a few that promise the unrated over the top. Hellraiser 1 & 2, Dead Alive, The Midnight Meat Train, and more.Tame on the comedy jokes from Chucky. Never expected the outcome on the end of this one. Always, on this series is a left to hint there is another to come. There is the remake supposedly going to be made too. I watch them all. I like remakes, just to see what it is like, bad or good.I am a horror fanatic, and that just not mean a lot of PG-13 ones. Those are not considered enough to be a horror movie to me. They are cut from the real horror that should be in a horror movie. We need a massive bring back of unrated and R rated horror movies.I will always go for the unrated over the top gore over the R, and no PG-13 horror, will ever get my attention like them. If you are a fan and love this, then that is good, but if you are a fan, and can't stand it and disappointed, then something is wrong with you.People that get irritated with gore and rather have a tamed PG-13 horror, then better ever, never meet me in this world.

Always cool when stuff like that happens.Overall, I'd say ""Cult of Chucky"" is worth a watch, if you're not too much of a purist regarding the original trilogy's tone.One star removed for moronic leftist cuck propaganda in the scene where a male nurse tells us his ""husband"" has MS. Typically irrelevant to the plot and presented as nonchalantly as possible, the subtle messages to the already cucked out and brainwashed masses being, ""Don't even blink. This is normal.""

65,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,6,17 September 2017,"Cult Of Chucky follows just after Curse of Chucky. Nica (Fiona Dourif)is sent to a mental asylum after supposedly killing her whole family and friends. It isn't long before Chucky follows her and his trial of dead bodies begin to show! There are good and bad points in regards to this movie. Let's get the bad bits over and done with first: Bad Points: 1. Jennifer Tilly is looking too old to play Tiffany, and in some scenes it didn't even look like she was trying to act.2. The acting was pretty bad by everyone involved (excluding Alex Vincent, Fiona Dourif and Brad Dourif who voices Chucky). You just never believe a single word they say and it becomes extremely laughable. Excluding Brad, Alex and Fiona, of course! 3. There was no character development, and very little is accomplished in regards to everything that happens.4. The ending felt so rushed and doesn't really leave you with the feeling on ""oh, yes...I feel that accomplished something...can't wait for more."" 5. The death scenes in some kills looked too fake.Good Points: 1. Having Andy Barclay return was the best thing Don Mancini ever did and seeing him back was an awesome feeling. And the fact that he's having dating/life problems and has been scarred by Chucky. His whole life has been him watching his back wherever he goes.2. There was no CGI in this movie. It was all done by robotic movement. And having 3 Chucky killer dolls in the one room and going around the Asylum killing everyone bit by bit was incredible...problem is it hardly lasted...needed more.3. Fiona Dourif was perfect. She is like her father Brad Dourif...extremely believable and always keeps it realistic. Brad Dourif has more lines in this one and is extremely witty in almost everyone he delivers! All in all it is worth seeing, but only just! So many good things about it, and also so many bad things. Can't say I'm looking forward to the next one, but maybe Mancini can create the perfect Chucky film! Jay- 3/5 stars.",Cult of Chucky
66,Minus_The_Beer,Chuck Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,7,7 October 2017,"The old adage that ""big things come in small packages"" has definitely proved to be true for the ""Child's Play"" films. Somehow, against all odds, this little guy has legs, becoming the most enduring and consistent horror movie franchise in recent memory, spanning and surviving three decades, without retcons or reboots. A big part of that success lies at the feet of writer turned writer- director, Don Mancini, who has been at the helm since the beginning, ensuring consistency throughout each installment. Also along for the ride since the beginning is the indispensable Brad Dourif as killer turned killer-doll, Chucky. Dourif's manic and often hilarious vocal performance combined with Mancini's ""anything goes"" sensibility makes each film a true pleasure to watch. All of that fan-pleasing, funny-bone teasing goodness is back for the seventh film, ""Cult of Chucky.""Picking up where 2013's ""Curse of Chucky"" left off, ""Cult of Chucky"" finds Nica (Fiona Dourif) now committed to a mental institution. Nica has been pummeled by electro-shock therapy into believing she killed her whole family, so it's up to Chucky's original nemesis, Andy (played by a now fully-grown Alex Vincent), to come to her rescue and put childish things away, once and for all. Along the way, he has to contend with Chucky's on-again/off-again lover, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), who has now inhabited the body of Jennifer Tilly. Confused? Well, watch the other movies. Though it's the second film in the series to be sent direct-to- video, the quality has most certainly not dipped with ""Cult of Chucky."" Mancini returns to the director's chair for the third time, and his visual style is very much informed by his time spent working on NBC's short-lived ""Hannibal."" Along for the ride is special effects guy Tony Gardner, who turns in some of his most impressive work to date. The film is riddled with practical effects that are not only convincing, but inspiring. If a DTV sequel can have special effects that put similar theatrical releases to shame, maybe there's hope for the future of the genre after all. On the acting front, Fiona Dourif digs deeper into her character and really seems to relish going slowly mad. The elder Dourif, meanwhile, is as crazy and charming as ever as the voice of everyone's killer doll. Vincent's return to the franchise is definite cause for celebration. His performance is a little wooden, but when you consider he gave up acting some 25 years ago, it's easy to cut him some slack. His presence is enough, as far as this fan is concerned. Speaking of presence, Jennifer Tilly is still an absolute bombshell, and her character feels very lived-in and is now an essential component of the franchise.The film has a few surprises you won't see coming, and you'll definitely want to stay until the very end, friend. Like ""Curse"" before it, ""Cult of Chucky"" plays the fan service game without insulting its audience. There's plenty of fresh ideas stirred among the nostalgia, and Mancini's mythology will probably require an extensive road map going forward. The humor is good, the horror is well-done and the film looks and sounds appropriately cold and crisp (shout out to composer Joe Loduca, of ""Evil Dead"" fame). It's all in good, gory fun. Fans who have made it this far will find this ""Cult"" worthy of worship.",Cult of Chucky

73,johnplocar,Another fun 'Chucky' sequel...,7,24 September 2017,"I'm truly glad that they're still making sequels. Every installment of this series has been, for me anyways, consistently entertaining and has brought something different to the table; this film is no exception. ""Cult of Chucky"" is a fun ride that actually brings a slight psychological edge to its horror. From the beginning it is making the viewer question a little bit what is real and what isn't. Which for a movie that is the seventh installment of a franchise is ballsy, but winds up being pretty cool that they were able to twist things up a bit to where I wasn't 100% sure if Chucky was actually up to his old tricks again or if this was a movie about crazy people effected by the past traumas that Chucky inflicted upon them. Now because it is the movie that it is, I did kinda figure out what was going on, granted not too much longer before it was revealed. Still, I found this to be a fun ride from beginning to end with a great amount of thrills and laughs to be had as with all of these movies thus far.I do have some gripes with the movie; for instance, the character of Andy Barclay has been brought back into this series. Originally I found this to be really awesome and I was excited to see where things go when he's first introduced into the movie. But after a while I honestly almost forgot that he was even in the film because he has nothing to do. It seriously felt as though the writers wrote his segments after the script was finished in order to pad things out because he barely feels that he's actually a part of the main plot going on. Then when he finally does show up more he still doesn't have much of anything to do and it is filmed as if he came in at a later date after the initial production was already over and these were pickup shots they made at another location.Another thing I had a problem with was the third act, namely the ending. No spoilers here, but there was a lot of build up to an end that felt slightly abrupt. I think that may be because they introduce a new and interesting element in the final moments of the film, but we end up not seeing anything really come of that. Also the fact that Andy Barclay's plot thread is entirely dropped with no satisfying conclusion either. Maybe it is simply setup for another sequel, which if so I will say that I am on board because despite all the issues I may have with this movie I still had a great time watching it.One thing that really stood out to me from even the start is that this film is superbly made; I mean that not only with its gore and effects, but also in its cinematography. This is a gorgeous movie to look at from beginning to end. Even in its simplest of shots it is terrifically composed and well lit. Proving once more that Don Mancini knows what he is doing behind the camera. The acting all around works and has plenty of colorful characters to carry this film. Brad Dourif, as always, is perfect in the role of the killer doll Chucky. Plus his daughter, Fiona Dourif, does a great job here as well and proves that she can even command the scene in some parts.If you're a fan of this series then I'd say that this is on par with most of the rest of the series. It has everything you'd want out of a Chucky movie with maybe even a little more sprinkled in. Perfect? No. But still enough of a blast to keep the pace going for 90 minutes quickly. Since we are entering into the Halloween season this makes for a good horror movie to break out and watch. I will say though that if someone is new to the series and you go into this blind, I think you'll be able to make through it okay but I believe it would help if you watched at least a couple of the previous installments. This is a direct sequel to ""Curse of Chucky"" so if you want to skip through watching all 6 prior movies then I'd say just watch ""Curse"" in order to better follow what is going on in ""Cult"".Anyways, I say check it out if you're curious. I believe it's worth the watch.",Cult of Chucky

Don Mancini seems to have a whole carnival planned out for this horror franchise that has become quite popular since debuting back in the late 80's, about a killer doll named Chucky. Don Mancini's latest incarnation ""Cult of Chucky"" is about as batshit crazy as you can imagine but the question is, for being a seventh sequel in the franchise, is it good?It's about, Nica Pierce (Fiona Dourif) who is convinced she is responsible for the murders, not Chucky, that happened to her family four years before. Since the murders, she has been locked up in an insane asylum. When strange occurrences begin happening at the asylum, Nica starts to believe that maybe she is not crazy after all. Chucky soon shows up at the asylum and begins looking for Nica. Meanwhile, Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) believes Nica's innocence because of his past with the killer doll and when he discovers she is in trouble, he races to the asylum to save her.After ""Curse of Chucky"" brought the franchise back to its horror roots and was surprisingly good, it set the bar high for a sequel to continue the story of Nica, the wheelchair-bound woman who learned her family's dark secret when Chucky gave us an exciting revelation that we had been waiting 25 years to learn. So, what can we expect from ""Cult of Chucky?"" It is no surprise that the return of Andy Barcely is the big lead-up to the movie. The last time we saw Andy was back in 1988 when he received Chucky as a birthday gift from his mom, who was unaware that the doll was possessed by a recently gunned down serial killer. Alex Vincent made a cameo appearance as Andy at the end credits of ""Curse of Chucky,"" signaling his return and prompting us all to gasp in delight. Someone appears after the end credits of this picture too but who could it be? I get the feeling I know what Don Mancini is trying to accomplish here.Andy hasn't had much luck since everyone seems to know about his dark past involving the killer doll. He lives in an isolated cabin and keeps a secret hidden in a wall safe. The secret serves as some the comedy of the film. Andy watches a video of him attempting to convince Nica's sleazy doctor by shooting the secret with a paintball gun and making it shriek. Of course, no one believes him...again. See how I am giving hints and making you wonder? That is what this whole film does until the revelation at the end and it can be really frustrating when you're wondering what is going on and who-is-who. However, it might be frustrating but does effectively keep you on the edge. At one point, Nica watches an unstable patent out a window take one of the dolls outside to a snowy graveyard and his face shifts evil and gives her the finger. This makes you wonder what is going on but more so what is Chucky's sinister plan?When Chucky is brought to the asylum by a mysterious person who is just a loony and sinister woman, not to mention she should be in the asylum, he awakens and goes looking for Nica. Now, what they have done with Chucky is amazing. There is a long shot of Chucky walking towards the camera and the focus fades in on him as he gets closer. He walks, talks and acts like a human and this is incredible for a doll that is not CGI but an actual puppet. This is something they have always gotten right and this time, it really is something to watch. Just after that scene, one of the crazies in the hospital comes out of her room and sees Chucky and attempts to tell him that he is not real. She ends up annoying him and he calls her a ""F**king cuckoos nest"" and takes off. He hasn't lost his charm.It is really hard to go into detail without spoiling the film because there are twists and turns, especially as things escalate towards the finale. Actually, I was really surprised at the finale. I was thinking someone else but it turned out to be the one person I never thought it would be. It is very much like ""Curse of Chucky."" Someone is left to take the fall for the murders at the asylum much like Nica took the fall for the murders in the house, but who is left in the asylum? See, those hints again. Chucky descends upon the staff of the hospital with whatever he can get her plastic hands on. I don't think he has ever used a power drill before but he has one now and it's gruesome. A lot of the patients are useless and are just there for Chucky to attack.Don Mancini has created another interesting entry in the franchise and there is plenty on offer here for the fans. I would say that whatever Don has planned for the next installment will be more interesting as this one is very much a build up with a lot going on. After the two revelations at the end, one I don't know what to think because I suppose the loss of innocence plays a part in it and another that breaks new ground and is interesting but I am not sure how Don will play it out. He sets this one up to make you really want to see what happens next and on that note, the film works and is a clever addition to the franchise. I just hope we get to see more than a few scenes with Andy the next time around.",Cult of Chucky
75,darksyde-63508,Best in years,8,9 November 2017,"Now this is more like it.after years of being played as a joke with ""Bride of"" and ""Seed Of Chucky"", they finally made Chucky scary again with ""Curse of Chucky"". I was a little worried when I saw the previews for this entry when I saw that they were bringing Tiffany back, and that she was playing a bigger part again, but thankfully I was wrong. ***spoiler alert**** after opening with a bang with Alex Vincent (the original Andy) and a severed head of a Chucky doll, the movie starts out kind of slowly until about halfway through, but then it picks up once the killing starts, and a few surprises are revealed. Definitely check this out if your a fan of the series.",Cult of Chucky

77,pedroquintaoo,The bad Chucky is back,3,25 September 2017,"The first 2 Child's Play movies were good and then it only received bad films, until 2013 when The Curse of Chucky gave some life to the franchise.I was with high expectations because I liked the previous film, however The Cult of Chucky is really bad like The Seed of Chucky (or even worse). The story is a mess, stupid and boring, the kills are bad and the characters are just uninteresting. However this installment has some good jokes and tries to give some life to this franchise,and the characters of Fiona Dourif and Alex Vincent are fine.In my opinion this movie should start with what we've seen during the ending, that would open an opportunity for a good and interesting story.If there will be a sequel, I hope will be different, more violent, funny without being ridiculous and with good characters.Chucky is back, but we have seen him in better days.Rating: 3.5/10",Cult of Chucky
78,horrorules,"Rating 5,2 for this GREAT movie it's an insult",10,23 November 2017,"81% on rotten, numerous positive reviews from various festivals, critics, fans and of course only 5.2 on IMDb, now a haven of pathetic, frustrated trolls and haters. I saw this movie yesterday, at a theater in Rome at Fantafestival and this movie is a MASTERPIECE. Mancini confirms a great director and screenwriter, film photography is fabulous, the plot is fabulous, violence is at very high levels, it is undoubtedly the most violent and frantic chapter of the franchise, in the film is deepened the psychology of the characters . This is a perfect movie !!! my rating is 10/10 and all the pathetic haters can watch Justice League, Insidious, Crap and Furious and all the scum that's around. CHUCKY IS BACK !!!!!",Cult of Chucky
79,NotASmartCritic,Worst movie i've watched so far..,1,6 January 2019,"Seriously....this is complete garbage, Child's play did so much better than this, this is such a weird movie, who would want to watch crazy mental ill people in the movies, this is freakin weird, and the plot is confusing even jaws did better than this, this is the worst movie i've ever watched",Cult of Chucky
80,multiplayerxgesource,It is becoming too inventive of itself,2,11 March 2020,"Okay so the bottomline here is there is some brilliant writing here however Holland has forgotten why we loved the first film in the first place. The whole idea of an angry soul possessing a doll that stalks us is what made Chucky an icon to begin with. Where this franchise has failed is by using it's own iconicness to destroy it's ability to actually be scary anymore. Chucky used to be a balanced character. Like Freddy Krueger, he has become nothing more than a tool to sell merchandise to fandom than a character that evolves anymore. The end to this movie is honestly DUMB. No one wants Childs Play without the doll. It defeats the entire point of it.",Cult of Chucky
81,pzct,"It's actually a good, solid film!",7,25 April 2020,"This movie isn't bad! It's actually pretty good. I do think however, there are times where they threw me off. With the Big Chucky dream, multiple Chuckys', I gotten the spell online, and all of that. But this movie is a good film. I know some may not like it but I actually do like the movie!",Cult of Chucky
82,jpasols,Watched a few times...Not bad after all!,8,3 July 2018,"So 'Cult of Chucky' is the seventh film in the long running and now very well known 'Child's Play' franchise, following 2013's 'Curse Of Chucky'. I'm giving this a 8 out of 10 stars because while I do enjoy the series I just felt that this particular film went a bunch of different directions story wise. There was too many different stories molded together in this one 90 min film and most of the time it was flat out confusing. I do appreciate they kept Brad Dourif as Chucky because nobody can do it better. It's cool they keep a lot of the same actors and characters from previous Chucky films including Chucky's original victim, Andy Barclay, still portrayed by original actor Alex Vincent.
Back to some of the more negative aspects of this film a lot of it reminded me of Jason Goes To Hell with all the body jumping there was that Chucky did. He put his soul in several different good guy doll and even possessed Nica at the end. Turning Chucky into a feminine character and he rides off with Tiffany in her human form and doll form in a car at the end of the film. To me that was ridiculous. The ending of this film was horrible, most of the graphics were cheesy and most of the new characters were pointless and you pretty much just wanted everyone to die.
However while this film may not be the best it is still a very entertaining and fun slasher flick with plenty of cheesy Gore)(which I actually do appreciate). I guess what I was looking for in this film was more of a story that made more sense and felt less comical. I thought Curse Of Chucky was probably the more scarier of the series since the original. I do recommend this film to hard core horror fans and Chucky fans. But if you're new to the series and not too big on horror films, I would say steer clear of this one.",Cult of Chucky
83,cstover-28468,Wickedly Strange yet Entertaining,7,19 June 2019,"Cult of Chucky seems to be a culmination of all the other Chucky films into one dark, twisted, yet strangely entertaining film. It has the horror elements of the original films with some of the black comedy from the newer ones and I actually really enjoyed the way they fit them together. I won't go into the entire plot as it's a bit convoluted but if you haven't seen Curse of Chucky, I recommend watching that first then going to this. You shouldn't be disappointed",Cult of Chucky
84,kelboy10,"so long in this body, I'm trapped in here!!!",6,18 April 2018,"You would think by now after several instalments this cult of followers chucky has would rejoice in harmony. Me personally, I think Don Mancini gets the balance between comedy and horror spot on. Since the 80s this global phenomenon has graced our screen much has changed in the styles of movies. Little did we see of chucky in the original childsplay and why would we? He was trying to scare us. Now we see Chucky everywhere quite literally. Thankful Mancini keeps the nostalgia of the chucky we all loved and brings freshness to what always seems to be evolving each and everytime. Unfortunately the more you see something the less scary it becomes. Mancini certainly recognises this and manages to create a charismatic doll with a little bit of fright left in him. He uses his animatronics to bring chucky to life again but doesn't over do it. We get shades of the original. Mancini creates good movie suspense with quick flashes of Chucky running and subtle shots of hands and feet. Creepy are some scenes in Curse of Chucky, a palette of bizarre images, a ward with very little staff, and a random multiple mixed up Malcolm. But in the middle isn't Malcolm, it's Brad Dourif's own daughter returning and so does the continuity right where we left off from Curse. Fiona Dourif is a nice addition to a new direction for the series. (Fiona Dourif) Playing Nica who is imprisoned in the institute as insane does pretty good job with her acting and is vulnerable as she is wheelchair bound. I had no issue with the lack of mental institute staff and the low budget. This is Chucky I'm sure many would love to stand in the background, but the secluded surrounding adds to the creepiness. Out with the old in with the new, not quite. Where are they now? Well older much older, but the nostalgia is nice as (Alex Vincent) Andy Barkley returns with twisted badass vengeance. What's interesting is chucky isn't just there to kill his victim Nico, he appears to be enjoying messing with her head with pychological games. Bringing in elements of what different fans liked about a variety of chucky movies Mancini gives us a dark horror with a slash of comedy and some twists and turns with some unexpected surprises. Overall this is improvement on bride and seed and keeps me wanting more of that loveable little ginger fellow with so much personality. Yeah he is an ice cold killer, but a likeable one!! Chucky wouldn't want me giving to much away, wanna play?",Cult of Chucky
85,tohkwongweng,What an absolute riot!!!,9,14 January 2019,"This one was almost the perfect scary movie. I watched 'Curse' then 'Cult' together both in their unrated versions and whilst I thought 'Curse' was pretty good, 'Cult' was an absolute blast! Not one Chucky but 3! Awesome! The ingenious ways in which everyone met their untimely demise was truly a work of scary movie art and I'm so glad that they were depicted with no holds barred. Watch it to believe it! I haven't had this much fun watching Chucky since the original Childs Play and 'Cult' payed great homage to it in that regard. Fiona Dourif's morph into evil towards the end was an absolutely brilliant twist and I never saw it coming. And I've said it before but I'll say it again, the twist in a twisted scary movie makes it great. Definitely one to be kept in my collection for future viewing.",Cult of Chucky
86,TheJohnnyPHreak,Chucky Is Back In This Well Done Sequel,7,24 February 2019,"I have a love-hate relationship with Chucky and Child's Play. I know the original film is a classic in the horror circles. I've never been a fan of the films, but I am a fan of Chucky himself. He's an interesting and icon horror movie killer. I might need to revisit the first films (which I plan to soon) but I have only been a fan of Bride of Chucky. I liked the goofy nature of the film and gory elements. It just seemed to be the first films were played too serious.Even though most people think when horror characters get too serious they add in humor to change things up. Most of the films that infuse horror after being serious somewhat fail. Look at the Nightmare On Elm Street series. (Even though I'm a fan of quipped tongue in cheek Freddy Kruger) I just feel that Chucky needs to be a little less serious sometimes. A good balance helps his character in these films.Cult of Chucky takes place right after Curse of Chucky, which I read is a soft reboot of the entire series. This film follows Andy, the protagonist from the first film. He's all grown up and is now hunting Chucky. He actually has found Chucky and keeps his head in a safe where he comes home to torture it. Andy is still suffering after all those years, he can't get dates, he's somewhat antisocial. But he continues to try to keep the world safe from Chucky.But it seems like Chucky has a new person to torment. Nica Pierce and her niece were terrorized by Chucky in Curse. But it seems no one believes Nica that a doll was doing the killings. After being released from prison in her doctor's care, she's sent to a mental hospital where people start dropping like flies. It is Chucky hunting her again or is Nica the real killer?For the characters in the film, this is the question. But if us as viewers we know that somehow Chucky is doing this to play with Nica. And it works on so many levels. I gotta say that Cult of Chucky might be my new favorite film in the series. It has a good balance of serious, funny and downright messed up. Don Mancini, the original writer, wrote and directed this film. He knows Chucky and he gets all the beats right. The film is shot pretty well for a VOD horror film. The set design of the hospital is very bleak and when the chaos happens it feels pretty claustrophobic.Fiona Dourif, who plays Nica is excellent as our lead. We get a gamut of emotions from her. Her range is excellent and she plays the character surprisingly deep for a horror movie. Her father Brad Dourif once again embodies Chucky so well. It feels like he gets to do more here than before. Chucky is manipulative, funny and downright vile at times. I really loved him in this. That's the main reason why the film works. Chucky gets enough really good screen time to shine. And he shines like a bloody bright star.The film is so gory and violent. There are some top-notch kills to be hand. One specific one actually shocked me with how gory the filmmakers went. I'll just say falling glass is never fun. The film feels fully fleshed out like this is extending narrative that takes one helluva a twist in the end. I really hope that with the rise of all things Chucky (we are getting a reboot film and a TV series) that Mancini can continue the story he is telling. It's nice to see Jennifer Tilly showing up in an extended cameo. She seems to love this series. I believe this might be the third or fourth film she's in.Cult of Chucky for Chucky fans is a must see. It plays out so well in the universe as a great sequel and just a fun standalone horror movie. It does connect itself to Curse of Chucky but there's enough of the original story in this film to not really having to see the film before it. (I haven't seen Curse yet but now I'm dying to) This film also made me want to revisit the original films. I'm not saying they will win me over like this did. But they deserve a revisit. As excited I am for the reboot/remake, I really would love to see where Mancini can go with this story he created here. He left a lot of things open for more than one film. I'm down for more Chucky anyway I can get it.",Cult of Chucky
87,LegendsofHorror,Movie Review: Cult of Chucky (2017),7,3 October 2017,"Let me start off by saying that the ""Chucky"" craze has been around for a long time, ""Chucky"" has gone through several changes over the years a lot like ""Fred Krueger"". They both started out as terrifying entities but over time sorta turned into demented blood crazed comedians, but throughout they always had their saving grace as horror icons. That being said, Child's Play 1-3 created a stone cold killer made from plastic, after the original trilogy he became a somewhat parody of himself...until now.Cult of Chucky returns our favourite killer doll back to his darker roots but still embedded within is the dark humour that us horror fans smile at amidst all his gory glory.The film opens up with fan favourite (Alex Vincent) as Andy Barclay, who was seen in the end credits of Curse who is now a mature young man still fighting with his daemons. Whilst on a date played by beautiful (Allison Dawn Doiron), things escalate and send us to a brief but fantastically twisted opener. The first eight minutes of this film is one of the best opening sequences since the original classic film.Once the credits start we fans see a beautifully edited montage of footage from all the 'Child's Play' films that we all grew up with which lead us into the mind's eye of one of the sole survivors of 'Curse' Nica Pierce (played by Fiona Dourif, daughter of ""Chucky""). We find her now institutionalized and trying to come to terms with the murders with the help Dr. Foley, (played by Michael Therriault) who convinced she is improving sends her to a minimum security ward which entails a unholy reunion with everybody's favourite serial killer. Still somewhat convinced she was more involved with the murders than ""Chucky"" she still fights these doubts as the killings start back up again with the arrival of a therapeutic Good Guy Doll.The visuals are beautifully shot, as is the tension. There are also some nicely placed cameos therein which add to the storyline, more than just fan candy. The death scenes contain some nice throwbacks to some of the brutality of the original films as well as adding some gratuitous gore of the gorehounds that are fans of the series.There have been mixed reviews mainly due to the change of Good Guy Mythos. These mythos are explained as the film picks up to its shocking finale as well as Director Don Mancini mentioned before that there will be more 'Child's Play' films and these new changes will be a part of the new vision in the franchise.In short, ""Chucky"" IS BACK and ready to play!!!!",Cult of Chucky
88,rolandjordaan2,Cult of Chucky - Spoiler Free Review,4,14 September 2018,"The Child's Play series of films have always been kinda hit and miss, with more films being misses than hits, unfortunate to say. 2013's 'Curse of Chucky' though, completely turned that around; not only was this the best sequel in the series, but one might even argue that it was an improvement on the 1988 original. The film had completely gone back to its routes, putting the focus on atmosphere, giving us time to get to know the characters, the comedy had been toned down; this movie was horror the way its meant to be. Therefore when I heard they were making another one and that it was going to be a direct continuation of the previous film, you better believe me when I say, I was excited as hell, I couldn't wait for this...and then I saw the film. What the hell people?!!! You shifted the series back in the original direction, made a Child's Play sequel that actually got overall favourable reviews and then, instead of sticking to that formula, you basically go and make another 'Bride of Chucky'. I actually can't put into words how badly they messed up this movie...okay, yes I can. This movie feels like watching a piece of fan fiction, it's like one of those comic books they release when they want to bring together characters from a bunch of different sequels, but there's no logical way to do it; oh and that happens here, believe me, that happens here: we have Andy Barclay returning from the original Child's Play series, Tiffany returning from the Bride/Seed of Chucky films and Nica from the previous film, and how do they all fit together? About as well as ketchup on ice cream, sure the plots all mix eventually, but there simply is no reason bringing all these characters back, other than for the sake of bringing all these characters back. Tone of the movie? It's a comedy again...don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's funny, but it sure as hell thinks it is. And then there's the editing...a mainstream horror movie that actually makes use of split screens and on occasion even those transitions that any first-year film student would feel too embarrassed to use. I guess if I have to say one positive thing about this, and I know I just complained about it, but it was kinda fun having Andy back (and kudos to them for actually using original actor, Alex Vincent, whom we haven't seen in this franchise since Child's Play 2, 27 years ago - yes I am aware of his cameo at the end of 'Curse', but I'm not counting one minute of screen time); overall his character was the only one I was at least kind of invested in and his subplot was waaay more interesting than what was actually happening in the main arc of this movie. Still, that isn't nearly enough for me to even vaguely recommend this, so unless they can turn things around with Child's Play 8, and trust me, this ending completely sets it up for another entry, skip this film, end the series with 'Curse of Chucky' and you can forever delude yourself that this franchise went out on a high note.",Cult of Chucky

91,filmtogo,Feels like a 3 hour movie but still better than the earlier films.,3,2 June 2018,"With Curse and Cult of Chucky the franchise actually got better. Still this one has a lot of problems. While Fiona Dourif is doing a very good job as the main protagonist Nica, Alex Vincent is a horrible grown-up Andy Barclay (from the first two films). His ""acting"" never matches any of the other actors. The asylum setting could've been cooler if it would've been an old atmospheric asylum and not a clean white Apple-style institution. And for some reason - probably the storytelling - this 90 minute movie feels like a 3 hour journey. But as with Curse of Chucky this one is still better than the earlier Child's Play movies.",Cult of Chucky
92,weemonk,Hard crowd to please,7,27 September 2017,"Wow. A lot of people seem hard to please on here. Most series are struggling by the 7th entry (7 stars appropriate) having ruined continuity, rehashed the same formula seen before or by having lost original cast members. A Nightmare on Elm Street had to switch it up to 'it's a movie but not', Halloween had to bring JLC back, Saw was calling it a day, Hellraiser was already screwed and Friday the 13th gave the heroine telekinetic powers to spice things up. It's damn hard to keep a series going and adding new ideas.I thought this entry had a lot going for it. Whilst only glimpsed post credits in Curse, Cult sees Andy Barclay back and all grown up since the first 2 entries and also with the original actor, Alex Vincent. Thanks to his childhood run-ins with Chucky, Andy is pretty bad ass taking no crap and is out to to stop him (much alike Tommy in Friday the 13th Part 6 which was a bloody good entry).One reviewer said this was cheap in production. This is what I thought of Curse, of which after 2 attempts of watching it, 4 years later (thanks to Cult) I revisited that film and watched it ignoring the lesser production budget. I was maybe a bit harsh. Cult employs animatronics over CGI at every turn apart from one shot that I could see of. I much more prefer this as animatronics still work the best for this character even in this modern CGI world.The kills are a throwback to some other films but overall are fantastic for gore with one drill scene which would have had the censors in uproar a couple of decades ago. I love the continuity for this film as everything in previous entries is in place and hasn't been changed with many a nod to earlier entries. For fans of the series this does show the love Mr Mancini has when writing these later entries. Add to this all the familiar cast are back including Fiona Dourif who turns out to be an excellent piece of casting (being the real life daughter of we know who) when 'expanding' her role later in the film (I'll not give anything away on that).Lastly, people seem divided on the humour in the series. I personally enjoy it. This entry has the humour lacking from Curse which I found a bit bland without it. This entry has enough without being too OTT like Bride or Seed. It's probably my favourite entry and a while since I've seen it but i recall CP2 having some dark humour so stop moaning those who don't like it.Overall the entry managed to breath some new life to the series with a new concept that could prove interesting if used minimally (again not saying more)....we are on entry 7 but it ain't telekinesis! The series has moved away from cinema release so the budget is never going to be what it used to be. This can be seen now and then but thankfully not when it comes to the FX for Chucky. Child's Play/Chucky films are what they are - about a murderous doll who kills people. They are watched by fans who know what they are getting. I look forward to entry 8 and seeing where things go. Make sure you watch after the credits!",Cult of Chucky
93,LasKeepsItReal,A respectable Sequel To Curse of Chucky!,7,30 August 2017,"I was able to see Cult of Chucky last week when there was the first exclusive showing of the movie at the London Frightfest Festival.The following review will contain some minor spoilers.Cult of Chucky takes places a few years after Curse of Chucky. The movie revolves around returning character Nica who has been committed to an asylum after being held responsible for the events which took place involving her family in the previous film.Some of the characters in the movie that Nica comes into contact with who are also within the asylum including Claire, Angela and Madeline for several different reasons were interesting and stood out. I was also looking forward to how the story would progress with Chucky and Tiffany and I was not disappointed with their scenes however I would have liked to have seen Tiffany have more screen time.Viewers of this film will have to wait and see what repercussions Nica will face throughout her time in the asylum and what her fate will be involving Chucky and Tiffany and with the reappearance of Andy from some of the previous movies, however I can tell you now that I was pleasantly surprised by some of the twists and turns in this movie involving the main characters and the end result of them. The practical effects and music in the film were well done and suited without being too over the top.I would give this movie 7 out of 10.",Cult of Chucky
94,DakotaTheGamer,This Movie Was Great! Till The End.,5,4 October 2017,OK this movie there is a lot of things i gotta say about this starting out with the beginning the beginning was good it showed stuff that looked good and everything but torge the middle it was so amazing it had so many disturbing scenes which I love it horror movies and it also had a bunch of gruesome scenes and also it showed what Andy was doing and everything but torge the end this movie was really bad because of what they did about Andy and the girl it just made me mad that they would do this it really upset me a lot and the cult theme didn't really help that much it was really weird having that it was funny at times though sometimes through it I laughed but there was one thing at the end credits there was a scene and I think its suppose to go along with another movie they will make I don't know yet but it made me change it from a 4/10 to a 5/10 so this movie was good but bad at the same time so i would recommend watching it just don't get ahead of yourself and buy it unless you love Chucky or want to complete the collection like me I hope they make another to just make up for this cause they could have done better but that's how I feel about the movie I thought it should have been like $10 instead of $16 cause of how it was but that's just how I feel but that's what I thought of it.,Cult of Chucky
95,ralo229,Well....um....it's Better Than Seed of Chucky,4,25 September 2017,"I wish I could say I was disappointed, but let's be honest. With the exception of Child's Play and Curse of Chucky, the Chucky films have been varying levels of suck. And while I can't say it's anywhere near as bad as some of the other ones, it's still not really that good per se.-Most of the acting was pretty bland except for Fiona Douriff, Alex Vincent, and of course Brad Douriff who's always fun to watch as Chucky.-Kind of like Curse of Chucky, the only memorable and/or interesting characters were Nicca and Chucky.-It is refreshing to see Alex Vincent reprise his role as Andy Barclay after his last major appearance in Child's Play 2, but if you've seen the film, you'd know that it's also beyond disappointing considering how he never plays much of a role in the plot. Fan service? Perhaps.-The story was extremely repetitive. Most of the movie consists of this: Chucky kills someone, Nicca claims that it was Chucky's fault, nobody believes her. Rinse, lather, and repeat for three fourths of the movie. In the film's final act, it does get a little interesting when it's revealed that Chucky has learned how to transfer his soul into multiple bodies at once. But then that ends before it can get fully utilized.-There's a disturbing lack of extras. That may not sound like an actual criticism to you, but hear me out. The entire film takes place inside of a mental institution, yet the only patients we see are the supporting and main characters, one psychiatrist, and two orderlies. We never see any other staff members or patients besides them and it really made me question if this was just the most understaffed and underutilized mental institution in the world. Chances are the low budget didn't allow for a huge cast. Curse of Chucky had an advantage in that regard considering how most of the film took place in a house and most of the characters consisted of the main character's family. So extras weren't really needed anyway. But if you're setting your film in a big facility, do you really expect me to buy that the staff only consists of three people? Others may not agree and might say I'm nitpicking, but it was very distracting.All in all, it's not very good. It's nowhere near as bad as say Child's Play 3 or Seed of Chucky, but it's far from the pleasant surprise that Curse of Chucky was. You might enjoy it if you're a die hard Chucky fan, but if you're not, well then I can't help you.",Cult of Chucky

However, unlike 1998's ""Bride Of Chucky"" which was actually funny and quite a bit of fun, and even ""Seed Of Chucky"", this one is just so absurd that it actually becomes boring. The plot holes are so large, the acting quite good, but worst of all very few scares. It leaves it open to a sequel but I doubt anyone other than hardcore fans will bother.

Instead Cult of Chucky merely continues beating the corpse of it's franchise in an effort to make more money!The original trilogy was a pleasing dose for horror buffs, then we had the horror/comedy Bride and Seed of Chucky movies, which were an interesting revival for the franchise. - Then they took it too far with 'Curse' and now 'Cult' of Chucky, it almost seems like the writers think they can make a new film by inventing new 'victims' from Chucky's past - I can think of over fifty without counting unnamed ones.Sadly this will spawn yet another 'sequel' and this franchise will continue being flogged for money far past it's used by date.I'm not recommending this film to anybody, and I'm a fan of the Child's Play franchise.

101,KillerRomance,Welcome to the Dollhouse cult at Frightfest brought straight to you,7,25 August 2017,"This is the seventh instalment of the Child's play Franchise, which I am lucky to be at the eighteenth Frightfest film festival. This is my first time and I had a dream come true to see a Chucky movie premiere. If you think Curse of Chucky is good, Cult of Chucky is even better, and here is why with major spoilers.It's been four years since the Pierce family were murdered. Andy Barclay (Vincent) has a date with Rachel in a swanky restaurant as they both drank white wine. Rachel probed further as Andy explained Aunt Maggie's demise, she finds it too overwhelming and leaves Andy abandoned at the restaurant. Andy Barclay morose about his life situation came home in his cabin with hunted game trophies hung on the wall and armoury, nothing but beer stack in the fridge. Opens a security safe and the blasted head of Chucky from the last movie begins to tease and sneers at Andy, so with a blowtorch Chucky gets some torture but remained alive. Barclay vows to find Nica Pierce.Nica is moving from Lockmore hospital to a less security psychiatric ward called Harrogate psychiatric hospital when she meets Claire, Multiple Malcolm and others. As Nica was settling in with a brief affair with Malcolm, then Tiffany Valentine (Jennifer Tilly) as Alice's legal Guardian brings tragic news to Nica that made her weep, as she comes to terms with her great loss, a Chucky doll is brought into therapy session, one patient accepts the doll as her child, Nica explained in realisation that the woman who visited her was Charles Lee Ray's Girlfriend and Chucky ""serial killer in the eighties who murdered twenty-two people"" during his human years, of course nobody believes her, Dr Foley claimed about 20 percent of good guy dolls are called Chucky and her delusions are perpetual, and to prove it, he burns Chucky's hand. Clare storms off with the doll to dispose as he bit her arm, she alerts people but they lock her up, and she dies.Nica was on the verge of committing suicide when Chucky wrote in blood ""not so fast"" and the older patient died next morning wrote in blood ""Chucky did it"" which put the blame on Nica. Another good guy doll called Chucky arrived by post, then Andy tracks the Harrogate psychiatric hospital to bring a short haired Good Guy doll from his safe keeping, and there is a multiple Chucky tag team of dolls. There is a crazy twist to the ending to explain Andy was tricked into a psychiatric padded room, and Charles Lee Ray won through the battle and finally turns human in a human being of an unsuspected person as the awaiting Tiffany Valentine gave a passionate Kiss as they drove off to oblivion. Then a nemesis sent by Andy's request from Chucky's past comes to torture the talking severed doll's head (from curse of Chucky) to get answers which makes way for another sequel.This opens up Child's play Eight in four years time.I love it! Like a puzzle and good pacing with some comedy including twists and turns. Nica starts walking and it is up to you as viewers to find out why, and many surprises galore to where that came from. I recommend this movie. It is even better than curse of Chucky, it is surreal and dream like, Chucky becomes powerful than ever, lighting and photography is well presented. A bit of thought had gone into it but I do love psychological mystery Horror anyway. I don't have to elucidate, Go see it much highly recommended.",Cult of Chucky
102,deltagilbert,Absolutely terrible.,1,24 February 2018,Literally one of the worst films I've ever seen. I saw Child's Play 1 and 2 years ago and enjoyed them but skipped over the later movies. Watched this as I saw it had a great review somewhere online in those 'overlooked horror movie' lists. But wow. This was awful. I was angry with myself for watching until the end. Total garbage.,Cult of Chucky
103,utslitt,Not That Bad,6,9 July 2019,"While it isn't as good as the film before it (Curse of Chucky), Cult of Chucky helps continue to storyline of the Child's Play universe with new and old characters in an appreciated way (for the most part). The film picks up where Curse of Chucky has left of, showing us what has happened to the main character of the last film. Chucky of course, is as alive as ever, and as always, is seeking revenge.When it comes to the story, I gotta say, it's not bad. I've been wondering for the longest time when we'd finally find someone in ""the nuthouse"" all because ""Chucky did it."" The chaos that ensues when Chucky finally appears on scene is tastefully, creatively done - all except one moment which to me seems as a repeat of a death from Bride with poor. and over-exaggerated special effects. (when you see it, you'll know what I'm referring to)A nice touch that was added to the film was the reintroduction of Andy. We haven't seen Andy in the past three films (Bride, Seed, and Curse), but he's back, and he's ready to take on Chucky once more.The things I didn't enjoy so much about the film was what was left unexplained due to sheer laziness, such as how the ""cult"" of Chucky was even able to happen at all. Yeah, yeah, we get it - voodoo shmoodoo - but when the same spell that's used for what the viewer is familiar with is used in a manner outside of that repeatedly and it's never explained why, it feels a little more ""because I said so"" than serial killer using voodoo to his benefit.All in all, with that one complaint aside, the movie isn't half bad. It may not have been everything the viewer was hoping for, but it's entertaining and gets the Chucky universe back on track after derailing with Bride and Seed.I'd recommend it.",Cult of Chucky

106,kpentlanduk,"Boring, slow - for Chucky fans only!",3,26 September 2017,"Managed to sit down and watch this last night. Ice cream in hand - had great expectations as the reviews here were generally favourable.I have watched a LOT of horror the past 30 years. A LOT. This new instalment of Chucky was, just... so... boring.Fans of the Chucky series may enjoy getting old characters back. Mostly the film is set in one of two mental asylums. Chucky dolls (yes two of them) turn up. The usual 'is he alive or just a doll' madness goes on and on until finally, Chucky starts to torment Nica and kills a few people with a menacing laugh and a funny comment. Nothing new here folks and it takes too much time wallowing in older characters, reminding us all of what happened. About 40 minutes had past and nothing remotely exciting had happened.Cult of Chucky is a film that teases. When the kills start there is the gore, but no real fear. I believe Cult of Chucky was trying to get back to the horror roots, removing the comedy element.... sadly it has failed and delivered a below average horror.Die hards only folks. There is nothing here that will be lingering in my mind.The acting is average. Nothing wrong there. So much more could have been done with this film. If you are new to the series go watch Childs Play 1 and 2 (maybe 3 also)...",Cult of Chucky

From what is seen he has multiplied by 3, not only physically but violently. This delivery takes place in a psychiatric where everything is white (even the snowy landscape that surrounds it), or Red-Blood with some other character dressed in black, 3 colors for 3 dummies are not enough to reach the height of some previous deliveries. Too much violence and too little content prevent the magic of connecting. Neither the presence of his memorable bride, arouses the interest (You still can remember her walking to the rhythm of Blondie's ""Call me"" but that was another story. Anyway, If what you want to see is just violence and no more, then, this is your movie.",Cult of Chucky
108,white_fire4,"Not as bad as Bride or Seed, but not as good as Curse sadly",6,26 September 2017,"The seventh installment of the Child's Play franchise introduces some interesting, albeit hamfisted in ideas. We got a brief glimpse of this at the end of Curse when Chucky was performing the soul spell on Alice, and then showing up at Andy's place in the box.The payoff from that last bit comes immediately, as the movie opens with Andy having Chucky's head in a safe, a quarter of it blown off from the shotgun he had pointed at him and fired off when the screen went black, along with some interesting patch work to keep Chucky's head relatively together.It's been four years, and Andy has been taking justice out in his own way, suffice at the expense of having any kind of real life. We get a slight insight into this, but unfortunately little more than that. By the end of the movie, you might be wishing this had gone in a similar vein, but instead had focused on Andy's attempts to stop Chucky.Sadly, the movie then moves to Nica, Chucky's daughter. What follows is a bunch of typical, cliché ""You're nuts, but you're not really nuts, but everyone tells you you're nuts"" psychiatric schlock. And the interesting twist to the series is slowly poked at and introduced.Chucky, with some help from Tilly, makes his way into the hospital that Nica is being held in. But wait, how can he be there if Andy has his head? Well, as is eventually revealed, Chucky can now split himself into other dolls, and other people.This is a neat, but as I said, hamfisted idea. How he came about this is passed away by his claim that he found a new spell in a voodoo for dummies book a few years ago, basically. And that's it. There's no touching on how in the hell his soul can be put, fully, into multiple dolls. But it is. And each doll literally seems to be a full, new Chucky, acting the same, same murderous intent, so on and so forth.There's a lot of implications here, and a ton of questions that people with a thirst for sci-fi and theology might have. But, again, it's glossed over very quickly and is basically a ""He can do this because the plot requires it"" type of thing.Even sadder, Chucky does not really get to shine until there's only about 18 minutes left in the film. There's brief snippets of him and his unique humor and homicidal tendencies, yes, but he doesn't go nuts, so to speak, and break out until right near the end. This is quite different from Curse, where when he revealed himself and started his killings, there was still a good chunk of movie left for him to do that in.This causes a rather uneven tone. While there is blood leading up to this, it's quite obviously subdued for the most part. However, once Chucky makes his big reveal, the blood and gore amps up quite noticeably, and a lot of kills are stuffed into the film rather quickly.The first scene with the multiple Chucky's together, thankfully, is quite hilarious. But again, it does show a lot of missed opportunity here, had Chucky revealed things sooner.How the movie ultimately ends also brings up a hell of a lot of questions as to how the franchise is going to be, moving forward. The implication seems to be that Chucky as we have known him for seven films will NOT be returning, so.It's not a bad film, persay, it's just that it's not quite as great as Curse was. The hospital Nica is in and that much of the film takes place in is weirdly well furnished, and seems very well maintained, despite the outside of it looking run down as hell. It also has a VERY sterile look and feel to everything. Seriously, damn near everything is white as can be. It's a stark change from the darkness of Curse.Ultimately, the movie doesn't reach the levels the first two managed to attain, and doesn't have near enough Chucky being Chucky. It introduces some ideas, but doesn't elaborate on them well enough.Here's hoping that it does well enough with its release that yet another one is made, and that it doesn't take quite as long, and that it returns to the format that made Curse such a surprisingly good sequel, while improving on what flaws that movie had as well.",Cult of Chucky

111,GoreWhoreAust,It's better than ALIEN: Covenant,7,3 October 2017,"It might seem odd to compare Cult Of Chucky to ALIEN: Covenant. I happen to watch both films only days apart, Covenant for the second time, and it dawned on me that there were a number of parallels. Foremost, they are both genre franchises that have been around for multiple decades with a similar number of installments that are generally a product of the time they were produced. And both feature iconic creations that continue to influence pop culture to this very day. Comparing these two films, released only a hand full of months apart, highlights the virtues of one and the short-coming of the other. I am one of a growing group that loved 2012's Prometheus. Ridley Scott took back the world he had created with ALIEN and gave us something new, not a rehash but something bold, grand and daring – it was no wonder the film was meet with such a polarizing response. It has its flaws, but they have diminished over time, particularly of late in comparison to Covenant. This is where we can look to Cult Of Chucky, the 6th sequel to a film from 1988. Where Covenant rehashes elements from all of its predecessors in the vein hope of satisfying fans of the original and detractors of Prometheus, yet satisfies no one – Cult, amasses story cues from all its predecessors, inventively stringing them together to create something new, fun and satisfying, with the convenient by-product of actually pushing the whole franchise forward in an unpredictable direction. Dare I say that such an out-come was what Ridley Scott had been hoping for. Another interesting comparison between the two is budget. Covenant is obviously a huge studio production and to Ridley's credit, everything always looks amazing. On the other hand, Cult had a fraction of the budget, not being destined for theatrical release. What director and series creator Don Mancini achieves on such a small budget is admirable. The film looks so slick and stylized. Aesthetically not for a minute did I feel I was watching something cheap or inferior. The ALIEN franchise is known for its grotesque beauty and somehow, even amid its highly designed elements, Covenant doesn't achieve the poetry in the horror that previous installments had. Back to Cult – there is one particular sequence / death (the skylight scene) which is captured with breathtaking beauty. You'd be very hard pressed to find such craftsmanship in another direct-to-home-ent production. It also shows the influence Hannibal the series had on Don Mancini as a filmmaker. He directed a number of episodes. Yet another comparison between the two is the horror trope of 'cannon fodder' characters. Covenant seems to have a huge cast of faceless victims – it's hard to even tell most of them apart and you learn next to nothing about them, at least nothing that makes you care about their plight or demise. The same can't be said for Cult. In less time, Mancini somehow establishes his cast of 'crazies' with enough info and emotion for us to actually care when they are finally dispatched. It's not like his periphery characters are given massively expansive backstories but Mancini manages to give the audience what they need which is a hell of a lot more than Ridley and his writers managed. I'm realistic, Cult Of Chucky is a crazy little film about a talking murderous doll and it's not perfect but there has been a lot of thought, effort and consideration put into it to satisfy fans and create something fun, new and memorable. I certainly had much more fun watching Cult than I did watching Covenant, which just made me lament what it could and should have been. One last thing to note about Cult, and it's not a comparison to Covenant, is Alex Vincent! Wow, what a great performance. Vincent plays this grown up, damaged Andy exactly right. He plays Andy with absolute conviction, not as a tokenistic call back to the original but as a fully evolved character who has been greatly affected by years of loss and torment. I'd really love to see Vincent in more productions. If you're a Chucky fan and particularly enjoyed Curse Of Chucky a few years back, I think you'll really appreciate what Mancini and friends have managed to conjure this time round.",Cult of Chucky

114,jameszxcvbn,Better than the last 3,6,27 September 2017,"Let me just start off by saying that I am a huge Chucky fan. Child's play was the first horror movie I've watched back in 1998 or something when I was about 7. I loved it and would always rent the VHS from the nearest video store. For the most, I actually enjoyed Cult of Chucky.The main problem with the Chucky series was that it went way too comedic from Bride of Chucky. I remember when Curse of Chucky was released straight to DVD and thought ""What an insult to the series"". But I watched it and immediately the first thing I hated was how the doll looked. It looked way too plastic and fake with the duck-lip chucky. Now, did Cult of Chucky redeem itself? Yes, I reckon so. I mean the beginning of the movie was already too good and the intro scene where Andy brings out Chucky's head from the safe is better than the entire Curse of Chucky movie. I thought it was an incredible opening and very intriguing... but.... it moves onto the cliché mental- hospital theme.The reason why Child's Play series worked is because Chucky was doing all the wrongdoings in a family-safe suburban area where we suspect nothing dangerous will happen. Home, toy store, school, school bus, even the army. It just works because it's not some crazy scenery where we know something messed up is gonna happen, before it happens. Why Curse of Chucky didn't work for me is because it all happens in a stranded house in the woods with nothing around it... It's just too cliché and boring and looks like it's trying too hard to adapt to the 'modern horror theme', where dark woods and stranded house is supposed to be 'scary'. Why Cult of Chucky didn't work like it should have is because it was set in a mental hospital. We've all seen this in the past. We saw how they messed up the Wrong Turn series by continuously introducing stupid scenery like the mental hospital. It just doesn't work because Chucky fans are used to the Child's Play 1,2,3 scenery. I thought Chucky 7 was gonna be a reboot of Child's Play 1 (though they probably would have messed it up). But they really should have just stuck with Child's Play style for this. The lighting, colour, scenery, everything that we see on the screen is way too unrealistic. Another thing I hated about the film is that obnoxious Asian lady. God she was so annoying... isn't she from Cube 2: Hypercube? Her acting is more suited to drama series rather than a movie.Regardless of this, I still enjoyed the film. My 2 favourite scenes are Andy interacting with Chucky's blown up head and where Nica is crawling and she hallucinates Chucky as this massive figure and you can see Brad Dourif's reflection on the knife he's holding. Clever scene work that we didn't get to see in the previous franchises.",Cult of Chucky

The Chucky movies are one big, continuing story since 1988. Don Mancini has had a hand in every one of them. He wrote parts 1-4 and then, for parts 5-7, he took over as director as well. His latest, Cult of Chucky, adds something completely new and unexpected to the saga but does not forget the past. Heck, there's even a reference to Kent Military Academy (the location for part 3). I really enjoyed this movie! Brad Dourif returns again as the voice of Chucky and has some fun dialog to spout. His daughter reprises the role of ""Nica"" and continues to impress.

He got the spell ""Online"" Yet its the same spell he has always been using?Seed was always seen as the low point to the franchise but let me tell you, this... This is worse than Seed.Wait till it's on Netflix, do not waste your money on it.",Cult of Chucky

This movie is trash and i will happily explain why. First and foremost, the majority of the movie, you will be scratching your head, thinking, what is going on? does Andy have Chucky imprisoned? is Chucky already in the DR's office or is Chucky dropped off when Jennifer Tilly makes an appearance. Take everything that you remember from the first six movies, any and all rules to the voodoo magic that gave Charles Lee Ray life in a doll and toss them in the trash because that is what they did when they made this movie. And they cheaply tried to explain it, towards the end of the movies, in a minute and failed. This movie has gore but the cheap kind of gore. The kind of gore that is supposed to make up for crappy writing with no direction. This movie wants to be scary and it fails. Jennifer Tilly is a hell of an actress do not know why she bothered with this movie, same for Alex Vincent. What a way to stick your middle finger at the loyal fans who appreciated the simplicity of Chucky. I even felt the curse of Chucky was worth a one time watch.

126,blametaker77,Don't Drink The Kool-Aid! This Cult is Overrated.,6,4 October 2017,"Cult of Chucky, while not horrific (pun intended) for a 7th installment, is easily my least favorite Child's Play film to date. That said, I do not consider Seed of Chucky a film but rather a form of rape, so... Anyway, on a positive note, Cult of Chucky explores an ingenious direction in which to take the franchise because what is more terrifying than Chucky? Chucky multiplied by 3. That's right, this film expands on the universe by making it possible for Charles Lee Ray to posses more than one doll (among other things) at a time. Unfortunately, the execution left a lot to be desired. The pacing was an enjoyable slow burn for about the half-hour, after that, it started to border on tedious, and at a lean 90 minutes, the film should have flown by and left me wanting more, much like Curse of Chucky. Speaking of Curse of Chucky, that was a fantastic horror film and the best entry in the series since the original. Maybe that is why Cult of Chucky let me down ultimately because compared to Curse, it was a minor effort. Curse repaired the series and took it in a bold new direction but Cult just sort of road its predecessor's coattails in reserve and still radiated pretension in the process. Despite the bizarrely positive critical phrase for this film, I think Chucky Creator/writer/director Don Mancini should have quit while he was ahead because so many fans I talked to loved Curse of Chucky, and I don't think those same fans are going to be as enamored with this underdeveloped, overrated latest entry. Sadly, for many (self included) the Chuck stops here.",Cult of Chucky

The franchise has come a long way since Curse of Chucky (crappy film), and my faith in the franchise has been restored due to Cult.Although the film is SO CONFUSING, and I found myself exclaiming constantly in confusion (and waving my arms around in frustration), I enjoyed the film and would recommend. For me to see past characters (and TIFFANY DOLL!) was really cool.There must be another film coming out because they really cannot end it like that, there is a lot of unanswered questions and things that still don't make sense.Excellent contrast in characterisation of Nica and Chucky from Fiona Dourif.Looking forward to see what is to come from Chucky!",Cult of Chucky
134,rocko90,"Way better than ""Curse""",10,2 October 2017,"Curse of Chucky was terrible. Low budget, boring kills and dialogue, and the atmosphere was never fully realized. Thankfully, this VOD sequel fixed all those mistakes. Child's Play 1 and 2 will always be the best in the series, and one thing lacking in CP2 was finally in this franchise (multiple Chuckys). For most part this sequel was fan service, much more than Curse tried to be. We get everyone from Andy, Tiffany /Jennifer Tilly (all in small doses).The storyline is standard fare. What makes this sequel work is it is a lot more fun and bizarre, and it never gets dull. Even when things don't make sense with the multiple Chuckys, it is something new and enjoyable. The acting overall is decent for what it's worth. The flaws is Andy never mentions what happens to his mom, the movie rnds rather abruptly, and again like in Curse of Chucky, the plot is severely hindered by the lack of budget. Chucky still doesn't look like Chucky but it is much better than the botoxed mess he looked like in Curse. I personally hate stitched face Chucky and in this movie Chucky is finally a killer DOLL again like the original 3 movies. The biggest flaw it is just very abrupt... the ending, the backstory about Alice, the actual voodoo jargon used for multiplying Chuckys... Those who complain about this movie... and yet enjoyed Curse... are entilted to their opinion. However this movie felt more like an actual Child's Play sequel in line with the first 3 movies.I'd recommend fans of first three sequels to watch it as it fan service for those fans. This had the right mix of comedy/horror in line with CP2/CP3.",Cult of Chucky

What brings me to such a low review.When I see a movie that includes Chucky, the killer doll, I am looking for something horror like, but it wasn't what I found with this movie. I laughed more than I felt the fright or the suspense in the air. The movie has some really fun scenes, with some funny lines, but no horror for the most part.All in all, 4 stars for the funny dialogues, but it's not really what i expected.",Cult of Chucky
136,kallevarvas,Felt like a final act,4,1 October 2017,"Before I begin my review, I must say that Child's Play is my all time favorite horror franchise. There are singular films that are way better than any of these movies, but as a franchise it's strong. Even though Seed Of Chucky was the worst one, and basically turned into a parody, I still enjoyed it.That being said, there now is a Chucky-film, that I didn't like. There's some positive elements in Cult, sure. I liked the idea, that they're bringing all the story lines together (minus Glen/Glenda) and old characters returned. Fiona Dourif was great and at the end, she really channeled her father perfectly.But the film itself is just bad. The storyline wasn't even a slightest bit of interesting, seeing three Chuckies running around simultaneously just isn't fun. Jennifer Tilly was annoying, but that's no surprise. I didn't care for Andy or any of the mental patients.It did however tie things up and the whole film felt like a final act. I really can't see them continuing anymore, there's nowhere to go now. Andy's locked up and will most likely be for life. Chucky got a new body and they rode to sunset with Tiffany. Sure, there are at least two Chucky-dolls running around still, but... Yeah.

138,IBRAHIMEX,The Franchise at its weakest,4,28 September 2017,"After 4 years of waiting for the new Cult of Chucky movie that i thought at the beginning it will be as good as Curse of Chucky, i felt completely disappointed. There is a high mood of insanity and stupidity in the whole plot. The movie is taking a very weak dramatic aspect relatively equal to Seed of Chucky. I don't know if Don Mancini's luck with odd numbers is bad because Child's Play 3 , Seed of Chucky and Finally the 7th Cult of Chucky are by all means equivalent to a C class horror movie. The end of the movie is also very weird that you will finally say to yourself ""Hugh OK and that's it ?"" Don't forget to watch the last scene after the credits ending. In my opinion there is no other way to revive this franchise unless if Don get's really serious and works on a prequel about the history of Charles Lee Ray instead with a fresh plot that goes before the original Child's Play movie. He has a brilliant actor Brad Dourif and he can make a full movie out of him with small sequences of Chucky to show to the audience the criminal biography of Charles Lee Ray. But if he continues for another sequel for Cult, i guess this won't work again.",Cult of Chucky

141,MarkW-CCP,Pretty good for the 7th in the Franchise,7,9 October 2017,"First of all I will start by saying I loved Curse of Chucky. Second, while I'm not a big fan of Seed of Chucky, I think an argument can be made that of the major horror series - Nightmare, Friday, Halloween, etc - the Child's Play franchise might be best.Before I go into my review of the 7th instalment in the series, I will qualify that last statement. I love all of the horror franchises, and I don't actually think any Chucky movie comes close to rivalling the best movies in any of the other series. However, while I think Seed s leaps and bounds the worst film in the demonic doll's library, it's probably better than the worst of the worst in the other series. Also, and this is quite noteworthy in today's Hollywood, Child's Play has not had to resort to a reboot or remake please correct me if I'm wrong, I think the Chucky brand is the only major series not to go down this road. That's amazing, surprising, and telling. Child's Play 1 is a frightening and fantastic film, the next two drop a bit, especially the third, but I still enjoy them, Bride is my favourite entry, Seed, again is my least favourite but Curse I bought without knowing anything about it. I grabbed it off the shelf, saw Don Mancini directed it, Brad Dourif was still Chucky, and his daughter Fiona was the star. That sold me. It was a wonderful surprise and it re- invigorated the series and, IMHO, brought the series as a whole into the ""greatest horror franchise"" conversation, or at least brought Chucky to same dinner table as Freddy, Jason, Michael, and Leatherface.Now Cult of Chucky, directed/written by Don Mancini, starring the Dourif clan, and bringing back Alex Vincent as a major character (he had a cameo at the end of Curse). This movie released on Netflix (rated version only) and on disc on October 3.Cult picks up a few years after the events of Curse, Nica (Fiona Dourif) is residing in a mental institution, and due to the torturous therapy she endures, she now believes she killed everyone in Curse, and that Chucky, the talking killer doll, was a figment of her imagination. She gets downgraded from the criminally insane solitary confinement to medium security, where she is holed-up with an eclectic group of mentally ill patients. Everything seems to be going fine until her therapist, Dr Foley (Michael Therriault) brings in a Good Guy doll to a group therapy session. Why? basically, because he's a dick, which becomes more and more evident as the movie kicks along. Soon patients start dropping like flies and no one believes poor Nica. Meanwhile, Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is trying his best to move past his childhood traumas and live a normal life, all the while hiding a few skeletons, and something more sinister, in his closet. Eventually he discovers Chucky is running around the asylum - apparently he kept track of the Nica story, and presumably all the other Chucky-related cases - and he gets himself checked in to try and stop his former best-friend-to-the-end once and for all.Maybe it's just that Curse surprised me with how good it was, maybe it's because I paid attention to this film from its inception and let the hype get to me (at lest in my circles it got a lot), but I didn't enjoy Cult as much as I hoped I would. It's still a good movie: good kills; good characters; well made; well acted. you get it, it's all well and good but wanted more. Before I go into what I liked, I'll mention my main dislike. The whole film feels a little disjointed. The Andy story line feels jammed in, Tiffany (with Jennifer Tilly returning, and she is as good as ever) also feels a little thrown in, and they mention some stories and plot devices that I wanted to know more about, heck the briefly mentioned Alice story line (Alice being Nica's niece from Curse) could probably have been it's own movie. And despite it being, hopefully, a set up for the sequel, the Andy story line doesn't really end satisfyingly, it just kinda hangs there. The main story, Nica's, is gory, a little silly (in a good way), not very scary but that doesn't really hurt it. The kills are great (though some CG irked me), and the secondary characters are fantastic. Angela (Marine Stephenson Kerr) is a delightful schizophrenic and has some great lines, some chilling moments, and a hilarious reaction to meeting Chucky, that the doll just can't really deal with - it's great. She also looks and sounds like Ray Finkle's mom from Ace Ventura Not sure if that was intentional but I loved it. Another standout was Madeleine (Elizabeth Rosen) who believes the Good Guy doll is her long lost baby boy, while that sounds great enough, one of the sight gags that comes along with it is the best kind of cringe-worthy. The other inmates and staff are serviceable to enjoyable and definitely don't take anything away from the film, even if there are at times a little... perfunctory Therriault's Dr. Foley gives us a disturbingly terrific secondary villain, and again some very funny interactions with Chucky. And Fiona Dourif is just marvellous as our heroine. She won me over in Curse, and Cult does nothing to change that. All around she is just great.In the end, I found myself entertained throughout Cult of Chucky. It never bored me and didn't fail to deliver on any of the staples I've come to love in the franchise, it just didn't really live up to what I hoped it would be. The new twists and turns the film brought to the franchise were surprising and enticing and I'm still hoping we get a Chucky 8 to see where it all goes.",Cult of Chucky

But frankly the only reason these movies keep getting made is because of the franchise name Chucky. needless beheading from falling glass same as the hotel room scene in bride of chucky. the buried doll scene same as childs play 2 where he was buried in the backyard. Frankly Hollywood should stop with the series and just let it drown out cause they will never be able to top the first 2 Childs play movie and they had a good run but this movie wasn't needed to be done at all.,Cult of Chucky

It starts off with Andy's terrible acting with a date blah blah cuts to Andy taking the head of chucky on a stick out the safe . From here I knew what I was getting into . I don't understand if the movie was trying be horror and serious or comedy and horror, it's a mess. I couldn't help but to stand there with a s*** smelling face watching these ""actors"" trying to act. Mikah or whatever her name is, is locked up in a mental institution. She meets a strange group of people but let's face it , they're crazy we expect this. When she enters , all this strange s*** happens and my god it's like the staff is oblivious to everything that's going on . Man and does it get worse, we come to find out there's multiple chuckies,that's right, he can transfer his million pieces of soul to other bodies and get this, he finds the spell on the ""internet"". It's awful and he tortures this handicap chick trying to make her kill for...what? He transfers his soul to hers just because. Her and Jennifer tilly make out at the end because yeah . It's was stupid and just unnecessary and furthers ruin chuckies name. The acting is awful , the horror and gore is bad and it has no idea what it's trying do. Btw Andy tried to save the day and gets locked in the crazy room by mikah aka charles Lee ray , so I'm assuming they're going to blame him for all the murders which makes no sense because there's a doll he killed clearly in the same room with blood, skull and guts it but since this universal is ridiculous I'm sure the cops would shrug it off .

This entry had some promising fanservice with Alex Vincent and Christine Elise but was completely wasted. The movie also takes place in a mental hospital for the most part which doesn't work, Chucky gets very easy kills here since the patients including Fiona Dourif's character are unable to defend themselves either because they're too mentaly unstable or the latter who is in a wheelchair, you feel kinda bad for these people. The only character that was unlikeable was the shrink who was abusive. In the previous movies the majority of the characters that got killed were more than capable than defend themselves from the killer doll, here it's just depressing to watch. The idea that Chucky can possess multiple vessels is very confusing and a lazy idea as he claims he learned from the internet.Overrall this is a bad sequel like the last 3.

147,trevuar,"Great cinematography and audio, terrible film",3,27 November 2017,"There are so many problems with this film. The first glaring one is the script. The main character has things happen to them instead of them being in direct motion to stop, escape, win, or obtain something. When this happens in any script, we as an audience cease to care about what goes on because the whole experience feels out of control or distant. SPOILERS AHEAD--What should have been--Andy is in this movie, but that he isn't the main character. It would have done wonders for the script if there was an actual cult in search of Chucky's voodoo power. Parts of this movie would have fit so great with this idea. 1. Andy had the head of Chucky.It would make sense if an actual voodoo cult was after him. The cult's goal would be to learn the voodoo spell used by Charles Lee Ray to obtain immortality. (This movie doesn't really have a cult in it at all. It's just a flimsy excuse to show more than one chucky doll killing people).2. Andy was packing some serious firepower to fight anything or anyone who would come after him. It was really great to see all the weapons that he had acquired and the movie did a great job of him losing a relationship over his obsession with firearms. All of the build up and reveal of Andy was ruined when he surrenders himself in a really stupid way to attempt a really insane attack on the other dolls that he magically found out existed ( probably because he read the script -_-). This movie should have been about a real cult of people or even more dolls trying to kill Andy and free the original Chucky from his grasp. 3. The ending problemsWe have no reason to root for the protagonist or chucky for that matter.Andy is captured in the mental institution with no escape.Chucky escapes as a woman who we don't care about.Even if this ending was supposed to be tragic, we don't get to know Andy better and we certainty don't care enough about Nica to hope for her escape.

It was so confusing with all the different dolls running around being the same person. It doesn't really make sense how they would all be the same guy, but in different places.

Not only is the effect's of Cult of Chucky worse then the old movies but some how the writer just found out it was time to ruin the entire storyline and rules for the voodoo in all the past movies which made me wanna slap Don Mancini so hard in the face and made me feel cheated for paying to see a child's play movie without any sense to it.. Don Mancini should never direct another movie and the storyline for this one is made in 20 minutes just to bait people on the title so they will go watch it.. All in all... We need to realize that the movie series is dead and i hope you didn't waste your money and time on this movie because it will make you cry or fall asleep,Cult of Chucky
162,lashayfairley,All I can say is Wtf!!!!!!,2,22 October 2017,Spoiler alert!!!!! OK id know what happened with the last one but the story is everywhere doesn't make even sense anymore I was really disappointed with the cult.. OK I love the first two child play and I love the curse it was pretty good but the seed and bride and now the cult are horrible in my opinionOK so the cult.... chucKY can be in more in one dolls I'm so confused with that because I thought his soul was stuck in the doll aND I like they bring Andy I wish he had more scenes definitely with nica I thought they both was going to be kicking ass in the movie together sorry about my English just really disappointed with this one and the plot was just horrible to me... In my opinion I wish they started off as Nica being denial that chucky is real and she blames herself for her family death and chucky is on his way to kill nica and Andy finds out about chucky is on his way to find nica and decides to put his self in the insane asylum with nica and trying to convince she didn't do it and it was chucky kill her family and they both try to destroy chucky like something like that,Cult of Chucky
163,shehlaali,very disappointing,1,4 January 2018,This movie is not like original ones poor characters no story just profanity make a horror movie like conjuring that broke all records.,Cult of Chucky
164,bm-73971,Classic Fun!,9,9 October 2017,"To begin, I really enjoyed the opening. I like how they touched on Andy's life since Chucky, i.e (background checks before dates, ""you googled me didn't you?"" etc) Really wish there would have been more Andy, but I like the new cast too. Nica (Fiona Dourif) was excellent, just as she was in Curse. How they thought a wheelchair bound woman was capable of such a massacre is beyond me, but she hinged between crazy/not crazy and did a great job doing so. The setting was also brilliant, who isn't a little uneasy about an insane asylum? The patients we portrayed perfectly, each one crazier than the last. The kills were classic Chucky, gory and brutal, there is even a callback to one Tiffany pulled off in Bride Of Chucky. This film definitely went back to the roots, less humor, more terror. However this film beautifully blended the two and even threw in some familiar faces! Gotta love Jennifer Tilley! In conclusion, this film is a great installment into the Chucky franchise, not the best of the bunch but definitely up there. The story was great and held together throughout the film, the acting was great, the effects were great, and the ending was great with a humorous twist! So forget the naysayers and enjoy this film! 9 out of 10 because I didn't want it to end!",Cult of Chucky
165,jameswdevine,'Cult of Chucky' FrightFest Premiere Review: A Good Guy Fun Ride!',9,25 August 2017,"Back at the start of July I managed to secure tickets to the opening day of FrightFest 2017. As soon as I heard Cult of Chucky was going to be having its World Premiere there, I jumped at the chance and paid money for a day pass even though this was the only movie on Thursday that I REALLY needed to see. Like hell was I risking the single tickets not being available and me missing the chance to see Chucky back on the big screen. The PositiveLike all of the Chucky films, Brad Dourif is an absolute delight as the voice of our favourite killer doll. I really felt that the events that transpired in the movie aided in showing how much passion Mr. Dourif still has for voicing the character and the range he has as a voice actor. I'll keep my praise in the family and say that I was a huge fan of Fiona Dourif as the returning character Nica, who has some VERY interesting character development throughout the movie whilst coming to terms with her actions in Curse of Chucky and facing Chucky once more.Unlike most sequels that seem to throw continuity out, this movie does great job at throwing back to the previous entries in the franchise in subtle, yet fun, ways! (there may even be a cameo or two).One thing I was extremely happy about was the amount of gore and practical effects used in the movie. There is no noticeable CGI Chucky like the one in Curse and it looked like the majority of the Chucky doll scenes were done using animatronics and puppetry.The gore in the movie is on point and not overused to the point of overkill. I mean, don't get me wrong, there are some pretty brutal kill scenes, but not gallon upon gallon of blood split and spraying all over the place.Don Mancini was so passionate about the franchise he built when he was doing the Q&A and urged the fans in the room to go out and support this one so that they can continue telling the story we were left with at the end, although I won't be divulging that information until October.The NegativeMy main gripe with the movie is that it felt lacking in the plot department. A lot of new concepts were introduced but with little explanation, although Don did say these would be addressed in a future installment if this one performs with the fans.Fans of Bride and Seed will be happy to know that Chucky is at his witty best, but I know that a lot of fans take issue with the mixture of both humour and horror. Although the effects were great, there were still one or two set pieces that looked a little off but I can appreciate that this is a low budget affair when you compare it to current Hollywood horror movies.It is a solid entry in a franchise that is already six installments strong and it also manages to breathe new life into what most may think is a tired concept. I firmly believe both fans of the original Child's Play series and Bride, Seed, and Curse of Chucky will be very happy at what is on display in this installment and will be begging for another one come closing credits.",Cult of Chucky
166,abthomson,"One huge step forward with the last sequel, and now one huge step back with this one..",4,3 October 2017,"Let me first say, CURSE of Chucky was a classic sequel and completely made up for its last embarrassing disaster of a film, known as Seed of Chucky. It returned to its creative horror roots but still with some comic elements, which is understandable, as you can't take a movie about a talking killer doll too seriously. The only thing I didn't like was the CGI Chucky, which made him look too animated and less terrifying. But with how good the film was overall, I completely forgave that. Now CULT of Chucky just reduced its way back to Seed's level, but it's still maybe better by a hair, at least. The supporting characters were very bland, uninteresting, and forgettable. The deaths were way too gory to the point of just looking ridiculously fake. The humor was cringey. There were no clever twists or suspenseful red herrings, just mindless kill after kill. And the absolute worst part was the ending, which I won't emphasize on for those who haven't seen this film yet. The only parts I enjoyed was Andy Barclay's return (perhaps my favorite part of it), Fiona and Brad Dourif's acting, and no CGI Chucky.It's sucks though, because I really wanted to love this 7th installment, being a huge fan of this franchise and all. On the brighter note, the ending does hint off another possible sequel, so I'm willing to give Mancini another chance. But hey, don't take my word for it. Go check out this film for yourself, as maybe you'll like it. Different strokes, different folks after-all.",Cult of Chucky
167,senthach,So lame..,3,25 September 2017,"Just seen this the other day.. it was horrible. The effects was so bad,movie is just an excuse for a reboot as this movie doesn't even resolve anything instead it ends setting up for a sequel. One of the main characters in the series,Andy doesn't do anything either, movie builds him as the hero to come and kill all the chucky clones (yes clones, cos that happened) only to be locked up after a dumb little battle.. so lame. I don't understand how there is only like 5 people in the whole damn building either, and how no-one just kicks the silly doll.. it's a doll! The guy that gets ganged up on literally does nothing. He didn't even flinch n fight back when he gets attacked lol he could easily kicked all their doll assess.. so stupid. The deaths in this movie id straight up hilarious and b.s. especially the Asian.. also the *sex* scenes were unnecessary just makes things weird n now sense. This movie is bad, like all the chucky movies besides maybe the first One, even in that classic, the doll looks more legit n less effects.. don't watch this. Waste of time",Cult of Chucky
168,jorgeoliva-81306,Cult of Chucky,9,27 September 2017,"Before watching please note that if your big on gun right and frown upon homosexuality then like two scenes in the movie will peeve you off, but other then that the movie in my opinion lives up to the Childs Play movies and there is certainly a lot of homages to past films. the film overall does have its downsides but the comedy makes you laugh it all away. At the moment its interesting to see how it will play out especially now that Chucky has a nice little trick up his sleeve which makes him a bit more dangerous. !!!!Spoilers!!!! a certain doll does make an appearance towards the end that makes go ""oh snap"".",Cult of Chucky
169,rodrigodecastilla,Best Child's play since the original trilogy,9,27 September 2017,"This was an excellent example of what Don Mancini can create with the helping advise and requests from his fan base Spoilers AheadAs most of you know the movie takes place in a mental asylum, Nica the handicapped protagonist from the last film Curse of Chucky is serving her indefinite sentence in the cuckoo's nest because she was believed to have murdered her whole family and is now convinced of that she in fact did it. The film promises the return of the fan favorite character Andy (played by Alex Vincent) the little boy from the first two films and teenager in the third (Justin Whalin) he does make his return and it was amazingly spectacular his scenes were by far the best in the entire movie. Andy has interactions with Chucky from curse which now only a severed head chained up and kept in vault for Andy to speak to and torture which I find interesting as chucky killed Andy's childhood and now Andy can take his revenge.Another reason why I enjoyed the Andy Scenes was because of the references to the original trilogy like Andy's clothes from Kent Military school from child's play 3 but what disappoints is the fact that the movie promised Andy they did deliver but I feel they promised for more than what we got. I loved the concept for the multiple chuckies but what I disliked about them was the explanation for them in the lore of the movie we are told that chucky ""learned a new spell from voodoo for dummies.com"" I thought this was in some levels disrespectful to the fans because they couldn't come up with a better explanation for the Multi-chuckies Personally they could have made it so that chucky gives some blood to the different good guy dolls and then performs a ritual resulting in the dolls to have charles lee ray's soul. I Hated the good guy model from curse of chucky as it made chucky just so ugly but it has vastly improved in this film resembling the good guys from the original 3 films a lot more and hopefully it just keeps improving with the new movies. Overall I think this was a great film geared towards the hardcore fans but I felt there needed to be more time to tell the story as it ends with one hand chucky still at the asylum Buzz-Cut-Chuck being disemboweled by Andy and Nica being possessed by melted hand chucky later trapping Andy in the White room with the remains of my favorite short hair short lived chucky Buzz-cut-Chuck and the now possessed Nica running away with Tiffany. Hopefully we get Child's Play 8 to see Mancini's story Played out.P.S. Kyle Also a fan favorite from Child's play 2 comes at the end to torture severed head chucky as she has keeped in touch with Andy and Andy called her over to play with charles >:)",Cult of Chucky
170,lashaunajones,Lacked Umph,1,2 October 2017,"The only good thing about this movie was the ending, and by ending I mean the closing credits. Chunky has been a favorite of mines since childhood, so to see it end like this was a huge disappointment. I do however give the writers a small bit of props for the story line however the execution was terrible.",Cult of Chucky
171,montesoscar,Disappointing,5,3 October 2017,"When I heard that another Chucky film was coming out I was excited but after watching it I was disappointed. The movie's plot was kind of interesting especially if the title was named The Cult of Chucky so I sort of assumed there was gonna be some cult members of some kind but nahhh.I also thought that the story plot was gonna involve Andy and Nica working together to finally take out chucky once in for all since they were the only lasting survivors of his killing spree but again nahh. The fact that Andy didn't really do much in the film other than just torture a Chucky head and killed another Chucky. The fact that Nica was just in her wheelchair witnessing these murders and not really doing anything about it but just trying to convince people that chucky was alive just sucked there could've been more to make her character look stronger even if she is a wheelchair. In the seed of chucky he asked what was so great of being human that you get old and die but yet in this film he posses Nica so I'm guessing there wont be an explanation for that? The good parts of the film was Brad voicing Chucky he's amazing, the kills were good, and they had a few good jokes here and there, and seeing some of the old cast like Alex and Fiona to return was nice as for Jennifer Tily yeah she's okay she just had 3 scenes and was just there to help chucky the usual.",Cult of Chucky
172,chuckysu,A true classic never goes out of style!,10,4 October 2017,"When I though Curse of Chucky was great, now comes Cult of Chucky is simply awesome! Chucky comes back with multiple dimensions (both physically & mentally) to haunt his old time Nemesis and a couple of psychiatric people.Pros: 1. You can to see how original actor, Andy(from Child's Play) meeting Nica (from Curse) interacting with each other2. A series of different Chuckys!3. Jennifer Tilly brings is back with her stylish horror suspense!Cons: Viewers who did not watch the previous sequel may not relate to the inside jokes. Conculsion If you are already a Chucky fan, you will love the show! if not, start from Bride of Chucky!",Cult of Chucky
173,knuxte-81778,Gotta say - this film was so much more than I expected,9,4 October 2017,"I'm not a huge fan of the movie series but this movie truly ties all the previous films together except for Seed of Chucky- which I have a feeling they're going to implement down the road if they make another sequel. I love the fact that the director has lately moved away from the Hollywood system and is doing is keeping an independent scene. I just wish that the characters could visit more of the outside world like they did in Child's Play 1, 2, Bride of Chucky- that's the only criticism I can get it. I hope Don Mancini keeps pushing himself to dish out a finale or something where he goes after Tyler from the 3rd film. The end is definitely a shocker and worth seeing....but I'm not going to spoil it.",Cult of Chucky
174,crystal-foster,Missed opportunity (Spoilers!!),5,23 October 2017,"It was alright if watching it for the sake of watching it however they really could have expanded on the 2nd movie with this one. Instead of having Chucky locate a voodoo spell online to split himself to other dolls and people... They should have paid tribute to the second movie. It was set up so perfectly with the psychologist saying ""2% of the dolls are named 'Chucky."" Let me take you back for a moment, in the second film Chucky was melted down and made into other dolls and now I'm sure your seeing how they could have done this a lot better just in that detail. For those of you are not seeing the potential the original Chucky could have been spread between the batch that was made using him in the mixture. This would explain the 2% of dolls naming themselves 'Chucky.' As for how they all were not murdering they could have required an activation of some sort. That is the only thing that really annoyed me but other than that it was decent in my tired state anyway.",Cult of Chucky
175,athlete-93050,How does this have a rating over 2?????????,1,24 October 2017,"Cult of Chucky is awful..just awful. I'm not sure what movie people watched to give this a rating above 2 or 3. Annoys me just to see people saying they liked this movie. They must have no knowledge of the first 3. This movie has terrible acting, terrible dialogue, and just plain terrible writing. It's a slap in the face to the real Child's Play fans out there. The fact that chucky can now switch bodies and some how be in multiple dolls at once is appalling. The movie just looks cheap in every way possible. How do the first 3 movies, have better special FX than these newer ones? Too much CGI just makes the movie look cheap. Hate the fact that in these new movies Chucky doesn't look as ugly or scary as he did in the earlier films and doesn't seem to get as angry either. I will probably never watch this movie again just like seed of Chucky. This movies has ultimately ruined the Chucky franchise for good.",Cult of Chucky
176,jazzarroyo,One of my favorite Chucky movies,9,30 November 2017,"What it seemed like they did with this movie was try to bring back that suspenseful, more serious story line of the first movies and unlike with The Curse of Chucky, this one definitely didn't feel like it dragged as much. The reason this is one of my favorite of the Child's Play franchise isn't because of its rock solid story line, deep characters, or thrill. I enjoyed this movie purely for the reason that it was so poorly executed that it was hysterical. This is not a movie that you watch to get a real immersive story. This is the movie you watch with close friends or family with a sense of humor. I mean honestly if you watch this movie from a very critical stand point you are going to regret all of your life choices leading up to the moment you watched this movie.This movie really pushes the boundaries on what is believable in an already outlandish plot. I mean, with the way this asylum is run its a surprise there wasn't any murders previously. Its shocking that this place was even there to be used for the murders because in any reasonable place, it would've been shut down a long time ago. And if you were watching this movie just for Andy's return, be prepared to see him act like a complete creep in the first ten minutes of the movie while assuring his date that he isn't crazy before heading home to torture and share a joint with the head of the doll who murdered everyone around him and ruined his life. And then he just stops being part of the movies except for those times the writer remembered that Andy was in the story too. And let's not even get to his giant, heavily anticipated plan to destroy the other Chuckies. Because one murderous doll definitely wasn't enough. The deeper into the movie you get the more and more the plot just falls apart and it adds up less and less.However! All of these issues just add up into a terribly laughable movie that you get to enjoy joking about with your friends. They definitely missed the mark on horror/thriller, but they hit the bulls-eye on horror/comedy. Honestly though everybody, after Bride of Chucky (a much better movie in my humble opinion), who actually expected this one to be any kind of serious movie? At least it's better than Seed of Chucky. This movie is not going to impress you with its prowess, it is going to impress you with its ridiculousness.",Cult of Chucky
177,yokeleyjackie,Wtf,1,15 March 2018,I thought the movie was horrible. I didn't get why they used the old chucky in the first one and not use the chucky they uses when he had his arm chopped off by Glenn. It would look scarier cause his arm was cut off and he only had 1 arm... So basically the movie sucked!!!,Cult of Chucky
178,dervovic,✅🎞,4,14 September 2019,"The first thing I want to say is that the movie is really good.
The script is very goodActing is very good-The director also did a really good job.
(Fiona Dourif) For such a role that is ""immobile"" she again manages to delight people with her acting.
Especially who I have to point out is (Brad Dourif) who did more than good voices for Chucky, which is a very great and in my opinion a key part of the movie.
The studio and the people who worked on the technological and robotic parts of Chucky also did an extraordinary and very demanding job.
I could write for days about a lot of good things in movie, but when we put it all together the movie is perfect.",Cult of Chucky
