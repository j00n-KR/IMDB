0,MartinHafer,I am surprised it took me so long to finally see this one.,6,26 November 2019,"Although I am not a huge action film fan, I am surprised that it took me 32 years to finally see ""Lethal Weapon"". After all, it's a rather iconic 80s film...the sort insane film buffs (like me) have likely seen. So, to correct this oversight, I'm finally seeing the picture...and fortunately just in time for the holidays since the film is set around Christmas.The film is the first of four ""Lethal Weapon"" films starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover...and there's also a 2016 remake starring an all-new cast.When the story begins, Riggs (Gibson) is living a pathetic life. Following his wife's death, he spends his time drinking heavily and feeling sorry for himself. He also is suicidal--and takes all sorts of insane risks as a cop. After all, if he dies, he really wouldn't mind it at all. Because he is so unstable, he's just been assigned a new partner, Sergeant Murtaugh (Glover). While this pairing might seem like a bad thing for Murtaugh since his new partner is so unhinged, it turns out to be a blessing. After all, Riggs is an amazing cop...and Murtaugh needs all the help he can get with a new case involving an old friend's daughter who kills herself at the beginning of the film. Why does he need so much help? Because the death is somehow related to a vicious gang of heroin dealers...and they're more than willing to kill anyone who learns of their operation.""Lethal Weapon"" is definitely a turn off your brain and enjoy sort of movie--especially the final third of the film. Too often, the film relies on explosions, giant fight scenes and crazy stunts...and this is why I enjoyed the set up for the story but overall could only give the picture a 6. With scenes such as crashing a police car into Murtaugh's house, cars that explode and the insane (and rather stupid) fist fight at the end, the movie chose again and again to offer stunts and explosions at the expense of logic and the story. Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film...but it's an excessive one whose violence doesn't enhance the picture (unlike in ""Die Hard""...where the excesses MAKE the movie). Worth seeing but far from a must-see.",Lethal Weapon
1,TheLittleSongbird,Action and buddy cop magic,8,10 July 2017,"'Lethal Weapon' may have spawned three sequels and a TV series, but even 30 years later shines heads and shoulders over the rest of the films. It is not a perfect film, not by any stretch of the imagination, but it was hugely influential in the development of the buddy-cop film and to this day is one of the better examples of it.Yes, it is implausible to the maximum and sometimes overblown, but the overblown nature to me and many others was part of the entertainment and wasn't that distracting. The implausibility is not quite as forgivable, with 'Lethal Weapon' being at its weakest in the script. Not that the script is terrible or anything, a lot of it is smart, very funny and crackles with wit, especially in the chemistry between Gibson and Glover, but sometimes the convolution and repetition reaches fever pitch.Mitchell Ryan is the other weak link. Despite being the head villain, the character is forgettable somewhat and Ryan is both pantomimic and dull (that may sound oxymoronic but both extremes together are possible, indicating an inconsistent performance). Look at other reviews of the film, and one gets the sense that Mr Joshua, the henchman, is far more memorable (which he is) and sees near-unanimous praise for Gary Busey for good reason, who is at his villainous best here being ruthlessly cold and chilling.It's not just Busey that makes 'Lethal Weapon' such a pleasure. As good as he is, he isn't even the best thing about it. Those three best things are the action, the chemistry between Gibson and Glover and the performances of the two.The action is slick and bursts with excitement and tension, some of it is overblown but deliciously so. It is very easy to see why the chalk and cheese chemistry of the polar opposite characters of Riggs and Murtaugh became so popular, very rarely in a buddy-cop film has this kind of chemistry been so entertaining and perfectly pitched.Gibson's performance here as the loose-cannon of the two is one of his best, a performance of wit, melancholy and great intensity. Glover has the no-nonsense and by-the-book character and is just as spirited while being more subtle. The story may seem familiar by today's standards and is not exceptional structurally, but back then there were not many films with the kind of story 'Lethal Weapon' had and the film was so influential that the number of buddy-cop films increased and the film was parodied a fair bit (like in National Lampoon's 'Loaded Weapon 1', one of those films that has seen me going against the grain and enjoying despite its faults).As said, there are parts of the script that work well, while Richard Donner directs with an assured hand and the way 'Lethal Weapon' is shot and designed screams slick and stylish, still looking good 30 years on. Was expecting Michael Kamen and Eric Clapton's music to jar considering their other work (style-wise that is) and reading up on how it was orchestrated and used, but actually it added a lot to the atmosphere and had an atmospheric groove.In conclusion, great fun and magic in the case of the action, the buddy-cop chemistry and the two lead performances. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Lethal Weapon
2,bkoganbing,Incredibly reckless,7,3 April 2017,"Lethal Weapon actually starts out as a serious film where Mel Gibson is an officer so despondent over the loss of his wife that he engages in incredibly reckless behavior. When that doesn't get him a line of duty death for a bit you see him contemplating suicide. No one will work with him and Danny Glover newly assigned to him is having second, third, and fourth thoughts. But they gradually warm up to each other as Glover and his family kind of provide a new stability for him. Also that shared Vietnam experience.That Vietnam thing comes in handy on the case these two have now. A former Army General who had a kind of stealth command of assassins Mitchell Ryan has gone heavy into the drug business via the contacts he made in Vietnam. His top assassin Gary Busey is his number two. These two think that Gibson and Glover got certain information about a big shipment coming in that their partner here told them before he was killed. That sets up all the action which is a cross between the Dirty Harry and the Indiana Jones features. The first Lethal Weapon got an Oscar nomination for Sound. Not sure if the three succeeding films got that kind of recognition. But they made money.",Lethal Weapon
3,Leofwine_draca,"Good, but not great...you had to wait until the sequel for that",6,25 May 2017,"LETHAL WEAPON is the film that kick-started the popular franchise and helped to usher in a new wave of buddy-buddy comedy cop movies. Watching it today, it does feel a little slow and dated in parts, with often laboured comedy and plotting that takes a long time to get anywhere. The reason the film still works lies in the casting of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, two underrated actors who share an irresistible camaraderie.You know the score by now: Gibson's the crazy one (and never crazier than here), Glover the straight man, his by-the-book partner. The latter in particular is excellent, boosting the humour quotient of any given situation. The big stunt and explosion scenes are all well and good, although this doesn't really quality as an action flick until the last half hour, which has some good shoot-outs and a memorable torture-by-electrocution set-piece featuring DIE HARD's Al Leong. Gary Busey's larger-than-life baddie is the scene-stealer here, so it's a pity about all that doubling and dated choreography in the final scene.",Lethal Weapon
4,SnoopyStyle,Great team chemistry,8,1 January 2014,"This is the quintessential buddy cop duo. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) is a suicidal disturbed cop suffering with his wife's death. Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is the veteran unlucky enough to be assigned to partner up with Riggs. Murtaugh's Vietnam war buddy had a daughter who was killed. They investigate and find a conspiracy of drug smugglers.Mel Gibson does great crazy. Only years later do we see him do it real life. Mel has interior intensity that serves him well over the years. This one is no exception. Danny Glover plays the opposite. Murtaugh's catch phrase ""I'm too old for this sht!"" says it all. Together they form a great Hollywood cop team. Certainly they have enough chemistry for countless sequels.",Lethal Weapon
5,Horst_In_Translation,"Occasionally drifts too much into pointless action territory, but overall a decent watch",6,15 June 2017,"""Lethal Weapon"" is an American 110-minute film from 1987, so this one has its 20th anniversary this year. The writer is Shane Black and he was still very young back then, in his 20s, and this was his very first writing credit. Quite a way to start a career, isn't it. The director was Richard Donner and he is a bit on the opposite side. Close to the age of 90 today he was way into his 50s already when he made this one. The stars here are of course the two lead actors Gibson and Glover and the fact that Gibson is first credit says a lot already about his fame and popularity back then, even if he was still really young, but obviously very easy on the eye. Anyway, he plays a character who suffers terribly from the death of his significant other and his new partner (played by Glover) is a member of a big intact family. So things may become complicated when these two are instructed to work together as a team and they do and they get closer despite Gibson's character's suicidal tendencies. Together the two go up against a gang of drug smugglers who even kidnap Glover's character's daughter. Even if things were not always looking that way, there is a happy end eventually. This film was successful enough for 3 sequels to be made, all of these also starring the duo of lead actors we have in here.Black cop, white cop films were popular back then as for example also Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy made a fairly famous film back then, two actually I think, even if the old cop was the white one there. By the way, Glover plays a character who is considerably older than he was back then. Anyway, the story is all a bit generic I must say, a bit too much focus on action and heartbreaking stuff without truly having the depth to pull it off. But it's the individual scenes that make this film somehow a success, like the one with the other suicidal guy early on. The second half felt relatively empty to me I must say, which is quite a shame as the initial premise and some of the plot developments did not look bad. Still in the end, I guess I will be a bit generous here and still give the film a positive rating and recommendation. Even with the villains being really boring for the most part and not half as memorable as they could have been with better writing and/or acting, Gibson is just too much of a cool cat to not enjoy this film, quite a while before his days as an Oscar-winning filmmaker himself. ""Lethal Weapon"" gets a thumbs-up from me, even if I must say that it did not get me curious about any of the sequels at all and I am pretty sure I will not check them out too soon.",Lethal Weapon
6,classicsoncall,"""You ever met anybody that you didn't kill?""",7,12 September 2017,"Every once in a while I don't mind kicking back, suspending disbelief, and enjoying a mindless action film like ""Lethal Weapon"". You have to realize of course, that no human being can withstand the kind of punishment a guy like Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) endures and then get up the next day feeling good as new. For the sake of these action flicks you just have to go with it, and as long as the story is OK, you'll be fine.I liked the camaraderie that developed between the suicidal Riggs and his newly assigned partner Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). It evolved over the course of the story with each man earning the respect and gratitude of the other after several life defying situations. If you're paying attention though, a few questions will pop up. Like when Riggs tells Roger that the guy who shot at him on the street was the same guy who tried to kill him from the helicopter. Considering the distance involved, there's no way Riggs could have seen Joshua (Gary Busey) well enough to be able to identify him on the chopper.Then there's the scene in the desert when Riggs takes up a position to watch Roger's back as he makes contact with The General's (Mitchell Ryan) men. Except for some scrub ground cover, what would have prevented Riggs from seeing The General sneak up on him? If you think about it too much, some of the movie's tension just falls away in the clear light of day.I'll say this for Mel Gibson though, that scene when he was contemplating suicide showed a remarkable range in the man's talent as an actor. Glover's character wasn't called on to get that emotional, but he managed to deliver his role with some finesse as well. As a team, they're an effective pair once all the trouble goes down, with an attitude well reflected by that tattoo on Riggs' arm that says 'Never Quit'.",Lethal Weapon
7,gavin6942,Modern Action Classic,8,28 July 2012,"A veteran cop, Murtough (Danny Glover), is partnered with a young homicidal cop, Riggs (Mel Gibson). Both having one thing in common, hating working in pairs. Now they must learn to work with one and other to stop a gang of drug smugglers.Plain and simple, this is a great action film. A great film in general? Maybe, maybe not. But plenty of fights, guns, dark humor, and enough memorable scenes that this film has been parodied far too many times. Perhaps it was parodied best on ""Always Sunny"". The Chinese torture scene? Classic. The line about being ""too old""? Everybody knows that line.Gary Busey has said this is the film that revived his career. Oddly enough, I do not think Busey's role is all that memorable. Sure, he is the primary villain, but he does not do much to make himself more than the average bad guy. Today, his craziness has far eclipsed his role here and he is now remembered as ""the crazy guy"" rather than the villain from ""Lethal Weapon"". Oh well.Upon repeat viewings, the film gets better and better, and really exemplifies what was right about 1980s action films. Sure, it is not realistic (no department would allow an officer to kill so many crooks), but it is darn entertaining.",Lethal Weapon
8,jboothmillard,Lethal Weapon,7,12 September 2005,"I knew I had to see this film again to really get a good opinion of it, and when I got the opportunity I wasn't going to miss it, from director Richard Donner (Superman, The Omen). Basically recently turned 50 family man cop Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is partnered up with Vietnam veteran and suicidal (since the death of his wife Victoria 'Vicky') cop Sergeant Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson). Together they are on a mission to stop crime in the local area, but more importantly to investigate a drugs (mainly heroin) ring and track the gang, known as Shadow Company down. Of course the gang's leader General Peter McAllister (Mitchell 'Mitch' Ryan) wants them dead, no matter what, so gun fights and explosions are to be expected along the way as Murtaugh and Riggs slowly get to like each other and go against the bad guys. Also starring Gary Busey as Mr. Joshua, Tom Atkins as Michael Hunsaker, Darlene Love as Trish Murtaugh, Traci Wolfe as Rianne Murtaugh, Jackie Swanson as Amanda Hunsaker, Damon Hines as Nick Murtaugh, Ebonie Smith as Carrie Murtaugh, Lycia Naff as Dixie and Steve Kahan as Captain Ed Murphy. The comedic buddy theme is very good between Gibson and Glover, the action and thrills are pretty good too, it is an enjoyable film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound. Mel Gibson was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Lethal Weapon
9,rmax304823,Not To Be Taken Seriously.,6,25 February 2012,"A commercial product that, if you want to be distracted from your troubles, will get the job done.Bourgeois plain clothes detective Danny Glover is partnered with the semi-suicidal Mel Gibson. This gives us the mis-matched buddy element. Glover is the loving family guy, and there's a delicious moment on his 50th birthday when his wife and three kids burst into the bathroom and give him hugs and kisses. Before leaving, his beautiful teen age daughter chides him because his beard is turning gray. Lots of well wishes and kisses and when they're gone, Glover turns his head slowly and gazes ruefully at his beard in the mirror. Fifty is the age at which the years go by so quickly that if they zipped along any faster they'd reach the speed of light and acquire infinite mass.We are introduced to Gibson waking up naked in his trailer on the beach, the TV still going from the night before. He slouches to the reefer, a butt hanging from his mouth, and gurgles down a bottle of beer. His wife was killed in an auto accident and ""he might just be psychotic."" Later, he puts his pistol and his mouth and the musical score warns us that this is a serious moment but we don't believe it because we know damned well that Mel Gibson is not going to blow his inion off less than half-way through the movie.Anyway, his self-destructive tendencies only provide the excuse for his outrageous behavior. He and Glover, naturally, don't get along. Gibson shoots first, while Glover doesn't want to make waves. Glover is also black, while Gibson is Gibson. But -- not to worry. At the end, their arms around each other, they enjoy the warmth of Glover's hearth during Christmas dinner.The film gives the viewer the impression that the primary job of Los Angeles police detectives is to shoot guns. They shoot all the time, all kinds of guns. Gibson is a crack shot, having been a member of one of those special ops organizations in Vietnam. His gun looms large in his legend.I think the story and dialog would be pruned today. This was released in 1987 and we've been possessed by the dybbuk of political correctness in a major way since then. I don't think Gibson would be allowed to smoke once in a while. Streng verboten. And when Glover is rolling all over Gibson, trying to extinguish his burning jacket, I doubt that Gibson would be allowed to crack, ""What are you, a fag?"" I don't know about the intimated attraction between Glover's pretty young daughter, Darlene Love, and Gibson. Love is an attractive and sexy girl and the producers and director know it, otherwise they wouldn't have her running around in a tiny slip or tied up and threatened with rape by the bad guys. ""Lethal Weapon 2"" might have been an interesting sequel had Gibson courted and married Love after she graduated from high school. I don't know how well that would have sat with some of the pertinent demographics.It's an exciting and diverting movie but it's really dumb too. The arrest of the evil Gary Busey is postponed while -- surrounded by cops and blazing lights on the front lawn -- Busey is loosed from his bonds to have a talent contest with Gibson to see who is the better martial arts expert. Gibson wins of course, partly by bumping his forehead hard against Busey's Here is Newton's third law of motion: ""The mutual forces of action and reaction between two bodies are equal, opposite and collinear."" That means that if you jar the other guy's brain with your head, your brain is just as jarred. Anyway, this martial arts jamboree resembles in no way what we were taught in boot camp. The fight would have been over in ten seconds, the instant one guy gouged his opponent's eyeball out.As the sensible cop, Glover is pretty good. He has considerable range as an actor. Catch him as the laid-back serial murderer in ""Switchback."" Gibson, I always have trouble with because his delivery of lines, especially wisecracks, seems so suggestive of ""acting."" There's no real point in going on about the plot, which has to do with some heroin importing business left over from Vietnam. It's no more than a peg to hang the action on.",Lethal Weapon
10,Tweekums,A great '80s action movie,9,29 December 2011,"The 'Lethal Weapon' series is often remembered for the comedy aspects of the later episodes but even though the first instalment contains a few good laughs it is much darker in tone than the various sequels. That tone is set by the opening scene where we see a beautiful young woman jump to her death from a tall building; It looks like suicide except the drugs she had taken had been adulterated. One of the cops to attend the scene is Roger Murtaugh who just happened to have had a call from the girl's father, an old war buddy, that morning. This being Hollywood there are no coincidences and Roger and his new partner must investigate. His new partner is Martin Riggs, a cop on the edge with suicidal tendencies who is potentially a danger to those around him. As the two of them investigate the girl's death they stumble upon a trail that will lead them to confront a drug gang made up of former special-forces personnel who learnt their trade during the war in Vietnam.Made in a time before action movies were packed with CGI this film is packed with action that looks real; whether it is hand to hand combat, shootouts or exploding cars. The story is gripping and packed with great characters; leads Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are great as Riggs and Murtaugh but it is Gary Busey who plays the sinister Mr. Joshua who steals every scene he is in. As well as the great action there are some nice laughs although they don't feel forced like the gags in later films in the series. If you like action films this is a must see!",Lethal Weapon
11,BA_Harrison,One of my all-time favourite 80s action films with a two word title.,8,28 September 2013,"Lethal Weapon has some of the worst incidental music I have ever heard in a film—random widdly guitar and god-awful tuneless saxophone warbling that I found grating even back in the 80s when such things were considered cool. It also features an unnecessarily drawn out shot of Mad Mel's bare ass and some gratuitous mullet action (also courtesy of Mel).Despite this, the film remains one of my all-time favourite 80s action films with a two word title (after Die Hard, of course) thanks to its stars' wonderful chemistry, the witty script by Shane Black, top direction from Richard Donner and several supporting actors so awesome that, as legend has it, if all three were to appear on-screen at the same time, time and space would simply cease to exist.For the record, that potentially catastrophic triumvirate of top talent consists of toothy, crazy cult actor Gary Busey as albino killer Joshua, white-haired, mustachioed character actor Tom Atkins as soon-to-be-dead-guy, and everybody's favourite on-screen terrorist Al Leong as Endo the torturer. With guys like that in the film, it's worth putting up with Gibson's arse for a while.",Lethal Weapon
12,Quinoa1984,One of the best action films of all,9,23 September 2000,"Richard Donner's Lethal Weapon is a film bombarded by action, plot and clever characters.  In a sense, this is a little like Raiders of the Lost Ark with a load of action, with a plot and characters to match.  Here, we meet 2 actors who, while are celebrities now, we're sort of celebrities back in the day.  These 2 guys are Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as a loose cannon (Martin Riggs) and a aging family man (Roger Murtaugh) who team up to stop a gang of drug dealers.

Possibly, Mr. Gibson is mooning over the death of his wife, some years earlier. Both Gibson and new crime-fighting partner Danny Glover (as Roger Murtaugh) served time in Vietnam. Gibson brings a Vietnam War-like style of fighting to the streets of Los Angeles, but Mr. Glover is a little more laid-back.

Gibson tells Glover the police department thinks he's either suicidal or trying for a ""psycho pension."" Although different, the cops bond.

15,hitchcockthelegend,We got the edge Cochise.,8,18 June 2009,"Close to retirement, Detective Sergeant Roger Murtaugh is a bit disturbed to find he's breaking in a new partner. Even more so when it turns out to be fellow Detective Martin Riggs, who since the death of his wife has scant regard for life, his own or those around him.Light on plot and character development, Lethal Weapon none the less shines bright as a beacon of how a buddy buddy action film should be done. Roughly an hour and forty five minutes of quips, action, villainy, heroics and cross generational/cultural divides. All what else is needed is a star duo with buoyant chemistry - thankfully Richard Donner's movie has it by the clip load.Mel Gibson is Riggs, a trigger happy suspected loony on the ragged edge, wonderfully playing off of Danny Glover's (superb) ""too old for this nonsense"" sage old copper. Riggs is a hard dude who quickly became a cinematic hero to many, an unstoppable force with a quip on the tongue and a glint in his eye, to which Gibson is terrific and perfectly cast.Gary Busey's ""psycho's are us"" henchman flits in and out the picture with gleeful nastiness and Shane Black's script crackles as the super stunt work starts to take a hold. Chief villain Mitchell Ryan as The General is almost a bystander though, and there's the odd piece of careless editing, but really Lethal Weapon has a winning formula that the box office punters promptly lapped up.Three sequels, all of which are of differing quality, would follow it, but this is a template movie for the genre and worthy of nostalgic revisits any time of day. 8/10",Lethal Weapon

They're both Vietnam veterans and detectives on the L.A. police force. Roger is a stable family man, while Martin has been incredibly *unstable* ever since the death of his wife. As we see, Martin seems to have developed something of a death wish, and he's often acting recklessly. But the two of them end up working well together as they investigate the death of a young woman who took a nose dive from a massive apartment block. As it turns out, this ties into a much bigger case involving international drug smuggling.""Lethal Weapon"" is, quite simply, one of the kings in this particular sub genre of action and comedy known as the ""buddy"" movie. With a frequently funny Shane Black screenplay that has its fair share of quotable lines, it perfected a formula that has been imitated many, many times since, but has seldom been equalled. Gibson and Glover are indeed a wonderful team, their well defined personalities clashing in lively and sometimes humorous fashion. Glover is appropriately solid as a rock, and Gibson has fun with his colorful role. Directed with maximum efficiency by veteran mainstream filmmaker Richard Donner, it really does move along at a blazing speed, especially if you've seen it before and know what to expect. The action and violence are first rate, and the movie does have pathos going for it as well.Of course, as with so many movies, it always helps to have great villains. And Mitchell Ryan and Gary Busey admirably fill the bill. It's very cool to see a fairly fit Busey sink his teeth into the part of a stone cold psycho henchman who proves his loyalty to Ryan in a memorable scene early on.Contrasting with Riggs' unhappy home life is the bright, cheerful suburban existence of Rogers' family. Singer Darlene Love and the very sexy Traci Wolfe shine as Murtaughs' wife and daughter. Wolfe is particularly cute when her character develops a bit of a crush on Riggs.There are a great deal of familiar faces in roles big and small. Tom Atkins is wonderful as Murtaughs' old Army buddy. Other people you may recognize are Jackie Swanson, Don Gordon, Jimmie F. Skaggs, Blackie Dammett, Mary Ellen Trainor, Steve Kahan, Jack Thibeau, Grand L.

19,zardoz-13,Good Buddy Cop Movie!!!,8,14 December 2013,"""Omen"" director Richard Donner finally hit it really big after toiling in the entertainment industry for decade without recognition when he helmed the first ""Lethal Weapon"" movie in the four movie franchise. Mel Gibson was already a star when he played Lieutenant Martin Riggs, but ""Lethal Weapon"" made him into a superstar along with Danny Glover as his partner Detective Roger Murtaugh. Initially, ""Lethal Weapon"" looked like just another cop buddy partner epic, but the charismatic coupling of the haywire Riggs and the down-to-earth Murtaugh gave the movie a flavor that tasted good. Riggs is the cop that nobody wants to work with; he is the cop who has gone beyond the pale. In a way, he is a shorter version of ""Dirty Harry"" with many of Harry's problems, including the death of his wife. The villains are hard as nails and the action is ultra-cool thanks to Donner's first-class helming. The opening scene with the girl who dives off the apartment building balcony is cool. Meantime, Riggs is just off the rails enough to turn any shoot-out into a massacre. ""Lethal Weapon"" and its kick-ass sequels is mandatory watching for anybody that loves cop movies. The final fight with Gary Busey on the front lawn is terrific as is Riggs' escape from the bad guys. Not to be missed!!!",Lethal Weapon

The acting was good from the whole cast, the characters well developed and the action on point. Glover and Gibson had good banter playing opposite style police officers.

The reason for this is very simple; Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Richard Donner. The three of them form a golden trio and makes the movie entertaining and memorable.To be honest the story of this movie is pretty standard action-movie stuff and fairly uninteresting to follow. But this is one of those movies were the story comes totally secondary and the power of the movie is in its main characters and their chemistry they have on the silver screen. They make you forget the story and make you sit back, relax and just enjoy this professionally made action-comedy.Both Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are acting wonderful in this movie. They are believable in their roles and give the characters some real depth and sense of credibility. It's rare for good actors to play the main role in action movies, since action movies (especially in the '80's) always have a though and cool main character in it. ""Lethal Weapon"" is an exception and it is an action movie with realistic main characters in it, of flesh and blood and with real emotions and personalities. It makes ""Lethal Weapon"" a very original action movies that has been much imitated ever since but has never been surpassed yet, by any other action movie franchise.Gary Busey plays a good typical 'Gary Busey villain role'. Whatever happened to his career by the way? I rarely ever see him in new movies anymore. A real shame because he is one of those typical actors that can basically play a villain in whatever movie comes on his path and whatever his role is.The action is fairly good but it's typical '80's stuff'. There are some spectacular sequences but in general it all is nothing really memorable. The main essence of the movie is truly on the entertainment value, rather than on its action.All in all this is a fun and entertaining action movie that is a 'classic' thanks to it's two main characters, perfectly played by Gibson and Glover, who have some great chemistry and thanks to Richard Donner's directing, who with this movie delivers yet another entertaining and fun movie that is very likable.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Lethal Weapon
22,view_and_review,Trend Setter,8,28 August 2019,"Riggs and Murtaugh changed the game for cop movies. They set the gold standard for a cop tandem. I can't think of a duo before them. Tibbs and Gillespie teamed up in In the Heat of the Night but it wasn't the same type of movie and that pairing was more accidental and impermanent. Dirty Harry had a few partners but 1.) his partnerships were very much a solo act with extra weight in tow and 2.) all his partners were either killed or injured.I'd say that Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) set the bar for a police pair and they were such a mismatch. Riggs was the younger, more athletic, very unstable partner who did things in an unorthodox manner. Murtaugh was the older, partially broken down, family man that seemed like he was just waiting for retirement. As we know by the three sequels that followed that retirement wasn't that close for him.Lethal weapon was a cool movie that gave us fighting, explosions, and shooting without it being overdone (much like in a movie I just saw called Hobbs and Shaw-or as I call it: How Many Things Can We Blow Up or Kill). The main characters were special, the story was a good one and the pacing was nice. This was a trend setter.",Lethal Weapon
23,anaconda-40658,Gibson is Lethal.,8,15 December 2015,"Lethal Weapon (1987): Dir: Richard Donner / Cast: Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Mitchell Ryan, Tom Atkins: Energizing action comedy about our inner demons. Mel Gibson plays cop Martin Riggs who mourns his wife's passing at the hands of a drunk driving incident. He is depressed and goes into dangerous situations that put his life in jeopardy at the expense of himself. He is a human hand grenade set to go off even when a gun is waved in his face. Danny Glover plays his new partner. He is married and has a couple children and is completely safe until Riggs heightens his nerves. The two have great comedic chemistry and are involved in a plot that began with a hooker dropping to her death from way high up in an effective opening. Gary Busey plays a psychotic villain with crazed eyes and a knack for making hits, including one that sent Riggs through a window. Other characters are not so broad. Mitchell Ryan plays another villain and has nowhere near the scene stealing ability that Busey possesses. Tom Atkins is another waste as the father of one of the female victims. He is in trouble for doing a botch job and will become a target. Unfortunately we feel nothing here. Otherwise the screenplay is written with skill and detail with Richard Donner adding another gem to Superman: The Movie and The Omen. Here he delivers something lethal with a few chuckles added in. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Lethal Weapon
24,HotToastyRag,A step above the usual buddy cop movies,8,17 October 2021,"It shows my youth, but the Lethal Weapon movies were before my time. For Danny Glover's week on Hot Toasty Rag, I attended history class and rented them. Mel Gibson's mullet, once his crowning glory, just seems funny today. It flops around behind him as he runs, as wild and crazy as the rest of his personality. But once I had my good laugh, I was able to sit back and really enjoy these movies.In the genre of buddy cop movies, these are so much fun! The first of the four establishes each character's backstory and motivation: Danny Glover is a devoted family man entering his senior years on the police force, and Mel Gibson is grieving over his dead wife. In the first movie, he seriously considers suicide and takes ridiculous risks on the job because he doesn't really care what happens to him. He's extremely reckless (which I'm sure made all the women in the audience swoon), but in a pretty dangerous and scary way. He shows his guns, he shows his buns; what else is there? Now ladies, don't forget there's more to true love than just that. There's a great smile and bright eyes - Oh, he has those, too.Now, onto Danny Glover. He's funny, too, in his own way. He loves his wife and kids, and whenever Mel pushes him out of his comfort zone, he begrudgingly ends up enjoying the ride. Both leads get to show off their acting chops in these movies, which make them a step above the usual buddy cop flicks that just focus on comedy. There are some very tense action sequences, interesting characters that you want to keep watching, and a sweet blossoming friendship. The start of the movie shows Danny Glover's house decorated for Christmas (this came out the year before Die Hard). Mel is without friends or family, but if you want to take bets on whether or not he'll find both before Christmas dinner, the odds are good.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",Lethal Weapon

Reluctantly thrown together to solve the mysterious murder of a banker's daughter, the duo uncovers a dangerous ring of drug smugglers employing ex-military mercenaries. After a tragic turn of events, the mission becomes personal and the pair must learn to trust one another as they wage a two-man war against a deadly criminal organisation......Its one of the most defining films of the eighties, one of the most defining action movies of all time, it catapulted Gibson into super-stardom, and along with Die Hard (the greatest film ever made) is the most copied action movie ever. And its plain to see why.It's endlessly quotable, still fresh after 27 years, and is expertly produced by Joel Silver.But despite the wonderful set pieces, the awesome pyrotechnics and Gibsons ability to outrun a car even though he chain smokes, the best thing about this beauty is the script and the story by Shane Black.It's such an easy high concept thriller, that the story doesn't really matter, I mean its about drugs, which most eighties action films were about. Ask people about the story, and they will tell you the narrative.Because the story doesn't matter.Black has made the characters so down to earth and so familiar, that you bond with Mutaugh, and feel huge empathy with Riggs, and this is in the first half hour, and once you bond with the two, the rest flows as freely as water from a tap.Its groundbreaking stuff, the second sequel complimented this,the other two, well it was good to catch up with the gang.Among one of the greatest action movies ever.",Lethal Weapon

The story...a hooker takes a plunge off a building and Glover is assigned to the case.  He is also assigned a new partner Riggs (Mel Gibson), who is a suicidal cop who gets quite berserk at times.  The investigation leads to an old Special Forces unit dealing in drugs.

When a beautiful young woman is found murdered it leads to a radical heroin-smuggling ring whose head honchos are played by Mitchell Ryan and Gary Busey.Everything about this movie screams mid-80s, like the music and the haircuts; it's also annoyingly comic booky, melodramatic and over-the-top. Once you catch a grip, though, it wins you over with the blossoming buddy-relationship of the two stars, not to mention the consistent thrills and scenic S. Cal. locations.In case you didn't know, the half-nude girl at the beginning is none other than Jackie Swanson, Kelly from Cheers.

Now I can finally get all the references, parodies, rip-offs and trivia questions. And I can finally put Lethal Weapon 4, which for some reason I watched back when it came out on DVD, in context. Maybe I should give it another watch now, but my intuition tells me it still sucks. Truth be told, Lethal Weapon 1 isn't an especially good movie, either, though the final installment (so far!) makes it look like a masterpiece. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover play chatterbox cops who are total opposites in life and style but, of course, are made partners. This probably wasn't the first buddy cop movie, but it is the most influential. Shane Black, who later went on to write and direct the superior Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, wrote a sometimes witty script which is also often ridiculous, repetitive, convoluted and just plain dumb. Richard Donner is one of the best popcorn directors, but a lot of Lethal Weapon feels overstuffed to me. There's just too much going on in many scenes, and the exaggerated performances of the two leads, along with their rapid-fire and frequently incomprehensible dialogue, I was getting a tad annoyed. But never that annoyed. With all its flaws, Lethal Weapon is nothing less than a good bit of entertainment. It's not a film you want to think too much about, but it's also not a film that really invites you to think about it too much, either.",Lethal Weapon

My friend had a bad incident with me after the film, and I believe this soured my view of this film.  A very bad year; don't let others choose your high school for you.  That is besides the point, but on second viewing, years later, I still found the movie disappointing.  The beginning is exciting, and Gary Busey's role is excellent with the cig lighter;sort of a copy of Miami Vice with: buddies who don't like each other at first, black/white, machine guns, drugs, etc.  Some of the other did this done that before ideas where, the old Nam team, car chases, the Dirty Harry jumper stunt, and the Rockford type of trailer Gibson lives in.

So when I hear this song, it reminds me of ""Lethal Weapon"", and taps into a fondness I've had for many years. A symbiotic relationship, really, and an altogether pleasant one. What better way to think of Christmas than picturing a good-looking girl diving from her high-rise balcony? Anyhoo, here's the thing with ""Lethal Weapon"": even after so many years of loving this movie and having seen so many subsequent action movies, I always get drawn into this. It maintains levels of absorption and replay value that just don't come along often. Holds up is an understatement; the torture and suicide scenes still feel raw and hard to watch; the direction is explosive and the acting is uncommonly strong for a genre film of this type. The key to making this whole thing work is the undeniable chemistry between Gibson and Glover. The magic that radiates throughout this movie starts with them.You can watch this any time of year, but man, does it put me in the Christmas mood! 10/10",Lethal Weapon

34,JamesHitchcock,Entertaining Tough Cop Thriller,6,26 June 2009,"Given that police detectives often work in pairs, it is surprising how long it took the film industry to come up with the ""buddy cop"" movie. ""In the Heat of the Night"" is a rare example from the sixties, but most of the ""tough cop"" dramas from that decade and from the seventies were about loners who preferred to work alone. Even when the likes of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry were paired with another detective, the focus was very much on the title character with his partner playing a minor role. ""48 Hours"" is sometimes classed as a ""buddy cop"" film, but in fact Nick Nolte's detective was teamed not with another police officer but with a convict temporarily released from jail.The ""buddy cop"" genre probably came of age with the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, of which this is the first. Two LAPD detectives, Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs, are assigned to investigate the apparent suicide of a young woman named Amanda Hunsaker, who turns out to be the daughter of one of Murtaugh's old buddies from the Vietnam War. Upon investigation it becomes clear that her death was in fact murder and that those responsible are a ruthless gang of drug dealers, all themselves Vietnam veterans. Amanda was killed because her banker father Michael, who acted as the gang's money-launderer, was threatening to alert the police to the scheme.What lifts ""Lethal Weapon"" above the average is not its plot or its action sequences, which are all very much standard shoot-e-mail-up stuff, but the characterisation of the two main roles. A common feature of ""buddy cop"" films is that the two partners are normally very different in character. They initially start off disliking one another, but this dislike eventually turns to mutual respect, even friendship. As in ""In the Heat of the Night"" one of the two is black, the other white. In the earlier film, which used the conventions of the police thriller to explore the problem of racism in American society, this racial difference is the most important element in the film; here it does not really matter, something which shows how America had changed in the twenty years between 1967 and 1987. The film would still be much the same if Riggs were black and Murtaugh white, or if both were of the same race. The important differences are not of race but of temperament.Murtaugh, as played by Danny Glover, is the older of the two, having recently celebrated his 50th birthday. He is also the more stable, a happily married family man. Mel Gibson's Riggs, by contrast, is depressed and suicidal following the death of his wife in a car crash. Murtaugh wants to play everything by the book, whereas Riggs prefers more uncompromising methods of law enforcement. He was originally attached to the drugs squad, but was transferred to homicide by his superiors who are weary of his violent behaviour. Riggs has some similarities with Harry Callahan, another widower who lost his wife to a car accident; the main difference is that the unpredictable Riggs lacks Harry's icy self-control.Along with ""Die Hard"", made the following year, ""Lethal Weapon"" launched a ""second generation"" of tough cop movies. (Bruce Willis, who plays John McClane in the ""Die Hard"" series, was originally considered for the role of Riggs). Like most tough cop films (the original ""Dirty Harry"" perhaps being an exception), it does not ask any very deep questions, but does at least provide some good entertainment with some exciting action sequences. 6/10",Lethal Weapon
35,Smells_Like_Cheese,One of the best action movies ever!,9,12 June 2005,"Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are two of a kind!

One of the greatest films of all time.",10,20 September 2003,"Some Spoiler Herein.""I guess we're gonna have to register you as a lethal weapon."" - Danny Glover, ""Lethal Weapon.""There's such a flow and deep character progression that helps make ""Lethal Weapon"" what it is today -- a funny, action-packed, and yet also quite intelligent cop-buddy film that owes its success in part to the smartness of its script, the solid direction by Richard Donner, and the interaction of its two lead stars, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, who bounce jokes and one-liners off each other with such comic timing and gruffness it makes one wonder why the strict comedies released nowadays can't be half as funny as this mixed-genre buddy film.""Lethal Weapon"" is a very tough film, brutal and vicious. Roger Ebert described it perfectly when he said, ""A movie where you and your date grab each other's arm every four minutes and you walk out black and blue and grinning from ear to ear."" That's exactly how I feel when I'm done watching it. The later sequels were extremely good given that the formula of these type of films usually get old very quick - in fact, as sequels go they surprisingly never really grew old in formula at all. But they did seem to gradually lose the toughness and brutality of the first film, at least after the second, something that helps elevate it to a type of hard action movie status. Those looking for a soft buddy comedy have rented the wrong movie.The strength of the film lies within the hands of its two lead stars; it is firmly rooted and all else flows with ease and an almost simple splendor. Mel Gibson plays a Mad Max gone homicidal. Danny Glover plays a retiring cop stuck with a lethal weapon of a partner for his last few days as an officer of the law. They'll be lucky to make it through the next week without killing each other first.It opens high up in the night sky to the song ""Jingle Bell Rock"" and comes to focus in a naked woman's apartment. She's drugged up and walks to an open ledge overlooking the landscape above and below. She jumps.
The next day. Sgt. Roger Murtaugh (Glover) is having his fiftieth birthday. He's retiring from the police force. As he so aptly puts it, ""I'm too old for this [feces].""Murtagh's bad day gets even worse when he's assigned a new partner named Martin Riggs (Gibson). Riggs is suicidal, the police force has their suspicions of this, and so they team him up with Murtaugh as a way of (a) seeing if he's just playing crazy to get a pension and (b) to get him out of their way. Murtaugh thinks he's playing crazy to make some extra cash - until he watches Riggs put a gun in his mouth and almost pull the trigger. ""You really are crazy.""Then the two men stumble upon a drug smuggling operation that goes back to the days of the Vietnam War. Things get personal when Murtaugh's family is in danger. Murtaugh's daughter is kidnapped and the two men have to find a way to get her back alive.Most films like these are just shouting matches between the two cops. They typically have a paper-thin plot with lots of shoot-'em-up action. ""Lethal Weapon"" is smarter than this -- it has shouting, it has plenty of shoot-'em-ups, but it also has a good plot -- enough plot for at least ten of these buddy films,The actors are terrific in their roles. Danny Glover's family man is absolutely convincing. I especially like throughout the four films when someone will make a remark about how old he is -- like his daughter mentioning his beard making him look older in the first film -- and he just stares in a mirror and looks at himself with that, ""I'm getting older. I can't believe it"" look.Mel Gibson is perfect as Riggs, a suicidal maniac who doesn't care if he goes down until he finds something to live for. The audience finds out early on that his wife has been killed, and her death has pushed him over the edge to the point where he has to think of a good reason not to blow his head off each day. There's a very tense scene when he's putting a gun to his head, then in his mouth, and he starts crying and trying to think of a reason to live. Later he tells us what the reason is: ""The job,"" he says. Most cops in films have families like Danny Glover's character. Riggs truly has nothing but his job, and if he dies carrying it out he couldn't care less.It's startling how effective a film this is. It's bruising, dynamite, action-packed storytelling, but it never forgets its plot, its characters and their progression, nor the dramatic side of the movie. Anyone not touched by Riggs' pre-suicide scene probably should seek help.Here is one of the best films of all time.John Ulmer",Lethal Weapon

39,thesar-2,Lethal on if you don't see it,8,12 May 2010,"One more year until Die Hard that set all the clichés for future action pics. Until then, you'll just have to settle for Lethal Weapon, the movie that set the buddy-cop clichés. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.What a fantastically realistic, original and fun movie the original Lethal Weapon movie was. In addition, it broke barriers by adding a lot of subliminal ""Can't we all just get along"" messages. Some less obvious than others and some in your face, like making the two ""opposite cop partners"" white and black. (Later in the series, they shove ""Save the Dolphin"" messages down our throats.) Still reeling in his wife's untimely demise, excellent/top notch/Jack Bauer Detective Riggs (Gibson) is suicidal, a la a ""lethal weapon"" and is teamed with over-the-hill Murtaugh (Glover) to solve a case involving someone in Murtaugh's war-laced past. They don't get along, have totally different personalities and must learn to work together for their common goal: justice. By means offists and gunpowder, for the most part.A lot of this sounds eerily familiar and predictable. And it isfor someone watching this for the first time today. But, again, this is the movie that set the standards. You'll have to thank this movie for the countless, and I mean countless, like in the hundreds, of rip-offs. Thankfully, this beginning of the ""new age"" buddy movie was very well done, but not without its flaws.It is said that the majority (if not all) of the Lethal Weapon films are improv'ed. Sure, they had somewhat of a script, but for the most part, the actors just did there thing. 90% of the time, it worked. When it didn't, it was slow and a little bit too realistic, like you were watching a dysfunctional family or cop partners on TruTV. Thankfully, that was only 10%.My parents took me to Lethal Weapon 2 in 1989. I was 14 and was allowed in due to being accompanied by adults. I had yet to see the original for years to come. I fell madly in love with part two. Unfortunately, once I was able to see this, I was disappointed as it was not as action-packed or funny as part 2. That said, this is still worth watching. You will see excellent acting by Gibson, the iconic Busey of the 1980s and the origin of the buddy-cop movies to follow. Absolutely recommended.",Lethal Weapon

41,ElMaruecan82,"Even in 2037, the film will not be too old for Cinema ...",9,18 September 2012,"It's hard to believe that Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs started driving up together 25 years ago, and I'm not expressing nostalgia here, only complimenting the timeless appeal of a film that stood the test of time. Because, as much as it carries the visible mark of the 80's, there's a level of freshness and modernity that elevates ""Lethal Weapon"" above any of todays productions. And not just as a classic cop/thriller, ""Lethal Weapon"" will forever be regarded as the film to that epitomizes the 'buddy-movie'.Generally, this sub-genre's main premise relies on the coexistence of two polar opposite personalities within a unity of space, time and plot, and whatever happens, the friendship or growing complicity between the two leads remains the plot's center of gravity. While not a golden rule, it's assumed that the more different they are, the funnier get the interactions, and the closer they are, the more serious it gets. I guess that a good buddy-movie should find the correct balance between ""The Odd Couple"" and ""The Defiant Ones"". And ""Lethal Weapon"" works like a school case, the relationship between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson could serve as the best reference for any buddy movie, regardless of the genre, the tone or the style.Richard Donner, who directed""Superman"" and ""The Goonies"" already proved to be capable of making action films where characters were more than tools to build a story. In ""Lethal Weapon"", he surpasses himself by providing two remarkable examples of great characterizations. Indeed, instead of taking for granted the necessity of having two different cops and throwing it at our faces –for instance, after a stereotypical set-up where one of them loses his partner- he takes time to present the two leads. And when they meet, they're familiar enough to us, to make us care for them equally, and that's a key element: no one serves as a foil to the other, no lead and sidekick, Glover and Gibson are complementary to the core. And that's because they have more in common than they think and each one has a potential to fill the other's life-gap.""Lethal Weapon"" opens with Danny Glover as a man who just turned 50, the father or three kids, one beautiful daughter, and like every man his age, he's concerned by his gray facial hair, can't find the car keys or can't tell his wife what he thinks of her cooking. His motto: ""I'm to old for this ----""summarizes the attitude that govern 95% of his life. And Mel Gibson plays a relatively young, long-haired, sharpshooter who became suicidal after his wife's death. Three key scenes sum up his 'pathos', he confronts a nervous sniper without taking any protection, he challenges a thug who took him as a hostage, and in one of the most emotionally engaging scenes, he tries to kill himself by pointing a gun in many spots in his face before giving up, his face covered of tears. By the way, the level of emotion Mel Gibson manages to pull in these 3 minutes is Oscar-worthy.Basically, Roger Murtaugh is in a routinely logic while Martin Riggs is in a dead-end, one is exceptionally ordinary; another is so tormented no one wants to work with him. It's astonishing how never, and I mean, never in the film, they seem stereotypical. As I described, when they start working together, we identify to each one of them, and try to figure how they can complete each other. Yet they do, because on their own, they're two lonely men, one absorbed by his family life, and another stuck to the only thing that keeps him for blowing his brain off: his job. Riggs is good and he knows it, is Murtaugh as good? Well, he lasted long enough without getting a bullet, or a scratch, and he contemplates retirement like Riggs suicide. Both are in a sort of transitional time of their life, in a tunnel where the most needful element to enlighten their lives is a buddy.And that's what makes the film so great, while we enjoy the countless action scenes and the investigation, we also have a good time watching them having some beer, commenting on the wife's food or the crush the cute daughter has on Riggs. Riggs' wisecracking comments and Murtaugh's excitability are the spices that provide the film (and the sequels) its entire savor. Of course, I'm not making ""Lethal Weapon"" sound like a character study but granted it's a great action/cop thriller with some heart-pounding sequences, there's more to it definitely, something in the same vein, than ""Die Hard"" that renewed the action genre. I guess the audience needed less superheroes or modern lone rider's type and needed to identify with the characters before getting immersed in their universe and caring for them not just because they're labeled as heroes.It's not surprising that ""Lehtal Weapon"" and ""Die Hard"" take place in L.A. during Christmas, the context doesn't play as a pivotal role in ""Lethal Weapon but it does provide this natural ordinary setting that, by contrast, make the action scenes more challenging. Naturally, the impact and entertaining value of an action film also relies on the presence of a great villain. ""Lethal Weapon"" manages to do so with the unforgettable third pillar of the film, Gary Busey as 'Mr. Joshua', although he doesn't have the same sophistication than Hans Gruber, he's genuinely scary and impressive enough to be a perfect match for Riggs and Murtaugh.What else to say about ""Lethal Weapon""? Well, it created the most endearing cinematic duo of the recent years, and although the film slides sometimes into some stereotypes, it still remains one of the greatest of its genre, with a genuine human quality. And I'm sure that even in 2037, the film will never be too old for Cinema.",Lethal Weapon
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The definitive buddy cop movie.,8,19 April 2020,"'Lethal Weapon (1987)' is the definitive 'buddy cop' movie. The film is a sort of extended set-up for its follow-ups, bringing its iconic duo together in preparation for the continuing adventures of Riggs and Murtaugh, but it still works as a stand-alone experience. It's a little bit unfocused, with most of its main plot being squished into its final act in favour of sequential set-pieces intended on deepening the dynamic between its leads. Indeed, that's what the narrative is really about: the protagonists' relationship. It's a good thing, then, that it's one of the best realised relationships ever put to film, evolving in a natural and empathetic way until it reaches its inevitable plateau just before the credits roll. Both Gibson and Glover are great, delivering performances much more nuanced than you might expect. Gibson's wild-eyed fury is hard to beat, while Glover's under-the-surface stress practically seeps out of him. Much of the affair is dedicated to Riggs' severe depression, which is dealt with more sensitively than you'd anticipate from an 80s action movie (even if its resolution is rather rushed). The picture is pretty good in terms of representation, too; it has a diverse cast and practically no out-dated, race-related humour. It's all just good fun, to be honest. Of course, it has some dark moments and is, generally, more serious than any of its follow-ups. It balances its comedy with its drama well, though, and delivers exactly what you want. Ultimately, that's what matters. It may be messy, with a fairly weak main plot, but it's very entertaining. Its action, which I haven't even mentioned yet, is fantastic. Richard Donner and his second unit team do an excellent job. From its delightfully practical car wrecks to its blank-firing, squib-triggering shoot-outs, it's all edge-of-your-seat, smile-inducing stuff. Its weakest moment is probably an odd, protracted fight scene that may just be the origin of unintelligible shaky cam. Still, even this soon becomes enjoyable and it doesn't prevent the piece from going out on a good note. In the end, this really is essential viewing for fans of action cinema. 8/10",Lethal Weapon
43,ThomasDrufke,I'm Too Old For this ****,8,3 May 2014,"It's quite simply one of the greatest buddy cop films of all time. Gibson and Glover give great performances and show terrific chemistry on screen together. The movie starts out slow, but once the two of them finally pair up, its gold until the end.It's a high octane thrill ride throughout, and the fun part is the back and forth between the leads. I really like that they give a solid back story for both rather than just have them be together in the first few scenes. It's nice when you become invested in the characters when you know why they feel emotionally a certain way. Gibson's character is suicidal and borderline crazy, and Glover is a good family man who just past the mid-century mark. I really like the action scenes, and even in 2014 they pretty much hold up. Now it obviously does have the typical 80's cheesy feel at some parts. But it doesn't diminish the fact that the movie has some depth to it, and isn't just a mindless action thriller.With that said I would have like to see more of the story to the villain side of things. 2 hours is a good length for the film but possibly remove the first few scenes of Gibson just in his trailer and instead give us scenes with Busey. I know the bad guys are involved with drugs but I wanted to get to know those characters more. There are also some parts that seemed a little bit too coincidental, but it is a Hollywood movie. And some parts weren't realistic, I mean the final fight with Gibson and Busey? Would have never been allowed in real life.Still a good film with one of the best cop duos ever captured on screen. Now to watch the sequels...8.4/10",Lethal Weapon

Riggs is a suicidal freak who likes to kill everyone and Murtaugh is a middle-aged cop who just wants peace and happiness. They are to be partners. Together, they must bust a big time drug industry.The acting is great. Along with the action, the actors added plenty of comedy especially with Mel Gibson who was brilliant. Danny Glover also did a great job.For action movie freaks, there are tons of action scenes.

47,secondtake,"Oh, smart and funny and filmed with pizazz, but mostly Gibson and Glover!",7,28 September 2011,"Lethal Weapon (1987)In some ways this is a great movie. It's fast, it's filmed with dramatic fluidity and terrific light, it has more lively acting than most movies, and it's filled with heroes and bad guys you can relate to.Director Richard Donner broke out of years of successful television directing with the headline hit, ""The Omen,"" in 1976, followed the next year with ""Superman."" But oddly enough (or not, following his t.v. years which included not only several ""Twilight Zone"" episodes but also ""Gilligan""s Island"" and ""Perry Mason""), it was the unlikely buddy movie with Mad Max star Mel Gibson that has made him very rich, and almost famous. Gibson makes it easy to forget all the nastiness that has happened lately in his life (from his own doing) because he's such a natural screen presence. I had almost forgotten how alive and a little edgy he could be in his goofy, handsome way. And Danny Glover, equally, comes alive on the screen, a little goofy as well, of course, but comfortable as the dad in a functioning middle class family. The two men are cops, thrown together and by some stroke of bad luck, pitched into high stakes dramas one after another.And if you really bother paying attention, the plot is a strain, made more for effect than anything that matters or even quite makes sense. There are ex-CIA heroin dealers and absurd (and dangerous) helicopter chases, fantastic skills with guns and an even more fantasy-like muddy hand-to-hand fist fight under the spray of a broken fire hydrant at night. Yeah, it's crazy and over the top and you just have to dive in and say, cool, go for it, great filming, funny one-liners.It's a moment for moment movie with a handful of clunker moments but hundreds of crazy fast and exciting ones. For all they are worth. In some ways, at least, as entertainment straight up, a kind a television on steroids, this is a great movie.",Lethal Weapon
48,CuriosityKilledShawn,All in favor say 'Die',6,26 February 2007,"It may well have appeared fresh and exciting back in 1987 but Lethal Weapon is soaked in so many 80s clichés it's sometimes hard to take it seriously. First of all we have the maverick cop on the edge who doesn't play by the rules but gets results. Second we have him being teamed up with a by-the-book partner. Third...it's all about drugs. There are countless more, from LA setting to the Vietnam vet psycho stuff and even all the way down to the deep voiced trailer guy saying stuff like 'They'll have to work together even if it kills them' and so-forth.Opening with long travelling shot of LA, complete with an agonizingly 80s credit front, Lethal Weapon begins with the death of a porn actress, high on cocktail of white powders, who thinks she can fly. But what she really gets is a 20-storey descent to the parking lot, the fast way. I first saw Lethal Weapon on TV in about 1990 and this scene had pretty much everything cut from it, the nudity, the drugs, it's amazing people actually made sense of films back then.Anyways, before I go off on a tangent rant, the dead girl is actually the daughter of a crooked banker involved in heroin smuggling. LAPD Sargeant Roger Murtaugh is his old pal and takes the case, but not before being teamed-up with renegade, suicidal cop Martin Riggs. Together 'They don't make the rules, they break them' and 'They'll have to survive each other first' and 'blah blah blah!' Honestly, the wafer-thin plot of Lethal Weapon has truly perished with time. Bad guys smuggle heroin, cops kill them for it. There are multiple, totally absurd elements such as Riggs being a Vietnam vet despite only being about 30 at the time (meaning he was 19 when the conflict ended), the rolling around with the gun firing a gun blindly but still hitting targets is hard to swallow, the martial arts showdown seems to come out of nowhere and belongs in a different film, kids recognizing tiny special forces tattoos from a significant distance and the contrived death of Murtaugh's daughter's never seen boyfriend.In fact, a LOT of this film is contrived and rather ramshackle. Shane Black IS a great writer but this film is just too underdeveloped. We never get to see the heroin or learn anything about how the villains do business. There's not any decent amount of mystery solving or police procedure and there is absolutely NO reason at all for the film being set at Christmas. There is no festive, yuletide atmosphere or Xmasy themes. Plus, with the film being set in LA, Christmas is all blue skies and sun. It adds nothing at all.What makes Lethal Weapon watchable however are the characters and the silly banter between them. Riggs and Murtaugh really seem to click with each other as pals and I think it's this that kept the sequels coming rather than the need to tell another macho action story set in LA.And I do wish that Michael Kamen never used those damn saxophones! The score can frequently be quite jarring and annoying whenever those things start screeching. I have the limited edition score CD, but skip those tracks whenever I stick it on. But since Kamen has died in recent years I will spare him my rant over his misjudged score.Unwisely regarded as a classic, Lethal Weapon only exhibits how to weave 40 million clichés into a macho action movie. The humor is what I like best, I can leave the rest to stagnate back in the 80s, where it really belongs.",Lethal Weapon
49,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,8,13 December 2012,"Lethal WeaponThe best thing about being a cop at Christmas is that you don't need the fake belly to play Santa.Surprising, the flatfoots in this action movie are quite fit, albeit not mentally.During the holiday season a prostitute is murdered, and her death is made to look like a suicide.Assigned to the case are cranky L.A.P.D. Sergeant Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and his loose cannon colleague Riggs (Mel Gibson).Together, the unorthodox pair expose a heroin trafficking ring run by ex-special forces (Mitchell Ryan, Gary Busey).But with Murtaugh's family in jeopardy, the duo may not be able to prevent the former flattops smuggling in the largest shipments of smack into L.A.From the combustible chemistry of the two leads, to the shadowy seasonal storyline, this initial installment of the successful series is still the quintessential buddy picture.Incidentally, Valium remains the number one drug choice of the holidays.

There's just enough plot to tie together the action scenes, although there are cartoons that have better plot and character development. It's mildly entertaining for the most part, but falls apart in the final third with some ridiculous action sequences, including one where a cop engages in hand-to-hand combat with a bad guy while other cops stand around and watch. With his bulging eyes and emotional displays, Gibson overdoes the crazy cop routine to the point of caricature.

51,slightlymad22,The Definitive Buddy Cop Movie,9,27 December 2014,"Continuing my plan to watch every Mel Gibson movie in order, I come to Lethal Weapon.After releasing 8 movies in 5 years, Gibson didn't release a movie in 1986, but his next movie really sent his career into orbit. Lethal Weapon is not the first buddy cop movie ever made, but it was the first one to do it this well, this is almost the definitive buddy cop movie. almost every single one since then has tried to duplicate this movie. Plot In A Paragraph: Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) has just turned 50, and only has a few years to go before he retires from the Los Angeles Police Department. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) has just lost his wife in an accident, and doesn't care if he lives or dies. They are paired together to investigate an apparent suicide. I've said countless times, car chases and shoot outs pretty much bore me now (hence me having no interest in the Fast & Furious franchise) but the difference here is, you actually care about the characters and the situations they are in. Shame Black's script is superb and for me director Richard Donner (who is still the director of the best Superman movie) pulled off a master stroke with his casting.Both Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are superb in their roles, as is Gary Busey, Darlene Love, Steve Kahan as Captain Murphy and Mary Ellen Trainor as Dr. Stephanie Woods (the Police Psychiatrist) do well in their small roles. Glover had been superb in The Colour Purple and Places In The Heart, and Gibson was a star on the rise, who hadn't quite made it big in America. He got to be serious, funny, heartbroken, crazy and the object of someone's affection.If there is a weak link in the cast, it is Mitchell Ryan as General Peter McAllister who seems to be in full pantomime villain mode and Ed O Ross who has a small role. The editing of the final fight irritates me every time too, but that really is nit picking of the highest order. Composer Michael Kamen and Eric Claptons score is a winner too. I also like Traci Wolfe as Murtaugh's daughter who has a crush on Gibson's Riggs. Excellently directed with a great score, Lethal Weapon is almost perfect entertainment. It was Gibson's biggest hit to date, ending the year the 9th highest grossing movie of 1987 with a domestic gross of $65 million. Beating movies such as Dirty Dancing, Living Daylights, Robocop, Wall Street and Arnie movies Predator and Running Man. Interestingly though, the similar themed movie Stakeout (which I love) slightly out grossed it.",Lethal Weapon

53,Dr_Coulardeau,Mel Gibson likes action but with some social depth,10,3 August 2010,"We are reaching here the roots of Mel Gibson. He is a cop without any equal and pairs with another cop who is only second but learns fast. The action is highly packed and intense and that is exactly what we want, what we like. But is action enough to make a good film? Of course not. The film is good first of all because of the small touches of humanity that are scattered all around, a dog as a best friend, a cat as a best buddy, and you can imagine the meeting of the two on Christmas day. A boat that has a front and a back and no water all around. Several kids who are as nice as kids know how to be when they are in a good mood, and we are surprised by the high level of resistance and resilience they demonstrate in the midst of that frantic action. A few black street boys who are deliciously anti-cop and just like ice cream so much that they start forgetting they are not supposed to speak to cops. A grenade that is a smoke bomb. A birthday that turns hectic with too many candles, definitely too many, on the cake. A shooting gallery that turns funny with bullets carving nice smiles into the faces of all the culprits in the world. And that and many more details make that film a real pleasure, nearly emotional. But the film is a lot better than that. When a country starts something dirty in the world against another country or another people, sooner or later the criminals that country has trained to do the bad job will come back to haunt everyone in their tombs or a little before they put them in their tombs. Killing machines are killing machines and you cannot stop them because you decide the war is over. That's why you should never start a war anywhere in the world, and those professional trained criminals can only be put to death because they will never accept any other trial or judgment, nor any period of peace and quiet at the bottom of a jail seen as an aquarium for gold fishes. They can only end fighting with real weapons and killed by real bullets, two rather than one, from two different guns rather than only one. That's what makes this film a lasting pleasure because in the world there is always the temptation to start a new war, and after starting a first one you cannot resist starting a second to spread the feast and the fun and make hundreds of thousands of people, in uniform or not, take part in the ""danse macabre"" that leads right to the cemetery, what's more an anonymous tomb of course, or just a collective grave, a big hole with some lye on top of the dismembered bodies. But we can end with the beginning then and imagine what the best friend dog and the best buddy cat do together when they meet. They do what human beings always do when they meet: they fight over their differences.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",Lethal Weapon
54,johnnyboyz,"Periodically smart and generally wry in an entertaining sense, Lethal Weapon is a taut enough crime thriller with some likable lead characters broken down and explored.",6,13 October 2010,"There is a great deal more fun to be had out of the combination of the two leads and their respective studies in 1987's Lethal Weapon than mostly anything else, their connection and the manner in which the two actors deliver the material much more interesting than whatever narrative or subplots to do with this, that or t'other which arise. By the time the film has descended into topless hard bodied males duking it out on a sodden lawn in a somewhat erotic display of masculinity and strength, the film has dealt humorously and substantially enough with how these two can't, in any way, feasibly link with one another given their respective life-situations at the respective point of meeting before having them gleefully link. The thrill is in the lead pairing and how the film observes that each needs the other one to advance to the next stage in both life and thinking; Lethal Weapon being really rather an intimate character study of two police officers, whom will end up on different roads as to when we first saw them, masquerading as an action picture. Director Richard Donner etches out as much as possible from these notions and idea before allowing the stunts and spectacle to just fill in the blanks along the way.Donner, in fact, opens the film with what is quite a long, remarkable tracking shot over the Los Angeles canopy layer of the numerous skyscrapers on show; the music bright and bubbly, your more typical establishing shot of a place so as to hammer home precisely where we all are on show. In the same take, the camera will descend into a high-rise building of apartments to reveal a semi-naked girl who takes some cocaine before leaping from a balcony and to her death. Just as the tone changes in the uncut crane shot, the atmosphere and content change with it; the greater extent of this wonderful opening being that it is how Donner will go on to construct the film, as a bright; airy and breezy piece with some harmless scenes of domesticisation and a carefree attitude to most scenes - granted, with a scene of suicidal ideation thrown in. But all this is before having everything descend into a more sordid, less glamorous zone when nastiness and sleaze come out of nowhere and now top the bill.The two lead's are both Sergeants, Mel Gibson's character is Martin Riggs while it is Danny Glover playing Roger Murtaugh. Their binary oppositional traits lie within their home-life, their attitudes to their work and just about everything else going on in their lives; eventual change and recognition as well as the opportunity to advance the end result. For Murtagh, his gradual getting by in the police department sees him attend crime scenes; take notes and generally do a lot of administrative work as he lives in the ideal detached house in a suburban part of California with the ideal family, an early scene in which they surprise him whilst he's in the bath outlining what a close knit group the Murtaugh's are as a background mirror reflecting his family hints at a literal 'reflecting' of a perfect family based unit. Roger is a Vietnam War veteran pushing fifty whom needs to be reminded that said war happened as long ago as it did and is having to come to terms with the growing up of his daughter Rianne (Wolfe), someone coming to be preoccupied with dressing up and going out in the evenings.On the jump side of things, Gibson's rough and messy trailer dwelling loner Martin Riggs is struggling with the recent death of his wife and is suicidal as a result; his much more 'hands on' police work when compared to Murtaugh's seeing him take gross, unnecessary risks with hardened criminals during a drug busts so as to further the possibility of on the spot release from life. Their pairing is the result of the aforementioned woman whom jumped from the balcony, something which is treated as a murder when traces of poison were found in the body upon investigation. Through being placed together, Riggs comes to observe a healthy family unit while gradually feeling better about himself while you feel Murtaugh comes to acknowledge his job a lot more after being involved in harsher, meaner police work as well as observing his own family and everything he's worked for become grossly threatened. By the end, Murtaugh has learnt to ""shoot to kill"" rather than just to do as before in maiming, as Riggs becomes more level headed the more he works with a family man. The thrill is in the way these two bounce off of one another, their respective life situations coming to compliment one another as changes are afoot whilst Riggs has some genuinely funny lines throughout.A plot involving a sadistic ex-American serviceman now turned evil mercenary and drug runner named Mr. Joshua (Busey), a man who is far more threatening than the name suggests, sees the two of them get in way over their heads but effectively renders their plight one of a fight against corruption and former patriots using their powers and abilities for wrong-doing. It's here the film becomes only a moderately interesting causality driven chase thriller, how Donner structures his film's opening shot only now resonating with us in its foreshadowing of something quite warm and welcoming becoming seedier and nastier as we delve in deeper with the peak of which is a pair of nasty interrogation sequences and some stark peril involving young Rianne. With a sharp and engaging more often than not screenplay from Shane Black, plus a competent job of direction from Richarcd Donner, Lethal Weapon is around about smart enough and entertaining enough to give a go.",Lethal Weapon
55,filipemanuelneto,"A film that made history and left its marks, but it's not perfect.",5,15 September 2021,"This film is one of the most interesting action films of the Eighties and started a brief, but interesting, film franchise. The key plot point is the collaboration and friendship between two substantially different policemen, but who have just been paired by their bosses: Murtaugh is an experienced middle-aged cop, disciplined in methods, married, a father and very attentive to his family ; Riggs is a police officer who has worked for several years in the Narcotics division and is experiencing severe depression, with suicidal tendencies that lead to impulsive, violent and risky behavior. Both are assigned to investigate the apparent suicide of a prostitute who is the daughter of a longtime friend of Murtaugh's, and who may be associated with a group of drug traffickers.In addition to the film having a good police story, the huge difference between the two protagonists and the way they manage to learn to respect and collaborate makes this film a good entertainment piece. It's not a movie made for thinking, nor is there a real mystery behind the crimes. It is an action-oriented film, punctuated by a light, intelligent and well-placed comedy. It's a movie made to enjoy and entertain.Much of the film's success rests on the back of its protagonist duo: Mel Gibson gives his character a bold, insane and intelligent aura, making good use of the opportunity and protagonism to popularize and leverage his career. Danny Glover is not far behind and offers us a mature, more restrained and intelligent performance. There are still several other actors, but none of them received material capable of allowing them to be highlighted.Technically, it's a regular action film, with elegant but understated cinematography, well-constructed sets and uninteresting costumes. The most notable technical aspect is the visual, special and sound effects department, which provides us with a job well done and realistic. There are lots of explosions, wrecked cars and insane fights that oscillate between the epic and the far-fetched, and the movie sometimes overdoes its spectacularity.

56,leplatypus,Lethal ideas (dad),10,24 August 2012,"With the time, this movie started a lot of trends that are nowadays in all action movie. The funny thing is that those ideas come by pair of opposites:First, the buddy movie: the old timer teams up with a crazy hotshot and the mix is explosive. The former calm and dull pavilion life will be changed forever. The magic comes here from its formidable casting because Glover and Gibson fit the part like glove. Next, the big violent criminals and sexual arousal: it's evident here that the shootings and fights are more brutal that those we have previously seen in similar movies. The kills rise high as well as the nudity scenes (it's not a erotic movie but you see that the prude veil is starting to come down at the release). However, the pill passes up as this content is blended with very familial content as well and comedy.Now, the complicated and very unbelievable plots: as they laugh themselves of it (""it's thin"", ""anorexic""), the crime story isn't original or inventive but the movie is speedy, nervous and dynamic (maybe it's even a bit too fast because the edit is sometimes clumsy: look for the handcuffs just before the big jump or count the shots and compare them with the card!). Like the casting, Donner has been a good choice because he knows how to tell a story.At last, in this first movie, the more unexpected opposition comes to shoot the movie in LA at Christmas time. It's very unusual to see that and the movie has a good atmosphere coming from the Californian sun and the Christmas decorations!Quickly, a good mention goes to the daughter that I have unfortunately never saw in other big movies and to the late Nick Kamen who scored a very bluesy score that helps define the mood of the movie.As you have understood, it's a really good movie, full of juice and laughs and that calls for more!",Lethal Weapon

58,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Infamous cop duo of Riggs and Murtaugh get it done,7,22 October 2008,"Nothing says 1980s cop thriller like a story of two cops that don't want to work with each other being forced to work with each other, especially when one of them is black and the other is Mel Gibson with flowing hair.There's not much to say about ""Lethal Weapon"" other than it got it right. Riggs and Murtaugh (Gibson and Glover) are undeniably one of the top duos of all time. After all, their chemistry was spectacular enough to bring about three more sequels. But why does the aging, skeptical black man work well with the younger, reckless, suicidal white guy? It's this huge contrast that reaches a wide audience.Because of how different they are, both heroes connect to everyone, but it's really more about how they are one person split in two. We all have a more grounded perception of our lives and our jobs like Murtaugh, but there is a part of us that wants to live on the edge and do things the bold way. That's the whole idea behind Shane Black's script and he sums it up well at the end. Of course it didn't hurt that he had one of the greatest directors of that decade bringing his work to life. Richard Donner is about as solid as you can get when it comes to action. While some of the scenes are definitely ""please keep this locked up in the 80s"" material, Donner does a lot to show you just how similar Riggs and Murtaugh are with camera angles and shots that compare them similarly.The plot is really only a vehicle for these characters to interact. It seems like every time the two go somewhere they are launched directly into an action sequence. There is no set up, no tension building; something merely explodes or suddenly there's a helicopter and a guy shooting at them. It's kind of ridiculous and the bad guys as a result seem way out in left- field, but the point is just how Murtaugh and Riggs respond to all these events and how they're changed. We just get to enjoy some great 80s gunfights along the way.",Lethal Weapon
59,marmar-69780,lethal weapon,8,4 January 2020,"Lethal weapon is one of most iconic 80s films and my favourite baddy cop type film,all of that was achivable through great chemistry between gibson and glover duo that become one of most memorable from any franchise,this film has a lot fun captivating dialogue and humour that give us neceserey laughs betweens action setpieces and chases,villain for this type of film surved its purpose and it wasnt boring or cliched and it gave connections between him and our duo,but him could still gave more risks in his actions or bigger stakes that would have bigger impact on us,you can call this film predictable but for me that wasnt problem and i had a great time watching it",Lethal Weapon
60,Anonymous_Maxine,This is the classic action film that introduces one of the best action duos ever to come to the big screen.,9,12 November 2000,"Lethal Weapon is a nearly perfectly structured action movie. The acting, the story, the script, the directing, even the IDEA of the movie all combine to make up a fascinating and thrill-packed police film. The cross-cutting at the beginning of the film was particularly effective, in my opinion, as Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are introduced. The startling difference between their separate lives provides for tons of fun to be had later in the movie. Roger starts his day off as the family man reluctantly celebrating his 50th birthday party with his numerous children and his loving wife in the big family house, while Riggs is shown waking up naked in his trashy trailer and beginning his day with a healthy breakfast of a cigarette and a beer. The fact that both Roger and Riggs hated that they had to work together was especially effective in creating a touching atmosphere as they grew to be closer and closer friends. They worked so well together in this movie; it was a symbiotic relationship. It was almost like they fed off of each other, and kept each other in line and out of trouble. I also liked the way that they showed that Riggs was deeply angered when he learned that the bad guys had taken Murtaugh's daughter. Things like this, when done right, can really get you to sit up and really get into the movie, and it was definitely done right here. Riggs was also very amusing in his anxiousness about being a cop (`Why don't you let me go to sleep?' `No, come on, we gotta get up and catch bad guys!'), and Gary Busey delivers an excellent performance as the lead bad guy. This is the type of role that he plays best (see ""Under Siege"").
Although the violence was painfully present in some parts (the torture scenes were short but extremely difficult to watch), the film never relied on violence to pull it along or keep the audience's attention. The story was sufficient enough so that there was no overindulgence necessary in anything like that. In this film you see the first of the now traditional Lethal Weapon scenes in which Riggs and Murtaugh stagger away from a smoking crime scene, seeming to hold each other up. The final fight scene between Riggs and Mr. Joshua (Busey) was a little excessive, and there were a few scenes which were a bit faulty (how did the guy on the building ledge expect to kill himself when there was such a huge air bag inflated on the ground directly below him?), but overall this was a spectacular crime thriller. The movie rushes along at a feverish pace, and particularly Gibson's and Glover's success working together on screen make this a timeless action film that is not to be missed.",Lethal Weapon
61,videorama-759-859391,"High calibre action, that's lethally addictive",8,18 February 2016,"If you ever saw the movie trailer, rip roaring with action, that will appease the hardcore viewer, you won't be disappointed by what unfolds before your your very eyes in this 110 minute high level actioner, that pits probably the best two partner cops, ever seen on film, even though the two, strangers at first, take an instant disapproval to one another. Gibson, as Riggs, gives one of his best acting performances ever. He's everything the part calls for. He's a border line psycho cop/ex Vietnam vet, who needs a stable cop, like Murtaugh (Danny Glover) to take him under his wing. Riggs is a very lonely guy, who just can't get over his wife's (Victoria Lynn) death, so basically he hates the world. This latest case which becomes personal for both cops, sees a young girl suiciding by free falling several stories, plummeting to her death, where later, it's discovered she was murdered, due to cooking up, where this pretty lass, was also used in pornographic films. But there's much more to this exciting story, where the bad guys are bad, and beautifully played by two heavyweights, but I won't disclose names. Action comes thick and fast in this, with no time to really stop. What makes Lethal Weapon, better than many of it's competitor action films, is beside the explosive action, is the family angle, where in between fighting baddies, Riggs and Murtaugh, spend some time out scenes like at Murtaugh's house, when he's invited for dinner. This is a great scene, and after on Murtaughs boat, where the last scene when all the dust has settled, just upon Christmas, and Murtaughs invites Riggs in, it couldn't be penned more better. This I will say, now, is the best buddy cop partnership in history, where we are thankful for the three sequels that followed. Lethal Weapon has a great young breakthrough writer as in Shane Black who was only 23 when he wrote this. The opening of the Jingle Bell Rock song, is unexpected, and too the title song is explosive. It's so much fun here, watching mad Mel, displaying so many emotions, some moments, really scaring us, as this is one unstable dude. The woman psychiatrist, played by a late actress, is really taking the p..s out of psychiatrists generally, by her un layman terms of evaluation. One special non stop actioner, I demand you all see, which will always live with me, as the actioner of 87 that stood out when first viewing it, but too, we could do with a few more action films, not involving drug.",Lethal Weapon

""Lethal Weapon"" is a name in the making, and I think this movie will stick in the minds of movie goers for all ages. Here you have Riggs(Mel Gibson), a neurotic cop who teams with Murtaugh(Danny Glover) a veteran family man cop. Pairs like these, you'll need someone from I.A.(Internal Affairs) to keep tabs to. I liked the Christmas tree crackdown where Riggs showed his crazy side to the crooks using the Curly maneuver, N'YUK! N'YUK!N'YUK! That's homage to the Three Stooges. When it comes to villains, Gary Busey played it well. Targeting both men, this soldier doesn't deserve an honorable mention of any sorts. The martial arts scenes were great, despite Riggs mental state, he's sane enough to protect his partner and his family, who would know that he would have eyes on Murtaugh's daughter. Hmmmmm! Other than that, this is great all the way, and these guys will be friends for life, in the films and in real life! 4 out of 5 stars.",Lethal Weapon
64,FiendishDramaturgy,The honest truth about one of the most beloved action/comedy series in the movie industry.,9,16 October 2003,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ALL FOUR MOVIES!!1 - was fresh, innovative, edgy and hard. It had everything a good action movie needs to make it successful; excellent character development, imaginative direction, professional performances by the cast and crew, a clever and witty screenplay with intelligent dialog, and action...lots of good fast-paced, well-delivered action. It had a fresh comedic element without ever turning to camp or juvenile antics to solicit a chuckle from us. The comedy was educated, intelligent and expertly-delivered. The characters were lovable, and we got the feeling that we ""knew"" them, cared about them, wanted them to succeed. Riggs's character felt less like a character and more like a person, due to the high-level of development his character received. True, the ""gun handling"" left a lot to be desired, but the vast majority of audiences would not realize that you can not get 20 shots from a 16 shot clip. Nor would they realize that you can't just leave those empty clips on the ground; they cost MONEY and no CoP would do that because law enforcement officers are typically not highly paid. That aside, this was an excellent movie with wonderful entertainment value. One of the best of its kind.2 - gave us Joe Pesci's character, Leo Getz. Because of Getz, I honestly found this film to be rather endearing. Getz is one of the best characters to have been introduced to this series. Unfortunately, the edge and freshness is toned down way too much, and the action is really rather predictable. I thoroughly enjoyed bearing witness to the further development of the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh, and was not in the least bored with that aspect. It is still a good movie, even though its edge is shelved for a more ""marketable"" product.3 - is just as good as 2. Riggs now has a new love interest and it seems as though all will be well and all manner of things will be well. It is still a few months away from the press release concerning the Glover/Gibson signing for 4 & 5, so it seems the series has wound down, rather than up. The action is still quality, though there are fewer and fewer unpredictable moments. The comedic aspect which was enlightened and intelligent is now a bit puerile and tired. And while the performances are still professional, it seems as though Riggs and Murtaugh both are well on their way out.4 - is the perfect ending to this series. Honestly. The characters have developed as far as I can bear to witness; Murtaugh misfires his gun in the locker room of the precinct, Riggs gets his butt kicked by a rookie cop in the boxing ring, and Riggs and Murtaugh are both just too old for this action thing anymore. (Gods help us with 60-something-year-old Harrison Ford in the upcoming ""Indiana Jones 4."") Their CHARACTERS speak constantly of being too old, and I'm not talking about Murtaugh's well used line, ""I'm getting too old for this sh*t."" It is far beyond that. And now, with Riggs's marriage to Lorna, Murtaugh's daughter's marriage to Butters, the new babies and all the smarmy crap at the ending...enough is just enough.5 - should never happen. I don't think I can bear to see anymore smarm from these two. The characters we all loved are already gone. Like in ""Invasion of the Bodysnatchers,"" they've been stolen from us. The edge from Riggs's character is gone. He's a bit hapless now, and sad rather than the lunatic mayhem we want and NEED from his character.The only way to pull off a 5th installment would be to kill off Lorna's character, the baby AND Butters. Either put Riggs back where his character was in 1 & 2, or don't bring him out of the moth balls. PLEASE. I loved these movies, but for the love of Mike! NO MORE!If you liked any of these movies, I highly recommend ""Tango & Cash,"" an excellent, much-overlooked, highly under-rated ""Buddy-Cop"" movie.1. 9.2/102. 8.8/103. 7.6/104. 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Lethal Weapon

After living in Australia for many moons, he returns back to his homeland with this surprise hit. Mel Gibson stars as Riggs, a loose cannon cop who lives life on the edge. He takes many chances whilst he's on duty because he doesn't care about life anymore (since the death of his wife). He's partnered with Murtaugh (Danny Glover), a nearly retired cop who's counting the days until his retirement (aren't they always going to retire in these films). Can Murtaugh keep Riggs in line? What drives Riggs to live just another day? Why is this movie filled with homo-erotic tendencies? To find out you'll just have to watch LETHAL WEAPON.This movie was the best of the bunch. I was fascinated by who cool and crazy Riggs character was. Instead of leaving it at one movie, they had to ruin the memory of the film and make three more lame action films.

67,freemantle_uk,The model of the cop buddy genre,8,30 June 2010,"With it's mix of serious thriller plot, action-comedy and chemistry between it stars Lethal Weapon has an iconic film from the 80s and as one of archetype buddy-comedy films.Danny Glover and Mel Gibson play Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), two LAPD detectives who could not be more different. Murtaugh is a Sergeant who just celebrated his 50th birthday and a happy family man, whilst Riggs had just lost his wife in a car accident and has become suicidal. Both are good officers but have very different styles: Murtaugh is much more safer in his approach to Riggs as a maverick. The two are forced together after Riggs was transferred and the two are assigned to investigate the death of a prostitute. But it quickly turns out that the death was linked to a drugs ring, run by the General (Mitchell Ryan) and his loyal henchman Mr. Joseph (Gary Busey).Lethal Weapon was a film that was able to mixed a serious plot that could have worked in a thriller or police film, with strong, light-hearted relationship between Glover and Gibson. The plot is played straight and has moments of darkness, whilst the characters themselves were a bit more comic because of Murtaugh's domestic situation and Riggs' crazy personality. But this film was played to be pretty serious for the most part.Shane Black writes a very good script and with Richard Donner's direction the action is constant. Donner knew when to slow the film down to allow the characters to shine. With a good score and traditional action techniques Donner makes an exciting and fun film: but the final fight scene was a bit disappointing. Donner kept a fast pacing so it was hard to get bored with a film like this. But Lethal Weapon is Donner's best film since The Omen (I am including Superman). Black avoided clichés that plagued the genre later on, like the dressing down by the police captain or the main two characters hating each other and then becoming friends. Murtaugh and Riggs do have a chalk and cheese relationship, but they never hate each other. They learn from each other and the relationship was natural in the film's internal reality. The plot itself was as mentioned, dark and in the right level between believable but just enough to keep a level of fantasy which was needed for this type of film.The key to the film was the interaction between Glover and Gibson who worked well together. Glover was more natural and deadpan in his approach whilst Gibson was more over the time. The acting is decent for the most part.An enjoyable film.",Lethal Weapon

Two detectives get assigned to the case. One of them is a suicidal loner with a death wish; his name is Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), still grieving over the death of his wife. The other is a family man who just turned 50; his name is Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). They don't like each other and that's made clear since Murtaugh knows being partnered with a psycho cop is likely to get him killed. This is the world of ""Lethal Weapon,"" the brain-child of a trifecta of competent filmmakers: director Richard Donner, producer Joel Silver, and screenwriter Shane Black. One thing is made clear that ""Lethal Weapon"" takes no prisoners and is all about action, and the relationship between two guys who don't like each other but if they're to survive what they are up against, they'll need one another's help. The dead woman happens to be the daughter of an old friend of Murtaugh's (Tom Atkins), who was himself involved with mercenaries from the Vietnam War that specialized in heroin smuggling. Riggs, Murtaugh, and the man are all products of that war. Their investigation eventually leads back to these mercenaries and their shadowy leader General McAllister (Mitch Ryan) and his peroxide-blonde chief henchman Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey). What it all leads up to is a no-holds-barred showdown in one of the most action-packed finales I've ever seen. ""Lethal Weapon"" was of course followed by three sequels, each one less dark in tone but with more emphasis on blockbuster action, and are indeed an essential for any true action fan's library.

Although in later installments the duo grew too chummy and formulaic for my taste, Gibson and Glover's relationship in this introductory adventure is icy, complex and quite interesting, especially with the enhanced benefits of retrospect. Gibson, in his mainstream American breakthrough, is particularly good as unhinged, suicidal cop Martin Riggs, who always seems to have a pit of emotion raging behind his wide, unsettling gaze. Of course, it's an action movie from right in the heart of the genre's heyday, so there's no shortage of fireballs, gunshots, abandoned warehouses or furiously flying fists, but its big heart, strong core relationship and generally-grounded approach to the big fight scenes keep it from feeling overly indulgent.

74,jimbo-53-186511,Fairly enjoyable cop buddy film mainly thanks to great chemistry between the two leads,6,17 September 2013,"Lethal Weapon has a pretty abrupt start to proceedings as the opening scene shows a young woman jumping off a balcony from towards the top of a tower block and landing on a car. However, this proves to have some relevance to the plot of Lethal Weapon.Basically veteran cop Murtagh (Glover)is assigned to investigate this incident which is initially deemed to be a 'suicide'. However, an autopsy confirms that the young woman was poisoned before she jumped, therefore she was murdered before she jumped. Murtagh must try to find out who poisoned the young woman and why, but he's not alone in investigating this case and is assigned a partner Riggs (Gibson). Riggs is a suicidal, unhinged police officer who has a very different method of policing to the more 'by the book' Murtagh.The majority of the humour stems from scenes with Murtagh and Riggs as both of them have a completely different style of policing. Murtagh is more straight laced and has more of a general regard for following police procedure. Whereas Riggs is unorthodox and wild and will go to more extreme methods (as you'll see in the scene where he's on the roof with a potential suicide victim). The character development is also good. Riggs in particular is afforded some depth - we learn that his wife of 11 years was killed in a car accident which explains his suicidal tendencies - it perhaps also helps to explain his rather 'gung ho' approach to policing (as he already feels suicidal, he probably doesn't fear death as much as your average police officer). We also see Murtagh's home life and see that he is a real family man. Both men show their human side, but also show that they can kick a lot of ass when necessary.There were a couple of problems with Lethal Weapon; Firstly, the final scene where Riggs is left to fight Joshua (Busey) outside Murtagh's house and no police officers bother to intercept until Riggs finally manages to get the better of him. Whilst it was dramatic and a reasonably good finale, it wasn't entirely believable. Secondly; I also felt that at times the film was a bit drawn out and it was disappointing that the baddies were given a lot less screen time than I would have hoped for.That being said, Lethal Weapon is still a good film but this is mainly due to the great on screen chemistry between Gibson and Glover.

76,yusufpiskin,Christmas Movies Marathon..,9,28 November 2020,"With Christmas a-comin' in a couple of moths, there's no better time to rewatch the buddy cop film to end all buddy cop films. Few action movies before or since have wowed me as much as Lethal Weapon, and for good reason.Let's start with the obvious. The cast. Specifically, those two phenomenal central characters. Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. Played to perfection by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. I just love how well their respective storylines intertwined with each other. The film's central theme is family, and we get two vastly different perspectives on it. Roger the stereotypical family man, Riggs the manic-depressive-suicidal-cop-who-just-lost-his-wife.... yeah, this isn't Rush Hour. There's a lovely maturity to this film, and Martin's arc in this film was surprisingly effective, even on the rewatch. Gibson's range certainly helps sell his arc, and it helps that Glover's just as talented, playing off of Mel's manic energy amazingly well. For a movie that opens as bleak as this one does, by the end it's all smiles. The rest of the cast is fantastic too, Gary Busey especially.Behind the camera, we have Richard Donner, bringing his dependable craftsmanship to steer this project into the well-chiseled masterpiece we all know it as today.Unlike most modern films of this type, he usually holds back on the editing and more ""interesting"" camera angles, instead opting for a more rugged approach which really helps us be with the characters. We feel what they feel. His approach to the action sadly isn't as impressive (although he definitely gets better as the sequels go on, ending with some phenomenal set-pieces in LW4 that rank amongst the best of 90's action cinema), yet it's serviceable. This is one of the rare action films that puts character front and centre, so the action in the movie is still functional. It also helps that apart from an explosion here or there, it's mostly small and self-contained, so the geography isn't too convoluted.Michael Kamen's score is one of my favourites. I just love the soundscape he, Clapton and Sanborn created for this film (and franchise). It's funky, charming and sincere, but can also be gripping or heart-wrenching, should the need arise. Film music rarely gets better, and I wish people would bring back saxophone scores to the mainstream. I love me some good RCP action music, but listen to 'Beverly Hills Bust' and tell me you don't miss the 80s.One can't mention Lethal Weapon without, of course, mentioning Shane Black. His first produced screenplay. Unbelievable. Both Donner and Kamen said they probably wouldn't have signed on for the film had it not been for just how brilliant Black's script was. Every element of this film speaks to the core partnership between Riggs and Murtaugh, but that starts from the page. Roger only really begins to tolerate Martin around the 40 minute mark. Until then they're at each other's throats. By the end, however, it's like they're the oldest of pals, and it doesn't feel forced at all. While a lot of that credit should go to Donner, Glover, and Gibson, it's Black's phenomenal screenplay that's embedded in this relationship. His witty dialogue also helps everything feel just a tad lighter than one would expect, no matter how dark the film can sometimes go. Jeffrey Boam's contributions should also be noted, as he helped maintain that delicate tonal balance, injecting some much needed humour.I could go on and on about this film, but I won't. I've probably gone on for too long already, if I'm honest. All I can say is that Lethal Weapon is a fantastic film, one that's fit for all seasons.

77,juneebuggy,Worth a re-watch...except maybe for Mel's hair,10,26 December 2014,"I caught this on TV the other night and had a blast watching it again. I had forgotten what a great movie this is and really enjoyed myself. It's aged pretty well too except maybe for the annoying score of saxophone music and possibly Mel's cool hair. Well there is that scene with the giant portable phone.Anyways, this is how buddy-cop movies are meant to be; great chemistry between our leads, humorous, without feeling forced, yet also dark and gritty with action scenes that didn't feel like they were just there for the sake of a cool stunt. This also managed to stay away from clichés and the prevalent 80's cheese factor and felt original all the way through. Just a great ride.I was also impressed with how tortured Mel's character 'Martin' is.

83,rbverhoef,Action and comedy,7,14 February 2004,"'Lethal Weapon' is a movie that knows what it is to be a buddy movie and a hard police movie at the same time. Comedy and action come together in the perfect way. In a way it is your typical buddy movie. An older and wiser black cop and a younger white cop, living on the edge, team up. The black cop is personally involved in the case they handle, the white cop is a little suicidal.Where most movies like this work to hard on the relationship between the two and therefore force most of the jokes, 'Lethal Weapon' starts by being a good action movie and from there it thinks further. The movie is funny because the characters simply do what you would expect them to do and because personalities collide it gets funny. Not that it is very different in other movies like this, but in those movies the characters have some strange habits to make it funny. Here the characters feel more real.The black cop is Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), the white cop Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson). Together they have to solve a case that involves drugs, an old Vietnam friend of Murtaugh and a villain played by Gary Busey. The screenplay is not very complicated, more like a simple police story, but it has some nice touches. We know Gibson can not die in the first couple of minutes of the movie, but when he holds that gun to his own head we really feel the fear he must have. This movie is one of the reasons he is the star he is today, and you understand why. Glover is nice as well, and that he and Gibson, together with director Richard Donner, made three other Lethal Weapon' movies together is no surprise. They are one of the best teams I have seen, for the action and for the comedy.",Lethal Weapon
84,valleyjohn,Still fun,8,30 April 2020,"It's over 30 years since watched Lethal Weapon and I thought it was about time I revisited Riggs and Murtaugh to see how time has treated them and sure , it does look a little dated but the film is still a lot of fun .Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were big stars back in 1987 . Glover had just been in The Color Purple and Gibson has just finished his third Mad Max movie so it made total sense to put the two together for this film and they undoubtedly worked really well together but Gibson was by no means first choice for the role .
Just take a look at the list of actors who were considered or turned down the role of Riggs .Alec Baldwin, Jeff Bridges, Pierce Brosnan, Bryan Brown, Nicolas Cage, Robert De Niro Kevin Costner, Willem Dafoe, Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, Richard Gere, Jeff Goldblum, Rutger Hauer, Don Johnson, Michael Keaton, Kevin Kline, Christopher Lambert, Michael Madsen, Liam Neeson, Michael Nouri, Al Pacino, Sean Penn, William Petersen, Dennis Quaid, Christopher Reeve, Eric Roberts, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Selleck, Charlie Sheen, Sylvester Stallone, Patrick Swayze, John Travolta and Bruce Willis .That has to be the most turned down roll in movie history and you just can't imagine any of the above being Riggs so it all turned out well in the end .The film is by no means perfect , in fact the story is pretty lame but the two leads along with one of the 1980's best baddie actors , Gary Busey , make the film a great piece of escapism .",Lethal Weapon

86,Spondonman,"More entertaining than, but almost as dated as me",7,22 June 2013,"I'll have to be careful what I put for the first Lethal Weapon; it's one of my daughter's favourite films and when younger she used to have a crush on Mel Gibson. So, it was a marvellous, even classic film.But what of the flimsy plot? Black and white cops up against ex-army heroin smugglers, interspersed by shedloads of comedy. How about the slapstick acting caricaturing the police force of the time, to be sure an ancient time when officers went about shouting Yipikaye to the baddies as they killed them unmercifully. The schmaltzy family scenes in contrast to the vigilante attitudes? No matter how laughable this always was or how dated it's getting it was always prime entertainment and a great way to spend two hours. Like Die Hard it was a deliberate and laudable propaganda attempt to get black and white people to understand together and to work for their common good together. Like Die Hard it had Christmas violence and baddies beyond the pale, in fact albino – baddies who only deserved to be terminated.It portrayed a brilliant fantasy world where Health & Safety or police protocols played no part, along with mobile phones, the internet and without the cgi cartoonery that's taken over movies in the last 20 years. There seemed to be plenty of time to enjoy nonsensical action films such as this back then.

88,burlesonjesse5,Lethal Weapon is a buddy cop film par excellence,10,8 May 2014,"With visceral, breathtaking action sequences and a shockingly good performance from Aussie bred Mel Gibson, Lethal Weapon stands as possibly the greatest buddy cop film ever made. After three star making performances in the Mad Max movies, Gibson (as suicidal cop Martin Riggs) built a whole new character niche for himself here. He is paired with the perfectly cast Danny Glover (L.A.P.D. Sergeant Roger Murtaugh) and the two of them become involved in taking down a ruthless drug dealer/murderer of the daughter of one of Murtaugh's closest friends.The very popular Lethal Weapon franchise went on to produce three more sequels. The fact that the first one stays away from the comedic element (this was overdone on the next 3 installments), makes it more atmospheric, more tension-filled, and vehemently more effective. Watch out for Gary Busey (a.k.a. Joshua) as a side villain who's pure, nasty fun. Richard Donner of The Goonies and Superman fame directs at a fast, workmanlike clip.",Lethal Weapon
89,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An entertaining buddy cop action film,7,10 August 2014,"Buddy Cop films were not uncommon in the 80s for several reasons. A big reason was that they permitted heavy violence with comical one liners. Another reason though was to pair up two odd ball actors together in one movie. It was a big grab because it allowed for audiences to see interactions between stars that were not normally seen in other genres. Among all the productions that were made, the most popular and critically praised was Richard Donner's Lethal Weapon (1987), the director best known for Superman (1978) and The Goonies (1985) up to that point. Then, attach writer Shane Black to the production and it became an instant hit. Shane Black is the more successful brother of Terry Black, the writer behind Dead Heat (1988).Black's set up to the main story is for the most part like any other buddy cop film. Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is an older police officer on the force getting close to retirement. Officer Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) is widower who can't be handled by his coworkers. Ever since he lost his wife, Riggs has been on the edge and no one wants to be partnered up with him. That is until he gets assigned to be with Murtaugh. Once Riggs meets Murtaugh, there is initial friction but they soon grow on each other with emotional backstories that are developed enough for the audience to care and understand. Aside from that, both Glover and Gibson give their characters a decent dose of charm. Glover is great at being the tired elderly cop and Gibson is great at being all over the place and bouncing off the walls. These contrasts are fun especially when they share the screen together.There's also a number of supporting actors cast in this movie. Gary Busey and Tom Atkins also have significant roles to play. Tom Atkins plays key a part in a homicide that Riggs and Murtaugh have to figure out. Gary Busey doesn't play a unique individual but makes his performance interesting because he's not all out crazy. He's a bit disturbing but not loony. That's Gibson's role anyway. Sadly there isn't much to say about cinematography or editing. It is competently done though. The cinematographer was Stephen Goldblatt (who might be editor Mark Goldblatt's brother?). The editor was Stuart Baird, who also worked with Donner on Superman (1978). Other than that, there's nothing to say that really stood out. The action was handled well especially when it came to fight sequences. Mel Gibson sure knew how to throw a punch. As for shootings and car chases, nothing there felt special either, I actually expected more. Musically related, Michael Kamen produced the score while collaborating with Eric Clapton. Was it memorable? Ehh,...no not really. However, the sound was different than most scores. This particular score highlighted the most saxophone in it than any other score I've listened too. This made it unique, sadly not enough to remember though. I don't even recall a main theme. However, there were some scenes that were effective - like Mel Gibson's emotional trauma. That worked, but it worked on occasion. It is still a well-made action film no doubt.It has a good cast of actors, fun action and a well-written story. Music and camera-work are good too but nothing to be amazed over. Fun fun.",Lethal Weapon
90,Easygoer10,Terrific Action Cop Film,9,6 December 2019,"Although I wasn't a big fan when these films came out, later I came to appreciate them. Especially the original, as is typically the case. It is a brilliant film: Funny, with non-stop action and a good plot. This was pulled off by an excellent director (RIchard Donner) and both of the lead actors. As a rule, I dislike sequels, and this is no exception. I remember when ""Death Wish"" (1974) with Charles Bronson came out. For me, it was the first of the revenge films, along with the ""2,3,4"" sequel syndrome. Both of these formulas have been beaten into the ground. The sequel part has occurred in every genre of film one can think of. Perhaps the most exploitative are the ""Fast & Furious"" movies. Of course ""Star Wars"" is up there as well, although that has a much different type of fan base. Regardless, this is the best when it comes to ""cop/buddy"" films. If I recall, it was the highest grossing film that year; if not, it was way up there. A must see.",Lethal Weapon
91,PredragReviews,Better dead than alive,9,7 May 2016,"One of the quintessential 80's action/cop/buddy cop movies. Glover and Gibson make a good pairing, the conflict is ratcheted up nicely, and Donner's direction give an epic feel to the action sequences. What the movie does, it does well.The plot involves an investigation into the death of a young woman, Amanda Hunsaker (Jackie Swanson), the daughter of an old war buddy of Murtaugh's, Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), who is now a successful banker. Ultimately, it leads Riggs and Murtaugh into some murky waters where they encounter a former General, Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan), and some ex-special forces mercenaries, including the especially psychotic Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey). There's some twists and turns along the way, but most importantly Donner keeps the action going and the tension building all the way to the climax. The dialogue is sharp, the story and characters are developed extremely well, and Donner wisely injects some humorous moments (courtesy of Gibson, with shades of The Three Stooges) that provide a respite to the intensity of the overall proceedings. But what really makes this movie is the pairing of Gibson and Glover. Perfectly cast as Riggs, Gibson is at his charismatic best here. He brings a depth to his character usually reserved for more dramatic fare, and layers him with a complexity that makes Riggs so much more than just another action hero. If you look deeply enough, you'll find a bit of McQueen's ""Bullitt"" in him.Along the way, however, an interesting thing happens. We are teated to actual characters, not typical shallow action-types. Riggs is shown to be a grieving widower, trying to make sense of things, while Murtaugh is a straight-laced family man who has to confront the baddies when they kidnap his daughter. They sort out their perspectives along the way, which is just as much a part of the story as the shoot-em-up action. It is no wonder, that these guys made several ""Lethal Weapon"" movies. They genuinely seemed to have a good time making this film.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Lethal Weapon
92,eric262003,The Best of the Series,9,26 November 2012,".The opening scene starts with an airborne view of Los Angeles where a gorgeous blonde chick, clad in a white nightgown,lying on a red sofa. Next to her on a table with drugs situated on top. The young lady gets up to sniff the drugs, then walks outside to the balcony, leans toward the railing and take her fatal plunge to her death.Mel Gibson was flat-out excellent as mentally unbalanced cop Det. Martin Riggs. As he combines his versatility as both a strong action hero and a lovable clown. Using both his charm and charisma, Riggs is probably one of the most endearing characters in film history. As a man who's perpetually grief-stricken after the death of his wife in a fatal automobile accident, Riggs has been living an unsettling life. Hell go far as to dare someone dangerous to kill him, even if its just for kicks. Many times Riggs tries to kill himself. With the assistance of his .9 mm. Beretta, he places the gun into his mouth and attempts to pull the trigger. Other attempts of suicidal tendencies is when another hes on top of a building and another jumper is nearby. He places one part of a handcuff on the jumpers wrist and another on his wrist as he gracefully throws the key in the air. As a unstable gunman, he fires shots without blinking claiming that ""killing was the only thing he could do well"".Riggs joins forcing with a reluctant ageing African-American police detective Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) to explore further investigation to the suicide of the young lady who fell to her death, which puts the dynamic duo in the centre of a major drug bust. Glover is equally effective and is known for stealing every scene he's in. Murtaugh is from the old-school of investigating as he is fixated on retirement but prefers to play by the rules rather than take risks like his partner Riggs. Pushing towards 50, Murtaugh wants to just forget about his achievements he's accomplished as an investigator and wants to spend time with his family.When news gets around that his daughter has been kidnapped, Murtaugh bites his tongue and goes along with Riggs risky ways in order to get his daughter back. Gary Busey is Mr. Joshua,a cold-blooded evil drug-lord who's also has had experience as a Vietnam vet. Joshua will go to any lengths necessary into how much the cops know about his drug rings. His boss General Peter MacAllister (Mitchell Ryan) who looks even more menacing than Joshua like as though he has icicles running through his veins. The evil general turns up the crank in the investigation by ordering Murtaugh to be annihilated and in the process kidnaps his adorable daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) in order for Murtaugh to speak. Director Richard Donner this movie combines plenty of bone-chilling action, great humour and brilliant acting by the cast. This goes beyond all expectancies from a cop-drama. The final action scenes pit Riggs and Murtaugh against the General and his goons features some of the best choreographed fight scenes ever put on film.",Lethal Weapon

94,winner55,"just a B-movie, after all",7,28 September 2009,"Beginning with the first Christopher Reeves Superman movie, the creative concept guys at Warner Bros. realized that if you sank millions of dollars into a B-movie formula, including hiring the right cast and crew, you would not only get millions of dollars in return, but everybody would be talking about it like it was an A-class film. (This knowledge had already been discovered by the James Bond team, but only with the success of Star Wars and the Indiana Jones films did it at last become obvious to all.) Look, Lethal Weapon, like so many other action films since that discovery was made, is a factory product. Some committee came up with the idea and set about hiring a team to realize it. It is all surface and no substance. There's no vision here, it's all meant to make money, that's all.I enjoy this film, very much - I've seen it over and over again, and I am thrilled by the action scenes and amused by the humor. But great film-making this is NOT. It's very slick, but it's also noisy, and clunky in spots, exploitative (did we really need to see the porn film the dead girl made?), overlong (with occasionally questionable editing choices), and it's ""dramatic"" moments are clearly intended to manipulate rather than arouse our emotions. This isn't even remarking the lack of realism regarding police procedure or the consequences of the behavior of the two heroes. Finally, as is apt for a B-movie, all the major players ham it up something fierce.But all this is entirely forgivable once one admits that, yeah, it's just a B-movie, after all, an amusing way to spend two hours when you have nothing better to do and want to watch good guys chase bad guys and blow things up.",Lethal Weapon

98,Howlin Wolf,The safety catch is permanently off... !,10,10 July 2007,"Cop who is a 'loose cannon'... Ho hum, right? Not in this case. Mel Gibson plays the role with frightening believability (as anyone who is familiar with his recent behaviour might not be surprised to hear... ) but also with an always self-deprecating sense of humour. He's very aware of his own faults and his relation to the world around him, a personal facet of the character as written that I find consistently amusing. Shane Black is unafraid to explore the scuzzier side of police work with his writing - in fact he positively wallows in it - so we're happy to accept with these two things combined that ""Lethal Weapon"" isn't just a catchy title, it might actually be the truth.Although the pairing of two such types is predictable, Danny Glover is equally as good in a different way taking on the role of Riggs' straight-laced partner. The banter between the two is very sharp but always stops just short of being terminally cutting. It's a teaming that each successive sequel builds upon to advantageous effect.This instalment is definitely the grittiest of the four, as thereafter the studios and Black's replacement scribes experimented with leavening the balance between action and humour. Over time Riggs' rough edges became sanded down, but for a full demonstration of his madcap antics when he was at his crazy peak, be sure not to miss this one. Nowhere else has instability been used as the basis for such an adrenaline-fuelled ride.",Lethal Weapon

Or maybe I'm just getting old.Every scene is on point as all hell. The perfect combination of pulp, grit, action, suspense and drama. I'd long thought Martin Riggs was my favorite character, but who am I kidding? The saxophone is probably my favorite character in all of cinema. In fact, you know what? It is! Move over Dr. Loomis and Rain Man... There's a saxophone comin' through.My introduction to this film was via VHS bargain bin back in the day. I think Movie Gallery was doing one of their 3 for $15 sales, if I remember correctly. I usually used said sales to purchase two flicks I'd already rented and loved, then took a chance on something well-known but that had slipped under my radar for whatever reason. Out of all those dice rolls, this was undoubtedly the best chance I ever took.

100,oneguyrambling,A high-water mark in mismatched buddy cop action comedies.,8,23 July 2011,"Lethal Weapon is perhaps the easiest Gibson vehicle to like and one of the best ""mismatched buddy cop"" films in history.Jaded vet Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) has just hit the big 5-ohhhh, with three kids and a mortgage, when he is partnered with Martin Riggs (Gibson), a younger, psychotic - and very likely suicidal - drunk struggling to move on from his wife's death. Riggs lives in a trailer on the beach with a dog as his only companion, and he has a myriad of techniques and skills in the art of killing, a crack shot with pistol or rifle and a martial artist, let's just say.The new pair are investigating the death of a young blonde woman who leapt to her death from a tall building, landing on a car below, which I only bring up to ask if anyone who ever jumped from a tall building DIDN'T land on a car? Regardless the young girl was a prostitute who more than dabbled in drugs and porn, and she was the daughter of one of Roger's buddies from Vietnam. It is discovered that her drugs were laced with poison and if she didn't jump from the building she would have died very soon in any case.Roger relays this new information to the father, who makes it very clear that regardless of Roger's badge and job description he wants the people responsible D.E.D.D.Pausing only to ""jump a jumper"" and to ponder the worth of his life, Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case...Being an 80s movie the plot is complex but not unnecessarily convoluted, the duo rapidly learn that they are up against a team of extremely dangerous mercenaries who intend to make a large shipment of heroin in only a few days, the team are led by the General and his loyal 2IC ""Mr Joshua"" (Gary Busey), who as well as being a crack soldier is perhaps the equal of Riggs in the insanity stakes.The mercenaries are vicious and brutal, and they target anyone in their way or anyone who might pose a threat, they quickly decide that Riggs and Murtaugh are both. Thankfully Riggs and Murtaugh are equally determined to deal with them and have no intention of running away. Each of them even get their own personal nemesis to ""off"" in the finale.After the initial wariness and friction Riggs and Murtaugh gradually develop a bond, which by the end of the film is already an easy chemistry. There are many setpieces that are extremely effective and some cool 80s stuntwork and driving sequences.This film wasn't as worried about the comedy elements as the sequels so it doesn't try so hard, but as a result the jokes work a little better, and of course they are often thrown around in the middle of crisis situations.Lethal Weapon is one of the better preserved classics of the 80s, it has aged very well and aside from being a little slow at times in comparison to today's action flicks it stands up against any film of the last decade and features a cast full of bit actors from half of the films made in the decade. The reasonably straightforward plot is a plus - the good guys are good and the bad guys need plugging full of holes - and the action to comedy ratio is just in favour of the action.As it should be.I said to my wife that Riggs is Gibson's Rambo or Rocky, and if you think he hasn't strongly considered dragging him out of retirement to attempt to rebuild his image you're nuts. I then joked (repeat: JOKED) that given his tirades in the last few years Riggs would take on a group of Jewish criminals... then turn the gun on Roger.If that sounds off-colour it is more a reflection of Gibson than anything else.I wouldn't watch Lethal Weapon 5; but I must (begrudgingly) admit that the original Lethal Weapon is a great flick.Final Rating - 8.5 / 10. One of the best buddy cop action flicks. Well paced with big explosions, car chases, snappy quips and a high body count. Immensely entertaining.",Lethal Weapon
101,seymourblack-1,"Action, Comedy & Mismatched Cops",9,15 September 2016,"The template for ""buddy cop movies"" had already been created some years before ""Lethal Weapon"" went into production and so its combination of action, comedy and a couple of mismatched cops didn't seem to offer anything particularly new. What it did offer, however, was an excellent plot, a couple of well-drawn characters and two actors whose extraordinary on-screen rapport contributed enormously to the phenomenal success that this movie justifiably achieved.Its story, which involves murder, drug-smuggling and kidnapping, is exciting, violent and often tense with some light relief being provided throughout by the bizarre behaviour of one of the cops and the entertaining banter that's an on-going feature of a relationship that, against the odds, develops into a strong friendship between two very different men.Homicide detective Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is assigned to investigate the apparent suicide of a young woman who had leaped to her death from a penthouse balcony. He soon discovers that she was the daughter of his old Vietnam War buddy, Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins) and later receives evidence that confirms that she was murdered. At fifty years of age and with retirement approaching, Murtaugh is keen to avoid any unnecessary danger and so, when he's teamed up with detective Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), who has a certain reputation for being unstable, he becomes very apprehensive.Riggs is an ex-Army Special Forces sniper who was classed as a ""lethal weapon"" and who, following the recent death of his wife, had become unpredictable and suicidal. His state of mind had become a source of concern for police psychiatrists because it had led to him taking great risks in his work and soon it becomes evident that he and Murtaugh have very different ways of doing things. The tensions caused by this situation initially makes their partnership difficult but as the investigation continues, some incidents that they confront, lead to them gaining more trust in each other.Hunsaker admits that he had, for some years, been involved in a drug smuggling operation which had been in existence since the Vietnam War and which was headed by General Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) who, like his henchman, Mr Joshua (Gary Busey), is extremely ruthless and they had murdered his daughter as a consequence of his decision to get out of their racket. The ensuing pursuit of the smugglers leads to Murtaugh's daughter being kidnapped and both detectives being tortured before Riggs and Joshua meet in the movie's final confrontation.Mel Gibson gives a remarkable performance in this movie as he excels as an action hero but also brings incredible intensity to the passages of the film where Riggs struggles with his suicidal tendencies. It's also interesting to watch how his initially volatile and reckless character gradually becomes more rational as a result of his relationship with Murtaugh and his family. Danny Glover also does a brilliant job of showing Murtaugh's humanity, warmth and insecurities as he deals with the demands of his job and his family, whilst also coming to terms with his concerns about getting older.""Lethal Weapon"" is hugely enjoyable, exciting to watch and full of humorous moments. It's extremely well-written and its emphasis on the nature and development of its characters is what ultimately elevates it above the level of most other similar action movies.",Lethal Weapon
102,Sirus_the_Virus,One of my favorite films ever.,10,17 October 2009,"Danny Glover and Mel Gibson give the best performances of their careers in the instant classic Lethal weapon. Though I love this movie so much because Mel Gibson is bad ass and they are both very funny and the action is great, this is going to be a short review for this film. Just know that it's great.Do I like this film as much as Die Hard? No, but I thought that both were great films series'. Mel Gibson plays Riggs, a cop with a death wish. Danny Glover plays Martaugh, a cop with a family. The two of them are assigned to each other. But they both have one thing in common. They hate being assigned partners. The two of them have to take down drug dealers. Though not too much to the plot, but the film is fantastic.Lethal weapon:****/****",Lethal Weapon
103,baumer,I suppose we have to register you as a lethal weapon.,10,5 July 1999,"Lethal Weapon caught me and everybody completely off guard.  It was a film that no one saw coming.  Mel Gibson was known for his work on the Mad Max films but he was still relatively obscure in Hollywood.  Danny Glover was more or less a serious actor, hence his role in Color Purple.  But could anyone have been prepared for what this movie accomplished?  Could you be prepared for what it has spawned and created?Lethal Weapon is a tour de force of action and comedy.  Richard Donner will be forever remembered for his role in this movie.  But to me, as terrific as his direction is and as amazing as Gibson and Glover are and as terrific as a script that Shane Black has written, there is one unsung hero in this film and many other films that have entertained us for the last 20 years.  And that is Joel Silver.The action is ground breaking, the humour is hysterical, the chemistry is magic and the whole picture is a delight.  That's all you need to know. As for Joel Silver, take a look at his filmography in here ( IMDb ).  It will blow you away at how many films he has done that are pure entertainment.",Lethal Weapon
104,DunnDeeDaGreat,Action and comedy at their best,10,16 June 2003,Lethal Weapon is the first in a series of films that were all good. Richard Donner made an action packed buddy picture that everyone can enjoy. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were both good in the lead roles and the action sequences are top notch. Kudos to Gary Busey for making a great bad guy.,Lethal Weapon
105,mentalcritic,Remember when action films had action in them?,10,1 May 2005,"If you do, then viewing Lethal Weapon once more on DVD-Video will be like returning to an old friend after an absence of several decades. The concept of the buddy cop routine was old and tired, even in the late 1980s, but stellar performances from Danny Glover and a very fresh-faced Mel Gibson made Lethal Weapon one to truly stand out from the pack. It also managed to impress upon viewers like myself that sometimes, you cannot keep the evil lurking out there away from your family. Whether this is a subtle comment on the blindness of attempts by action films to be family-friendly, as they call it, or just an amusing side effect, is best left to the individual viewer.The story begins with a typical day in the life of an aging detective by the name of Roger Murtaugh. If this man embodied the family-man spirit any more, he would have to be stuffed and mounted on a wall. But after kissing the wife and children goodbye before reporting for another day at work, one of his worst nightmares comes true. His new partner is a rather strange-looking character by the name of Martin Riggs. In the course of just one day, Riggs manages to risk his life, and that of his new partner, in so many memorable ways that the film is now entrenched as an example of the buddy cop film not only being done right, but being done brilliantly. Part of this lies in the fact that rather that resorting to cultural stereotyping to make the bond work, Lethal Weapon focuses more on what makes this admittedly mismatched pair similar.The main plot focuses on investigating the suicide of a young woman who happens to be the daughter of an old war buddy of Murtaugh's. As the two detectives begin asking questions, a string of extremely memorable attempts on their lives begins. They say that an action hero is only as strong as his antagonist, and Gary Busey gives Mel Gibson a lot to work with here. Gibson, fresh off the rather tepid third installment in the Mad Max franchise, obviously knew this was his shot at the big time, and he rides it for everything that it is worth. What is interesting to note is that Danny Glover, although treated as the elder statesman of this duo, had about the same number of films under his belt at the time. It is sadly ironic that this, rather than a role in a great historical drama like The Colour Purple, Glover is hardly remembered outside of this admittedly impressive cavalcade of stunts.I have been reading articles recently that state, among other things, that the real reason films have been getting more expensive and less profitable is not so much production costs, but because of a massive explosion in salaries. Lethal Weapon, estimated to have cost fifteen million to make, took in more than four times that sum at the box office. That's to say nothing of all the rentals and video sales that this, regarded by some as the best action/buddy film, has generated. It reminds me of a satirical graphic developed by one pack of jokers that states the fact that film executives once paid Keanu Reeves thirty million dollars, but piracy is making them bankrupt. Although I disagree with the idea that the best films were made in the so-called Golden Era, when studios reigned over cast and crew like the monarchs of old, I do agree with the notion that film does not function well at all when commerce is the driving factor. It has become better to lose money spending a hundred million rather than ten million, and the art suffers badly for it.Lethal Weapon is also (almost) the last film on the resumé of stuntman Dar Robinson, whose resume also includes the first two Police Academy films, along with other surprising classics like Rollerball. As Lethal Weapon was in post-production, Robinson was tragically killed in a motorbike accident. A brief dedication at the end of the film lets viewers in on the fact that behind all those men who dive off buildings or get blown up for their entertainment, there are names and faces. It is a quiet dedication that most never bother to watch, but it reminds that stuntmen are truly the unsung heroes of the action film industry.I gave Lethal Weapon a ten out of ten. It shows in no uncertain terms that action films work better when the director is allowed to focus on that little element called action. Not just the kind of action where some idiot shoots another with a cap gun, and you see some terrible playacting, but the kind of action where men are trapped in cars that, seconds later, explode with a mighty thud. They don't make them much better than this.",Lethal Weapon
106,hnt_dnl,Arguably the best cop-buddy film!,10,9 August 2015,"LETHAL WEAPON (1987) is perhaps the best cop buddy film made. Yes, there were several before (and many since!), but this one feels like the peak of the genre, and it's mainly due to the tremendous acting displayed by it's stars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, but ESPECIALLY Gibson! I honestly believe that Gibson was robbed of a Best Actor nomination for his intense, deeply involving performance of L.A. Police Sergeant Martin Riggs, a suicidal 11-year police vet who mourns the loss of his wife in a tragic car accident every single day of his life. Riggs lives life on the edge. He can't keep a partner due to his affinity for danger. In comes Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (excellently played by Danny Glover), a family man who just turned 50 and is ready for early retirement, because, you know, he's ""too old for this sh*t!"" LOL.Riggs is paired with Murtaugh to investigate an apparent suicide of a coked-out 18-year old Amanda Hunsaker (played by Jackie Swanson of ""Cheers"" fame in the scene that opened the film) and things get interesting fast as the ""suicide"" leads the cops to a web of intrigue. The girl's father, a prominent banker Michael Hunsaker is a former Army buddy of Murtaugh who saved his life in Vietnam. The banker is played by Tom Atkins (a stalwart of John Carpenter 70s-80s flicks) and Atkins is very persuasive as a man in over his head. Turns out that Hunsaker is involved in money laundering, using his bank as a front for a local drug ring comprised of former military specialists. The head of the ring is General McAllister (played with cold detachment by Mitchell Ryan) and his right hand is Mr. Joshua (played with scary, scene-stealing brilliance by Gary Busey). There seemed to be a trend around this time of having high class villains in action movies, with McAllister and Joshua actually preceding the Die Hard villains Hans and Karl by about a year and a half (Lethal Weapon technically premiered on Christmas Day '86 while Die Hard came out the summer of '88). But the Lethal Weapon villains are just as scary and intense (if not more so) than the Die Hard ones. The real pull of Lethal Weapon to me is the authentic chemistry and budding relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh and their snappy banter throughout. There have been buddy movies ad nauseum over the years, but this one feels like the best due to the believable progression of the Riggs-Murtaugh relationship. Of course, this being the first film of the eventual series (there were 4 total), this is the only one where Riggs and Murtaugh actually disliked each other for most of the film, but by the end they were best buddies, which carried over to all the sequels. Anyone who watched any of the (inferior) sequels first will find it hard to imagine that these 2 cops actually had an active dislike for each other at one point, but you have to start somewhere!Notable performances are also delivered by Darlene Love (as Murtaugh's wife Trish) and Traci Wolfe (as Murtaugh's eldest daughter Rianne, who has a crush on Riggs). The film was directed with energy, style, and flair by Richard Donner, who notedly directed the first Superman film from 1978 (interesting dichotomy) and would go onto direct all 3 Lethal Weapon sequels. But this is the one that got it right...it's the original...usually that's the keeper!",Lethal Weapon
107,Karl Self,Dismal Weapon,6,21 December 2008,"There are two movies here: the first is a brilliant, groundbreaking ""incompatible cop team"" action movie with plenty of laughs. LAPD Sergeant Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is a ""middle-aged"" (altough Glover was actually only sweet 40 at the time of filming) cop with a large family and the world's worst cook for a wife. He has to team up with Sergeant Riggs, a young buck from a Special Forces background, who has gone mental following the death of his young wife.Just the opening scene, where a young hooker jumps to her death, is outstanding. At the beginning of this scene you might still be chatting with your friends about where to go afterwards, but at the end of this scene you will be firmly sitting in your seat and staring at the screen. And I may not be the hugest Mel Gibson fan, but his acting here is very impressive. There is a scene where he attempts to muster the courage to shoot himself in the head; this scene is crucial to the credibility of the entire movie, and there is one way of doing it right and a thousand of doing it wrong, but Gibson gets it spot-on. Glover is equally outstanding as the good-hearted, amiable guy who feels he's getting ""too old for this sh*t"". A difficult role to play next to Riggs' atom bomb of a character without going under or seeming like a douchebag.Anyroads, this film has it all: great acting, great plot, great cinematography, great atmosphere, it's all just so damn right and fine. You'd think that this movie was safely on its way to cinematic greatness when suddenly, inexplicably, it starts to suck harder than Monica Lewinsky trying to beat an octopus to it. It kind of starts in the scene where Hunsacker reveals his role as a drug trafficker and then is murdered by being shot from a helicopter. While drinking eggnog. But the story really jumps the shark in the desert lake scene, where oldtimer Murtaugh keeps a whole squad of heavily-armed mercenaries who are equipped with a freakin' helicopter AND holding his darling daughter hostage in check by threatening ""to blow us all up"" with a single hand-grenade.It's as if the studio had decided that this movie has been great enough so far, let's just roller-coaster it home. I don't know what happened here behind the scenes, but in a nutshell: a great movie for about one hour, then terribly sucky in its denouement. Still, for the cop-action-fan, it's recommended viewing.",Lethal Weapon
108,Beta_Gallinger,"A steady buddy cop movie, featuring suspense, humour, and two likable leads",8,22 April 2009,"This 80's action movie, starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, both famous actors I'm familiar with, was released about half a year after I was born, and since it's an R-rated movie, it obviously would have been quite a while before I would ever get to see it. 22 years later, after being aware of the existence of this movie and its sequels for only a short while (I guess that's because I came across copies of them in the video store more than once), I've finally seen it. ""Lethal Weapon"" was obviously a success, since it spawned three sequels, and knowing how popular it was, I was expecting a decent action thriller. I could have found the film absolutely stunning, which I didn't, but for the most part, it is an impressive buddy cop movie.Roger Murtaugh (Glover) has been working for the L.A.P.D. for quite a long time, and has just reached his 50th birthday. He is informed of the death of Amanda Hunsaker, who fell from her apartment. She was the daughter of Michael Hunsaker, a man who was friends with Roger when they fought in Vietnam, but they haven't seen each other in twelve years. So, the L.A.P.D. detective is assigned to investigate, and is assigned a partner for this investigation, a younger L.A.P.D. detective named Martin Riggs (Gibson). Riggs has been mentally unstable and suicidal since the death of his wife in an accident, and he takes unusually high risks while on the job! It turns out that Amanda was poisoned, so the two cops are to find out who is responsible. Their mission, which won't be made any easier by their conflicting personalities, leads them to a group of drug-smuggling mercenaries! Not everything about this movie thoroughly impressed me. The intro is a bit bland, showing a moving overhead view through the city put to ""Jingle Bell Rock"". It then goes to Amanda Hunsaker, showing the character on her fateful night, and this sequence also could have been done better. Jackie Swanson didn't do the best job in this very brief role, even though she apparently performed her own stunt, which was obviously an accomplishment. So, there may be some dull moments, but to make up for that, there is a lot of action and suspense, and while the dialogue may be flawed at times, I've heard worse. So many people have praised this film for the two leads, and I'm going to have to join them. Danny Glover and Mel Gibson do make a good team, both playing memorable characters with depth. (Yes, I know I'm not the first to point that out.) Putting a lot of action in a movie isn't necessarily going to make it good, but with the two leads, along with some humour, ""Lethal Weapon"" doesn't rely entirely on action for entertainment value. For that reason, I can see why this 1987 blockbuster was such a big hit.",Lethal Weapon
109,vip_ebriega,"Good cop, bad cop.",8,22 May 2008,"My Take: While somewhat dated in spots, this is an enjoyable caper comedy with some thrilling action and well-developed characters. LETHAL WEAPON still remains one of the classic 80's action pictures. But it ain't a classic for non-stop action ala DIE HARD and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. The film is memorable heavily for the partnership between the two leads, Mel Gibson as Martin Riggs and Danny Glover as Roger Murtaugh. Gibson is the suicidal type, Glover is the nice family guy type. For just the bond between and the sparing of these two characters, LETHAL WEAPON had me and never lost me.The main plot concerns the odd couple cop partners battle against drug lords. But the real plot mainly concerns how these two characters go together. The action scenes, including two car chase with one against a helicopter, come later during the film. But director Richard Donner doesn't keep us waiting. He makes his actors fun to watch to make sure the audiences stuck to them till the end. The trick works, and these two leads are very fun to watch.Gibson is very lively as Riggs, a crazy guy ready to explode. He's wacky and witty, yet darn serious and just plain nuts at the same time. Glover is his counterpart, and he's just as good to watch. It's nice to see a cop movie where the cop's family plays some essence in the story. What Glover's character cares about (his family), we care about. Then there are the bad guys, which like all great villains are real meanies. The villain played by Gary Busey (the nearly unstoppable Mr. Joshua) is probably the best of the other villains in the film played by Mitch Ryan and others.Overall, it's not as relentlessly busy as DIE HARD or the INDIANA JONES movies. But it's the closest one where we'll get to an action movie with well-developed characters.Rating: **** out of 5.",Lethal Weapon

I must admit i've always been a bigger fan of 48 HRS and Lethal Weapon 2 over this movie, mainly due to the fact that the plot is far duller and the action sequences not quite as spectacular as the fore-mentioned titles. Still there is plenty to like here, as Gary Busey makes a great villain, Gibson and Glover share excellent chemistry and basically the movie is directed with an excellent eye for detail. It just lacks that extra something that made 48 HRS and its sequel better. Still I say it's worth a look, and by far one of the best in the genre, especially when compared to the extremely dull Red Heat and Tango and Cash. Also the movie has a great hostage negotiation sequence, although as far as Mel Gibson movies go, I'll always be more partial to the Mad Max movies.

111,jhclues,"A ""Lethal"" Beginning",10,23 November 2000,"This is the one that started all the `lethal' action and introduced one of the most memorable cop teams in cinematic history.  `Lethal Weapon,' directed by Richard Donner, is a hard-hitting, fast-paced action/drama starring Mel Gibson as Detective Sergeant Martin Riggs, who once served in the Special Forces in Vietnam, and who now serves the city of Los Angeles. Riggs has some inner demons with which he must cope (the loss of his wife), and starts every day thinking of reasons why he shouldn't swallow a bullet. In the end, it's the job that keeps him going; it's what he does best in the world.  Meanwhile, Detective Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is dealing with some issues in his own life:  He just turned fifty, has a teenaged daughter who is suddenly grown-up and dating, and he's just been assigned a new partner, Riggs, whom he quickly learns has a propensity for dangerous situations and apparently has a death wish.  His assessment of his situation is summed up with his now classic line, `I'm too old for this ----.'  And the adventure begins. 	The plot involves an investigation into the death of a young woman, Amanda Hunsaker (Jackie Swanson), the daughter of an old war buddy of Murtaugh's, Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), who is now a successful banker.  Ultimately, it leads Riggs and Murtaugh into some murky waters where they encounter a former General, Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan), and some ex-special forces mercenaries, including the especially psychotic Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey). There's some twists and turns along the way, but most importantly Donner keeps the action going and the tension building all the way to the climax. The dialogue is sharp, the story and characters are developed extremely well, and Donner wisely injects some humorous moments (courtesy of Gibson, with shades of The Three Stooges) that provide a respite to the intensity of the overall proceedings.  But what really makes this movie is the pairing of Gibson and Glover. 	Perfectly cast as Riggs, Gibson is at his charismatic best here.  He brings a depth to his character usually reserved for more dramatic fare, and layers him with a complexity that makes Riggs so much more than just another action hero.  If you look deeply enough, you'll find a bit of McQueen's `Bullitt' in him.  To his credit, Gibson took what could have been just another `star' outing and created a truly memorable character.  Glover, as well, breathes real life into Murtaugh; he lets you in on what really makes his character tick, what his loyalties are and his perceptions of the world in which he lives.  Like Gibson, he gets beneath the surface and gives you a lot more; much more than meets the eye.  And there's a chemistry between the two that really clicks and makes it all work so well.  Watching these guys operate is real kick; they give the audience something to relate to, and it's that connection they make with the viewer that is one of the reasons the `Lethal' films have been so successful. 	Also memorable in supporting roles are Darlene Love, as Roger's wife, Trish; and Traci Wolfe as their daughter, Rianne.  In the end, `Lethal Weapon' is an exhilarating, entertaining movie that introduces some great characters that happily, for the audience, return in the sequels.  It's like meeting good people who become your friends for life.  But be prepared; once you've seen this one, you're going to HAVE to see the rest.  And I guarantee, you're going to want to see them all more than once, so be ready to add to your DVD/video collection.  These are keepers. I rate this one 9/10.",Lethal Weapon
112,KnightsofNi11,Simply fun,7,26 August 2012,"The buddy cop movie formula seems to have been around for a while, but one could argue that Lethal Weapon is the film that devised this formula. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover star as two cops who reluctantly work together to stop a group of drug smugglers. They have wildly different personalities that are constantly clashing, as are their methods of doing the same job. Gibson plays Martin Riggs, an unhinged officer with suicidal tendencies, while Glover plays Roger Murtagh, a family man and a veteran cop. The two make a charming pair that make for a fun and explosively entertaining film.Lethal Weapon is very simple and very straightforward. It is, after all, just a formula film. There's nothing astounding or jaw dropping about the film, but it is a lot of fun. It's the quintessential buddy cop film, no matter how standard and ordinary the buddy cop genre is. The story about drug smugglers brings nothing new to the table. It's very simple, but thankfully not dull.All that a good buddy cop movie can really depend on is the chemistry in its two leads, as there's not much more going for this genre most of the time. Lethal Weapon succeeds on this front. Gibson and Glover are great together. Their characters are believable and seeing them work together is a lot of fun. It's clear they had a fun time working on the film together as they give their respective performances their all. I have zero respect for Mel Gibson these days for obvious reasons, but I was even able to find him enjoyable in this film. He and Glover are excellent, and are essentially the only thing that makes Lethal Weapon a worthwhile watch.If you love buddy cop movies then this is a must see. If you're indifferent towards the genre, like me, then you may or may not want to invest two hours of your life towards Lethal Weapon.

In addition, if you're not able to take a classic action buddy cop movie of all time, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon (1987) is my favorite classic action the best Christmas flick alongside Die Hard! It was always my favorite action flick from Richard Donner and Shane Black beside Superman (1978). If the Godfather is the Godfather of all gangster flicks, then Lethal Weapon is the Godfather of all buddy-buddy action cop flicks! In the summer of '87 director Richard Donner gave us Riggs and Murtaugh. Lethal Weapon is one of the Greatest Action Movies from the 80's. This is the movie I grew up and it is my childhood movie! You should know all of the great action movies: Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Dirty Harry, etc. This movie is a classic. Movie was the best cop movie EVER! It showed that cops are human too and have the same faults as the rest of us. The action scenes were great and keep you engaged through the whole movie. Gary Busey and Danny Glover both started in Predator 2. I think the man Gary Busey is very underrated actor for playing action hero's and villains. I think he did the best job ever. I seriously love him in Lethal Weapon and Predator 2!The first one in the Lethal Weapon series is a really fun 80s action flick! It's one of my favorite action movies of all time. I love this movie to death I love it!!! And the chemistry between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson is just flawless. The deserts scenes are outstanding and really fantastic in which Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) attempt to rescue Murtaugh's daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) in the desert, Riggs provides cover for Murtaugh using a Heckler & Koch PSG-1 sniper rifle with a high-capacity magazine and Harris bipod. He succeeds in taking out several Shadow Company goons and is about to shoot Mr. Joshua when General McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) interferes and captures him, later seen carrying the rifle across his back while escorting the captured Riggs.Lethal Weapon is the 1987 action film that was one of the first in the modern ""buddy cop"" genre. Mel Gibson stars as LAPD Detective Martin Riggs, a cop who lives on the ragged edge and who could be suicidal, much to the chagrin of his new partner Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), who is celebrating his 50th birthday. Together they uncover a drug smuggling ring that involves a criminal gang comprised of mercenaries and former members of a CIA / special forces ""Black Ops"" unit with ties to the Vietnam War. The film was written by Shane Black and directed by Richard Donner (Superman: The Movie). The success of the movie would help spawn a film franchise that spanned four films as well as numerous movie imitators.Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, McAllister has no control over the accelerator and brake pedals, so he can only steer as the car enters a main street, where it's t-boned by a large bus and flipped over. The general is upside down, bleeding, surrounded by bags of drugs and several grenades. When McAllister is trying to reach and grabbing the grenades, they all explode, destroying the car and him). The gunplay is delivered in perfect Richard Donner style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable. In the Murtaugh's house the wall of the living room caves in and an empty police car crashes into the room, a police baton wedged onto the accelerator. Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey) shoots a T. V. displaying a Christmas commercial with his Colt XM177 Commando at Murtaugh's home and fires all round in the police car. The fighting sequences between Joshua (Gray Busey) and Riggs (Mel Gibson) is very realistic! You don't see any realistic fighting scenes in any action movie like that!This movie is the best action packed filled with a lot of entrainment, excitement, joy, laughs and a lot of action sequences! It is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, great acting, the flying sequences between Riggs and suicide jumper is outstanding but a really crazy stunt, I have ever seen. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. I love this movie, it is the finest action movie of all time ever made!!!!! This first entry in the series that would spawn 3 sequels and countless duplicates, is the darker of the set. But the action and violence is played up and this one is a classic from first view to the next.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Warner Bros.

117,gab-14712,One of the Best Action Films from the 1980's!,9,11 October 2020,"Lethal Weapon is often considered to be one of the greatest buddy cop films of all time. It is an assessment I would not disagree with. It spawned three legitimate sequels and a decent television reboot. Some say Beverly Hills Cop started this type of movie, but most agree that this hardwired action extravaganza began the boom of action-packed cop films that dominated the 1980's and the 1990's. This film is absolutely bonkers...in a good way. Director Richard Donner sends one action sequence after another and he does not dare step on the brakes. That could have been boring, yet Donner made us care about the two polar opposite characters; homebody Roger Murtagh and wild Martin Riggs. The chemistry between the two characters is unlike anything you would ever see. The comedy and even the action work because of this duo.
The idea of this movie was generated from Shane Black. A recent college graduate, Black wanted to create a ""modern Western"" and was inspired by films like Dirty Harry. His original script was dark and had enormous action sequences such as the Hollywood sign being covered in cocaine (now that would be a fun sequence)! Donner loved the script, but he toned down the script because it was too dark. The final script is excellent, and it features some very juicy, memorable lines of dialogue. This is where Shane Black became a name in Hollywood. As for Donner, he did a great job going all out making an R-rated film. It's no Superman or The Goonies. He invested lots of time and energy to make sure this film would be about its characters and not about the big, bad action sequences. Although one will admit it is nice to see our heroes and antagonists wreak havoc in Southern California.
Roger Murtagh (Danny Glover) is turning 50 years old. He is a family man and is deeply emotional about his new age. He is assigned a new partner, the younger and crazier Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson). Riggs has been suicidal since his girlfriend perished in a car crash several years before, which allows him the benefit of being reckless in these big fights. Their first case together is to investigate the death of Amanda Hunsaker, a prostitute and daughter of Murtagh's banker friend. Upon investigation, they realize that the young woman was murdered. The investigation allows the two men to be targets of the Shadow Company, a group of former Vietnam War mercenaries that distribute cocaine in Southern California. General Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) and his head honcho Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey) wants them both dead.
This is putting it mildly, but the acting blows everything up (literally and figuratively). The chemistry between Glover and Gibson goes unmatched when compared to action films of the past, present, and probably future. Glover, coming off success in The Color Purple, loved the idea of being a family-first man and then has his world come undone with the introduction of Riggs in his life. Gibson becomes unhinged, but you can understand the position he is in. His wildness attracts the ladies (such as Murtagh's teenage daughter), but his emotional state is horrid. There is a scene where he tries to stop someone from killing himself, and that scene hits home. This movie revitalized Gary Busey's career and he had to audition for the role of Mr. Joshua. He was a terrifying villain. He is an intimidating man with the propensity for some disgusting electric torture.
In terms of the action, the filmmakers wanted to go big. They hurled action scenes at you from the starting line. If you can imagine it, it is probably there. Big sequences with helicopters and machine guns, the aforementioned electric torture, trying to rescue Murtagh's kidnapped daughter, and the list goes on and on. Most importantly, the action was not boring because of the characters. The music, composed by Michael Kamen, also plays an important role. If you did not know, Eric Clapton is the one playing the electric guitar.
Overall, Lethal Weapon is so much fun to watch. It definitely has moments that are deep, but Donner/Black made sure it did not take itself too seriously. The lines each character at certain points made me crack up. I do love when Glover repeatedly mentions, ""I'm too old for this ...."" The action is believable even when it plays for borderline insanity. Be prepared for a wild ride because it is heart-pounding, relentless, and will allow for an amazing time! Danny Glover and Mel Gibson made for an excellent, unforgettable pairing.
My Grade: A-",Lethal Weapon
118,SmileysWorld,"Sets the standard for the many ""buddy cop"" flicks that followed",8,11 October 2002,"Although there had been others before,this ""buddy cop"" film is the one people probably most refect back on,when they see one like it today.This teaming of a middle aged veteran cop(Danny Glover),and the mentally troubled recently widowed Martin Riggs(Mel Gibson),is the one that sets the standard for the many that have followed since,including it's three sequels.The chemistry between Glover and Gibson is terrific,and the story is indeed compelling,with Murtaugh(Glover),finding himself at odds with a former Vietnam war buddy whose daughter has just been murdered.A great villanous performance here by Gary Busey as Mr. Joshua. It has just enough appeal to be an entertaining film,though it has it's violent moments which of course children should be shielded from.Thumbs up!",Lethal Weapon
119,fernandoschiavi,"Lethal weapon is an absolute classic of the genre, with great script and direction. Danny Glover and Mel Gibson turns the film into something truly unforgettable",8,29 August 2020,"The 1980s are certainly the best representation of action cinema, bringing several classic copies to the present day, which would become successful worldwide franchises. In this medium, we can include the continuations of the Rocky franchise, Die Hard, Rambo, among others. Lethal weapon is certainly one of the most successful examples of its kind. Produced by Joel Silver, scripted by Shane Black and directed by Richard Donner, the same behind the super-successful Superman (1978), the film marked the era, raising more than 120 million dollars at the box office, with a budget of 15 million dollars. In addition, it was nominated for the Oscar for Best Sound Mixing. Due to the great commercial and critical success, the film became one of the main works of Glover and Gibson, initiating a successful film franchise of three more sequences and a television series.Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) is a madman who is always on the edge. On the other hand, policeman Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is a quiet man, waiting only for his retirement to arrive. Despite the differences, they become partners to fight a gang of drug traffickers, made up of ex-Vietnam War soldiers.Beginning screenwriter Shane Black definitely understood the buddy cop style - marked by classic series like Miami Vice, Starsky & Hutch, CHiPs, Agent 86, Hawaii Five-O and so many others - and cinema would never be the same ... Black part of the desire to do something close to an ""urban western"", putting us in sunny Los Angeles in the 80s. The story here is a mere pretext for us to analyze and entertain ourselves with the very amusing relationship of the characters. Glover masterfully and comfortably embodies the older policeman who believes in a safer and more traditional approach to investigation, while Gibson simply explodes on the scene in Riggs' memorable figure, a guy who, to summarize things a lot, is freaking and unstable. The death of his wife in a car accident turned him into an uncontrolled suicide, a characteristic that Black uses very well in his script and that yields brilliant moments from Gibson's performance, whose fury reaches even fun levels when facing some of the criminals here.The empathy that ""Lethal weapon"" provokes in the viewer is largely due to the fact that the two policemen are ordinary people, with many problems and completely vulnerable. In addition, Danny Glover and Mel Gibson's performances are obviously very collaborative. The duo's dynamics are impressive and the actors are at ease in their roles. Watch as Riggs hums during the target shooting session as he hits all the shots, causing Roger to be astonished, while his friend demonstrates firmness in confronting Riggs' trauma when needed. By teaming up with Murtaugh, Riggs ends up earning a new family and a second chance. Seeing these days, it may seem a bit shaky, since buddy cop movies have become very popular. But, at the time, there was a freshness that did not go unnoticed by the audience and the critics. True friendship appears in happy and sad moments.The excellent introduction of the characters places the viewer very well in the plot. Right away, we know that Murtaugh faces problems with his age through his reaction to family jokes on his birthday, reinforced by the phrase ""I'm too old for that"", repeated over and over again during the feature. We also know, in his first appearance, that Riggs is a person left in life, living in a trailer and not seeming to care much for the mess that surrounds him (in reality, this mess reflects his psychological state, revealing the good work of direction of art). It is also worth mentioning that having participated in the Vietnam War is perhaps the only point in common between the two policemen. While one seeks the calm of retirement and has a stable family, the other seeks death in every way after having his family destroyed, which makes him a constant danger to everyone who crosses his path. In the impressive scene in which Riggs puts the gun to his head and mouth, the reason for his pain is evident - and Gibson conveys this feeling very well, crying and fighting the urge to drop everything and leave this life. The script spreads evidence throughout the narrative, but never gives much explanation about Riggs' drama, which is elegant and correct. Images speak more than words.
Michael Kamen, who just completed his work on Highlander, composed the soundtrack for Lethal Weapon. The guitar part of the Riggs theme was performed by Eric Clapton. Kamen and Clapton had worked together on the music for the 1985 BBC TV series Edge of Darkness (whose theatrical adaptation would later be, coincidentally, starring Mel Gibson). The saxophone part of the Murtaugh theme was performed by David Sanborn. The Christmas song ""Jingle Bell Rock"", performed by Bobby Helms, is played during the opening credits of the film. The song ""Lethal Weapon"" by the hard rock band Honeymoon Suite is played during the final credits of the film without being credited. The peculiar relationship of the protagonists is exceptionally accompanied by the soundtrack. It's a sensual and evocative song, whose mix of a heavy saxophone worthy of a Sidney Bechet and Clapton's vibrant guitar brings a perfect harmony with the story and its characters: the meeting between the new and the old, the classic and the radical, while the notes effectively emulate the mood of a noir that falls well in this dangerous Los Angeles.Donner's direction is exquisite. Having just left the success of The Goonies (1985), Donner lends his talent for composition and action to bring Black's text to life. The wide open plans and simple choreography for the fight scenes guarantee an agile and fun rhythm, and Donner is smart to, for example, lead the sequence where Riggs deals with a suicide bomber in the city center, where we see how the framing limitation was essential to hide a very important element that guarantees one of the best surprises in the scene.Mixing elements of action and comedy is always welcome, as these two genres usually marry very well when the junction is performed correctly, even more in police films. Fortunately, Richard Donner got his hand on this first feature in the remarkable and entertaining series. The initial traveling of ""Lethal Weapon"" takes us to Amanda Hunsaker's (Jackie Swanson) apartment to the sound of the lively Christmas song ""Jingle Bells"". Upon entering the apartment, however, the reality is quite different from the joy that Christmas brings. The young blonde, drugged and apparently beside herself, walks to the balcony where her life will end. The shocking crash scene is very well done by Donner, who shows the impact in a very realistic way, ending the sequence with an impressive plan made from inside the affected car. The director also takes great care in the sensational action sequences, with emphasis on the explosion of a house, the invasion of a mansion and, mainly, the entire final sequence, which begins with the heavy torture of the police (note the painful reactions of Riggs and Murtaugh) and only ends in the fight between Riggs and Joshua (Gary Busey) in front of Roger's house. Although exaggerated, the final fight is visually beautiful, accentuated by the obscure photography, the rain and the agitated camera that alternates close-ups (highlighting the pain of the characters) and distant shots, which allow us to appreciate the elaborate strokes delivered.In another moment, right after the kidnapping of Rianne (Traci Wolfe), Donner creates a beautiful plan where Roger and Riggs talk in front of the Christmas tree. Observe how cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt uses the strong dominance of red in the scene, visually illustrating the duo's astral hell at that time. Finally, in the tense and spectacular sequence of the desert, Donner starts and ends with a traveling, setting the viewer to the place. Notice how Stuart Baird's excellent montage ensures an exciting rhythm to the scene without ever sounding confusing. Baird, by the way, keeps the narrative agile and the pace exciting at all times, which is essential in an action movie.In addition to being a lot of fun, important everyday issues are addressed: raising children, family unity, discussing values and the safety of loved ones from police, corruption of high-ranking members of government agencies, drug trafficking, prostitution, excessive urban violence, erotic video market, although some of these themes are only scratched. Even touching on these subjects, the episode is still pointed out as a diversion for ""the whole family"", thanks to the direction of actors, as well as the thousand jokes and absurdities so common in brucutus films.Lethal weapon is an absolute classic of the genre, with great script and direction. But it is really the explosive presence of Danny Glover and Mel Gibson that forever changed the buddy cop and that turns the film into something truly unforgettable, that mixes correct doses of action, humor and suspense, and still finds space to show, even if from superficially, the effects of a disease that attacks many people today. Well directed by Richard Donner, it also has the strength of the intertwined main duo, extremely dynamic and directly responsible for the viewer's empathy. The wonderful action sequences are the icing on the cake in this film that has its flaws, but guarantees fun without offending the audience's intelligence. Lethal weapon is a metaphor for the story of love and friendships between two men, who discover new meanings for their lives, Murtaugh learns to accept the hardships of old age while Riggs finds a new family and more reasons to live beyond work.",Lethal Weapon
120,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,A classic,8,25 February 2004,"The biggest American film in the Hollywood action would have to be Die Hard, and honestly, I can't disagree. But it was about a year before that this film came out and it packs serious action. The cast gives good performances and Donner's direction is tight and effective. The script from Shane Black set a big standard for Hollywood action movies. I guess Die Hard is more popular because of it's spectacular scenes, Lethal Weapon is more gritty; the opening scene shows a naked cokehead prostitute jumping off of a balcony on to a car roof, later Riggs' thinks about suicide, and there are notions of drugs and torture. However the grimness works for the movie and makes it rough and tough like a classic thriller should be. 8/10",Lethal Weapon

122,tonypeacock-1,Typical and now aged 1980s action film,6,5 November 2019,"1987 US cop buddy action movie starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.What the film lacks for in artistic merit it makes up for with some quite explosive action sequences.
Produced by Joel Silver such action films became the norm in the late 1980s.Gibson and Glover play homicide detectives Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. Recently made a cop partnership they fight a gang of heroin smugglers.Riggs is suicidal (haunted by the death of his wife ala Mel Gibson in Mad Max) and Murtaugh is the sane family man who has just celebrated his fiftieth birthday.The soundtrack by the late composer Michael Kamen is a lazy copy of some of his other work before and after (Rita, Sue and Bob Too! and Licence To Kill spring to mind) although some guitar chords from Eric Clapton can be heard.The director Richard Donner was more famous for 1978 film Superman.Gary Busey plays the menacing bad guy long before he was relegated to Z list celebrity status on reality TV shows.

123,RonellSowes,Failure Even By Its Own Measure,3,26 February 2021,"Riggs(Gibson), a dissident and suicidal detective, is assigned as the partner to the older and more conventional Murtaugh(Glover). However, the pair must set aside their conflicting personalities as they investigate a gang of drug dealers. Which is a good thing for the overall benefit of the film. The crazy way Riggs acts and how Murtaugh argues with him lead to some pretty unwatchable scenes. The dialouge is so bad that that it sounds improvised on the spot(there's too much for that actually to be the case) and the scenes are so poor that even the actors give the impression that they don't believe what they're saying or doing. This applies to the entire film, but it's just some of the scenes in the beginning that really fit the description. There's no actual quality to this film and the side story concerning their friendship falls flat on its face. In that case, I guess all your left with is the action. There's no shortage of it in the picture, but all that means is that you're sure to get your fill of drawn out, comically unrealistic and frankly boring sequences.
If I hadn't seen some of his other work, I would probably mention what a lousy actor Gibson. But knowing otherwise, I'll say it's just a very poor film that inevitably leads to a poor performance. As for some of the other actors like Busey or Glover, I'll simply add that they are operating to the best of their abilities in the picture.Lethal Weapon was released at the peak of the 80's action surge and one of the most succesful financially.

The movie has a good plot and the action scenes are fantastic. Richard Donner can be a very good director and this is one of his best.

Then you must ask yourself if they have been hiding under a rock for the last 18 years. To see this was mandatory if you were a kid in the late 80's. I know that this really isn't a movie for small children but if you were over 12 and could stomach a few violent action scenes this was the ultimate viewing experience.I will not go into plot as everybody probably knows what it is about but just say that Mel Gibson was only known to me as Mad Max and Danny Glover was a complete unknown at the time of this movie's release. This isn't Mad Max but something few have ever duplicated, an action movie that not only has action but also a simply brilliant premise. The reason why the two main characters start to like each other after a while is completely plausible because they basically think that what they are doing is worthwhile although Riggs, the Gibson character, pretends that he simply doesn't care anymore.The villains, one of them played by Gary Busey are what they should be and the women characters are simply background stuff because this is after all a buddy picture not a relationship picture. Shane Black, the writer has often been criticized for being too sexist (eg. The Last Boy Scout) but the feeling of seeing a real action film without the mushy stuff is somehow enjoyable. The women would play a greater part in the sequels.To end it, there will probably never be another one of these pictures that we will not compare to this one and indeed the buddy picture is almost dead today or it has been written more as comedies than action films.

133,Horror-yo,"Too much action, not enough laughs - uneven mediocre effort",5,17 January 2018,"All the clichés meet here: this film is undeniably an 80's action flick. It's got the cop one-two punch, that light crime atmosphere and intrigue revolving around a death (suicide...or not ?), cheap campy laughs and lengthy action scenes, soundtrack full of saxophone or bluesy reverb guitars, the ""I'm too old for this s*it !"" line and a very (too) obvious divide between the good guys fighting the good fight versus the definite bad guys.They really could've used lots more of the comedic potential between a completely insane (like, more than usual) and unleashed Mel Gibson and his black older counterpart Danny Glover whose characters are both likable in their own different ways, naturally. There are at least two full action scenes that seem endless and feel pointless after a certain point where if you're not a fanatic of explosions and electric-paced successive bursts of motion you're probably going to feel every second of them pretty quickly. Too much action - not enough laughs. That's for sure. It's too uneven barring that anyways. The film settles itself nicely at the beginning, develops decently as we get to know more about the plot and the lead characters (how great a shot Mel Gibson really is, etc) but then those monolithic chunks of action... it's too disparate in how much humor is supplied, how much action was needed, and the plot wears thin way too soon.
Finally the film is also quite politicized: the 'black and white partners make nice' rationale, the apartheid sign on the fridge that's well emphasized... it's not just an innocent little comedy-action flick, there's real underlying social commentary here.Not good enough, it doesn't matter how slightly more semi-original it was when it came out in 1987: 5/10.",Lethal Weapon

138,AvidClimber,Lethal Weapon — A mold for modern law enforcement action flick,8,21 May 2013,"Lethal Weapon is now a classic of law enforcement action, and at its release, it put Mel Gibson on the map.The good. Plenty of action. Great main characters. Nice intrigue. Interesting story. Very well paced scenario.The actors. Mel Gibson is definitively the best of the bunch as the crazy suicidal Martin Riggs. Danny Glover is pretty good too as his more conservative partner Roger Murtaugh who has a heart of gold and hidden depths of ruthlessness.The bad. The age of the movie is showing in a number of places, but not too much. Still pretty acceptable. The bad guys have no depth at all.The ugly. The actor playing the jumper is just terrible.The result. Excellent action geared entertainment if you can get past the age.",Lethal Weapon
139,lagudafuad,Best buddy cop movie there is,8,6 March 2013,"Lethal Weapon to me is one of the best buddy cop movie that I have seen, the combination of Sgt Martin Riggs and Sgt Roger Murtaugh is one of the best character pairing when it comes to this genre and we were given the honor to see this paring done by first class actors in Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. This movie combines high tense action with humor that makes you want to see more of these guys, as it ends you just find yourself desiring that it didn't. From the very beginning this casting was set from someone high in heaven, because according to Wikipedia Casting director Marion Dougherty first casting suggestion was Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, which ended up being what we saw on screen.They were both like a diamond in a rock, one an all-round good guy with a family man consisting of 3 children and the other a widower with suicidal intentions and nothing to live for until he met the first. These were Murtaugh and Riggs respectively and if you think you can cross any of these guys and just walk away you got another thing coming.The first of the four series is this one which was released in 1987; it stands as the introduction piece of how Murtaugh and Riggs met, and how they bonded. Murtaugh (Danny Glover) at that time was 50 years of age enjoying the life of being a straight shooter cop until he got partnered with a younger suicidal cop Riggs (38 at that time) (Mel Gibson) who no one wants to work with. Now both guys who are like a mix of crazy and normal must learn to work with one another to stop a gang of drug smugglers.As easy as this may sound on paper it wasn't on screen, as we get to go through scenes after scenes of both parties ready to do what it takes to get the job done. The music score in this movie is one that you will love as it was done by Michael Kamen and Eric Clapton. The Jazz feel is just exquisite, moving ahead my favorite scene in the movie; ""Spoiler Alert"" is where Riggs convinced a man that was going to jump to appreciate living. He did this by making the man live up to his word when he was threatening to jump, Riggs made him jump.After this the duo went ahead to make 3 other films similar to this and they from my point of view were just as beautiful as this one was.www.lagsreviews.com",Lethal Weapon
140,Cinemaniac1984,An excellent action movie that is still enjoyable today.,9,14 February 2015,"Lethal Weapon makes a dynamic impact on the action buddy cop genre. Take two mismatched cops and make them reluctant partners, and as their relationship forms they go up against the bad guys and take them down. It's an 80's movie through and through, but it's still an enjoyable movie today. The best thing about Lethal Weapon is that it's not a ""leave your brain at the door"" action movie with gunplay, fights and explosions that ignores the story. It's not a movie with action for the sake of action, and it certainly not a movie that relies on an endless body count. The action and violence fits in perfectly with the story to make it believable as the movie flows very smoothly. Lethal Weapon makes its name as a great action movie that never stops, interesting well rounded characters, crackling and witty dialogue with occasional moments of humour, excellent cinematography, and a fully fleshed out story with excellent attention to detail.The movie starts with Jingle Bell Rock playing over the opening credits as the camera pans over the blue tinted Los Angeles skyline at night. The mood quickly changes when Amanda Hunsaker (Jackie Swanson) leaps to her death from her apartment balcony which forms the basis of the story. Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) investigates the apparent suicide and he later finds out that Amanda Hunsaker is the daughter of Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), a former Vietnam Veteran that Roger served with during the war. At the same time, we are introduced to Sergeant Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), a crazy, wild eyed rebel with a death wish following the death of his wife in a car accident in 1984. Martin Riggs has lost the will to live and often takes wild risks, hoping he will die in the line of duty. Riggs and Murtaugh are polar opposites. Roger Murtaugh has just celebrated his 50th birthday and he is a proud family man at heart. He is also a conservative by-the-book police detective who is also considering retirement after 20 years with the Los Angeles Police Department. Martin Riggs is a police detective with a wild suicidal streak who is not afraid to put himself in harms way. He has attempted suicide but decides against it as he hopes to end his misery in the line of duty. Riggs has also served in the Vietnam War and was a former US Army Special Forces soldier specialising as a trained killer. These skills have served him well as well as his psychotic behaviour which gives him a dangerous edge against his enemies. Following serious concerns about Riggs' wild behaviour, he is transferred from Narcotics to Homicide and partnered with Murtaugh. Though they resent each other at first, their partnership grows solid throughout the movie, and also giving Martin Riggs a new lease on life. Amanda Hunsaker's suicide turns out not to be the case as the trail leads Riggs and Murtaugh to a heroin smuggling syndicate operated by a former Special Forces group named Shadow Company which operated during the Vietnam War. Shadow Company is made up of a gang of mercenaries led by ex-military General Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) and his chief enforcer and right hand man Mr Joshua (Gary Busey). Riggs and Murtaugh take on McAllister and Mr Joshua when they declare war through the streets of Los Angeles.Besides Braveheart and Mad Max, Lethal Weapon is one of Mel Gibson's best movies. Mel Gibson's role as Martin Riggs is certainly one to remember. His character is psychotic and unstable like a powder keg waiting to explode, but he also brings a comedic side to Riggs with a love of The Three Stooges. Danny Glover is tailor made to the role of Roger Murtaugh, a sensible police detective and a proud family man at heart. Gary Busey's role as the intimidating enforcer Mr Joshua made him a great villain. Believe it or not, this was Gary Busey's first role as a villain which has seen him cast as the villain such as Under Siege (1992) and Drop Zone (1994) or a crazed character such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), and also lends his voice in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002).Richard Donner previously directed The Omen (1976) and Superman (1978) and had cemented his reputation as a reliable director. Richard Donner created an unbeatable chemistry with Lethal Weapon and there has not been a movie that has been able to beat it. He has also since carried on with the chemistry with a further three sequels. Writer Shane Black found himself in high demand for action movies following the success of Lethal Weapon and since then, he has written The Last Boy Scout (1991) and The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) and received a record setting sum of money for his work. He has proved he is not just a pretty face as an actor appearing as Hawkins in Predator (1987) and small roles here and there, as well as striking success as a director with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) and Iron Man 3 (2013). Producer Joel Silver also can add Lethal Weapon to his long list of box office blockbusters along with 48 Hrs (1982), Predator (1987), Die Hard (1988), The Matrix (1999), and Sherlock Holmes (2009).There have been numerous ""buddy cop"" movies that have been released since Lethal Weapon, and numerous movies such as but not limited to Tango & Cash (1989), The Rookie (1990), Bad Boys (1995) and its sequel Bad Boys II (2003), The Glimmer Man (1996), The Other Guys (2010), and The Heat (2013) do not hold a candle to Lethal Weapon or any of its sequels.Lethal Weapon is still an enjoyable action movie years later, and the magic continues with Riggs and Murtaugh returning in Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), and Lethal Weapon 4 (1998). Definitely a must see for all fans of action movies.9/10.",Lethal Weapon
141,akcenat,"A buddy action movie the way it's properly done, but in 2021 little bit dated",6,20 January 2021,"Before the buddy-cop formula became overused ""Lethal Weapon"" was viewed to have much freshness compare to most of the late 1980s action movies. In the 33+ years since film was first released, a good bit of it may seem dated but will still be fun for those that appreciate the era. The chemistry between D. Glover and M.

152,jcbutthead86,"One Of The Best Action Films Ever Made. An Unforgettable,Landmark Classic.",10,31 May 2013,"Lethal Weapon is one of the best Action films ever made that is filled with great direction,intense Action,a great screenplay,excellent acting and a wonderful score making Lethal Weapon one of the all-time great Action movie classics,one of my favorite Action and one of my favorite films period.Set in Los Angeles,CA,Lethal Weapon tells the story of veteran L.A.P.D cop Roger Murtaugh(Danny Glover)who now has to team with suicidal cop Martin Riggs(Mel Gibson)to investigate a homicide while going after a drug cartel. Riggs and Murtaugh now must figure out how to work together and solve the case while at the same time try to get to know one another and figure each other out and Murtaugh get used to Riggs as a Lethal Weapon.Lethal Weapon is one of those Action movie classics that made me fall in love with the Action genre and gave viewers an introduction to one of the greatest film screen duos of all time Riggs and Murtaugh and a masterful introduction to the amazing Lethal Weapon series. Right from the opening credits to the end you are glued to the screen because of the Action,thrills,suspense and memorable characters in the film. I think that one of the reasons Lethal Weapon is such a brilliant film is because the film took the Buddy cop concept of the Action-Comedy Walter Hill classic 48 Hrs and flipped it and instead of being the cop and criminal this time both are cops. It's no coincidence that both Lethal Weapon and 48 Hrs were both co-produced by Joel Silver. Where as the other Lethal Weapon sequels we're light and much more comedic,LW1 is more gritty and dark because LW1 while an Action is also a great character study of Riggs and Murtaugh because the film shows that Riggs is depressed and on the verge of suicide while Murtaugh has to deal with getting older and his new partner Riggs. And while LW is a serious Action film there are moments of funny humor but the Humor is done in a cynical tone and the comedy is not as over the top as the sequels. LW in some way bridged a gap between the Action films of the 70s and 80s and the early 90s by being serious with a dark sense of Humor. That being said I love all of the LW films. The screenplay by Shane Black is brilliant and excellent,well-written and one of the best Action screenplays of all time with Black giving the main characters memorable dialog with some dark humor and giving the two main characters powerful depth. Black would continue writing brilliant Action scripts with Lethal Weapon 2,The Last Boy Scout,The Long Kiss Goodnight and Kiss,Kiss,Bang,Bang. Riggs and Murtaugh are classic characters of Action films and cinema in general. Like any great Action buddy film,Riggs and Murtaugh at first don't like each other and it's not only because the two don't want to work with one another it's also because of how opposite the two are. Riggs is more wild and filled with energy where as Murtaugh is more straight and narrow but as the film goes on Riggs and Murtaugh begin to understand and like each other. Riggs and Murtaugh feel like real characters who not stereotypes but real people that viewers can relate to. It is the difference between the characters that makes Riggs and Murtaugh so great and entertaining and the banter and dialog makes this film and the other LW films so amazing and watchable. I also love the villains in the film and despite the villains not having much screen time they are vicious and dark in the way they do things and leave a huge impression. The film moves at a great pace and never slows down once the Action kicks into high gear The Action scenes in the film are excellent and handled with intensity and white hot suspense and the Action scenes would get better and bigger as the LW films went on. The final 20-30 minutes are among the best endings that you will see in a Action film and it is so thrilling and Action packed that you will barely have time to catch your breath. It is an excellent ending that will stay in you after the film is over and will put a smile on viewers faces.The whole cast is great in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are excellent and at their best as Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh,with Gibson and Glover bringing depth,intensity and great chemistry to their roles. Gary Busey(Joshua) and Mitchell Ryan(The General)are great and menacing as the villains in the film. Tom Atkins is wonderful as Michael Hunsaker,Roger's old friend. Steve Kahan(Capt. Ed Murphy),Mary Ellen Trainor(Psychologist),Ed Ross(Mendez),Darlene Love(Trish Murtaugh),Traci Wolfe(Rianne Murtaugh),Damon Hines(Nick Murtaugh),Ebonie Smith(Carrie Murtaugh),Lycia Naff(Dixie)and Al Leong give good performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is brilliant,with Donner always moving the camera and giving the film a great style and tone to the film and Donner also does a great job with the Action scenes. Amazing direction by Donner.The score by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen is masterful,powerful and one of the best scores in an Action film. A great score by Clapton and Kamen. I also loved the use of the classic Christmas song Jingle Bell Rock by Bobby Helms.In final word if you love Action films,Thrillers or films in general I highly suggest you see Lethal Weapon,a masterful start to a great series and a unforgettable Action classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Lethal Weapon
153,jackasstrange,"Dull, but watchable",6,8 November 2013,"Lethal Weapon is the typical Hollywood popcorn action film: it wasn't the first and certainly not the last either. But it's kinda special. I dare to say that it is...superior to the other films of the genre? I mean, it is extremely dull, the characters motivations are certainly not convincing or cleverly explained, and the story arc is painfully cliché...but the hell, who cares? The targeted audience is perhaps very satisfied with the result. It is a dull action popcorn flick with lots of crude jokes on it. I really don't get the appeal of this kind of film, it offends my intellectual capacities, but i can understand why some people do like this one so much. The fans of the 'popcorn' sub-genre do _and the future ones will_ absolutely love it. Mel Gibson actually overacts a lot, and so Danny Glover does. But that aspect do actually made some sense, since the film is plain over the top. And the soundtrack is actually very good. I really like it. It brings to the film a entire new type of atmosphere, a more neo- romantic thriller one. So...it's worth of one watch, i guess. More than one, it's asking too much. 6.5/10",Lethal Weapon

155,flingebunt,Get registered,8,1 April 2005,"Despite having one of the lamest titles and tag lines of any successful action movie (and most bad ones) this movie goes far beyond the action genre.The plot is fairly basic. 2 mismatched cops are thrown together. Riggs is young, his wife is dead and is happily breaking every rule in the police man. Murtaugh is an older family man who is just doing the job till his retirement.They get involved in the death of a prostitute, who turns out to be Murtaugh's old army buddy's daughter.What makes this movie different is many fold. Firstly there are a lot of sub plots and issues that tie into the overall story. Such as Riggs suicidal tendencies and his special forces military training. It is not just an ad-on, but forms part of a character arc for Riggs.There is also the police investigation. It is like real police work. Based on guess work, in exact, but no incredible plot twists. Most police work involves arresting the person standing over the dead body with a bloody knife shouting ""I did it"". This story shows how police try and work through something tricky but solvable by simple good police work.Then there is the action. Other than Mel Gibson pretending he knows Jujitsu the action is both realistic and exciting (no situations where 2 people shoot at each other, only the good guy hits, rather it is about the strategy, the chase and so on).Finally there is the humour. Jokes are understated and perfect for Mel.Oh wait...girls, you get to see Mel's naked bottom.....when he was young and sexy.This movie works at so many different levels (from naked bottoms up to great character development) that it will be enjoyed by many people. Also, do a search online for the movie script and you will see the script writer Shane Black needs to cut down on the coffee.The worst part of this movie is the terrible sequels and carbon copy movies that came later.",Lethal Weapon

Their differences cause major rifts. Their bickering, squabbling and conflicting ideals make their current objective a thrilling experience. The story is simple, but strong, the leads cops driving it until the end credits. Murtaugh's anger towards Riggs is funny. On the flip side Riggs's troubled past is touching. It dips a little in to dark comedy, but not so much that it takes away what emotion it carries. Murtaugh might be too old for this ..., but we're not. Riggs and his partner are characters that stick around, more so than John McClane or Axel Foley.",Lethal Weapon
157,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,"""Well, I haven't killed you yet."" - My personal favorite 80's buddy cop action flick of all time",10,8 February 2019,"On my birthday , while celebrating I watch another 80's action personal favorite action buddy cop flick of all time Lethal Weapon (1987). I love, love this film to death. The one and the only best film in the franchise 80's it is filled with Lethal bad-ass action sequences that you think and imagine your in the movie. It is filled with rush, excitement, entertainment, it has Christmas, Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Gary Busey in the most excitement action flick of all time. It is Roger's 50 birthday in this movie so we both have birthday today.Lethal Weapon was written by Shane Black (Predator) and directed from Richard Donner who directed great this film. It has ton's of action, references back on Vietnam war, explosions gun battles. There is a lot of automatic weapons, grenades, hand guns and they are used well.This movie spawned 3 sequels and a TV series, so popular this movie become. It is very fun action film. It has little humor, action and little drama in it. It is filled with so many classic moments: I love the desert action sequences that was the best in the film. When Riggs and Murtaugh attempt to rescue Murtaugh's daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) in the desert, Riggs uses Heckler & Koch PSG-1 sniper rifle, like a sniper he is and kills many bad guys. Rianne steals a limousine and a chopper chases her. I love the torture scene in which Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey) tortures Riggs under the shower Electric Shock torture memorable scene. You can see this scene in The Last Boy Scout (1991) with Bruce Willis in which his daughter Darien is watching this movie. Great explosion you see Dixie's house been blow practical effect, real explosion. I love the music tune theme by Michael Kamen.Lethal Weapon (1987) and the first Die Hard (1988) are the best action movies ever made. I miss the '80's , this was my childhood film with Under Siege (1992) I watched them constantly as a kid. This was Mel Gibson's action movie with The Road Warrior (1981) that made him in to an action star. Predator 2 and Lethal Weapon made Danny Glover in to action star. The best bad-ass is Gary Busey as Mr. Joshua as bad-ass character. The man can play so well.A young girl jumps out of the building and kill her self. LAPD Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) get's the case and find's out, she is a daughter of one of his Vietnam buddy's back from Nam who saved his life. Murtaugh is calm type and family man, decides to work on this case to find a clue. He get's team up with LAPD Detective Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), a cop and former Special Forces sniper who lives on the ragged edge and who is a suicidal transfer from narcotics to homicide. The suicide of a young girl turns out to be a murder, she was poisoned by overdose they uncover a drug smuggling ring that involves a criminal gang comprised of mercenaries and former members of a CIA / special forces ""Black Ops"" unit with ties to the Vietnam War. These guys will turn up the heat. The fight between Mr. Joshua and Riggs is a bad-ass in the finale I love it.For the people who hate Christmas: ""Goddamn Christmas!"" Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey) shoots a T.V. displaying a Christmas commercial with his Colt XM177 Commando at Murtaugh's home. He destroys a police car with his machine riffle. For me Gary Busey steals the show. I love the guy and love he re teamed with Danny Glover in Predator 2. I miss these kind of movies action type now days. Today is nothing but lousy, lazy CGI. I want movies like this back: First Blood, Rambo: First Blood Part II, Cobra, Lethal Weapon, Predator, The Terminator, Bloodsport, Kickboxer, Cyborg, Aliens, Die Hard, The Terminator, RoboCop, The Killer and many more action movies from the 80's those are my movies that I enjoy watching them.Lethal Weapon (1987) is the best bad-ass action flick from the 80's my all time favorite action film. I love, love this film to death. A bus hit's a bad-guys car and his car with grenades explodes bad-ass best explosion sequence in the film ever.

They have a psycho Commander leading his soldiers, and he commands Busey to do his bidding.The back and forth lead to a highly anticipated final battle, mano a mano, between the crazy duo. Who will win out? Well, since they went on to make multiple Leathal Weapons, you are pretty assured that Hollywood will prevail and leave you cheering.

I will say right here that 'Lethal Weapon' is one of the best action films of the 80's, behind the obvious Die Hard and the obvious Terminator. The characters in the film are extremely great and this is one of the bigger positives from the film. The action in the film is great as was the cinematography until the final fight between Riggs and Joshua, which I say was a great fight but the camera movement was all over the place. It was sad, as the film duel would've looked brilliant. Apart from this, the film was brilliant and I liked the chemistry between Mel Gibson's Riggs and Danny Glover's Roger. That was my favorite part of the entire film. The script was great and the directing and acting were superbDefinite must see film for all die hard action fans!",Lethal Weapon
163,antagonist117,A bare plot becomes a playground for powerful characters and a smart director,7,9 January 2015,"Even a forgettable potboiler can become a great piece of entertainment if it brings together creative minds. Richard Donner's direction and Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's acting elevate ""Lethal Weapon"" into something more than the sum of its parts. Shane Black's script is polished and professional, largely free of extraneous elements or logical leaps. But the plot it conveys is as hackneyed as crime fare gets: a simple drug deal sloppily adorned with prostitutes. It has less flair and intrigue than a side mission in a ""Grand Theft Auto"" game. Happily, it's not where Black and Donner and Gibson place their focus.Even people who have not seen ""Lethal Weapon"" know it as one of the first movies in which a mismatched pair of cops are thrust together and form an unlikely friendship. And even before this gimmick became one of the biggest clichés in entertainment, it was already corny and obvious. The characters are drawn in glaring, unambiguous colors: Gibson is incredibly temperamental and reckless, and Danny Glover is an equally-incredibly contented family man. Glover's birthday gathering around a bubble bath is ridiculous, but it's an efficient way to link his character in an instant to all things good and comfortable and domestic. We know what he's about before he utters a word. Gibson doesn't utter, he shouts maniacally, but his character is also defined through exaggerated imagery. He stands unflinching in a hail of bullets, then watches TV alone on Christmas with a bottle of scotch and a loaded gun. (Incidentally, count the TVs in this film. They're everywhere. And when one gets destroyed, another one turns up— twice!) Surely even Marlowe and Spade had more humanity than this cartoon-watching cartoon of a cop. But ""Lethal Weapon"" doesn't need Gibson to be real any more than it needs a great plot, because its focus is unwaveringly fixed on just one thing: the chemistry between the cops.Donner is famous for infusing unreal characters with humanity. He brought out the sensitivity and aching in the Man of Steel. He's the perfect director to kindle the sparks that fly between Gibson and Glover. Donner ensures that one or both are always at the center of the action, which is not over when the bodies hit the floor or when the dust settles, but when Gibson and Glover share a quip and an affectionate look. As they grow closer, even the formless plot begins to coalesce around them, becoming an unlikely extension of their lives; after Glover and Gibson bond over their memories of Vietnam, it is revealed that the bad guys learned their tricks in Vietnam, too! When the prostitutes are finally out of the picture, Glover's beloved daughter steps into the sexualized victim role. It's absurd stuff, but very neatly and consciously done, and everyone involved commits to it in full.Unfortunately, the film ends with a small misstep. Gary Busey's superhuman villain is a third wheel to Glover and Gibson's relationship. His final, vaguely martial-artsy fight with Gibson strains credulity without adding to the central drama of the cops' friendship and rebirth. Its manufactured excess is one last reminder, though, that ""Lethal Weapon""'s filmmakers know how to jazz up a genre picture.",Lethal Weapon

165,Mr_Censored,"""My luck's changing for the better every day. """,9,17 December 2008,"Let it be known that I have seen ""Lethal Weapon"" many, many times. I've seen it so many times that I can annoy those around me by uttering lines in unison with the characters on screen. Yet, no matter how many times I watch it, I am always baffled at how quickly the hour and forty five minutes pass as I reach the end, feeling satisfied, yet yearning for more. That's the kind of movie this is. It's got an insane amount of re-playability, which is due, I suppose, to the fact that the story works on so many levels. ""Lethal Weapon"" is equal parts action movie, drama, comedy and buddy flick, all wrapped up nice and neatly in a perfectly sized and perfectly portioned little action-movie burrito. The perfect action film? The best of it's kind? It just may be.One thing is for sure, and that is that Richard Donner is the unsung hero of 1980's cinema. If it weren't for the groundwork he laid in this movie, the action genre -- as it played out in it's aftermath -- wouldn't have been quite as memorable or exciting. That's because Donner -- along with screenwriter Shane Black -- raised the bar, raised expectations and quenched the thirst of audiences. To have an action movie with real characters that you really cared about was a rarity for the time. Those looking for an all-encompassing movie, something that can be both a tearjerker and a nail-biter, will find just that in ""Lethal Weapon"" any time they view it. And at a stunning twenty-one years of age, it has yet to be outdone and hardly feels dated.Mel Gibson stars alongside Danny Glover, and it's hard to imagine one without the other. Would this film be as good had different actors been cast? It's doubtful. While Gibson brings the psychotic, alcoholic Martin Riggs to life almost naturally, it's Glover's grounded performance of family-man Roger Murtaugh that makes up the heart of the film. More than just a buddy-cop flick, ""Lethal Weapon"" is also a story about redemption, as Murtaugh welcomes a troubled Riggs into his family circle. It's Murtaugh's friendship that helps Riggs patch up his wounds, as he mourns the tragic loss of his wife to a fatal car accident. Even though the movie is ""too manly to admit so"", at it's core, it's a touching story about the power of friendship and loyalty.There's also action. Lots and lots of action. Donner constantly bombards us with explosions, gun-play, car crashes and so on, and manages to keep it fresh throughout. Whereas in other films an abundance of action can get tiresome, such is not the case here. The action bits in this film will keep you on the edge of your seat and glued to the screen. The movie is just so well-crafted in that sense. I can safely say that I, personally, am never bored with this film, and it's a testament as to why ""Lethal Weapon"" is the best of it's kind. Well, unless, we're talking about ""Lethal Weapon 2"", but that's a different story.",Lethal Weapon
166,monkeysgalore,One of the Ones That Started it All,10,15 November 2018,"If you have to see an action movie or buddy cop movie from the 80s, and you've already seen ""Die Hard"", then you absolutely must see ""Lethal Weapon"". It's one of my all-time favorites, if not my absolute favorite, and everything about is so watchable and memorable, and it never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. An absolute classic. The film was so influential that it spawned a whole host of copycats, such as ""Red Heat"", ""Tango & Cash"", ""The Glimmer Man"", ""Bad Boys"" its sequels, and others.You already know the plot: Two very different cops (Mel Gibson, Danny Glover) are assigned to work with each other, to take down some drug dealers. Matters are complicated however, when they kidnap one cop's daughter.This movie was perfect, especially for its time period, it still holds up today. The characters are still engaging, everyone delivers wonderful performances, there are great action sequences, and this movie is pretty much the epitome of character development. Amid the bullets and fighting, you get to see two very different characters, who are both in a way, the same character. Both cops have been on the force for a while, both have seen action, both are getting tired and looking for a way out. Both are good cops and people, but Murtaugh is tired of putting his life on the line, which is all Riggs knows how to do. Riggs and Murtaugh are two sides of the same coin, and they are one of the best on-screen duos ever to be seen. BothGibson's character, Martin Riggs, really brings most of the action, and when he's not dodging bullets or beating the crap out of someone, he's joking around and being cocky. Glover's character, Roger Murtaugh, is a skilled cop, but one who's tired of being a cop. Riggs is just tired of living. The two become embroiled in a drug investigation, and the pair engage in many antics along the way, such as a shootout at a Christmas tree lot, a death-defying jump off of a building, an intense chase along Hollywood Boulevard, and one final, brutal, legendary final fight scene that really compliments the tone of the whole film, and it really expresses the intensity and craziness of Riggs.Many refer to this as an action comedy, which is fair, but it really is more generous to the action genre than the comedy genre. There are some comedic moments, but this, and the second film are definitely more action-thriller oriented than comedy-oriented, but 3 and 4 are much more lighthearted. This film barely scrapes by as an action comedy, which is one of the things that makes it so good. It's just really brutally action-packed, probably as much as ""Die Hard"", but not to the point where it's over the top. Probably the perfect mix of action and storytelling, honestly. There were many memorable action scenes, such as the Christmas tree lot shootout, desert shootout, torture fight, club shootout and foot chase, and the final fight. In between those are many other brief instances of action and violence.Shane Black, a truly gifted script writer, has written some excellent films, and this is definitely one of, if not his actual, best. He establishes a really cool, dark, and gritty mood, and it compliments the character of Riggs so well. The film is really about two different, flawed characters who try to do the right thing, and succeed, learning about and accepting each other in the process. I should also note that Gary Busey delivers a pretty great performance as a villain, and he and Jet Li were probably the best of the four villains from the franchise.Richard Donner also delivers incredibly with the action sequences, adeptly staging and pacing the scenes, and swiftly moving us from one nail-biting scene to the next, while also using the lead actors' talents to the fullest, and Donner also handles the dramatic scenes quite well here, proving that he can capably handle just about any scenario he has to direct.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this film, and except for a few brief instances of unnecessary nudity, and a lot of strong language, this film is just too good not to watch, and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot, at least once.",Lethal Weapon
167,ThomasColquith,Just Bad,3,9 July 2021,"""Lethal Weapon"" is just plain bad -- a dismal movie. Don't waste your time watching this one. Pass, you aren't missing anything. If you want to see a good movie of this sort, I would recommend ""Above the Law"" with Steven Seagal. ""Lethal Weapon"" just doesn't work on so many levels. I'm sorry I bought the set of 4, now I have to decide if I should risk any more time watching the sequels. I saw the sequels years ago and I thought they were average, but I never saw the first one until now, and it was bad. I had a feeling I would not like it.So many problems: it is too dark, too unrealistic, bad action scenes, hardly any normal women in the entire film (just one wife and several prostitutes which are treated poorly), the hero is a degenerate (not because of his fragile mental state which is nothing to mock, but because he is portrayed as interested in underage girls instead of ones near his own age), the plot is nonsensical (cops are invited over without a warrant then the suspect starts shooting at them; no backup cops ever around; that ending fight - so stupid), the Christmas motif and blasphemy is unwarranted -- the entire film is like some psychological trick to associate Christmas and Christ with the awful trash encompassed in this film. I'm not sure how this film got the great reputation it has or had. In summary, skip this one, 3/10 stars (and that may be generous).",Lethal Weapon
168,son_of_cheese_messiah,Misfired weapon,2,13 June 2011,"It seems utterly incredible that this poor movie inspired a successful series. Badly directed, badly written and badly acted, it is more like a series of action movie clichés than a story. It borrows heavily from various previous superior films especially Dirty Harry. The 'suicidal jumper' scene in both films makes the comparison; in Dirty Harry, the scene was honest, but the inferior copy version, the scene ends with an unearned and deceptive pay-off, a cheat in other words. It is not possible to speak of the plot being contrived, but rather a series of implausible contrivances one after another. The basic idea, an unstable cop being allowed to continue working (and even being transferred to homicide!), is utterly absurd in itself but it gets worse. Basic procedures, such as handcuffing subdued criminals, are not adhered to, leading to two characters drawing weapons and having to be killed. People start shooting for no apparent reason, such as at the swimming pool. A hackneyed and unconvincing plot about a secret conspiracy emerges. An over the top shoot out in the desert, complete with helicopter. A gruesome (but laughable) torture scene. Gibson hurls a dead body across a room like a deadly weapon. A sub-machine gun fight takes place on a crowded free-way. And a final punch-up while the cops just look on.Everything about this film is clunky. It takes a long time for the story to get going and it is held together by certain convenient details. The dialogue is wooden, as is the acting (apart from the kids, who at least emerge with credit). The music is of the late 80s variety, and sounds very dated now.Nor are the action scenes very memorable, just a series of deeply contrived set pieces which neither look good nor convince. Situations are set-up just so a car can drive through a wall or hit a bus or explode. There is no artistry in any of this, and none of it lingers in the memory.A cartoon, and not a particularly good one.",Lethal Weapon
169,buzznzipp1995,Pow! Gibson and Glover and Donner and Blitzen!,10,11 March 2007,"Viva Le Mel and Danny too!! An instant Christmas time classic! An action genre film to be enjoyed for years to come. What a team of unlikely hero's in this 'Lethal' of movies filmed in 87' or maybe 86'. This was the best of the Lethal's franchise. The idea was fresh with these two, and Mel was as big in this character as king Kong!! I know because of the recent situations with Gibson, on that they will disagree. I do love his stand on The Passion of the Christ, I live for HIM too. But I'm talking about his character portrayal the quintessential 'Gibson' man, in this box-office giant that if it had been someone else, it may have not done the type of business that it did. The feeling was for Martin Riggs. He wore it well. Losing the love of his life, you could feel the agony in his soul. The exchange between the two, Riggs and Murtaugh was an incredible balancing act. It would have to be or one end or the other would up end them both. A cop who's on the ragged edge almost explosive and a family man, who has a tight-nit group that would end up caring for a man in need of care. In return, he (riggs) with his quick -acting sharp-shooter trained conditioning, that actually came natural to his character and his ' wits' , would end-up, saving Roger from losing his life and that family . This was (I think) an original story that, like some others, for instance, "" Indiana Jones "", "" Predator "" etc leaves you feeling a different emotion altogether. Sometimes these features should be left alone not made again and again until the real essence of the original story and characters has been recycled so many times that its water thin in the end. This has an alternate ending on the DVD which was perfect in my eyes, they should have used it. But money is 'king' even over art, right?The first is best. Shane Black made this right . Richard Donner directed it well. I recommend Lethal Weapon (****)",Lethal Weapon
170,JaydoDre,Great funny first half followed by a terrible 80's B-action movie,7,26 September 2014,"After a lifetime of seeing this film in bits and pieces, whenever it happened to appear on TV, I finally saw it for the first time in its entirety, and the feelings are mixed.The basic premise of the movie is really bland. It should be enough to hear that that a movie was made in the 80s and that drugs and cops are involved to turn off a large number of people. Lethal Weapon has the markings of a typical 80s factory stamped action movie and it could have disappeared into obscurity, were it not for the two people at its centre: Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.Lethal Weapon is what has become known as a buddy-cop movie. The thing you need for a buddy cop movie is two good actors with a bit of chemistry and that is exactly what these two folks gave us. Nowadays, Mel's personal reputation almost squeezed him out of Hollywood, but do not forget, he is an actor with great charisma and Danny turned out to be just the right complement to his energy.The first part of the movie, when these two are first introduced and just work of each other, is the good part of the movie, but then the stupid starts. The cheesy 80s action stereotypes all come creeping in, complete with shooting rifles from the hip and unnecessary one on one fist fights. The dialogue turns to crap and the humour dies.This flick has a charm that keeps it a float, but it's a shame the story and the action is so poor.",Lethal Weapon

Los Angeles police sergeant Roger Murtaugh, who has just turned 50 years old, is assigned to investigate the death of Amanda Hunsaker, a prostitute who is one of the daughters of bank president Michael Hunsaker, a friend whom Roger has known since they were in the Vietnam War together, but Roger hasn't seen Michael in 12 years. Beginning with this investigation, Roger is assigned a new partner Sergeant Martin Riggs, who has been suicidal ever since his wife Victoria ""Vicky"" Lynn Riggs died in a car crash in 1984. Riggs and Murtaugh's investigation of Amanda's death reveals that she was murdered. Upon hearing of this, Michael tells Murtaugh that he would like for whoever is behind Amanda's murder to end up dead, like Amanda. Riggs and Murtaugh's investigation continues and it makes them the targets of Shadow Company, a group of former Vietnam War era mercenaries who now bring heroin into the Los Angeles County region. Shadow Company's leader, General Peter McAllister, and his right hand man, Mr. Joshua, want Riggs and Murtaugh dead, no matter what the cost.Just saw this last night as a part of my Lethal Weapon Saga movie nights and man, this one right here is the ultimate buddy cop film. This movie, in my opinion started the buddy cop genre which later spawned a whole lot of buddy cop films. From Tango & Cash, Bad Boys and Starsky & Hutch, it was all inspired by Lethal Weapon. What makes this film work incredibly is the chemistry between two leads: Mel Gibson as psychotic cop Martin Riggs and Danny Glover as ""I'm too old fo' this sheet"" Roger Murtaugh.I admit, I've never been really a fan of Mel Gibson as an actor, I like him better when he's behind the camera but this film changes it all. Tremendous acting by Gibson as well as Glover. Another reason why this film really clicked is the villainous Gary Busey as Mr. Joshua. A bad ass character portrayed by a bad ass actor. Mr. Joshua will go down as one of the greatest villains of all time.",Lethal Weapon

Riggs is so powerful and his skills in martial arts is awesome and the way he uses his power in Ju Jitsu to fight against the dangerous and extremely malicious Joshua is absolutely amazing and brilliant.

Danny Glover plays Seargant Roger Murtagh, a 50 year coloured man with a family who lives in a middle class house. He and Riggs are teamed up to investigate a young girl who supposedly dived out of her window who was involved in drugs and making pornographic films. Soon they are on the trail of drugs and mercenaries.Throughout Riggs remains a lose cannon and goes off on one when he gets mad. Glover and Gibson make a fantastic duo when sparring with each other and coming to trust and become buddies right at the end of the film. There is great comic chemistry between them, which will have you in fits. Gary Busey as the principal villain makes a lasting impact.This is a superb first film with excellent and exciting action, great humour and a good story that all blend in seamlessly together.

This is one of the few series where all of the films worked; each one had qualities that outshone the others. Gibson's Riggs is best in the first film, though; the facial expressions, the dialogue, the body language: this is Mel Gibson at his best.Danny Glover, on the other hand, really seemed to warm/wake up in 2. He wasn't as solid in the first one, he felt too wooden and too generic.The script is sharp, good use of foreshadow and well-written in terms of plot and pacing. The film doesn't get boring, and doesn't really get unrealistic eitheras far as any action film doesn't;) Gary Busey plays his typical evil villain character, one that he plays so well at all times (though each character tends to be a branch on the same tree, so to speak).Some of the action was a little too generic. The final fight scene was way over the top, could've been clipped a bit.Overall: not much to say except that this is a good, solid action film.

Unfortunately that was not enough to elevate it above its lot. It's literally 'Miami Vice' in L.A., or more because of Richard Donner's standard direction, a high-end ""To Live and Die in L.A."". Hell, there's even a helicopter above the ocean scene that heavily reminded me of the opening credits to Magnum P.I. Black has since proven himself to be a more visually competent and exciting director than Donner, who is and has always been a mediocrity. One can only wonder what Black would've done with it...
Shane Black would revisit a similar theme nearly 30 years later with the much better looking, visually engaging, better acted, more cleverly written and arrestingly directed The Nice Guys, which was a terrific ride from start to finish. The much more droll 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', with Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer, was also more enjoyable than this dry-rub precursor, where the script was more interesting than the movie - kinda like watching a lackluster Hollywood adaptation of a mildly enjoyable pulp novel.

There is NOTHING in the world that could beat this movie. Even though Die Hard was a relatively different movie than this it's about as good as this one. The story is in the same geniously spirit as Die Hard. I mean just the idea of pairing together two totally different kind of people and let them work together. I like the first one best because it really fits with the describing ''Lethal''. In Lethal 2 the humor was clearer with Joe Pesci and all. In Lethal 3 his role had got bigger. And in Lethal 4 the whole story is actually almost more funny than Lethal. So I like the original for one simple reason: It's tough! The fighting scenes have never been more violent then in this one ( OK OK OK the Lethal 4-end maybe ). But one things for sure: Mel Gibson is really a Lethal Weapon in this movie. The other parts are just more childish. Here it is a more grown-up story. Enough speaking. See Lethal Weapon. If you can buy the ''Lethal Weapon box'' with all three in directors cut.

Writer Shane Black introduce some new characters that we seen before, but not in a steady action picture between there are lines of dialog that present humor, even between Glover and Gibson. The movie was directed by Richard Donner, who also made the 1976 horror classic, The Omen and the superhero 1978 picture, Superman. This time, his direction works. Here, a steady action picture like Lethal Weapon are why action movies back in the 1980's were exciting and thrilling like Die Hard.

What made this movie work is that both Mel Gibson and Danny Glover work so well together as we buy the chemistry between them; these two wonderful actors are the reason for making this movie worth watching.

Richard Donner does a fine job directing the movie, but I mainly love his work on the first ""Superman"" movie as well as the sequel that he never completely finish as he only shot seventy-five percent of the movie if the producer didn't fired him so he can finish it for one hundred percent. The music by Michael Kamen is nothing special, but it is well done. The action in this movie is terrific, and the humor itself is alright. What didn't work is that the movie itself feels kind of slow, and which if they cut some things out so that I feel like I'm watching a fast paced buddy cop movie. That is just me, in my humble opinion. Also, I don't think its the greatest action movie of all time as it takes place around Christmas. So, I guess you can say that I like ""Die Hard"" more but I digress. Anyway, like I said, I don't have too much to say about ""Lethal Weapon,"" but I do like to say that it is a fun movie, and both Gibson and Glover are wonderful together. I give it an 8 out of 10.",Lethal Weapon
184,no-skyline,A Classic Action Blockbuster,8,30 June 2005,"The eighties a time of big hair, bad clothes and worse music but the eighties also gave us Axel Foley, Arnie and of course Riggs and Murtagh. Lethal Weapon is an unashamed big, loud action movie but its more than this to with a smart plot and interesting characters. It's helped by having Gibson & Glover who are the best 'buddy' team since Redford & Newman, the action scenes are top quality but it's the interaction of these two that makes the movie. All the necessary ingredients for a great action blockbuster are present and correct chases, shootouts and a terrific final showdown. What is surprising is how little this film has dated it easily stands head and shoulders above recent efforts such as Bad Boys 2, XXX 2 etc. Top entertainment 8/10.Note - If possible see the directors cut which adds more depth to Riggs character with two quality scenes added.",Lethal Weapon
185,writenamehere,This cheese is firm.,7,29 October 2019,"This first film in the series is pointlessly violent, and no one can really act all that well. Riggs, played by a young Mel Gibson, is especially brooding. Murtaugh seems to be having trouble both speaking and walking, so he just starts yelling sounds. The male characters are Vietnam veterans, and the women either Moms or borderline stars - a common scenario for films of this period. You'll also hear small refrains of Eric Clapton's guitar that echo the popular completed tune it became years later. Cheesy and at times ridiculous, this film has aged well - not many do. Worth revisiting.",Lethal Weapon
186,Snake-666,One of the great buddy movies!,7,10 July 2003,"Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is a police officer who has just turned 50 years old and is assigned to investigate the death of Amanda Hunsaker, the daughter of Michael (Tom Atkins) one of Murtaugh's old Vietnam buddy's that he hasn't seen in around 12 years. At the same time the department has assigned Murtaugh with a new partner, Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) a man with a death wish who has been suffering with depression ever since his wife Victoria was killed in a car crash. Their investigations prove that Amanda Hunsaker was murdered and as they delve deeper they find themselves immersed in the world of organised drug trafficking and also find their original distrust and suspicion for each other grow into friendship.Perhaps not the greatest action movie ever, and in my opinion a little poorer than the first two sequels, Lethal Weapon' is an exceptional action/thriller and is definitely worth checking out. Lethal Weapon' is rather dark and gritty and deals with numerous interesting, and often emotional, scenes. Mel Gibson is great as the suicidal Martin Riggs and makes his character shine out in many scenes, including a school-yard sniper scene in the directors cut version. The audience can identify with Riggs and feel sympathy for him without being distracted from the main storyline. On top of this Danny Glover puts in a strong performance as the family man Murtaugh and adds a certain lightness to the movie without making it any less gritty. I personally feel that the pairing of Gibson and Glover is one of the all time greats in cinema, the characters of Riggs and Murtaugh go together exceptionally and the eventual trust and friendship that grows between the two is almost a beautiful thing to behold. A rather ingenious soundtrack really helps to add an air of humanity to certain scenes and compliments the Gibson/Glover partnership perfectly on many occasions. Credit must also go to Mitch Ryan who played Captain McAllister and Gary Busey who played Mr. Joshua as both portrayed their villainous characters magnificently and convincingly.The film moves at a steady pace and despite dragging on occasion is generally paced well enough to sustain the viewers interest. There is a lack of action early on in the movie but this does not hamper Lethal Weapon' in any way. The first half of the movie is almost more like a drama as we have to see if Riggs can keep his head together long enough for the duo to solve the crime. It's in the first half of the movie that the audience is treated to many emotional moments as the character of Riggs is fully investigated by director Richard Donner (this in my opinion is one of Donner's best films) and writer Shane Black. We learn so much about both characters in the first half that when the action portion of the movie gets going it's almost impossible not to feel for these characters who are putting their lives on the line. Donner's direction is exceptional though sometimes he lets himself down a little with some poor choices for camera angles or somewhat slow direction.There are few faults to this movie though people expecting gunfight after gunfight and explosion after explosion may be a little disappointed. Also the occasional dragging of the storyline makes some parts of the movie a little tedious, but overall the screenplay is very tight and there is a lot of useful and realistic dialogue. I would certainly recommend this to action movie fans and casual moviegoers. For fans of this I recommend the first two sequels as well. My rating for Lethal Weapon'  7.5/10",Lethal Weapon
187,tmpj,Lethal Madness....,5,26 April 2010,"It's OK for a film of this genre...have not seen any of the sequels or prequels ( if any), but I hope they are better than this. Two lunatic cops are paired together. One, Glover, who appears sane ( but loses it frequently) has a house, kids, and a wife who needs to meet Betty Crocker or Chef Boy-Yar-Dee. The other makes no pretense at sanity (Gibson)...declared dangerous by a department shrink...other cops refuse to work with him out of fear. Sounds like a typical strike force cop if you grew up in the ghetto. Not exactly a match made in heaven, and not quite as satisfying as Laurel and Hardy, they bumble their way through a series of events where there is a lot of action, a lot of gunfire, and a lot of blood. But when the daughter of an old friend of Glover's winds up dead and the death is ruled as a homicide instead of a suicide, the two bumblers find themselves on the trail of a vicious drug and crime ring. For those who thrive on action in films and violence, this one is right up your alley. But it is not without its flaws. There is one scene where a man is threatening suicide by jumping from a tall building. Gibson apprehends him and they both jump into free-fall...but what the director holds out on is...they jump into an air-bag cushion that is already in place, not mentioned, and not visible to viewers until they fall into it. A 'cheap shot' scene like this one took away any credibility this film might have had for me...and holding out on that was an insult to the intelligence of the viewer. I grudgingly watched the rest after that, but that made me lose respect for the integrity of the film...or the lack of it. Watch it if you want, but be prepared for the ridiculous.",Lethal Weapon
188,Chuck-149,Surprisingly good action-flick.,7,7 August 2000,"One of the movie genres which is the most popular in Hollywood is the action movie genre, movies like Star Wars (1977), Broken Arrow (1996), Independence Day (1996), The Fugitive (1993), and many more.  Personally, my favorite has always been Die Hard (1988) and considering some of the action movies we have been able to see quite recently, it always will be.  However, Lethal Weapon is another movie that I would consider as a good action movie. It isn't Die Hard, but it's pretty close and having been released one year before Die Hard, I give it credit for its styles which we can find in all of the Lethal Weapon movies.  These styles are a blend of action and comedy and a few emotional moments which keep the movie going and do not throw it off track.  Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) is a cop who is very suicidal and whom many think is crazy.  He lives alone in his broken down trailer with no other friend than his guard dog.  During the day, he works undercover busting drug dealers or as a normal cop but doing crazy things like jumping off a roof with a man who had intended to do that in the first place.  On the other side, we have detective Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), an investigative cop who has just turned fifty.  Roger is married and father of three. 
  This is the set-up for the movie or as some people might call it, the excuse for allowing the movie to be.  The only thing is, these two men will have to meet one day if director Richard Donner wants his movie to be.  And this is where the emotional part of the movie comes in.  One night, in his trailer, Riggs brings his gun to his mouth and the only thing that keeps him from pulling the trigger is the picture of his wife who is deceased.  It seems to be the reason he wants to pull the trigger so that he may join her, but it also seems to keep him from shooting himself.  On the other side, detective Murtaugh is investigating the death of a prostitute who turns out to be the daughter of a friend with whom he served in Vietnam.  However, after the autopsy of the dead girl, the apparent suicide seems to be a murder case after all.  At this point, the two men have not met but they will quite soon.  Riggs is assigned to Murtaugh as his new partner.  The two of them quickly meet when Murtaugh assaults Riggs when he takes out his gun in the police precinct believing Riggs was about to attack the department.  Murtaugh soon realizes that his partner is a mad man and might get him killed while they work.  Riggs, on the other hand, sees nothing crazy whatsoever in what manners he uses to defend himself or his partner as long as he gets the job done.  For him, that is the only thing that counts considering the fact that Riggs realizes he is suicidal.  There is a very intense scene in which Murtaugh is trying to push Riggs over the edge telling him he should kill himself for he believes Riggs is not willing to do it.  But he realizes, just like the viewer, that Riggs is very willing and that he shouldn't tempt him.  The comedy sets in after the two of them meet and this is what makes this movie so unique.  In Die Hard, we saw Bruce Willis making wisecracks every now and then which allowed the movie to be more relaxing and all the more entertaining.  In Lethal Weapon however, the two actors make jokes and funny remarks about their age, Glover's family, and many other subjects all along the movie which gives it a cool rhythm and a nice flow.    Danny Glover seems to be one of the best actors they could have gotten for the job of Murtaugh as he delivers the goods and gives his now famous line ""I'm too old for this s***"" quite often.  But Gibson is the only man there was for the role of Riggs.  He steals the movie with his tough uncaring attitude of wether he dies on the job or not.  His attitude in the movie is comparable to Connery's in The Untouchables (1987) as he is ready to do anything as long as that gets the job done.  Fnally, the only thing missing to complete the cast is the bad guy.  I this case, Gary Busey plays an evil wacko named Mr. Joshua who has a disfunction in his nervous system as he can take pain with no reaction and still keep fighting back until he is taken down.  Busey is as good as Gibson and this might be one of the movie's flaws, Busey's lack of screen-time.  The script could have been somewhat stronger but you can't have everything now can you.  Overall, it is a very cool action movie and is definitely worth a watch.",Lethal Weapon

My favorite part is Gibson. He is beyond gorgeous and does a wonderful job here. One can easily believe that this led to his being cast as Hamlet. Loved Mel, loved the movie and despite being in the category of fan least likely to love it (older,female, professional), I love it a lot.

The plot is okay but what definitively stands out is Mel Gibson's performance. From start to finish, Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) makes you feel excited just watching him. Whether it's with his psychotic bouts, unique demeanour or deep moments, his presence adds an energy to this movie that makes it both fun and insane (in a good way). His quality acting in Lethal Weapon is surely some of the best in cinema. Besides the amazing casting, the overall story is mediocre. In this film, though, it's the acting that makes it special.

When the audience is introduced to Officer Riggs (Mel Gibson) he is contemplating suicide. What ensues after is a rollercoaster ride of comedy and action and a great story. Lethal Weapon is the kind of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and you are always rooting for these two cops who are thrown together and forced to be partners but then help each other in the end.

Starting off with a tutorial into the more ""Un-favourable"" side of L.A. life and drug use, we are straight into the whole concept; this is a buddy movie. There are two main characters: the ever lovable Roger Murtaugh (as Danny Glover) a middle-aged man who doesn't want to lose his respectable life and Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) a mad man who will do anything to stop crime (including jumping off a building). There target: drug kingpin Gary Busey. It's not a superb film: it's the style in which it's done. It's action-packed, funny, yet still stern, but is done to the effect that it's so enjoyable. It really is hard not to love it. An action-packed, violent comedy, Lethal Weapon defined action films and is a lovable classic that should be appreciated by anyone old enough to handle it.

197,charlessmith702210,Not just good action in the film; there is some good characterization,9,16 October 2006,"The movie had a wide variety of action and that is why I love it....from explosions (especially when Murtaugh and Riggs almost walk right into a house that blows up) and car chase scenes to shoot-outs and martial arts fights.Well, Riggs' character is very, very crazy. Especially when Murtaugh says to him that Riggs came from the special forces in the war in Vietnam. The reason for the craziness is clear--the Vietnam War caused the whole United States to protest Americans who fought in it. And especially when he faces off with something ripped-out of the headlines from the Columbine high school shooting in the director's cut version....a crazed man at a school firing randomly with an automatic weapon, and Riggs, in a very high-risk move, moves towards the line of fire at the shooter, plays a game of ""you missed the target"" to confuse the shooter, and finally knocks him dead with his 9mm at close range. Or even more, when Riggs hammers his head himself with his fists--as if his head was some type of drum------in front of his first perpetrator and then without warning points his 9mm at him--and surprise is Riggs' way of arresting perpetrators (because he uses unusual diversions).The scene involving Riggs and a suicidal man on a roof who wants to jump to their death tells more about Riggs' character....Riggs loves to talk fast, and, as mentioned before, he loves surprises, especially when he handcuffs the suicidal man without even telling him......and their famous jump off the roof into an awaiting safety mat is almost like the movie ""Hooper"", which gives you a gist of how a Hollywood stunt person lives with one's work.During the torture scene, where Endo shocks Riggs with about 600 volts of electricity over a shower raining on Riggs, I had seen why there was water. They say water and electricity don't mix. Doubly exciting was the part where Joshua tortures Murtaugh by attempting to break his left arm....and the intercutting camera work on both of the tortured characters.The final climax shows why police officers use handcuffs on their arrestees...here, you think Joshua is down for the count after the final fight with Riggs as he is dragged side-by-side by police officers without handcuffs. There was very good editing work on Joshua's sudden act of wrestling away one of the officer's guns and Riggs's 9mm and Murtaugh's .38 finally finishing him off...probably the only time in all four of the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies where the two main characters shoot their guns at the same time.

200,thegulls1,Always worth a look..,8,26 August 2019,"AMCHD ran this recently edited, bringing the language down to a PG level. If you dont like bad guys getting shot in Cops & Buddy flick, you might want to pass anyway. Danny Glover, family man and straight cop, gets partnered with lunatic Mel Gibson. Both guys are ex-Vietnam, but 'Riggs' (Gibson) is the mentally-deranged by highly-skilled LETHAL WEAPON.Some of their former war colleagues have continued the drug-smuggling in the private sector and the 2 cops get wind of the operation. The bad guys are anchored by a polite, white-haired dude (Gary Busey), who is the polar opposite of those giant snarling villians in the karate films: he is handsome, well-dressed, deferential but certainly in the same league as Riggs when it comes to being a deadly oppinent. Playing a good (charismatic) villain does wonders for your acting career. Even Tom Cruise tried it.Three scenes I always found amazing:
1) Riggs climbs a building to deal with a jumper. Soon the jumper wants no part of the crazy cop.
2) Busey rises in a helicopter to take out a guy who kives in a cliff-mansion. Great photography!
3) There is a final showdown between Gibson & Busey. Had to be. It's not realistic for a lawman to engage in a fistfight with a captured felon, but--dang! it's fun to watch.Often imitated (or satirized)-never duplicated.

His emotional scenes were brilliant. Danny Glover was also amazing as the by the book cop and wonderful family man. Even though both men are opposites they are perfect partners which leads to them not being friends but as a family as well.Gary Busey is also chilling as one of the main bad guys Mr Joshua.

Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are a perfect team in this movie. A young man who wants to commit suicide because his wife dies and a older man who has a family for a long time is not a good mix. Put these two together and destruction is bound to happen. My favorite scene in this movie is when Mel Gibson was on top of the building with a guy who is about to jump off and Mel Gibson handcuffs himself to the other man and jumps off together. He thought it was fun but the other guy was going insane. I think that particular scene shows how crazy and determined the character Martin Riggs really is. The non-stop action was incredible. The ending was full of high quality action that will keep you at the edge of your seat the whole time. Mel Gibson was incredible at the ending. Danny Glover was also full of surprises as well. I give Lethal Weapon **** out of ****. It was a classic movie and I recommend this movie to all viewers who like non-stop action and comedy and are Mel Gibson fans because this was by far Mel Gibson's most classical movie he made besides the movie Braveheart which he won an oscar for Best Director.

205,DJ_Shilo,Lethal Force,10,2 August 2021,"""Lethal Weapon"" is another buddy cop movie but with a rare pairing of substance and quality. The plot is very straightforward and surprisingly makes sense. The action hardly ever stops, and the cross-culture jokes and one-liners add humour to the film. While that may be all well and good, It's Gibson and Glover's performances as two like-minded cops with an unlikely friendship who win us over with trigger-happy enthusiasm.It's about a young girl who dives out a window in an apparent suicide. When it's investigated closer, it turns out to be a homicide. Ageing cop, Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is partnered with a volatile cop, Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) who is transferred from Naraciotis to homicide. Together they discover something bigger than a suicide that will test with limits as partners and friends.It opens to the wintery tune of Jingle Bell Rock before a woman decides to swan dive out of her hotel window on a dark night. Murtaugh is assigned to the case and he discovers the girl who jumped is only the tip of the iceberg but also has a connection that puts Murtaugh in touch with an old companion from the Vietnam war, the girl's father, Michael Hunsacker (Tom Atkins). That's basically the setup, a murder investigation with a few unexpected twists. Riggs comes into the movie when he ends up transferred because nobody wants to work with him. After he meets Murtaugh, they initially hate each other but develop mutual respect when Riggs saves Murtaugh's life and they bond over the violence in their pasts and he gives Riggs someone to talk to.Riggs is a suicidal hot dog whose developed a tendency since his wife was killed in a car crash and he blames himself for it. He carries a hollow point bullet that he tends to use on himself the moment the job doesn't do it for him anymore. He's considered a burnout on the ragged edge and a psycho but he is more of a criminal's worst nightmare than anything. There is a scene early on in the film that has Riggs load the special bullet into a 9mm Baretta and in a flurry of tears, he puts the barrel in his mouth and begs himself to pull the trigger. It gives you a reason to care about him and understand him. He's a martial arts expert, a sharpshooter and a ""lethal weapon"" hence the title of the film with a shot at black humour. Murtaugh on the other hand has just celebrated his 50th birthday. He is the middle-class good cop family man who begins to lose faith in himself due to his age and he's close to retirement. When we first see him, he is in a bathtub and ribbed by his wife and kids for his age. Just like Riggs, it shows the vulnerability of the characters.Richard Donner as the director and Shane Black as the screenwriter together make a fierce pair. They keep the movie wound tight and the tone is frenetic with surrealistic violence but it's balanced between the action sequences. When Riggs saves Murtaugh, he invites him to his home for dinner and you can see the sadness in Riggs's eyes as he admires Murtaugh's family and his new friend. You can also see that while Riggs is broken on the inside, after meeting Murtaugh, he becomes more lively when around him and the prominent scene of Riggs starting to find a new meaning is when he brings Murtaugh coffee and says ""Come on. You gotta get up so we can catch bad guys."" Murtaugh gets grumpy as he is comically forced out of bed.It all comes down to the two cops discovering what is going on and the villains appear because the cops are hot on their trail. One of them is a bright eye hateful killer, Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey) and the other is the stereotypical bad guy who is the leader and barks orders, Peter Macallister (Mitchell Ryan). Rather than just explain everything, Riggs and Murtaugh have to piece it all together which makes it exciting. When a house explodes and Riggs finds something he hasn't seen since the war, it makes them wonder what they are up against and these are the suspenseful moments that build up the film. An unexpected kidnapping sets up the third act where Murtaugh must turn to Riggs for help and it gets quite intense. You may be able to figure out the ending because it's an action film with a few surprises in an otherwise redundant story but there's a little more to it than you might expect and that's what makes the film chug along with a full chamber with buses crashing, cars exploding and non-stop gunfire. The most appealing are two characters that will be admired for many years to come.",Lethal Weapon
206,Asentiff2004,Im getting to old for this S***,9,22 December 2013,"Veteran cop Roger Murtaugh has served proudly as an LA police officer for many years, that is until loose canon Martin Riggs is assigned as his partner.

Donnor directs this movie with pure brilliance and the chemistry between Gibson and Glover as they play off each other with utter perfection, truly push this film forward. Intentionally hilarious, with extreme action this movie sets the standard for buddy cop films throughout the 80s and 90s. Though under appreciated in its time, Lethal Weapon has garnered a fan following that has proved to stand the test of time. Its hard to not root and become attached to Gibson and Glover in their roles, and just as easy to hate the villainous Mr. Joshua played by Busey. Fine performances, stupendous action, and even some comedy as this movie to this day remains any action movie fans wet dream.",Lethal Weapon
207,KingBrian1,Thrilling Good Action Movie,9,11 September 2014,"In this epic action adventure movie two LA cops partner up to take on the evil CIA drug smugglers. Roger Murtaugh an aging family man, long time on the force is forced to deal with the unhinged Martin Riggs. Together they must find the murderer of a young girl in the city. What should be a conventional detectives case suddenly turns into a roller coaster ride of pain, violence and revenge.This movie is simple a classic. The heyday of action movies were the 80's. The scenes featuring Riggs and his emotional breakdowns over his lost wife are extremely effective. The contrast between him and the cruel thugs with their absence of feelings goes someway to demonstrate how the goodness of the character always shines through despite his rage.The movie is great because both of the major characters played by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover pull off the tag team so well. One would be forgiven to think this is just another stupid action movie but this is not so. The theme of Christmas is all around, while these two cops go about their business of tracking down the murderers they share the bonds of friendship which develop over the course of the movie. Riggs rescuing Murtaugh, Murtaugh inviting Riggs into his house and of course Riggs be allowed to help his partner regardless of crimes he may be about to commit.",Lethal Weapon
208,peterpants66,Echo chamber of hot dog's,10,12 December 2010,"Lethal Weapon is a term used when a martial artist is so heavily skilled they have to register their ""hands"" as lethal weapons, so as to offer something to thugs before cremating them with fists, knees and elbows. I have personally been involved as a martial artist for over ten years and NEVER, EVER heard of anyone doing this in real life. What we have here is a franchise that never knew when to quit, often hiding behind the first picture to shelter security and ward off nah-sayer's. Supposedly this flick started the now fabled ""buddy"" style action films, movies where you grab a few bro's and head to the theater to engage in gut laughs and thunderous Hi-five's. I love the first L.W. but everything that came after fell incredibly short of the magic sustained in part one. Detective Riggs (Gibson) is a suicidal maniac narc splitting heads wide open in attempts to secure ""Psycho pension"" and leave the force, or so were told. Murtaw (Glover) plays the spry, gran-pappy, only shoot to injure, fatherly pug who's never too old for anything. Shane Black who would later go on to pen some of the best action flicks of our time, lays down some nice track here. This is a great movie to watch alone as well, some sub-section of movie collectors would probably agree, if i come home and i just want to throw something on, chances are Lethal Weapon is going in. Air America the former CIA liaison to corruption worldwide is mentioned as old enemies with Shadow company clearance are waxed. Did i mention Gary Busey? Who shines as the insane henchmen, that man can grunt! It's just too bad though, i hated the rest of the series. Rumor has it that if Mel can stop beating woman for ninety seconds there going to have-at another sequel. Five weapons are too much, they really should have stopped here. I mean there was only one Last Boyscout and that's all we needed. Hollywood, just make one good movie from now on and stop chucking more garbage at an otherwise good idea.",Lethal Weapon

211,MinorityReporter,Will never be matched!,9,26 May 2005,"This is not only one of the best cop-buddy movies but it is also by far one of Mel Gibson's best movies. In my opinion it almost matches Braveheart which is by all standards a great movie.First of all the overall acting in this movie is nothing short of excellent. Especially Mel Gibson portrays the deeply disturbed Martin Riggs with great finesse and his ability to create nuanced characters shines through in this movie. You genuinely feel with him and feel the incredible weight of his wife's death on him. Furthermore one of the things that makes Mel Gibson one of the really great actors in Hollywood is his ability to portray rage. Pure, uncontrolled rage and he certainly lifts the movie a few nudges acting wise. The other lead actor, Danny Glover, is also great in his role as the aging family father and he literally embodies the part of Roger Murtaugh and his line: ""I'm too old for this s*h*i*t"" has become a legend in the film world. Gary Busey is one of my top 10 screen bad guys. Not because he is an especially talented or great actor but he brings an edge to his character that makes one believe that he is the perfect nemesis for Riggs. Last but not least we have the underused Mitch Ryan (whom we have come to know best in the part of Edward Montgomery in Dharma and Greg) and he also does a great job with the relatively few lines he is given.In terms of story and interaction between the characters I can only say that it is close to perfection. The meeting between the two main characters is a classic moment and their slowly growing to like each other is also brilliantly done. The on-screen chemistry between the two actors is excellent and I'm tempted to say that they have the best chemistry EVER in film history (perhaps bested only by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs). In terms of the story the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh has been weighed more heavily than in the following movies which means that the villains will naturally be less refined than in the following movies and this weighing is very acceptable because the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh is the carrying element of the movie.The action in the movie is excellent for an 80s movie. I'll even say that I think that the action in this movie is better than much of the action in movies today because somehow it just seems much more believable in this movie than it does in movies like Die Another Day for example where the action has been amplified so much that it just becomes ridiculous and, lets face it, silly. Most of the action involves Mel Gibson and this works great because he really is one of the greats when it comes to action. He gives the action credibility unlike ""actors"" like Sylvester Stallone or Steven Segal. You genuinely believe that he could be able to shoot someone with a sniper rifle at a distance of 1 - 2 kilometers.All in all a movie where basically everything works and is perhaps underrated by the voters of IMDb. 9/10 - watch this movie right now!",Lethal Weapon
212,badfeelinganger,"The most successful instalment in a phenomenally successful series, Lethal Weapon helped redefine action movies for the 1980s and 1990s.",10,29 September 2014,"The most successful instalment in a phenomenally successful series, Lethal Weapon helped redefine action movies for the 1980s and 1990s.Thanks to a peculiar chemistry and a terrific script, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover lift this movie above and beyond.

214,scorfield-51711,"'You make it through tomorrow without killing anybody, especially me or yourself, then I'll start trusting you.""",8,5 April 2021,"The first in the franchise which reinvigorated this genre of buddy action movies, pairing two detectives of differing, yet complementary characters. The chemistry between the leads is palpable and serves as the dynamism for why this film maintains its popularity. Another factor in its box office success and warm critical reception was its combination of frenetic pace and solid characterisation, the credit for which should go to director, Richard Donner. Having been out of the box office limelight since his sacking from Superman II seven years earlier, he reminded theatregoers and studio executives of his skills with this landmark feature.Thankfully, the first choice to take the director's chair, Leonard Nimoy, turned the project down. However, one cannot imagine how Richard Donner envisaged Christopher Reeve, his first choice for the leading role, undertaking such an unhinged character as Martin Riggs. Once cast, Gibson made the role his own, managing the difficult feat of capturing the necessary charm, brittle emotional state, and resolute determination of this unorthodox action hero. Indeed, it is the taut performance from Gibson in the tense and tearful scene where Riggs fails to carry out his attempt to take his own life which persuaded Zeffirelli to cast him in the role of Hamlet in his production of the Shakespearean tragedy.Darker in tone than its sequels, it is still somewhat regrettable that the decision was made to shed the school sniper scene, restored in the more recent Director's cut. This illustrates far more effectively the death wish with which Riggs struggles, triggered by his inconsolable bereavement at the recent loss of his wife in a car accident. Riggs' edgy character juxtaposes well against his partner's wish to safely reach and enjoy retirement with his family, providing many of the lighter touches behind the screenplay. As the advertising copy for the movie phrased it: 'Glover carries a weapon. Gibson is one.' At one point when his partner asks him whether he sleeps with his weapon under the pillow, Riggs responds: 'I would if I slept'. On an interesting note, the unfortunate psychiatrist assigned to Riggs' case is played by Mary Ellen Trainer, familiar to audiences as the meddling journalist, Gail Wallens, from the other action blockbuster of the late Eighties, 'Die Hard'. This brings us to another coincidence that Bruce Willis turned down the role of Riggs before it was handed down to Gibson, and twelve months later the latter returned the favour in rejecting the part of John McClane.The credit for casting Danny Glover as Roger Murtaugh goes to casting director, Marion Dougherty, who persuaded Richard Donner of the attraction of pairing an Afro-American with Riggs' character. Indeed, as it turned out, Glover's performance as Murtaugh is the perfect foil for Gibson, with this underrated actor's reactions to his partner's antics forming one of the running comedic themes throughout the movie, and its subsequent sequels. Rigg's instability also contrasts with the warmth of the family scenes set in the Murtaugh family home, which lent themselves so well to a Christmas release. The festive setting would prove to be one characteristically used by the novice screenwriter, Shane Black, due to the fact, as he himself later explained: 'It's unifying...It grounds everything...lonely people are lonelier...People take stock of where their lives are at Christmas.' The central plot behind Black's storyline surrounds an investigation into the death of Murtagh's Vietnam war buddy's daughter, whose tragic drug-related demise from falling to her death from a high-rise opens proceedings. The subsequent delving into the case brings our protagonists too close to the interests of 'Shadow Company', a black-ops heroin smuggling outfit that had helped the CIA fund the Vietnam War, and whose illicit drug-dealing operations have continued into peacetime. Given Murtaugh and Riggs' service in the same conflict, the film plays out like a confrontation between good versus evil as our veterans clash swords with those whose service record from the Vietnam conflict had more nefarious motivation. This is especially the case with the extreme torture scenes which Riggs is subjected to.There is strong support from the rest of the cast, most notably from Gary Busey as psychotic criminal sidekick, Mr Joshua. Having spent years in cinematic mediocrity, Busey rightfully regards this role as having saved his career. In preparing for his unhinged character, Busey later revealed that he thought of Joshua as an individual who 'would walk through his grandmother's blood to get a postage stamp'. Yet, aside from Busey's malignant interventions, one of the few criticisms of the movie which could be made is that the villains of the piece, under the leadership of the enigmatic 'General', played satisfactorily by Mitchell Ryan, himself a Korean War veteran, are not given enough 'screen-time'.Nevertheless, there can be no question that this production set standards for action movies which others have since sought to emulate. Much of the credit for this should go to the cinematography of Stephen Goldblatt, from the opening aerial tracking shot to the high-rise from which our first victim will plummet, to the superbly crafted execution of the desert showdown. The latter is the movie's best scene, as the partners hatch a plan to rescue Murtaugh's kidnapped daughter. Goldblatt's skills are fully demonstrated in firstly exploiting the expanse of the landscape to build the tension behind the arrival of both parties for the supposed trade-off. Secondly, Goldblatt skilfully returns to utilise a highly effective aerial shot to frame the aftermath of this rescue attempt with the capture of Riggs.As commented upon earlier, credit for the film's success is largely due to the reliable and underrated talents of director, Richard Donner, who ensures that the action sequences maintain sufficient drama for the audience, while imbuing the whole production with a style which has not suffered with the passage of time. Indeed, by placing the focus on as much the entertainment as on the action itself, Donner set the movie apart from the typical fare which had previously characterised this genre. Gibson himself quoted this as the main appeal for him taking a role where the character of our protagonists supersedes mere brawn and stamina. Yet, the latter do come to the forefront when the film's action sequences do end with a hand-to-hand combat between Gibson's and Busey's characters. This key head-to-head confrontation took great planning. Just for this sequence alone, three specialist trainers were employed to orchestrate a unique blend of styles of martial arts.Unlike the case in some of the future sequels, Donner ably balances the humour of scenes, such as that of Rigg's handling of the 'jumper', with the gritty tension of the graphic treatment of his torture at the hands of Al Leong's Kung-Fu moustachioed member of 'Shadow Company'. On a different note, one of the few weak elements of the movie, dating the production, is the soundtrack provided by Michael Kamen and Eric Clapton. This is a shame, and one wonders whether its removal would benefit a future cut.Ultimately, the film's commercial and critical success must be credited to Shane Black's debut screenplay, which so impressed producer Joel Silver that he was prepared to pay a quarter of a million dollars to the untried and untested 22 year-old recent graduate from UCLA film-school. In fact, so successful would this reintroduction of the buddy cop movie be that it would set the benchmark for all those which would follow in it's wake. As a final point of interest, the aforementioned chemistry between the two leads persuaded Donner to alter the original ending where the two say their goodbyes, to one much more open to the possibility of a sequel, thereby, ensuring the viability of one of the biggest grossing franchises in cinema history.",Lethal Weapon
215,Wwmbrd,Aged like wine,7,20 September 2021,"I've long been a proponent of getting a crazy person to perform the role of a crazy character, and who better to fill the shoes of a suicidal, unhinged, fast talking cop than Mel Gibson? In what may have been the defining role of his career, if not the finest performance he's ever given, Gibson truly shines here. Lethal Weapon carries the action with an itchy trigger finger, and has enough brawls to keep you interested, even where the plot may feel a bit thin.

216,jjgooner,Gibson + Glover = Ultimate Cop Buddies,8,18 August 2013,"Lethal Weapon***1/2 (out of 4)117 mins/ 18Cast: Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Mitch Ryan, Tom Atkins, Darlene Love, Traci Wolfe, Jackie Swanson, Damon HinesDirector: Richard DonnerPlot: An experienced cop is forced to work with a young suicidal cop to take down a gang of drug smugglers. JJ's Verdict: Lethal Weapon has a confused and a little twisted plot. In most films I would be criticising it for this. But in Lethal Weapon, story is rightfully placed behind the right to entertain the audience with Riggs and Murtaugh – the best cop partnership cinema has had to offer.In Lethal Weapon, we are introduced to Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh who have just been paired together to investigate the suicide of a young woman after she jumped off her balcony. In Riggs we have a young, confident cop but extremely psychotic and suicidal and in Murtaugh, a reserved old-timer and family man who is just too old for this s***. The pair discover the girl died after being poisoned through drugs and have to try and investigate a gang of drug dealers while also trying to stand one and other.Lethal Weapon is plot thin. It mainly revolves around Riggs and Murtaugh chasing drug dealers and with this premise most would expect a textbook formulaic action film. Luckily this isn't what they get, mainly down to writer Shane Black. His script is sharp and full of witty lines and contains two superb characters. Put together with director Richard Donner's brilliant flair for directing both actors and action scenes, it is action and cop-buddy heaven. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover work so well together and (Gibson especially) both become completely immersed in their characters. Despite their characters being complete opposites, as a viewer you kind of want to be both. Gibson's Riggs is a total loner and has a tendency to go completely psycho and watching the Aussie contemplate suicide and then just go bonkers with a gun is an absolute joy to watch. Danny Glover's Murtaugh is less showy than Gibson and without much study you would probably just say he did fine. But Glover's attention to small details in his acting is brilliant and little moments where he worries about his age are, at times, heart breaking. The rest of the cast includes singer Darlene Love in a sweet performance as Mrs. Murtaugh and Gary Busey, who is very good as primary villain, Mr. Joshua.The action is brilliantly choreographed, and each set piece is very intense. A few that standout in particular is the wild-west-like shootout towards the end, the bar shootout and of course the epic punch-off finale between Riggs and Joshua. Most of the actor did their own stunts in the film and each of them certainly put in their all to look well-trained in these scenes-and trust me, they do.Its plot is a little too simple but that isn't the appeal here. The appeal is Gibson and Glover, having brilliant banter, learning to trust the other, killing bad guys and just having fun. This is entertainment at its very best.",Lethal Weapon

222,wolverinesforever,Effective fun,8,5 February 2010,"One thing that stood out for me while watching ""Lethal Weapon"" was how it took some time to get you to know the characters. Most action movies seem to be in a rush to get to the fights and explosions. They simply fill in the blanks for ""characterization"" and then have them draw their guns. ""Lethal Weapon"" is better than that. We really get to know Murtagh, the dedicated family man, and Riggs, the broken widow. Scenes like where Murtagh is having dinner or where Riggs contemplates suicide helped me relate to them not just as cops, but as people with other things going on.So while they are efficient in their jobs, they are also very vulnerable and very human. So when they get caught up in a fight against the bad guys in the second half, I cared for their fates. Director Richard Donner does a good job keeping the adrenaline high, making the second half quite thrilling to watch. All in all, ""Lethal Weapon"" does a good job bringing in the thrills and action with a dose of comedy and plenty of characterization to boot.

225,Diego_rjc,"The first - and with no thought, the best - buddy film",9,18 December 2010,"Action movies. We all love them. They have heroes, explosions, foreign villains, amazing gunfights and pretty much all you need to have fun. But there is one type of action movie that we love the most, the so- called buddy films. They got almost what every action flick has (all mentioned above). But there is one major difference. In this type of movie, instead of one hero, you get two. Generally they are both partner cops and struggle to solve a major case involving drug-dealers. And Richard Donner's 1987's 'Lethal Weapon' is the movie that practically created this buddy movie genre, and it's still copied nowadays. But what makes 'Lethal Weapon' so special? We shall see. 'Lethal Weapons' story centers around its two major characters: Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), both cops who are partnered to solve a case involving a gang of drug smugglers. Although the story may seem a bit cliché nowadays, that is because it was copied so many times - back then, it was fresh and new. But the main force that makes Shane Black's script so great is the depth of his two main characters and their relationship. They are so different that it's hard to understand how they get along so well. Riggs is a self-destruct, and almost suicidal cop, and that makes him the Lethal Weapon referred to on the title. Murtaugh, on the other hand, is just a simple detective, a family man who served in Vietnam and has been on the force for nearly 20 years. And it's this difference of opinion and style that makes the movie as good as it is - it's practically a love story between two thought guys in the middle of chases, gunfights, explosions. The dialog here is also marvelous - you sure are going to remember most of the main quotes. There are also a few funny lines and sequences to light up the mood a little bit.As stated, 'Lethal Weapon''s script revolves around Gibson and Glover. Therefore, the story simply wouldn't work without good acting of the pair. But thankfully, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover have so much chemistry on screen that you end up believing they are Riggs and Murtaugh on skin and flesh. They both deliver excellent performances, and, in my opinion, even Oscar-worthy ones, Specially for Gibson. The scene where Riggs almost kills himself in his apartment is quite an impressive achievement for Gibson, being the best scene on his career. And Glover also manages to deliver a very good performance. But apart from the main duo, there isn't really a lot to add on what refers to acting. No one from the supporting cast did a above-average job, but they really didn't need to. Gibson and Glover sure can hold the bar on their own.Another point that impressed me upon watching 'Lethal Weapon' was Richard Donner's directing. I've watched most of his other flicks, and I believe this is the best job he did since 'Superman'. He managed to always keep the pace of the flick, never let the bar go or anything. And also he did a incredible job filming the action scenes. The helicopter scene, to give the best example, is quite breath-taking, so is the chase at the end of the movie. And talking about the end - both the ending and the initial scenes are shockingly well-filmed. Technically, I can't also find many flaws in 'Lethal Weapon' - Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography works very well, so does the editing by Stuart Baird. If you're wandering if the musical score is good or not, there is only one thing to be said: Eric Clapton did it (along with Michael Kamen).What can I say? 'Lethal Weapon' is the movie that started it all - it started the buddy film genre and introduced us to Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs, characters we all know and love. The movie's script is awesome, and it's still copied nowadays. Richard Donner's directing is also great, but what makes it almost perfect is the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. Donner, Gibson, and Glover would still come back for three other sequels, but nothing can come close to the magic that was the first movie. Recommended to anyone who likes action flicks or just wanna have a good time.9/10",Lethal Weapon

227,mark-whait,Gibson and Glover chemistry the best since Sundance,10,24 December 2010,"One of the most compelling and entertaining movies to come out of Eighties Hollywood was Lethal Weapon. It cemented the superstar status of Mel Gibson - already essential casting following the success of Mad Max, and also turned Danny Glover into a household name. But crucially, the script - despite being a typical 80s action thriller that stretches credibility to its most unlikely point - actually works because of the mesmerising chemistry between Gibson and Glover. The two bounce off each other and the dialogue sizzles in between the breathtaking action sequences. It's the best on screen partnership since Newman and Redford in Butch Cassidy, and rarely can two characters have been so neon-lit as being 'the good guys'. The set pieces are tremendous - from Gibson's attempts to bring down a suicidal man from the top of a tower block to his hilarious yet unmissable brush with a gang of drug dealers early on, this top the buddy-movie genre onto another level. Of course the movie spawned another 3 sequels and became one of the most recognisable franchises in modern Hollywood. But this is entertainment at its very best, and Gibson has rarely been better. His psychotic, crazed cop blessed with martial art and sharpshooting skills most of his colleagues don't have made him the perfect rampaging crusader and his star status was assured after this.",Lethal Weapon
228,Habibi-Universe,A Cult Classic,6,23 September 2020,"Richard Donner's 'Lethal Weapon' (1987) is a buddy cop action film about two newly paired cops, who are complete opposites, having to put aside their differences in order to catch a gang of drug smugglers. That's the main gist of the film.
I am writing this review as someone who has just seen 'Lethal Weapon' for the first time in his life.This film has earned a great reputation over the decades from the film fan community due to one main reason, the chemistry between our two heroes!Mel Gibson as Martin Riggs and Danny Glover as Roger Murtaugh are both completely different characters, yet they share this undeniable charm that unites them beautifully! A good buddy cop action comedy always needs a great chemistry between the two protagonists! This film does have that!
Despite being constructed like a typical buddy cop action comedy, I still really appreciate the originality of the script. Is it the most amazing screenplay of all time? Of course not. It does have a few problems, mainly that it is too superficial at times and makes it a little too easy for itself when our characters are put into difficult situations. Therefore, at the end of the day, you can exactly see how the story will end and you won't be confronted with any shocking twists and turns.
Then again, the film definitely deserves credit for being so entertaining, fun to watch and pretty clever when it comes to the dialogue. There are some really funny one-liners coming from Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. Admittedly this film does have its silly moments too, especially right at the end!Let me talk a little bit about the impressive cinematography. I would specifically like to talk about one scene (without spoiling anything) where the cinematography stood out to me. There is a key scene in the film that takes place in a rather unusual/distant environment. In that whole sequence the cinematography is absolutely fantastic! You have long takes building up the tension and wide shots increasing the scope of the film even though a rather intimate and personal subject matter is the issue. Due to this wide shot technique the audience is presented with a much grander and richer experience.Despite the R-rating of the film, it is relatively light-hearted with the exception of a few gruesome scenes. The film's pacing is quite good. Unfortunately the second half of the film wasn't as compelling, focused and good as the first one. I feel like the quality had a bit of a dip.
The ending, like I said, is predictable without any twists and turns.Overall, 'Lethal Weapon' is a feel-good movie with some really entertaining and fun scenes. Obviously this film is a cult classic and an absolute must-see film for everybody! If you've never seen it before... what are you doing?! Go watch it! 6/10",Lethal Weapon

231,TheDreadedChampion2019,They Don't Make em like this anymore,9,9 November 2019,"The Original Lethal Weapon is just the perfect movie. You have an old pro behind the camera, Dick Donner (in his first off 6 collaborations with Mel Gibson). You have one of the more larger than life personalities in Hollywood and action movie connoisseur Joel Silver producing, and the brilliant and raw screenwriting debut by a young Shane Black. Mel Gibson was born to play the character of Martin Riggs. It's some of his best acting, so natural and real. Danny Glover as the more conservative Murtaugh is a great counter balance to the nervous energy of Riggs....This movie balances comedy, action, and drama so well. The action is exciting and well staged. The drama is real and deep. The comedy is so natural and flows so easily from the electric chemistry between Gibson and Glover. The script by Black is top notch stuff. It's a film that works on so many levels and that really takes you on a wild ride. I've come back to it so many times. The second one comes close and in some areas even supersedes this one. But as a whole you still can't beat the sheer magnetic power of the original.",Lethal Weapon
232,Ofisil8-850-238679,I'm Too Old For This S***,4,28 June 2011,"Plot: One police officer with suicidal tendencies and his close-to-retirement colleague have to uncover a huge drug-smuggling operation and at the same time cope with each other.You'll love Lethal Gun if: You like these macho, cop-duo over the top action films of the 80's and don't really care about getting you intelligence insulted. Honestly I rented this movie just to help myself remember why I liked it when I was very young and I can't say I figured out why. However if you can handle the movie's cheesiness, unrealistic situations and characters and the stereotypes of US cop films, you're in for one of the best of its kind at least that's what the majority says. The saving grace of the film: the great chemistry between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson and while when I was younger I loved the psycho bad-ass Mel Gibson, I can see now that Glover not only plays a much, much better character but also a more realistic one thus easier to relate to, (unless you are 8 years old).You'll hate Lethal Gun if: You hate these unrealistic cop films and if you want a movie with an actually interesting plot. Honestly what's the big deal with this movie and its -far worse- sequels? They are one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is pretty typical nothing will leave you with your mouth open or surprise you. The characters are of cardboard quality at best, with Gibson playing a cartoon who is more irritating than cool. Glover plays the conservative family man, (with a moustache of course!), and Gibson is the rebel cop who cries at night while trying to kill his self because his wife died in a traffic accident boooohoooooo! Riiiiiight The action sequences are boring and the way the main characters and especially Gibson behave is unrealistic and far from heroic more like suicidal just for the fun of it. You want a good cop movie look elsewhere. Yes, I've seen worse but the point here is that this movie is one of the most successful ones!!!FINAL VERDICT: A Series Of Action Movie Clichés (4.4/10)[+] Great main character chemistry.[-] Boring action sequences and plot. Extremely stereotypical characters.Also Check: Bad Boys (1993) - Die Hard (1988) – Lethal Weapon (1989) – Rush Hour (1998)P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say ""I like\don't like this movie"" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...",Lethal Weapon
233,crazychap,The best action movie since Raiders,9,8 June 2005,"Perfect cop movie that uses clichés and gives them a new face with a story of two cops who have only two things in common: both are Vietnam Veterans and they hate working with partners. Mel Gibson plays Martin Riggs, a suicidal cop in his mid 30's who enjoys the danger and doesn't care if he lives or dies; Danny Glover play a 50-year-old detective and family man who is setting up plans for retirement in the near future. But fate or circumstance cause these two to come together as they investigate a hooker's murder, which leads these two to a deadly drug ring. Before long, they have no choice but trust each other.One of the best action movies of modern times, it has the right combination of action, drama and humour. The jumper scene (in which Riggs cuffs himself with the potential jumper) is a hilarious and unheard of in most other movies. The action sequences are fast-paced and furious, and they never let up for a minute. Gibson and Glover deliver powerful performances as they fit their character's shoes perfectly (Martin Riggs's suicide attempt with a gun is both chilling and moving, as it shows us the roots of his wild behaviour). The rest of the cast is also perfect; Gary Busey and Mitchell Ryan are the right antithesis of Gibson and Glover. The final fight between is Gibson and Busey is a wow, JUST AS LONG AS YOU DON'T hesitate to think (the movie hardly gives you time to do so).***1/2 out of ****",Lethal Weapon
234,nbwritersinbox,Well Crafted Action Yarn,7,5 April 2011,"As 80s action films go, this one surprised me. (When I came across an old VHS Tape of the movie and gave it a spin - Yes, I admit to still owning a VCR).I recall Lethal Weapon was an entertaining film, when I first watched it years ago. On a new viewing, it remains notable due to the fine performances turned-in by Glover and Gibson.Although prone to the all-American desire for gratuitous violence, a well-crafted screenplay, dramatic performances and worthy supporting cast lift proceedings. Director, Richard Donner, is possibly under-rated too, as many scenes crackle with action and excitement.Either by accident, or design, we're also given a heart-warming exploration of a man's battle to regain his sanity - after coping with the loss of his wife. These scenes are well-handled by Donner, while Gibson (as Riggs) provides a moving portrayal.Danny Glover, who's been watchable in many movies, as the steady and careful Murtough contrasts well with his manic, though talented colleague, Riggs. I'd even suggest there's rare, though welcome ""screen chemistry"" occurring between Mel and Danny in this film. Chemistry so often missing in the cinema today.",Lethal Weapon
235,Munin75,An action classic... I don't get it.,5,12 March 2012,"I watched Lethal Weapon first as a kid in the 90s and I guess I liked it because - let's face it, I was prepubescent so anything with action was good enough. Now in my mid-twenties I almost fell asleep watching it, the only reason I stayed awake was out of shock that such a stale and monotonous film is considered an action classic today.What was original about Lethal Weapon when it came out? Perhaps the unusual cop duo set in a seemingly realistic crime plot - which I realize has since probably inspired all the later films with that same ingredient. So I give it credit for that. Nonetheless I can't give it more than the average 5/10. I found the crime plot uninteresting, and the dialog now feels so cliché and outdated that if it were released today it would probably receive much ridicule. Some scenes are absolutely ludicrous, like when Gibson threatens to kill himself while Glover encourages him, or the final fight scene (Gibson going personal, and the cops just agreeing to watch them get it on...). This wouldn't be so awful to me if there were other good scenes to make up for the bad ones, but I honestly can't think of one memorable and good scene.I admit though, that I'm not so much into generic cop films which rely almost exclusively on action. Straightforward gun-shooting action tends to bore me unless a scene is particularly impressive or original in some way. Caring for the characters is also necessary to enjoy the action sequences. Unfortunately, I didn't care for any of the characters in Lethal Weapon, and wasn't impressed by the discreet attempts at humor.To each his own I guess. If you like stereotypical 80s action crime films, you may want to check this one out.",Lethal Weapon
236,crawfrordboon,"""'Mad' Mel hits the bit time!""",7,28 January 2005,"Progressing from the wide acclaim brought to him through the MAD MAX series, Mel Gibson's star continued its inexorable rise to superstardom with LETHAL WEAPON, the film that would launch one of the most popular, successful, and iconic film franchises of recent times. Gibson takes centre stage as suicidal LA detective Martin Riggs, allowing him free rein to explode into the claustrophobic surroundings in which he finds himself.Partnering Gibson, his 'straight man' as it were, is Danny Glover as Sgt Roger Murtagh, a veteran cop who is less than pleased to find himself paired with Riggs. The 'buddy' nature of the partnership, shifting from suspicion, to dislike, to liking, back to antagonism, and finally to respect, friendship, and trust, is a formula which has often been imitated, but never bettered. The chemistry between Gibson and Glover is instantly evident, and throughout the film the tension generated by placing two such nominally dissimilar characters together is rarely far from the surface.The dual layered plot, which initially and mostly focuses on the attempts of Riggs to overcome the depression which has settled over his life since the death of his wife, is an important feature of the film, and one that would be repeated successfully in the sequels. Gradually, as the partnership builds around a murder case of an old friend of Murtagh's, a criminal mercenary heroin running scheme is uncovered by the duo, who find themselves targeted, not for the last time in the series, by the bad guys. Of course, there is plenty of action, including drive-by shootings, fly-by shootings, fist fights, and explosions, but in this first instalment of the series, the best moments are saved for darker instances of tension between characters.The one false note struck in LETHAL WEAPON is the repeated references to the Vietnam War, in which Riggs, Murtagh, and the head bad guy Mr Joshua (Gary Busey in a menacing but not overused appearance), are meant to have served. Not only are all three men clearly too young to have been in Vietnam, but the ties of Gibson's former special forces unit to the mercenary operation and the murder case are skimmed over too briefly, and could have done with deeper exploration, especially through the 'fleshing out' of key villains, such as Mr Joshua. A belated attempt to look at the US Special Forces abusing the narcotics laws was made in 1990 with Air America, also starring Gibson.On the whole, this is a very enjoyable action film, with far less of the comedic element than was to follow, with only Riggs' lighter moments during his depression to provide relief from the drama. For an uncomplicated, powerful, and above all fun thrill ride, you can't do much better than LETHAL WEAPON!",Lethal Weapon
237,benaboo,This is my favorite action movie of all time! Sorry Die Hard.,10,9 July 2018,"If somebody asks me what my favorite action movie is I'm going to answer Lethal Weapon. Yes, I like Lethal Weapon better than Die Hard. There is just something about this franchise that really speaks to me. This is not your average run of the mill buddy cop film. This movie has a lot of fantastic action, some great drama, and a little bit of humor. The chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is magical. The character of Martin Riggs, portrayed beautifully by my favorite actor Mel Gibson is one of my favorite movie characters in all of cinema. Shane Black apparently hated the way Riggs evolved in the later installments but I personally loved that. He was a character that was very well developed and seeing him grow as a character was a pleasure to watch. These films don't have the most memorable villains in the world but the villains in this movie are my second favorites after Jet Li and Company in the fourth film. The fight between Mel Gibson and Gary Busey is one of the greatest in cinema history. I love how a broken fire hydrant rains over them as they fight. The suicide contemplation scene is one of the most well acted scenes by Mel Gibson but he has a bunch of those. Lethal Weapon is not only my favorite action movie of all time but one of my favorite movies and it's spawned a great franchise. Lethal Weapon is fantastic. Lethal Weapon 2 is almost as good. Lethal Weapon 3 is weaker but definitely has it's strong points and Lethal Weapon 4 is fun from start to finish with great action and funny comedy. If I had to grade these films I would give Lethal Weapon an A. I would give Lethal Weapon 2 an A-. I would give Lethal Weapon 3 a B. And I would give Lethal Weapon 4 a B+.",Lethal Weapon

The ultimate in buddie movies which spawned 3 more fantastic films. The original crazed Mad max becomes the even crazier Martin Riggs. Gibson portrays the agony and heartache of a cop on the edge of losing wife. His face could tell a thousand stories of his pain. Richard Donner knows that Mel Gibson has this edge and frames it perfectly. He lets the actors generate an energy and rolls with it. This is seen even more on LW2. 80's action with amazing energy that doesn't stop. Danny (Murtagh) Glover could be the voice of reason but for Riggs but realised he is too much of a lose cannon to control. Perfect cop buddie, good cop, worst cop!

241,fpcholcomb,The Best Buddy Cop Movie Ever Made,9,27 November 2019,"Lethal Weapon is the best buddy cop movie ever made and a quintessential piece of American commercial cinema. This movie is a perfect example of how to take a relatively common format with broad appeal and bring it to its natural peak. It is energetic, well cast, and toes the line between humor and emotional excellently.Now I have to admit some bias here as I am a huge fan of Danny Glover. I first saw him in Predator 2, which I liked him in although the movie was disappointing when compared to the original. Then I saw him much later again when I watched my favorite tv show of all time, Arrested Development, where he had me in stitches. Pairing his old, charming, and gruff cop persona with Mel Gibson's wild eyed always-say-die energy was a stroke of genius. Glover is an old cop who has amassed a good family and a nice life that he wants to protect, the exact opposite of Mel's character who is a reckless cop who has nothing to live for but the job after his wife died in a car accident. At first the situation plays out about as well as you expect, with neither particularly liking the other. It becomes clear they have very, very different methods of diffusing situations that often put them at odds with one another. Most importantly, this relationship does not feel forced and there is a minimal amount of cheese. I cannot stress how well Glover and Gibson play their characters off one another.One of the only points I can take away from the film is that the villains are no Hans Grubers. They are generic drug dealing ex military guys who like to prove how tough they are by burning themselves in front of potential clientele. That being said, they are well acted and rightfully not the focal point of the movie, only appearing to show their menace or to get into shootouts with Murtaugh and Riggs (the cops Danny and Mel play, respectively).The big reason this movie works in two fold, like almost all good action movies it does not take itself too seriously and its the fast paced and explosive action sequences works within the laws of its own universe. There is always something going on or surprising the viewer to keep them engaged. Not to mention it at time shows restraint, which movies often don't. They use feature a helicopter often but never show it exploding mid air in a ball of fire as so many other movies would do for the sheer spectacle of it despite its obvious lack of feasibility. The violence is abrupt but not overtly gruesome. It presents a convincing world and two heroes that are worthy of our attention within it. You feel the stress of the cops life as they are threatened going about their everyday work in a city full of drugs and crime and not in a cartoonish way.Action, heart, fantastic actors, this movie has all you could want from a cheesy action flick, and it does not feel nearly dated as one might think in this cgi spectacle age.

I'm also sorry it's so intricate-an-interweaving of just about everything to which I most essentially relate, and just about every image I've so thoroughly come to renounce; but perhaps not quite on time to avoid dying of cancer, almost as Fatalistically as I sometimes feel tempted to jump, if not indulge the most compulsively-evasive appetites! . . . It's as if the good guys, those only the god of this age really loves for what they are, but no more than to the point where even that remains so unavoidably expedient to his most tenderly domesticating sensibilities, were not any other than Mr. Joshua and The General. . . . That is, contrary to the viciously, systematically slandered image of just about everything this god as dishonestly, shamefully despises, while insuring that it hates him back in a way which really does work, if only to prolong the dirty little secret that it's not crazy! . . . They're still denying it a more chivalrously sporting Shot at the Title, and have even quite carelessly written it off for dead, due to a zeal for being thorough which they mistakenly assume has penetrated to the very heart of the problem! . . . They thereby defy a Force of Reason it need renew, every single day, in order to continue doing the only thing it's ever really been good at; over-against their need never to admit how accidentally neat they are at even wounding it in the leg, let-alone with such rhetorically mystifying impactright between the eyes! . . . That is, just as far-too-many of their more intentionally fatal blows must be even more accurately yet lyingly listed by them as accidental, at least in the only way which can possibly matter at all; to those who quite conveniently pay no more real mind to the motive than to the deed, lest even by luck the worst kind of marksmanship does operationally manage to redeem. . . . That is, while embodying a Reason of Force which often tells the truth, but never by nature because it is the truth; contrary to as explicitly-relentless-a-denial as necessary of this very truth, in the form of their most fundamentally, categorically misleading expedient. . . . How much more gracefully yet I'd love to be able to put my weapon permanently under the pillow, rather than needing a hollow point to do the job right; as one who never really expects to be home for Christmas, but only followed without mercy by one last reminder that the closing theme is all that remains, even of his dreams. . . .

He shoots it square in the head.

250,O.N.,The Best of the Lethal Weapon Series,8,20 December 1999,"Lethal Weapon is typical of the tough hard-nosed action films of the 80's and is a great piece of escapist mayhem.The story, penned by action specialist Shane Black, involves suicidal cop Riggs (Mel Gibson) teaming up with by-the-books family cop Murtaugh (Danny Glover) to combat a nasty drug syndicate headed by baddies Gary Busey and Mitch Ryan.Although the premise is nothing overly original, it provides a great springboard for what makes this film really work -- the  interplay between the two vastly different lead characters and the top-notch excitement-filled action pieces.Gibson and Glover work very well together, and unlike the other Lethal Weapons where the humour comes from specially scripted jokes or characters (eg. Joe Pesci), this Lethal derives its humour from the situations these two cops keep getting stuck in. For instance, Riggs as the suicidal cop (resulting from the recent death of his wife) has no fear and just walks head first into dangerous situations. It's a real laugh to see him doing his job because you just don't know what he's going to do next. The drug deal at the start where he plays three-stooges with the dealers and gives them 100 bucks for their stash is a fine example and is bound to raise more than a few smiles. Later he teams up with good cop Murtaugh and more mayhem ensues as these two adjust to each other's methods of policing. But in the spirit of all these types of movies, they end up being the best of pals and team up to really make the villains pay.The villains here are the best out of all the Lethal Weapons, with the exception of Jet Li in no. 4. Gary Busey gives one of his best performances as ex-mercenary ""Mr Joshua"" who now finds drug dealing a profitable pastime. The final fight between Joshua and Riggs is a highlight and apparently took 4 days to shoot. However, there are many other adrenalin-charged sequences between cops and scumbags including an explosive bus crash and a chase down Hollywood boulevard with the bare chested, machine gun packing Riggs going all-out to do his job.In summary, this is a great combination of action and comedy which is not seen in the more politically-correct action films of the 90's. Clearly the pick of the Lethal Weapon series and one of the best cop films of the 80's!8.5 - 9 / 10",Lethal Weapon
251,RottenPop-Sid,The quintessential buddy cop action flick!,8,19 January 2018,"Lethal Weapon is the eighties action film that kicked off the whole buddy-cop trope in Hollywood. It's directed by Richard Donner (Superman II) and penned by Shane Black (Predator). Our cast of stars features Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the lead roles with Gary Busey as a henchman to the main villain, The General played by Mitchell Ryan. I decided to pair the film with a nice Indica like King Louis XIII from Marley Natural. It's a relaxing strain that provides a good deal of happiness. A good combination to dive right into a badass picture like this. The earthy tastes and piny aromas pair well with a good beer too. If that's your kind of thing. The film follows the pairing of two LAPD detectives. Martin Riggs is a detective that is psychologically broken and emotionally damaged following the death of his wife. Roger Murtaugh is a veteran cop that works hard to support his family. They get paired together as partners working various crimes and bonding. Roger is constantly tested by Riggs' inherently psychotic behavior. He almost gives up. However, after things go south and the duo bands together to put an end to a very dangerous group of drug smugglers called Shadow Company. The film features cheesy action film acting and witty dialogue, mostly between Gibson and just about everyone he comes in contact with. His Martin Riggs character is iconic. He stands as one of the best cops in movie history. Danny Glover is the perfect straight man but it's kind of unfortunate that he was so tight cast. Busey is badass in this movie. He looks awesome and does a great job of projecting himself as menacing. Tom Atkins is good too, his role is minimal, but he gives it everything. That is up until his death, which is rather goofy looking. Lethal Weapon also has an amazing soundtrack provided by Michael Kamen and Eric Clapton. Yes, that Eric Clapton. The howling saxophone and blazing guitar set upon a sprawling Los Angeles cityscape provide an amazing atmosphere for the story. The soundtrack provides a great technique for building suspense that gets paid off with intense action scenes. This movie is a hell of a ride. It builds an amazing world that gets explored at break-neck speed. In some cases it's far too fast-paced to be bad. All of the faults with the film are steamrolled by the constant action. The fight scenes are brutal and unrelenting. The final showdown is a thing of pure eighties glory. I love it. It's a classic that should be enjoyed by everyone at least once! There's a reason that It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia loves it so much. The King Louis XIII paired really well with Lethal Weapon. It tasted so good, I ended up having an extra snapper or two. The cannabis had me feeling really relaxed and sunken into my couch. The uplifting effects had me alert and ready for the suspense of the action scenes, which were numerous. The effects were long lasting and are still prevalent when writing this review. Although it feels great, the taste and smell are the leading factors with this particular batch from Marley Natural.

253,shirleyfuller,Richard Donner has created a great buddy cop film that shall serve as a blueprint for all films in this subgenre.,7,19 August 2018,"Lethal Weapon is a fun, exciting movie that deserves its standing in the pantheon of great action films. Contrary to popular believe this film didn't make Mel Gibson a star- He already was one after Mad Max but it did make him a household name in the US. He and Danny Glover are amazing as the mismatched buddy cop duo and one can say Lethal Weapon restarted the sub genre after 48 hours had done so a few years ago. Featuring great sequences, dialogues worth remembering and great pace Lethal Weapon is a must watch.",Lethal Weapon
254,kaydentullett,A solid action film with believable forces of the law.,7,11 August 2019,"I honestly found this film while in need of a classic action film to want. Most action films today are contaminated with CGI and green screen - not to say these always make a film bad - and I needed to wind down with a film that relied more on strict and up close attention, rather than persistent back-at-the-studio editing and milked dry standstills.My positive attention was quickly brought over to the photography of this film, at least when it started up and playing. The most noticeable shots in this film are the wide-shots, which I complimented consistently for the beautiful shots of California and the plentiful buildings that stretch onwards. I - most notably - favoured the shots that captured the diversity of California, if anything, seeing as most films I've watched care more about focusing on the same wide-shot that is supposed to, at first, open the film; same day, time, setting - boring.The music was also diverse, much like the photography. Depending on a character's mood, an escalating situation, a rising trouble, the music and the instruments used to create said music moved forward with the deed of switching up their sounds. Instead of leaving us with the same strict genre of music, no matter the situation, Lethal Weapon would be sure to find the perfect sound to help its audience stay attentive to the situation taking place on their digital screens. The placements of music are what kept me focused on the intensifying actions scenes.The actors, even the ones likely being paid the least, were very exceptional throughout the duration of the film. Plenty of films forget to give even the minor characters a decent piece of dialogue - a common mistake that even I have made, so there's not necessarily serious harm. Throughout Lethal Weapon, I happened to find myself pleased over how every character had something to say in reference to the main characters and the crimes that had taken place and only continued to take place. This helped be seek more belief that I was watching a crime related film.The main characters belonged rightfully to both Danny Glover and Mel Gibson. Danny's performance triumphed multiple emotions successfully; Roger didn't want to feel old, which could be evident through the visible fear on his face. He boxed in a strong sense of justice, which could be evident in his more serious expression whenever Riggs performed a disagreeable act. Mel Gibson's inner craziness brought Riggs to life with his many expressions drifting from serious and psychopathic.The characters felt realistic, another success this film upholds. From the kids (despite bad acting), to the general family, to Riggs, to the police department, the way they all spoke and interacted with their environments were done in a way that made me forget I was watching a film at all. These traits aren't hard to miss, and I can assure you that you will have fun seeking these little hints during your watch.The villains were average to me. The actors did a great job at filling out their villainy, but I felt that the overworked use of bringing in helicopters, excessive amount of rifles and ridiculous accuracy when holding firearms weakened the form of action I was looking for. The film has its positive moments when it comes to the shootouts, but the scenes that burden the film are the ones that are too energetic when it comes to the mistake of provoking the word 'action' too far.I was informed that the comedy in this film was good, but I'd have to differ from that belief. Very few scenes got me smile, never mind laugh. I got a whiff at the lack of good comedy when I noticed that the genres for the film never contained comedy, even though the jokes are whacked there and there. If you've arrived to this film hoping for an action and comedy duo similar to that of 'Rush Hour', you're not going to find it here and would find more prosperity looking somewhere else.",Lethal Weapon
255,whatalad,Best action film ever!,10,18 January 2006,"This film is truly the greatest action film of all time, with only Die Hard and the other 'Lethal' sequels coming close. In these days of XXX and Bad Boys II, and The Island, thank god that action fans still can watch the real action movies, the kind that Hollywood simply doesn't make any more. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover make the perfect on-screen partnership, in my opinion it is the best ever seen. Throughour the 4 movies, their chemistry never fails. The direction is superb from Richard Donner and the screenplay by Shane Black is remarkable as it was his first movie script. Why this film has such a low rating is beyond me, it deserves and 8.5 at the very least. Any one who likes action films but hasn't seen this should do so because every action flick that you've enjoyed is thanks to the standard set by this 1987 CLASSIC.",Lethal Weapon

Two good Vietnam veteran cops cleaning up the streets of LA from drug dealing Vietnam vets and mercenaries. This movie was and still is one of the best action movies ever made. The chemistry between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson as Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs was the original (and still the best) template for many other buddy cop flicks to follow. I give major credit and would like to thank Richard Donner, Shane Black and Joel Silver for making this movie work on every level. I hope that one day these types of movies will return to the big screen again. I can only hope, since movies have become very unoriginal.",Lethal Weapon
257,SavingPrivateSam-ltq,A perfect blend of humor and action. Strongly recommended.(Spoilers),9,2 May 2008,"I watched Lethal Weapon in the theater when it first came out in 1987, it blew me away. I've never seen such a movie like that before, it had been copied for numerous times so it wouldn't be so appealing nowadays. I bought DVDs of the Lethal Weapon series. To me, this one still stands out as the best of the four. Its brilliance and luster retains even though I watch it in 2008. It certainly deserves to get at least one Oscar for the performance and some special effects but it was overlooked. One of the most eloquent evidence that proves the Academy Award is a joke.First, this movie starts with a aerial view of the city of Los Angeles. As the title ""Lethal Weapon"" appears, you get a feeling this is not only a cop movie but also an ultimate blockbuster. Later, the camera stops in the balcony. We see a half-naked woman lying on the bed, as if she is drowned or her high is coming up. However, she somehow climbs onto the balcony and takes a dive out of the building. Her death leads to an introduction of an middle-aged cop who is celebrating his birthday. His name is Murtaugh(played by Danny Glover), he is fifty years old when he takes this case. Later, he is informed he will be partnered with a cop named Riggs(played by Mel Gibson), only to find out the cop is suicidal because his wife was killed in a car accident a few years ago. First, the two cops detest each other very much. As time goes on, they become accustomed to each other and they stand together to fight against the bad guys of the movie. The bad guys are a bunch of veterans who become drug dealers by smuggling the heroin from Vietnam. Their leader is stern general and a macho guy named Joshua(played by Gary Busey), who is the top guy in the unit. All the actors were doing a great job and delivered believable, flesh-and-blood, and comical characters. Mel Gibson gave an outstanding performance as Riggs. His hardened exterior could not cover up the fragile interior of his. He was in a dilemma whether to kill himself or go on living. Danny Glover was also remarkable, he did everything ""by the book"", who could ever forget his characteristics: Shooting criminals in the leg and shooting people directly in the head. Gary Busey gave his best performance to date. This is one movie he ever immersed into his character. The action scenes were perfectly done. Almost two hours of non-stop action can satisfy action fans. Also, it can be considered a comedy to watch when you want to get rid of your burden. Also, some people have the tradition to watch it on Christmas. It can have different significance and interpretation reviewed by different people. Good story, good actors, crazy action, comical scenes, and significant masterpiece. This movie is a landmark of cop movies. 20 years and it still retains all these good elements. Strongly recommended for you to watch it.",Lethal Weapon

Martin Riggs(Mel Gibson) is a suicidal cop who never hesitate too throw himself into danger.

I won't do a review, because we have all seen it a million times, but this film is flawless. I now rate it above Die Hard, whereas before tonight Die Hard was higher on the ratings scale. The action is so believable and the characters have so much depth. Plus of course, the acting and directing and writing is sublime. The film also has immense heart. Fact.Riggs contemplating killing himself with the gun = Gibson acting genius11/10the schoolyard scene should never have been left out of the original film. Having Riggs kick off his law enforcement with the Xmas tree drug dealers did not show you the depths of his psychosis, depression and the power of his death wish. Though it is touched upon later with the trailer-gun-in-mouth-near-suicide scene, the school-yard REALLY drums it home! It sets a completely darker tone for the first two acts.

I am just going to make a short strong review of how great and iconicle this movie is.This movie, unlike 'Die Hard' has a real solid background-story. It's not some random tough-ass cop who breaks the law to make sure other's respect it. This is different. There's story of a cop who has lost an important person in his life and who has suicidal tendencies. The whole story is so well directed that the movie itself is a masterpiece. Not only because most 80's action movies are cheesy and have tons of unrealistic actionscenes. But because the humour, the sincerity and the action are all well balanced into a slightly touchy buddy-cop movie. An all-time well respected classic in its kind.",Lethal Weapon

273,AnApatheticGinger,It's aged. It's fun. It worth a watch.,6,28 May 2019,"This is a fun good cop, bad cop movie that hasn't aged too well. The characters are pretty fun and likable, and you can clearly see their motivations well. I really like Riggs' depression and suicide motif, and how that affects him in the first part of the movie. The villain was pretty fun too, although their history is a little weird and shaky with the Vietnam connection. The reason it's a little dated is just because of the situations they get themselves into. The dry lake action scenes feels very one-sides: it was two dudes against 20 and a helicopter, and the two dudes held their own. The torture scene was pretty okay as far as Riggs goes (with the electrical shock) but Murtagh was literally just have salt rubbed into wounds. Don't get me wrong, that's hurts, but compared to modern day torture scenes in movies it just seems comical. Finally, the last scene where a Riggs (a cop) bare knuckle fights the villain while 40 cops watch and Murtagh yells at them to stay back just feels... wrong? Silly? Completely out of character for a police department? It's good to show that Riggs has changed (because he didn't kill the dude, at first at least) but it just feels like that isn't at all what any sort of law enforcement would do. The suspension of disbelief in this wasn't needed in any enough in any other scenes, but was really needed in these. I will day though, the camera work is 👌🏻. It feels alive. The camera always seems to be moving, which is really cool. Furthermore, the focus on the DOF on some shots was sooo shallow, and even the ones in motion was crystal sharp. Really good shot selection. It was still fun, but it just felt a little dated.",Lethal Weapon

Are they made just to placate the dumb crowd, who wouldn't know real police activity if it jumped up and arrested them?

The sequels weren't up to much, but the number of copy-cat clones that Lethal Weapon has spawned are a tribute to its greatness. It isn't up there with Bullit and the like, but it has a great deal to offer. We all know the classic cop double-act - mistrust turns to reliance and friendship with a whole shedload of fast-quipping, gun-toting action along the way. But this film is difference. It has a very, very hard edge to it. The two leads, Gibson and Glover, are both exceptional, lifting this film above others of its ilk. The dynamic between them is...well, it makes this film a classic.In the sequels, Gibson's character lost his hard, living-on-the-fringe-of-sanity edge, which is a shame because in this first film, he really is crazy. His performance is, there's no denying it, moving, which is rare in a film like this.Anyone who hasn't seen this film should.

285,milt1996,classic,9,8 May 2013,"classic case, of two cops who are forced to work together and hate each other but tend to make a good match. Lots of action, a very good plot with some good twists but the interaction between the main characters was the best thing and turned out to be very funny. Even though it doesn't lose its seriousness that way, it reminds of the classic buddy cop series/movies of that era. For example starsky and hutch, tango and cash and so on. Generally a very good and enjoyable movie which keeps you interested and haves some cheesiness from the 80s. Mel Gibson is awesome as well, at first he did gave the impression of the main star but, Danny Glover, a new face to me, proved to be an interesting character and of almost equal importance to Mel Gibson, though the story is mainly built around his environment at start. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes cop movies filled with some good amount of high quality action.",Lethal Weapon
286,spunkyc78,Decent film!,5,30 January 2012,"Do things like magic really exist? Well, if you've seen Lethal Weapon - not only the greatest action comedy, but perhaps also the greatest movie of all time! - you should know that the answer to that question is YES. If you don't, it's very obvious that you need to see a doctor. And in case you for some incomprehensible reason haven't seen Lethal yet, I have only one thing to say: stop reading this comment and go rent it immediately!!! There's simply no logical excuse for anyone old enough NOT to see this brilliant movie.The Lethal Weapon series started out with this film back in 1987, starring the phenomenal Mel Gibson as psychotic loose cannon Martin Riggs and Danny Glover (truly wonderful as well) as his total opposite for a partner - family man and by-the-book police officer Roger Murtaugh.Murtaugh lives a happy life with his loving family in a friendly neighborhood and is planning to retire from the force. But on his 50th birthday his life takes off in a different direction when the daughter of an old friend from Vietnam jumps out from a window and dies. This incident tosses Murtaugh into a dangerous and twisted investigation. And as if that's not enough: he is also teamed up with a new partner - a burned-out lunatic named Martin Riggs, who's been leaning on the edge of suicide ever since his wife was killed in a car crash. Roger is shocked when he meets this ""lethal weapon"". These two cops only have two things in common: they're both Vietnam vets and they both hate working with partners.This is my all time favorite movie, because it gives you everything you could ever ask from a great flick: action, drama, suspense, and even love (without getting all sentimental). And if you love Mel Gibson (God, he used to be so beautiful!!)- like me - this is were he makes one of his strongest and most remarkable performances. Actually, I can hardly call it acting - he IS Riggs. The emotions he's going through is so evident in his eyes and so real and cuts right through your soul: you can actually feel his pain and his anger. And Mel also contributes a great deal to the humorous element of the film with his attitude, witty comments and eagerness of doing his job: ""Man, I love this job! Can we put the sirens on?"" Danny Glover is outstanding as Murtaugh and serves the audience a normal, middle-aged man who is fighting with his age, a daughter who's turning into a young woman and a partner who doesn't care whether he lives or dies. Danny's hilarious making those faces and throwing back at Mel! He plays his part with great sensitivity and I think he, just like Mel, gives so much life to his character that no other actor could have done it better. And together, he and Mel undoubtedly makes the best film team there was, is or ever will be! (The concept has been copied too many times, though..."" With the fantastic action, humor, performances and screenplay, Lethal Weapon and its sequels definitely top the list of all time action movies. Danny and Mel (naturally) won an award for ""best duo on screen"" on MTV Movie Awards once, and considering their work with these series, I believe director Richard Donner and producer Joel Silver makes the best duo OFF screen.I'm convinced this is a movie that not only action fans would enjoy watching, so I recommend it to everyone. This is a movie you can't afford to miss!",Lethal Weapon
287,farty-1,good stuff,7,25 June 2004,"best of the four films,i especially like the beginning of the movie for it being very dark with Riggs totally maniac,totally depressing,and i think that it even got better when they brought out the collectors edition on DVD with more scenes,most of them showing Riggs in the lowest conditions. I think its a movie that also worked because of the perfect combination(Mel Gibson,Danny Glover)they both did great acting and proved a great partnership. i still think that Richard Donner could still do another lethal weapon movie in the style of this first one and have Riggs covered in xxxx again,i don't know maybe his wife could die again..........",Lethal Weapon
288,Smoknjoeyc,Mel's Best Movie,9,26 February 2005,"Great action by Gibson and Glover along with Busey. Great acting by Gibson and a tremendous plot. It's interesting to see how one of my favorite actors(Mel Gibson) and one of my non-favorite actors(Danny Glover) team up in a cop movie and do a great job at it. Gary Busey plays Mr. Joshua, a mean an arrogant man who fights Gibson and Glover till it comes down to them killing Busey. Gary Busey does a great job at being a bad guy(Almost like Kevin Costner in 3000 Miles To Graceland). Overall, this movie shows how it is to be a cop and fighting the bad guys. This was one of the best cop/action movies I have ever seen. I rate this movie a an ********1/2 stars out of 10 stars.",Lethal Weapon

It really is a ""fantastic film"" with moments of ""pure joy"" and ""awesome action"" that will ""keep you at the edge of your seat/s"". I remember the first time I ever ""thoroughly enjoyed"" this film. I was a ""wee nipper"" back in ""the day"". I was ""sat"" on my ""own"" in the cinema (we used to call it ""the pictures"") and I watched it from the ""start"" to the ""very"" end. (including all of the credits, which were ""excellent"" too). Then I watched it when it came ""out"" on VHS (although we used to call it ""video"" - tsssh! How silly were we??) and I remember ""thoroughly enjoying"" it ""all over again"". Afterwards, I turned to my Monkey, ""Dave"" and said: ""You know what, Dave?"" (He doesn't say much back, ever, so I went on...) ""I ""thoroughly enjoyed"" watching that ""film"" (or was it ""movie"" I said??) ""all over"" ""again!""",Lethal Weapon
291,adamc75,I prefer Lethal Weapon to Die Hard!,10,8 January 2013,"The first time I watched Lethal Weapon, I liked it without thinking to much of it but after watching the sequels, I really wanted to see the first again. It is now possibly my favorite action movie. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) is a suicidal recluse and loose canon after the death of his wife while Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is a family man who just celebrated his 50th birthday and is a character most can relate to. They eventually get partnered up, neither of them wanting to work with the other as Riggs (Gibson) makes it clear that no one wants to work with him as some think he's faking the suicidal thing to draw a psycho pension and others believe he really is suicidal. They get sent to work on a case involving the suicidal of a prostitute who's father just so happens to be an old Vietnam war buddy of Murtaugh (Glover) and is involved in a heroin-smuggling operation which leads to some top-notch action. As I said, I am one of a few people who prefer this movie to Die Hard as an action Christmas movie.",Lethal Weapon

294,boksefrede,Two very different cops team up to investigate the murder of a young woman.,9,29 May 2015,"Best Quote: I'm too old for this sh*t. - Murtaugh Pros: Gibson and Glover are perfectly cast as the two cops, who initially hate each other but end up forming a strong bond of friendship. The chemistry between the characters is really what carries the movie, and the dialog is very fresh and entertaining. The action is decent and often very imaginative – especially in the scene were Riggs is pretending to buy coke at a Christmas tree vendor. The characters are all really fleshed out and you totally buy them as real people. It is impossible not to like Riggs and Murtaugh.Cons: given that most of the story focuses on the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh, the rest of the plot ends up feeling a bit secondary, and the villains are only okay.Sentence: Lethal Weapon is easily the best buddy-cop movie of all time, and Gibson and Glover are perfect for each other. It is a movie that you can always watch and that never gets boring. 5/6.",Lethal Weapon
295,maryumbibi,A really solid enjoyable buddy cop film,7,18 May 2021,"First time watch of one of the iconic buddy cop films next to rush hour and red heat. Whilst I went in with low expectations and not expecting to enjoy it much yet surprisingly I enjoyed it a-lot more then I expected.The first thing I really liked is the chemistry and dialogue between the two iconic duo. They both really sell their performance and make something really special between their chemistry which made their friendship really believable. Their dialogue is where I got the most laughs seeing them have those conversations had moments which genuinely made me laugh and smirk at some of the jokes in the film. The action itself was definitely well done with some die hard like action that I really enjoyed watching. And some of the side characters I really like and seeing their interactions and dialogue between the two main protagonists was really entertaining. And at times this movie can be pretty serious which for a comedy is kind of rare to find from the opening to Mel Gibsons break down in the caravan is definitely really dark and pretty tense too.However the movie does suffer at times with it's pretty uninteresting villains that the two main characters have to take down. I found those moments pretty uninteresting and just wished the movie would get back to the two main characters quickly. And the final climax did drag on a little too long.Overall this was a fun, entertaining and really enjoyable buddy cop film that has great characters and likeable protagonists in a really good blend of serious and comedic moments. It's not Shane Blacks best work but he still did a good job with the writing in this film.",Lethal Weapon
