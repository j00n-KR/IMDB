0,TheLittleSongbird,A good idea that doesn't work,3,29 October 2011,"The idea was great, interesting, somewhat weird and stomach-churning. But the movie doesn't live up to it. There are some good things aside from this idea, I liked the stylistic nods to Hitchcock and Kubrick, the camera work and lighting are good and while he occasionally resorts to cartoon villainy Dieter Laser has many moments where he is genuinely chilling. Against all this, the story is very predictable and lacking in suspense. Despite the premise, it is actually fairly light on gore and gruesome scenes and this diminished the suspense levels for me. The direction has a lot of style but not a lot of substance, technically the film is assured but the characters are stock and the remainder of the other acting is uninspired. The Human Centipede is a very poorly written movie in my opinion with dully written and delivered dialogue and big, obvious and unforgivable medical errors. Overall, has a good idea but bad dialogue, a lack of suspense and a dull story stop it from being any more effective. 3/10 Bethany Cox",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
1,Leofwine_draca,Foul,1,4 January 2016,"THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE (FIRST SEQUENCE) is probably the most awful film I can think of that's famed for its notoriety. The whole concept of the film is some huge gross-out thing about a mad scientist creating a human centipede out of some unwilling test subjects, and that's all there is to it.It's not enough material to sustain a genuine running time, so we get lots of dull scenes elsewhere. There are random murders, some scenes of over-acting, repetitive escapes and captures, and some bad acting on the part of the participants. The whole 'human centipede' stuff is played for maximum revulsion with some truly gross moments that are designed to test the strength of one's stomach.It's not that this film is extremely gory, because it isn't; it's just that the concept is so off-putting that it's hard to think about it without being repulsed. I guess that's the hook. In any case, as a film it's a complete failure, the worst type of 'torture porn' that I can think of, and I hated every moment of it.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
2,Horst_In_Translation,Appreciate the absurdity,8,29 July 2015,"""The Human Centipede"" is a Dutch (don't worry: the language is mostly English) 90-minute film from over five years ago. The director and writer is Tom Six and his films pretty much always get bad reviews. This one is no exception. However, among horror fans this film was appreciated enough for Six to make several sequels. The title already gives you a very basic idea of what it is about. An insane surgeon scientist plans to turn several humans into a human centipede. Now I read on several occasions that people criticize the acting. In my opinion, that is simply wrong. Nobody in here acted badly and I thought the Japanese actor's performance right before his suicide was pretty brilliant. The girls and the police officers weren't bad either. The former are pretty much crawling around for over 50% of the film anyway and the policemen have very little screen time towards the end, so it's almost impossible for them to destroy the film even if they had acted badly, which they did not in my opinion. The main antagonist is played by Dieter Laser and there is a reason why he has had a successful career for many decades. He simply is pretty talented and the way he portrays this lunatic is absolutely spot-on. Also there is some nice writing to his character. How he crawls up after being attacked at the end or how he shows up behind the curtain in one scene, all of it fits and Laser is simply outstanding here in every regard, also the way he talks. His character's name is Heiter and there is quite some irony to that as ""heiter"" is the German adjective for cheerful.Horror films are usually measured about how creepy they are and this one is absolutely creepy. Many of these films stand and fall with the portrayal of the villain and this one is top-notch. Yes it is pretty absurd, disgusting and repulsive, but I can't see how that makes it a bad film. It is a great drama movie, thriller and, most of all, horror movie. There are even some emotional moments in here like at the end when the girls hold each other's hands before one of them is about to die. And pay attention to the significance of the number three in this film. Of course, there are three people in the centipede, but there are also three people near the swimming pool in the end and all of them die. This is not a piece of bad writing. There are several smart references in here and Six's direction was also well done for the most part, especially with the way he directed Laser. Oh yeah and Ashlynn Yennie is pretty hot I have to say. This was the third time I think that I watched this film and it is still at least as scary as the first viewing, which is always a good sign that it stays an exciting watch even if you know the ending. Of course, this is not a film for easily offended people, but those who can deal with rough content should enjoy this watch. The most disgusting scene for me was probably when we see the pus coming out of one of the girls' faces. That was pretty heavy stuff. So yeah, if you watched ""Tusk"" not too long ago, this film here takes a similar path, although a less comedic one for the most part. Still, there are scenes when you have to smile. I highly recommend ""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)"". I have not seen Six's other films, but this certainly made me curious, even if I would be very surprised if they are as good as his work here. Thumbs up.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
3,claudio_carvalho,"Gruesome, Repulsive and Excessive Black Humor, but also an Original Trash Movie",6,13 August 2011,"The New Yorkers Lindsay (Ashley C. Williams) and Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie) are on vacation traveling through Europe. In Germany, they meet a waiter that invites them to go to a party in the nightclub Bunker. They rent a car but they get lost in a lonely road in the woods. When they have a flat tire, they do not replace the tire and prefer to seek for help instead. They reach a house and they are received by the sociopath mad scientist Joseph Heiter (Dieter laser) that drugs them. When Lindsay and Jenny awake, they find that they are tied to a bed in a laboratory in the basement of the house. Sooner, Dr. Heiter brings the Japanese tourist Katsuro ( Akihiro Kitamura) and introduces himself as a former surgeon specialized in separating Siamese twins. Further, he exposes his insane project of creating the human centipede, joining three human beings through the mouths and anuses.""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)"" is a gruesome and repulsive film with excessive black humor (and bad taste), but also an original trash movie. After the polemic in Brazil with ""A Serbian Film"", I have decided to see several polemic films to see how far directors and writers dare to go. ""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)"" is nasty, but not nastier than, for example, Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salò o le 120 Giornate di Sodoma"" that is considered ""art-film"" by the professional critics. When Dr. Heiter orders Katsuro to feed Lindsay, I have almost vomited but I was warned before seeing this film and I had to option of not watching it. But despite the heavy hand of the director, I did not dislike this insane film. Actually I prefer films like this than those that are predictable and full of clichés. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Centopéia Humana"" (""The Human Centipede"")",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
4,kosmasp,And now for something completely different ...,3,25 October 2009,"Depending on how much impact something new, never before seen, has on your voting, you might rate this higher (or enjoy it more), as have some fellow watchers at the Fright Fest. Hence their voting and some of the comments here on IMDb. But no movie is complete, without someone looking at the other side of the shield/coin and point out some bad stuff about this movie.First of all, not everybody did ""enjoy"" this movie at Fright Fest (enjoy is the wrong word to begin with). Apart from the really cool idea(s) and the fact, that it is medically accurate (according to the director, who told us just that after the movie was over), there are quite a few things wrong with the movie.I'll start with the story, that has quite some flaws. There are the usual horror flaws (scenes not making sense etc.). I'll accept that, but the movie should either have been shorter or have some ""meat"" (no pun intended) to flesh it out more (that's story for you).The actors aren't really up for the task either. There is especially one scene, where one of the actors has a breakdown, which is unbearable (to watch) ... and not in a good sense. The German actors are the ones, that might throw you off completely though. Especially if you do understand them, you can see how ham their acting is. Which is pretty disturbing (again not in a good sense).Having said all that, the movie was successful enough, to spawn a ""sequel"". Although judging from the title and if I remember correctly, that will be the ""real"" version, the director wanted to make to begin with. And now he has the money to do so ... so maybe this new version (announced for 2010), will actually be really good! We'll see ...",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
5,gavin6942,Not as Offensive As You Might Expect,7,31 October 2011,"A mad scientist (Dieter Laser) kidnaps and mutilates a trio of tourists in order to reassemble them into a new ""pet""-- a human centipede, created by stitching their mouths to each others' rectums.Well, the hype for this film made it sound absolutely repulsive. And, frankly, it just is not that bad. For a film that features defecating into another person's mouth, it is as tame as could possibly be expected.I found it to be an above average horror flick, with a nice nod to Nazi experiments (subtle but not too subtle, obvious but not too obvious). And the use of isolation when the two main characters do not speak German, and another character does not speak German or English! I would gladly watch this film again.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
6,lee_eisenberg,united we are one,5,27 March 2011,"How to describe ""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)""? If nothing else, it's an original idea. There have been a few horror flicks whose sole purpose was to see how much the audience would watch -- think ""Saw"" -- but this goes one further, with a maniacal surgeon (Dieter Laser) stitching three people together to create what he calls a human centipede. The shock factor is simply in the concept, since there's not much in the way of gore.As can be expected with these flicks, the victims (Ashley Williams and Ashlynn Yennie) are given totally unrealistic lines, but no one watches these movies to see great acting. Overall, I'd say that the movie is worth seeing only if you're willing to watch some gruesome stuff. Also starring Akihiro Kitamura.PS: Although you might have never heard of Dieter Laser, it sounds as though he's been well known in Germany for a while, having won a German Film Award for Best Actor for ""John Glückstadt"" (I'm going to have to see that one).",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
7,jboothmillard,The Human Centipede (First Sequence),6,20 October 2010,"I had heard many people tell me that this was the possibly the sickest film ever made, so I was very interested to see if that would be my opinion as well, from director Tom Six, who apparently worked on the Dutch version of Big Brother, where it first began. Basically two pretty and ditsy American girls, Lindsay (Ashley C. Williams) and Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie), start a road trip across Europe, and they get a flat tyre in the middle of the night. They start walking into the woods looking for help, they find the isolated villa house of German surgeon Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser), he fakes calling assistance for the girls and drugs their drinks of water. When they wake up, Lindsay and Jenny have been tied down in a makeshift hospital ward in the Doctor's basement, there is a Japanese tourist, Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura), as well. Dr. Heiter explains that he used to be a successful surgeon that separated Siamese twins, but he has a plan to do almost the opposite, to stitch the three victims together in a medically possible experiment, to become the human centipede. Katsuro is the front, Lindsay's mouth with teeth pulled out is stitched to Katsuro's anus, Jenny also with teeth pulled out has her mouth stitched to Lindsay's anus, and all have their knees whittled a bit to make crawling easier. The three ""patients"" wake up as the completed Doctor's sick fantasy creation, the human centipede, their gastric systems have been connected, and for a little while Katsuro as the front refuses the Doctor's few demands. Obviously Katsuro does eat some food fed to him, like a dog in a bowl, and of course when it comes to the need to defecate, the excrement has to pass through the next body, forcing Lindsay to swallow it. The Doctor watches stuff like this with great delight, but he is irritated by the three victims' constant screaming of misery and pain, and Jenny is dying of blood poisoning. Soon enough two policemen, Detective Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Detective Voller (Peter Blankenstein), have found the villa and question the Doctor about the two tourists' disappearance, they suspect that the Doctor has issues and secrets, so they leave for a little while. The three victims attempt to make their escape, stabbing Dr. Heiter and biting his neck, but Katsuro decides to cut his own neck with a piece of broken glass. At this point the police have returned for Dr. Heiter, Kranz is shocked to see both the three victims, and Voller dead in the swimming pool, and after being fatally wounded he does manage to shoot the Doctor right between the eyes. The end is simply Lindsay and Jenny still alive in their hideous state, and they hold each other's hands, but Jenny dies from the blood poisoning, and Lindsay is left crying with two dead bodies connected to her. Laser has a real Christopher Walken look about him, with his jaw line and similar eyes, he is a little like a cartoon villain, but certainly very chilling. It is certainly sick to see people stitched together in the way they are, even if you don't see the bloody operation, and a girl forced to swallow excrement is sick, but I've seen sicker films than this, it is a not bad horror thriller. Good!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
8,Woodyanders,"A very strong, bleak, and upsetting horror shocker",8,19 December 2012,"Crazed and merciless reclusive misanthrope German surgeon Dr. Heiter (a supremely creepy and unnerving performance by Dieter Laser) plans to attach three people together mouth to anus so he can make his own ghastly approximation of a human centipede. Writer/director Tom Six certainly doesn't punk out on the unflinching cruelty, depravity, and perversity of the central premise: He expertly crafts a dark, grim, and nihilistic mood that really gets under the viewer's skin while delivering plenty of squirm-inducing moments and sparing absolutely none of the abject pain, terror, misery, and suffering felt by the hapless recipients of this deplorable endeavor. Indeed, the queasy and uncomfortable atmosphere potently projects a jarring feeling of unblinking sadism and utter hopelessness right to the devastating downbeat end. Worst of all, Heiter carries out his abhorrent experiment simply because he can. In fact, Heiter rates highly as one of the single most cold, chilling, and remorseless villains in modern horror history. In addition, his titular creation is truly grotesque and revolting (watch out for the infamously disgusting ""Feed her!"" scene!). Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie, and Akihiro Kitamura are convincing as Heiter's unwilling and unfortunate patients. Goof de Koning's polished cinematography provides an appropriately stark look. The spare shivery score by Patrick Savage and Holeg Spies does the spine-tingling trick. Special kudos are also in order for the remarkably vile and persuasive make-up f/x. Icky and unpleasant for sure, but still undeniably effective and unsettling just the same.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
9,BA_Harrison,Will leave you squirming!,8,5 November 2010,"I honestly thought that nothing else I'd see this year could even come close to A Serbian Film for sheer outrageousness, but The Human Centipede, from writer director/warped genius Tom Six, has gone and proved me wrong: they don't get much more disgusting (or funny, if your sense of humour is more than a tad twisted) than this sick little puppy.Dieter Laser plays Dr. Heiter, an eminent German surgeon renowned for his work in separating conjoined twins; now retired, Heiter has a new goal in life—to create a 'human centipede' by surgically joining several unwilling victims 'ass to mouth'. Obviously, such an experiment leads to some rather unsettling moments, not least the stomach-churning moment when the 'head' of the centipede announces that he needs to do a dump—straight into the mouth of the poor woman behind him!It's not all 'disgusting for disgusting's sake' however: in addition to the totally revolting nature of his film's central experiment, Mix also manages to create an incredible sense of tension, both early on as his female victims wander unsuspectingly into the demented surgeon's lair, and later when the 'centipede' makes a desperate bid for freedom. Of course, this being an utterly depraved piece of cinema, all does not end well—the finalé is an absolutely gob-smacking downer designed to leave viewers stunned!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
10,paul_haakonsen,"Great concept idea, mediocre movie...",5,11 August 2013,"I must say that I had expected something more from this movie as all people said it was so gross, disturbing and twisted. Well, hardly so, there are far more disturbing movies out there. ""The Human Centipede"" wasn't that bad.Sure the concept idea of connecting three individuals together in that matter is twisted, but it hardly qualified to be as gross as people made it out to be. The concept idea was interesting, as bizarre as it was, but it just never made it up beyond mediocrity.The story is about two American girls, Lindsay (played by Ashley C. Williams) and Jenny (played by Ashlynn Yennie) who is traveling across Europe. They are on their way to a party in Germany when their car breaks down with a flat tire, and they seek shelter at a nearby house that belongs to Dr. Heiter (played by Dieter Laser). The not-so-good doctor drugs the Americans and makes them part of his insane ambition to make a human centipede.I will say that the story progressed nicely at a good pace, and there were some great moments throughout the movie. But this movie doesn't really gross out the audience, and the shock value of what is going on is fairly tame compared to other movies out there.The movie was nicely acted, and Dieter Laser was really the one carrying the movie with the stereotypical maniacal doctor who wants nothing else but to make inhuman experiments. Dieter Laser's character Dr. Heiter also had the best comment in the entire movie; ""I don't like human beings"". And I guess it must have been some challenge for Akihiro Kitamura, Ashlynn Yennie and Ashley C. Williams to spend most of the movie on their hands and knees, together face to rear part.Despite its predictable story, and lack of a shocking value, then ""The Human Centipede"" was a good enough movie. The movie had potential for something more disturbing, but the end result was mediocre, yet watchable.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
11,Coventry,"A Human Centipede? But, of course! Why didn't I think of that?",7,18 April 2010,"I'm really glad and thankful there exist such as thing as Fantastic Film Festivals. Where else would you be offered the opportunity to watch sick-spirited and repulsive independent flicks like ""The Human Centipede"" on a big cinema screen? This is truly the type of movie that would never reach video stores or even e-bay and is directly intended for the international festival circuit. This film, commonly known already under its abbreviation THC, is everything you could possibly expect from a midnight crowd shocker/pleaser and then some! The plot and its main character are completely over-the-top absurd, the depiction of gore is gratuitous and nauseating and the tone of the movie is continuously surreal. It's the type of film where you are practically forced to think stuff like ""what kind of sick and depraved human mind could possibly have come up with such a horror concept"". The answer: Dutch born writer/director Tom Six. ""The Human Centipede"" starts out like approximately ten thousand other horror movies already did before. Two American girls traveling across Europe get lost with their rental car in a remote German backwoods area. It's the middle of the night and naturally their mobile phones don't detect any signals. Obviously you expect them to end up in a type of torture hostel or in the dungeon of a deranged inbred hillbilly family, but no. They end up at the luxurious mansion of the highly respected medical surgeon Dr. Heiter. The good Dr. is retired but still very obsessively working on his life-long ambition: to create the very first unnatural human Siamese triplets! But simply attaching three people together isn't good enough, however, as he wants them to function as a centipede! Here's how this works in three simple steps: 1) you capture three persons and remove their kneecaps so that they can't stand up anymore. 2) You attach the mouth of the second person to the arse of the first person and the mouth of the third person to the arse of the second person. 3) You connect the obligatory intestines and organs to each other so that persons two and three nourish on the excreta of person one. Does all that sound slightly disgusting, inhuman and revolting? Well, it is actually. Needless to say movies like ""The Human Centipede"" are only intended for a very select audience. How can you possibly legitimize your motivations for watching a movie that depicts three people agonizing and undergoing humiliation for no reason other than an irrational and implausible (but apparently anatomically attainable) medical experiment? I usually say that I'm constantly looking for new horror and cult movies that go far beyond expectancy patterns and commonly used themes. ""The Human Centipede"" definitely fits into that category, what with its sickening footage and utterly despicable insinuations. The true star of the film is undoubtedly Dieter Lasser, who gives a marvelously grotesque performance as the dedicated Dr. Heiter. I've seen quite a bit of mad scientist portrayals in my years as a horror fanatic, but Lasser could easily be described as the ultimate stereotype for this role. He's a sneering German (obviously) psychopath with dementia in his eyes and Nazi echoes in his voice.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

13,Theo Robertson,Dinner Is Served,6,2 September 2013,"It's always difficult for a film maker to entice a potential audience in to the cinema . You can imagine the producers of this Euro chiller scratching their chins pulling out all the traditional horror elements and ticking the checklist Two female protagonists . Check Their car breaks down on a remote road at night . Check There's a nearby house . Check The home dweller is a friendly man . Check Too friendly . Check He's a raving sadist . Check So the producers then try and do something a little bit different . Not quite torture porn in the way HOSTEL was this film was no less controversial but slightly better simply because it does try and do something different with the horror formula combining clichéd convention with body horror . Since it's also set in Germany with a mad doctor who has the forename Josef you can see it's making a political statement that sometimes if human amorality is given too much free rein it can end in obscene sadism . That said it's a film that is somewhat restrained . Of course the premise is rather distressing , especially when the result of the experiment is revealed to the audience , but equally there's little in the way of explicit gore and the director Tom Six concentrates far more on the psychological horrors of the narrative",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
14,poolandrews,No other film quite like it...,6,26 March 2011,"The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is set in Germany & starts as two friends & American tourists Lindsay (Ashley G. Williams) & Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie) are making their way to a nightclub, the car they are driving gets a flat tyre in the middle of some woods & while searching for help the pair become hopelessly lost. The friends think they have found safely when they come across a house owned by sinister German surgeon Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser) who invites them both into his house with the promise of calling for help but drugs the two girls. When Lindsay & Jenny regain consciousness Dr. Heiter explains that he plans to use them in a sickening experiment to create a human Centipede, Heiter plans to surgically graft three people together with the mouth & anus being the connecting points. The third person in the Centipede is the Japanese tourist Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura), in his basement surgery Dr. Heiter completes the experiment & the world's first human Centipede is created...This Dutch production was written, produced & directed by Tom Six, this is a film that has gained a fair amount of notoriety & even my casual friends who aren't interested in anything other than big budget Hollywood blockbusters have heard of it, hell The Human Centipede (First Sequence) was even reviewed in the national press over here with surprisingly balanced views which is an achievement on it's own considering how they usually look down on such films. One cannot discuss The Human Centipede (First Sequence) without mentioning just how twisted & sick it is, while what you actually see on screen isn't that graphic the ideas & story in the film is just perverse & I could see many people having a hard time watching this. Apparently the film came about from a joke made by Six about sewing the mouth's of child molester's to a fat truck driver's bum as punishment & to be honest the entire film revolves around this one single idea, the gross idea of someone's mouth being sewn to someone else's anus & the rather messy & disgusting implication's that scenario entails. At a little under 90 minutes the character's are minimal, hell neither Lindsay or Jenny can say anything once they are attached & the film takes place almost entirely in Deiter's house, he is given no real motivation other than he is carry out some sort of sick personal experiment that has no obvious benefit. Deiter has no deep motivation or silly plan, he is doing this simply because he wants to, nothing more & nothing less. If nothing else The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a unique film, it's a memorable film & it's a film that isn't ashamed of what it is, in fact it revels in it's twisted plot like when Katsuro can't stop himself from defecating after Lindsay has been sewn onto his anus & Dr. Heiter encourages him by shouting 'feed her!' in another scene many may find unpleasant to say the least. The ending is a bit loose, things feel a bit rushed & unfinished but apparently this was always meant to be the first of two parts.The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is extremely well made, it has great, crisp, clean photography & none of the horribly dark, shaky hand-held camcorder headache inducing crap seen in a lot or recent horror films & there's none of that machine gun editing either, everything is clear & totally understandable. It's never explained quite how Dr. Heiter manages to transport the human Centipede from his basement to the upstairs which is an apparent plot hole when at the end the human Centipede tries to escape & it becomes obvious just how difficult it would be to move the thing about. There's not that much actual gore here, there's a slit throat, some gunshot wounds, a few brief surgery scenes & a bit of blood splatter. The film has a deliberately clean & sterile look, Dr. Heiter's house is minimalist chic with clean lines & light colours, the plainness & cleanliness of the visuals is nicely at odds with some of the grotesque images shown.With a supposed budget of about $1,500,000 this has really good production values & is well made, it definitely looks like a proper film anyway. Although set in Germany this was filmed in the Netherlands. A Dutch production, set in Germany with English, German & Japanese dialogue. The acting is pretty good, Dieter Laser is just a bizarre mix of creepy, weird & mad while having a sort of Nazi attitude going.The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a memorable film, it's a gross & disgusting films that loves the idea of people's mouth's being sewn to someone else's anus so they can eat their excrement which will revolt many but in that sense I think the film is a total success. I quite liked it's twisted & rather disgusting central premise, it's certainly well made enough & has enough going on to warrant a watch.

15,dbborroughs,One joke film goes nowhere,2,1 May 2010,"One joke horror film about a doctor who sews three people together mouth to anus...well kind of. He does it because he can. It serves no purpose...and once it created it just kneels there.Ultimate artificially created cult horror film is sure to split the horror community since some are going to find it cool in some form while most are going to find it really stupid.I find it really stupid.What the heck did IFC think when they picked it up? Sure they'll make some cash but there's a limit since the number of suckers liable to pony up will be small. Most will borrow it from friends. then again many will be like me and get it on IFC in Theaters for potentially no extra cash.Plot holes? There are chasms.The centipede is just three people on their hands and knees with faces in butts and once the centipede is created about half way into the film it doesn't do anything it just sits there because its so stupid its impossible to do anything with it beyond ""creating"" it. (Seriously for 95% of its screen time it just sits there) Its trying to be funnier than scary, I mean teaching the centipede to fetch? but at the same time why? Worse its got long dull scenes where nothing happens.Its a ten minute film stretched to 90 minutes. Seriously, as a ten minute film in an anthology of body horror films this would have been chilling. As a 90 minute horror film is a snoozer.How they are getting a sequel when everyone is pretty much dead at the end is beyond me.A rip off.A waste of time.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
16,zardoz-13,A Macabre Butt-Munch Masterpiece!!!,4,21 October 2010,"Wow, talk about a bad night in Dr. Frankenstein's hospital emergency room! This immaculate filth about a mad surgeon who earned a prestigious reputation for separating Siamese twins decides to reverse the process. ""Gay in Amsterdam"" director Tom Six has gone on record as saying: ""I get a rash from too much political correctness. I love it when films dare to have politically incorrect ideas."" Appropriately enough, nothing in ""The Human Centipede--First Sequence"" remotely qualifies as politically correct, including its truly warped ending. Nevertheless, Six displays signs of judicious restraint throughout this horror chiller. Spilled blood is held to a minimum until the final shoot-out scene between the police and the mad surgeon in his spacious pool room. Six prefers to leave some of his ghoulishness to the imagination. Not surprisingly, Six worships the work of David Cronenberg and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Although nothing lunges off the screen at you, this unearthly film could be aptly described as the ultimate 3-D movie: degrading, disgusting, and depraved. The actor who portrays the mad surgeon, Dieter Laser, looks like the offspring of Lance Henriksen and Benjamin Pratt, but he never goes over-the-top. Laser definitely has a career in horror movies with his creepy looks. Unfortunately, the two American tourists--actresses Ashley C. Williams and Ashlynn Yennie--are bimbos played by bimbos. Mind you, they are playing cookie-cutter stereotypes. Akihiro Kirtamura fare better as the Japanese tourist Katsuro, but how do you list this on your thespian portfolio. ""Yes, I played the part of a woman who had her knees mutilated so I had to crawl around on my hands and my mouth--with most of my teeth removed--was grafted onto the anus of the actor or actress in front of me.""Nobody is remotely sympathetic in this ghoulish saga, and you'll find yourself either vomiting or giggling uncontrollably because it is so audaciously sick. The scene where the mad surgeon describes to the victims who he has shanghaied what he plans to do to them anticipates the worse to come. Miraculously, one of the gals escapes and scrambles around Dr. Josef Heiter's clean residence. Of course, the howling mad surgeon pursues her with his sedation rifle and warns her that he will extract her teeth without anesthesia and put her in the middle between the crazy Japanese guy and her girlfriend. The first third of ""The Human Centipede"" shows Dr. Heiter hunting a prospective candidate for his human centipede. As he sits in his car alongside a road and waits for somebody to pull over near him, Heiter gazes fondly at his three Rotweillers that he grafted together as one. A bowel-challenged trucker pulls off the road to void himself in the wilderness, and the diabolical Dr. Heiter follows him on foot and shoots him with a dart filled with a drug that knocks him out. Later, two clueless American tourists, Lindsay (Ashley C. Williams of ""Willow"") and Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie of ""2009 Evan and Gareth Are Trying to Get Laid""), get lost searching for a nightclub and wind up in the middle of nowhere. They blow a front tire, and decide to traipse off into the woods after a fat, slimy pervert tries to help them. They wind up at Dr. Heiter's villa, and he invites them inside, fakes a phone call to a car repair technician and hands them glasses of chilled water with rohypnol, the date rape drug, in them. When they awaken after the hideous surgery, they have been grafted to each other at the anus and they cannot stand up. Kindly Dr. Heiter feeds them--or at least the first one--from a dog bowl and keeps them locked up at night in a long canine cage. Eventually, a pair of leather-clad, gray-haired German cops come knocking on his door and all hell breaks loose, including the human centipede. Interestingly enough, Six says he was inspired to make this film while he was watching a television program about child molesters with his friends. He suggested the heinous child molester should have his mouth grafted to the buttocks of a fat man. Six scores major points for taking us where nobody wants to go. Moreover, he is preparing a sequel that will surpass this monstrosity.

I figured the movie can't be too bad if they made two sequels. How wrong I was.This movie was dreadful. The very concept makes no sense--making a centipede out of people. A wack job surgeon in Germany literally makes a centipede out of three strangers--mouth to anus (yes, so digest that for a second). This movie had no point, no substance, no nothing but a disgusting mutation created by a German Michael Shannon look alike. My stomach is still turning after seeing two women and a man stitched together in one of the most abominable creations ever conceived. They may have been terrible actors but they didn't deserve that. And you can imagine just how few lines the two ladies had considering they were the tail end of the centipede.This movie is for you if: 1.) you have a strong stomach. 2.) You like horror. 3.) You like seeing people being horrifically morphed into different creatures. 4.) Acting and plot don't matter.Don't look for scares, don't look for a story line, heck--don't even look to make sense of it all. Just look to cringe and turn pale and/or green.

19,morrison-dylan-fan,Have a chow down on this...,8,8 May 2011,"During one night late last year,I was searching round the TV channels to find something that was even mildly interesting on.When I got to Channel 4,I noticed that they were showing a terrible ""comedy"" panel show called You Have Been Watching.Just before I changed the channel,it was announced on the program that they were going to show a ""surprise"" teaser for an upcoming film,which the presenter said looks like ""One of the most insane,out-their ideas,that had somehow been made into a film"". Whilst the program showed that all of the panelist had been stunned into silence by the teaser,the opposite had actually occurred with me.From the moment the last ten seconds of the teaser showed why the film is named The Human Centerpede,I knew that this was a film that I had to track down.After I found the film being sold on Amazon UK,I went round to my friends house to watch it with him.just as the film started to begin,I made sure to warn my friend that he should get himself prepared for something that will be very hard to forget.View on the film:
Although writer/director Tom Six only has one joke,it packs one hell of a punchline.For the first hour of this excellent film Six creates moments of pure jet-black comedic Horror from his bonkers idea. Although most of the film is surprisingly not that bloody,Tom Six instead builds up a strong feeling of dread,with the ""meal time"" scene being chillingly disturbing.For the last half an hour of the film,Tom Six drops the ball slightly by adding a last minute subplot,which leads to one of the victims acting in a manner that they would not have done during the intense first hour.Thankfully whilst the last part of the screenplay lets the film down a bit,the cast are able to keep the films intensity level high for the whole running time.Although the victims faces are mostly not see able,due to two of them having their face sewed up onto each others rectum,each of the cast members are brilliant at making the strong feelings of pain and hopelessness walk across the screen.
Final view on the film:A very original,horror film,which is filled with lots of disturbing moments that will stay in your head for days.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

In Germany, they end up alone at night with a broken car in the woods. They search for help and find an isolated villa. The next day, they awaken to find themselves trapped in a terrifying makeshift basement hospital along with a Japanese man. An older German man identifies himself as a retired surgeon specialised in separating Siamese twins. However, his three ""patients"" are not about to be separated but joined together in a horrific operation.....This film has such an amazing cult following already, i had to see it to see what all the fuss was about. And after seeing it, i was sorely disappointed.The premise is excellent, such a bizarre character in the doctor, one of the most sick characters i have seen on screen, and his explanation of the procedure is maniacal, bordering on genius, but than it just becomes very boring and very slow.Reading that people walked out because of the content, i couldn't see why they would do that, it's not gory or sadistic at all, the ideas are, and a lot of it is left to the imagination, but on screen, it's pretty tolerable stuff considering.This is probably why it's called the first sequence, the first sequence being him explaining his work. The full sequence could be the whole procedure. Maybe.The house is nice and unsettling, the acting is average, but not awful, but after the are joined together, it becomes lost, as if the director is thinking what to do.There's a short monologue from one of the victims near the end, but it doesn't make up for the very disappointing final third.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
21,trashgang,the best from the Netherlands,9,12 October 2010,"God, what was I afraid to watch this hyped flick. Reviews in all kind of horror magazines and people fussing about it how good it could be or how bad it was. But after a while my really good geeks on the net and in the flesh told me, well, it's worth watching. I did and...I was stunned. First of all, it's made by for many an unknown director coming out, of all places, Netherland. Most movies coming from there are mostly about sex. I won't give titles but I guess you know them. Then the actors. The retired surgeon is played by German actor Dieter Laser. I don't know the guy but he performed in a lot of German flicks and series but man, his face, his performance. It all worked so well. But the centipede itself, Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie and Akihiro Kitamura they give the best they could, they have just played in 4 flicks so are also really unknown. But what a performance. The way it has been filmed is also a trown back to old school horror. No fast movements, no tricky steady cam shots, just slow pans and tilts. And it worked so well. The score did work also, no bombastic orchestra or London philharmonic. So easy but so effective (like it did for the Last House on The Left remake). I was locked in my seat from the first minute until the last one. Some reviewers stated that it was made just to shock, well, being a geek in the genre it wasn't for the shocking it was made, it's just a brutal flick. If you want to be shocked go watch An Serbian Film. The blood flows, it's disgusting sometimes, even gory, surely not for the squeamish. And let me say, there is nudity in it but you won't be attracted to the titties, I can give you that. Great movie, no happy end, looking forward for part 2.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

23,StevePulaski,Pick your poison,1,7 August 2011,"Once you get past the idea of the centipede, and the fact this crazed, demented doctor is laughing at these people's torture, the film becomes a one-note joke. This reminds me of Rubber, a film to this day I am still mixed on. I love the fact that that film chose to pursue its own direction, but once again, it was ruined by having a love affair with itself. For some reason, I'm a fan of a film with a killer tire over a film with an inane creation. It's like if someone asked you ""would you rather drink CLR or Mr. Clean?"" I must applaud The Human Centipede for the same reason as Rubber. Tom Six could've done another formulaic slasher, or worse, a remake. But he pursued his own idea. A creative one, but a disturbing one. I give him credit. He was probably drinking with buddies around a bon-fire when he said ""some idiot should make a film about three people bound together to make something like a centipede."" The next day, he got to work.The idea behind ""the human centipede"" is that you take a minimum of three people, give them anesthesia, make an incision in their kneecaps that prevents them from standing up, cut off their lips, and a small hole around their anus and stitch both together.The only person who will be able to obtain food is the first person. When he has to go number two, he will go and it will go thru each of the other (in this case two) human's mouths before coming out for good. It's sick, twisted, and disgusting. But original, yes.The story is two women (Williams and Yennie) are on their way to a nightclub when they get a flat tire. They exchange in some nonsense dialog taken straight from other horror films until they stumble upon a house in the middle of the woods. The house is owned by an unsettling man named Dr. Heiter (Laser). They are drugged after he calls a rent-a-car company, are tied up on a hospital bed with an Asian man as the final piece of the puzzle, and are taught the science behind this creature. Heiter gives them anesthesia, and he creates his beast. It works, but now the three are left to cope with the unfair advantage of being treated like a pet dog.Personally, none of The Human Centipede was very hard to watch. I've read cult films with sicker plots than this one. The idea of the centipede is disgusting, but not seriously disgusting. Still, it's not like it isn't creative. It for damn sure is. But watch August Underground, and tell me which one is sicker.The Human Centipede can't get over the fact it came up with this beast. It's not a horror movie. It's a boastful torture film. It's grotesque, and inhumane. Making a shock film is easy if you have a disgusting idea, it's hard to make one that has a good storyline and a premise to keep you interested. The Human Centipede lacks in both fields, and just relies on the invention to carry the film.Tom Six's directing is fine, but Dieter Laser's acting shines through everything. Everyone else is dull. I do applaud the three victims of the centipede for agreeing to this. They really had no dialog since most of the script is made up of screams and shrieks. Just the fact they wanted to participate in this makes me want to shake each one of them by the hand.But the constant screams and shrieks get annoying. I realize that if I was part of this creation I would scream, cry, and shriek and horror, but literally, 60% of the film is made up of screams, and the remaining forty is made up of clunky dialog and the German language.As a horror film, The Human Centipede fails. As a shock film, The Human Centipede rockets thru the roof. As a film in general, it simply isn't strong in any other fields except for creativity. The idea of humans bound together against their will is an interesting topic, so consider this a more-than-cheerful one star review. But, just an idea can't carry a film. Execution is what it's all about, and The Human Centipede doesn't have anything else to boast except its idea.Apparently, this is just the ""first sequence."" We are also in for a ""full sequence"" and a ""final sequence."" If you could stomach the first, you will most likely watch the full one after much contemplating. To hold out for the final would take patience and a sadistic craving.Starring: Dieter Laser, Ashley C. Williamsm, Ashlynn Yennie, and Akihiro Kitamura.

24,Smells_Like_Cheese,Full of bologna!,4,22 April 2012,"There are two kind of horror films: fantasy and realistic. Some even try to do a little mixture of both and can get away with it. A little low budget film that just got a lot of word of mouth made it pretty big. The way I heard of The Human Centipede was a challenge from my fiancé's brother's girlfriend, she knows my love of horror films and she said I would never be able to handle this movie. I laughed and said that I would check it out and I was expecting something really horrific, after all I've seen A Serbian Film and Irreversiblewas this really worse than those two? So I actually bought the film without seeing it first; my mistake. I watched the interview with the director first on the special features because I knew what the film was about but was curious if the director was going to talk about where he got the idea from: he joked about how a child molester should have his mouth glued to a fat trucker's butt. At that point I knew I was in for one heck of a ride.Lindsay and Jenny, two American tourists in Germany, are drugged and involuntarily detained by crazed surgeon Dr. Josef Heiter when they seek help at his house after their car breaks down. When the women wake up, Heiter has secured a male captive, Japanese tourist Katsuro. The doctor explains that he is a world-renowned expert at separating Siamese twins, but dreams of making new creatures by sewing people together. He describes in detail how he will surgically connect his three victims mouth-to-anus, so that they share a single digestive system. Heiter performs the surgery on his victims, placing Katsuro at the front, Lindsay in the middle and Jenny at the rear. During his procedure, Heiter severs the ligaments in his victims' knees so they cannot stand and are forced to crawl, and sticks the victims together in a line with their mouths surgically attached to the anus of the person in front of them. Now Heitler treats them like a pet and takes on the role of God as the victims want to escape this insane house.The director, to me, seems very full of himself and depends too much on the concept of the film and looks to shock people into remembering the movie. Is the film gross? Yeah, I think so. Is the film outrageous? Yes, I think it's a very original idea. However, he states that he got a surgeon to state that this film was 100% accurate which is very hard to believe. Because if this was to be done in real life, the victims would die of infection or dehydration. The plot holes are a plenty as the doctor can take his centipede upstairs, downstairs, inside and outside without any issue or explanation. The doctor removes the victim's knee ligaments to prevent them from standing up and having a better chance of escaping, when they wake up from the surgery, they somehow can already stand on their knees. How is this possible without physical therapy first? It wasn't believable.Also the two female victims are completely obnoxious and stupid that you don't feel any sympathy for them. The cliché's are insanely outnumbered: no cell signal, taking a crazy route to a night club that leads you in the middle of no where, flat tire in the middle of a storm and the crazy insane creepy doctor that everyone plays dumb around like he's normal and also accept drinks from him. To be honest, he's the only thing that's good about the film and that's because of Dieter Laser's performance. You're sympathizing with the villain here, folks! The leader of the centipede played by Akihiro Kitamura was also very good because he's given more development and human depth. But also the torture factor wasn't there enough to really make an effect on your soul. I've seen much worse, I'll put it that way. This film had a lot of potential to be something special and really was a let down. Have a message, have a meaning if you're going for realism, not just because it would look funny or cool to have people's mouths attached to a butt.4/10",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
25,KineticSeoul,Just plain gross and that is about it,3,25 December 2010,"So nothing about the surgery is realistic and the movie was just plain gross. I know some people like to see crazy and messed up stuff, but this was just boring and wasn't even shocking or scary. Most of the sort of tense scenes are all in the beginning of the movie and after that it's just stupid torture scenes and it's very dull and boring to watch. The crazy doctor is basically a douche and looks like one as well, his face is freakishly gross looking as well and has zero charisma. So basically none of the characters were interesting to watch, most of them are retarded and the characters actions didn't make sense a lot of times and the movie has a lot of plot holes. It's like the director just came up with a idea that is gross but original and thought it would be great to just rely the whole movie around that one small idea.

26,sddavis63,Ridiculously Creepy But Surprisingly Effective,8,27 December 2010,"It looks and sounds ridiculous - and to be honest it is. This entire movie revolves around the work of the classic mad scientist who sets himself to the task of kidnapping three people and turning them into a ""human centipede"" - by attaching the mouth of the one behind onto the anus of the one in front. Yeah. It looks and sounds ridiculous. And in all honesty, it is ridiculous. Through the entire 90 minutes I couldn't figure out just exactly what the point of the experiment was. Why was Dr. Heiter doing this? What was Dr. Heiter hoping to accomplish by doing this? I suppose the only accomplishment would be to prove to himself that he could, in fact, do it - but once he's done it, so what? He can't show off his work! Instead, he'll just be stuck with this hideous three person thing crawling around his house. Sure, he's a mad scientist. He's crazy. He's insane. But he seems well enough in touch with reality that you wouldn't think he'd take on such an apparently complicated experiment with no return possible once he's finished. It's ridiculous.That all leads me to admit with a certain degree of embarrassment that I actually liked this. Ridiculous it may be - but it is definitely one of the creepiest (in a totally ""gross"" sort of way) movies I've ever come across. There are parts of it that I had to turn my head away from, and the actors who were portraying the three who were experimented on seemed to capture the fear and horror of their characters absolutely perfectly. In the same way, Dieter Laser (who played Dr. Heiter) was also perfectly creepy and cold-blooded, and made sure that Heiter came across as totally fixated on and obsessed with his work to the exclusion of any of the obvious objections that could have been made to it. The ending of the movie leaves you absolutely squeamish, wondering what in the world is going to happen to the poor girl in the middle of the ""centipede"" who ends up as the only one left alive in the house. Is there any hope for her to escape this insanity, or does she just stay there and wait to starve or to die of thirst, since there's no way she can drink any liquids or eat any food, even if she could get to a source of either.It's ridiculous, and it's completely without any explanation as to why this experiment is even being conducted or what's going to be accomplished by it. And yet - surprisingly enough - it works quite well, if you're in the mood for an absolute creep-fest.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
27,Hellmant,"This film ranks right up there with some of the worst ever, in my book, like 'DATE MOVIE', 'RENT' and 'CALIGULA'!",1,14 October 2010,"'THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE (FIRST SEQUENCE): Zero Stars (Out of Five) I really like and respect horror movies; I think they often require the most imagination, creativity and talent to produce out of any genre of film. They also can be very enlightening and entertaining as well. I love to be scared and I love to be disturbed (to a certain extent). Horror movies which do these things can teach us something about facing our own fears and actually serve as a psychological examination of what makes us afraid and disturbed of these things to begin with. I also love just good old fashioned 'B' monster and slasher flicks which serve no real purpose other than to entertain and make light and fun of what fears us and creeps us out. There's also those horror films that straddle the line of both serious terror and fun campy B horror, which really serve both purposes (I love these films as well). There has to be some value or some purpose to a film though that makes it worthwhile (Even if it might seem as trivial to some as the ones I've mentioned).Some movies, like this feature written and directed by the notoriously bad filmmaker Tom Six, have no purpose whatsoever other than torturing the viewer and making them sick. It tells the story of a 'mad' retired German surgeon (played impressively by Dieter Laser), who once specialized in separating Siamese twins, who's now drugged and captured three tourists who he plans to make live out his horrifying dream of becoming the first 'human centipede' by joining them together through their gastric systems.The film is split among fans and critics evenly with half of each loving the film and half hating it (On IMDb it has a user rating of 5.1 out of 10 and on rottentomatoes.com it has an overall critic approval of 48%, with an average rating of 5 out of 10). I generally don't believe in calling a film bad just because I didn't like it, or get something of value to me from it, as long as it's generally well made, it serves it's intent and purposes and has some value of some kind to someone. This film does seem to serve the filmmaker's intent of totally disturbing and repulsing the viewer (and some people obviously love it for that) and in some ways it is arguably well made to a certain extent; the lead actor is very good and the movie has a seriously creepy and shockingly morbid tone to it that it maintains for it's entirety. Still the film has no real value of any kind to anyone (that I can see). It's not a campy 'B' horror film that wants the viewer to overlook it's absurdity and just have fun with it's frightfulness and outrageous shock value (which some argue). The filmmaker, Six, has said that he was trying to make a generally horrifying film, which is what I got from it and think he succeeded. So this makes me truly question the logic and credibility of the film.The surgeon is obviously supposed to be a very brilliant, although insane man, so why would he possibly expect his experiment to work. The creation obviously would die very quickly yet he obviously wants it to live. The film has been described as completely medically realistic and accurate, by experts, and it's true that everything performed in the film is possible but still it wouldn't last long and an expert surgeon would have to know this. There's also absolutely no character development at all. We know nothing about the victims and we know that the surgeon is insane and hates human beings but we have no idea why. The 'SAW' and 'HOSTEL' films, which I love, are full of rich insightful character development and also satisfying character redemption at times. This film has one brief moment, towards the end, of a victim coming to terms with his wrong doings but we don't understand what they were or where they are suddenly coming from. I don't believe in calling a movie 'morally deprived' because of the actions of the characters within it but this movie is 'morally deprived', in my opinion. It has no point or purpose at all and it's just hurtful. This film ranks right up there with some of the worst ever, in my book, like 'DATE MOVIE', 'RENT' and 'CALIGULA'.

Williams) and Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie) are touring around Europe, and find themselves lost on a car journey. They call on the home of Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser) for assistance. His horrible demeanour becomes apparent from the off set, but it soon becomes even more horrifying when he drugs them and ties them up with a Japanese man called Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura) and informs them he wants to use them in an experiment to join some humans together and create the 'human centipede.' With only Detectives Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein) to help them, the trio face the most horrifying ordeal of their lives in their bid to get free.It is a curious age we're living in, with the 'torture porn' phenomenon being so mainstream and huge swathes in the form of audiences flocking to see films that revel in blood, torture, human suffering/degradation and sick horror for entertainment. While a lot of these films are generally aiming to be as shocking as they are, some of them are so over the top a twisted part of our brains really does switch on, and we end up laughing at their absurdity and unpleasantness. The Human Centipede had already started to develop something of a cult following for it's hideous subject matter, but with the news just through that a certificate for the sequel has been refused in the UK and it will actually be illegal to own a copy (?!??!?) it will be pushed even more into the eye of your more discerning film-watcher.The premise for this unbelievable little film will really make you wonder how some people are capable of thinking up some ideas. Alledgedly conceived after the writer had a conversation with someone else about what should happen to convicted paedophiles, this is all the same a completely off the wall experience, as far fetched as it is sick, and as revolting and upsetting as you rightly find it, it really is all too much and you end up laughing your head off at how anyone could be as twisted to make something like this. Like most of these types of films, it's complete rubbish, really, doubtless harbouring pretensions of high art but to the average Joe Bloggs just seen as the drivel it is when you've seen past the superficial stuff. All the same, you may well find yourself wanting to watch it again afterwards, not for any morally sado-masochistic reason, just for lots more effective unintentional laughs. **",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

If you don't know, it's about a mad scientist in Germany who decides to sew three people together (I'll spare you the gory details) in order to create the titular 'insect.' If that idea appeals to you, then give it a go. If - like so many - you think that sounds like the worst idea imaginable, then you should steer well clear of it.So, if you do choose to go ahead and spend an hour and a half watching this nightmare, you may be expecting a fair amount of gore. Oddly enough, it doesn't have that much. There's not a lot of the red stuff, even in the operation scenes. This film is about 'concept.' The 'horror' of it all comes from the sheer sick mind that you're taking a look into here.And, the film is pretty disturbing. That's its strong point. However, it falls down by adhering to pretty much all the general horror clichés and you'll find yourself shouting at the characters on screen for their damn silly choices.Basically, know what you're getting: a disturbingly sick film, which probably could have been better written, but, if you're into this sort of thing, the lead performance from the mad scientist should be worth a watch on its own.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Young, eager director Tom Six walks in, anxious to impress potential producers. ""So what's it about?"" asks one of the financers. Six looks awkward, shuffling his feet. ""Er.. it's about this mad scientist who specialises in Siamese twin separation, who abducts these girls. He kinda has this obsession and dream about stitching people together. He wants to join three people together, connected by their mouth and a**ehole, and treat them like a dog."" The producers look at each confused, and the one drops a bag on the table full of money. ""Here's two million dollars,"" he says, ""go make a f*****g movie!""And yes, that is what the film is about. This is probably the maddest idea I've ever heard, which got me extremely intrigued. That, along with the minor media storm that was caused upon it's UK release, meant it was a film I had to see. Not since the glory days of Grindhouse has such a crazy idea been released to mainstream audiences. Yet for all its 'potential' it falls rather flat on it's face.First of all, there are things to enjoy about the film. The crazy surgeon at the centre of it all, Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser), has one of the most unusual faces I've ever seen, and therefore makes a great horror villain. His stoic and Nazi-like behaviour is hilarious, sometimes unnerving, and often very camp. There's definitely a little Udo Kier about him. The surgery scenes, and the inevitable ""oh no, I need to s**t!"" moment are delightfully cringe-inducing, and watching Heiter gaze longingly at a picture of his dead three-dog (work it out) is just plain weird.Yet at the heart of it all, it's nothing more than a run-of-the-mill horror, with dragged-out set pieces, an overlong stalk-around-the-house scene, and a rather poor climax. The eventual unveiling of his creation is also rather tame, with the key gruesome areas covered up (the fact that I would want to see a mouth stitched to an a**ehole worries me). I'd like to say it's a missed opportunity, but I don't if an opportunity was ever there. I mean, how good can a film be where the victims are joined through the gastric system and are forced to s**t in each others mouths? Saying all that, I will be watching the sequel.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
33,Thanos_Alfie,Disgusting...,4,29 January 2014,"""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)"" is a really disgusting movie that has to do with a crazy scientist who wants to make a human centipede and he kidnaps three people to do so. To make this centipede he stitched their mouths to each others rectums and one feed the other. He did all of that because he needed a new ""pet"" for him.When I saw the title of this movie I thought that it will be really disgusting but I saw it because I have not ever seen such a movie like that.Finally I have to tell you that in this movie do not expect good interpretations and nothing from these staff the only thing that you will see is an insane thriller and you have to be prepared for it.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
34,filipemanuelneto,Terrible,1,4 December 2017,"I'm still wondering why this movie was made. There is nothing good here. The movie is gore horror and is based on this: two girls end up getting lost and knock on the door of an old man who is, actually, a totally crazy old doctor who will arrest the girls with another boy and try to create a ""centipede"" by sewing their mouth to the rectum of the person in front of them. Sounds crazy enough?The script simply runs over medical or anatomy issues without any consideration for our intelligence. Clearly in desperation, the movie simply wants to shock. Its sick, its repulsive, but the truth is that it also brings few truly novelties that do not have equivalent in other horror films. Then you have the awful dialogues, the actors worthy of a low-budget B movie, and a flood of clichés loaded with predictability. Is it worth watching it? I don't think so.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
35,Rectangular_businessman,Boring,1,19 June 2012,"Considering the bad reputation that this movie had prior to its release (with some rumors pointing it as one of the most disturbing/ disgusting films) I was getting ready for the worse before seeing it. Now that I've seen it, I have to say that this movie is not even close to be one of the most disturbing movies ever made.Is not that I have a problem with that, after all, I don't mind if a horror movie is gory or disturbing if it is good. Sadly, this is not the case: The grotesque premise aside, this is a pretty generic horror movie, with dumb characters that make very stupid decisions and a cartoonish villain that it's so obviously evil from the beginning that it is almost laughable. Except that this movie takes itself way too seriously, and tries too hard to proof that is something very ""deep"" or ""artistic"" forcing a lame tragedy ending which is so predictable and cliché that is not surprising anymore.The scene where Katsuro confesses the doctor that he ""deserved"" what happened to him in the movie before committing suicide is idiotic. His comment about how he treated ""poorly"" his family just came out of nowhere with zero foreshadowing and without any justification in the context of the events. That's why it feels as something forced, as if Tom Six was trying to portray this film as something more ""deeper"" than it actually is. This attempt results in something quite poor, generic and unoriginal, which had zero interest for me, lacking both in the artistic or entertainment aspect.""The Human Centipede"" it's a boring, uninspired film, that doesn't add anything new to the underrated horror genre. In fact, I think that it is for the works done by hacks like Tom Six that horror movies doesn't get the respect that deserve.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

""Entirely deplorable and revolting, sort of brilliant"". ""Cronenbergian care and precision"". Did we watch the same film? No seriously, did we? I wanted a fun exaggerative body horror that doesn't hold back in conjoining the human anatomy. What I got was a tame, badly acted and boring ""film"" to which its only existence is to be controversial. Except it wasn't. It was just terrible. Two tourists are stranded and ask for help from a crazed surgeon who wants to create a ""Human Centipede"". So, firstly, someone tell Tom Six that a centipede has typically around thirty legs (at the bare minimum). It's more of a ""Human Isopod"". Secondly, and most importantly, this film is pointless. Absolutely inherently stupid. Six states that the narrative was a reflection of fascism, and that it is a commentary on the horrific actions of Nazis. What a load of centipede excrement! You can't transform rubbish into pretentious nonsense. There's no substance to the German shenanigans. Six is as subtle as throwing a flaming brick through a window and shouting ""I DID IT!"". The two American tourists were on a different level of stupid. Sure, you break down and wander the German woods at night, only to come across the most sinister surgeon in the lands. But you drink his water!? You don't physically call the car rental service yourselves!? You escape and go back for your friend!? Stranger danger girls, come on! The good thing is that their mouths are silenced once they are surgically attached to the other person's other hole. No, not their nostrils. They physically could not act, groaning and moaning their way through this pointless ordeal. Laser's menacing performance is the only redeemable quality. There is probably one scene, which involves defecation, that may be squeamish for some. But you don't connect (pardon the pun) with the characters. So all the defecating and swallowing means nothing, making for a tame and dull experience. Quite simply atrocious.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The idea apparently originated from a dirty joke. I went into this film really not knowing much about it. The script is mediocre, but the whole film is something different, which hopefully won't send a trend in faecies, as I had watched Salo, not long after this. A psychopathic doctor, a recluse, kidnaps two chicks and an Asian guy, who overacts like you wouldn't believe. We in awe of his new experiment to conjoin the three arse to face, etc. which when successfully completed isn't much to look at. Of course we have authorities, making the mistake of walking into the house, which they don't take up much of the movie's time. Watching the operation is a bit hard, as it's terrible for the girls (who act okay) when the Asian has to relieve himself. Surprisingly it's not that that violent too, but some of it is affecting, like watching flesh being peeled back, what have you, affecting cause it's more visually real. Sick, Disgusting, Foul, horrible, The Human Centipede, but bad? No? The story is actually very well structured and has a nice flow. We learn a bit too about Science as our psychopath (a wonderful Dieter Laser, who has an enlarged Jeremy Iron's face) teaches us. Of course, the film doesn't end on a happy note, but it's Laser's freaky chilling and evil performance that encapsulates us.

To call this something which 'pushes boundaries' is the most misguided and blind thing anyone could say. To push boundaries is to do something nobody else was capable of or better than anyone else could. This could have been done 100 years ago with great ease, it is not ground-breaking in any way, anyone with a camera could make it. Nobody in their right mind would want to that's all! This does not spring from a person's imagination it springs from someone's warped lack of moral or artistic decency. It didn't even shock me it just saddens me. It is truly pathetic. To even call it a film is to credit it with artistic merit it doesn't deserve, it is drivel! There is NO artistic merit, acting, direction, writing, production are all the lowest level. The idea is majorly sick but the idiot making it couldn't even do it right, for instance the girls moan and gasp in ways it is impossible to with you mouth covered by anything. If you try to re-enact their noises with your mouth open under your hand you will find you cannot do it. The unrealistic nature of how it all happens is just one addition to how pathetic this putrid nonsense is. This is not well made or intelligent enough to influence a normal adult but the only reason this should be banned is the shocking fact that many children I have taught in schools have sadly seen this. An uneducated mind without sufficient guidance could be harmed by this. This kind of grot can make a child or easily influenced person see the abnormal, sick depravity as normal and lessen their perception of real human suffering.

The surgery is brutal, starting with the severing of the knee ligaments to prevent his visitors from trying to escape. After the three are attached, Heiter walks them around like a pet and watches them eat each others feces; do not watch this after dinner.

The movie is called "" The Human Centipede "" and is definitely not for the squeamish or easily offended. This macabre story is of Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser) a world renowned surgeon who once was a knowledgeable and well respected scientist. His specialty was in medically separating Siamese twins. Now completely Mad, he wishes to create a new species called a human centipede. Thus Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie and Akihiro Kitamura some unlucky tourists are kidnapped and become his Guinea pigs. What soon becomes apparent to the audience is that most of the medical procedures are horrifyingly possible.

41,GiraffeDoor,An imperfect but refreshing effort that runs out of ideas before the end.,7,2 March 2019,"If you often avoid this kind of movie because you don't like seeing gore then there is actually a surprising lack of violence in this. There's some physical conflict of course and a few glimpses of medical gore but it's not the bloodfest that one might be inclined to assume it is.It's rare that a movie has a premise that can vex you by itself rather than just intrigue you. I admire that this movie broke away from the horrors that take themselves just a tad too seriously.Is this a perfect movie? No. It may be a bit hysterical but it definitely brings something fresh to the table.A typical slasher is about some silent, unhinged killer hacking various youths apart.Here we have someone relatively stable, a professional, not killing right away but joining people together in the intelligent, calculated way. We don't get to just briefly feel bad for a dead character and move on to the ones that are still alive but see the victims live long into the ordeal in a way that is at once kind of real yet unreal.It has a sense of humour. It has to. I know the whole thing feels a bit like schoolboy scatology but it uses that to its strength, at times daring you to laugh and you just don't quite know how to feel about what you're watching. it's not a horror comedy, it's just a horror that deftly applies dark humour you don't want to laugh at and is all the better for it.Dr. Heiter is a fascinating antagonist. The guy who plays him radiates menace and evil from his first appearance to how delectably he savours playing with his creation. You watch him hoping for an origin story but of course an actual prequel would ruin the mystique and be a bad idea.Few movies have nauseated me in quite the special way this one does. It's more than the physicality of it's story (but that does play a part) it's getting to watch a man who has gained a prestigious place in society from is intelligence and skill revel in his degradation of the human form to an object...dare i say...an insect? :) (yes, I know centipedes are not insects but let me have this one).It doesn't fetishize death and dismemberment the way a slasher might; it's more about an apathy to the sanctity of life toward very personal goals that is the crux of this movie. Refreshingly nihlistic.Admittedly Six did run out of idea toward the end and the final leg of this picture kind of annoys me but over all I'm glad i saw it.

After failing to keep his three rottweilers alive after experimenting on them, he decides to go for it with an unlucky Japanese man and the two American girls. Writer-director Tom Six wastes little time with character development and moves this ghastly film along at a very fast clip. It's grim to the point of exhaustion. Laser is ridiculous, conjuring up everyone's idea of what Josef Mengele would have done for kicks had he lived in a more medically advanced time.

Anyway about the movie. It isn't even very graphical, most of the goryness are covered by bandages. All the horror is psychological. There aren't much violence in this film, it's just the trauma and the terrible experience the characters survive, there aren't any jumpscares or at least obvious ones, which proves it's high quality of a horror film.

A truck driver stops to use the restroom and Heiter kidnaps him.Later, two American tourists on their way to some remote club, end up lost and with a flat tire. They walk for help and end up...in Dr. Heiter's house. We learn that he was a renowned surgeon specializing in separating conjoined twins.

Moreover, the police show up at his door looking for the girls. The Dr's bizarre behavior doesn't exactly seem innocent so the police promise to come back with a warrant- in less than 30 minutes! The Human Centipede I isn't nearly as repulsive or aberrant a movie as you would think, or some would hope. Like many extreme horror movies, with the exception of French ones, it is fairly sanitized, and even slightly stylish. It has its creepy moments as when the Dr. explains his ""patients"" the procedure he will perform. The Dr. himself has too much of a cartoonish personality to be taken seriously, the actor does look creepy though. And the director could have done so much more with the creature. It's not even filmed in a horrific way, in some way, the cinematographer failed. Our first sight of the centipede should have much more impact and the weirdness of it wasn't exploited. Even the digestive process could have been so much more gross.This movie is fairly basic in its story, it feels short, has a small budget, although it looks good.

45,Jonny_Numb,"Madness, Desperation, and Dark Humor",6,26 November 2010,"""The Human Centipede"" entered the public consciousness in a barnstorming manner that rendered the notion of 'spoilers' a moot point indeed; while no cinema within my general geographical plane played the film during its theatrical run, the Internet buzz and festival reviews I gleaned on several trusted websites piqued my interest considerably. Having gone out of my way to experience willfully uncomfortable films (sometimes for no other reason than to say I survived them), writer-director Tom Six's ""Centipede"" quickly shot to the top of my must-see list. The subsequent viewing experience was a wild, over-the-top mixture of morbid, absurd humor, queasy unease, and unrelieved, batsh1t-crazy horror. To call Six's narrative structure ""tonally inconsistent"" would be an understatement; the film progresses through three distinct acts: the first consists of two rock-stupid American girls vacationing in Germany, whose car trouble echoes the ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""; the second consists of the girls (and a Japanese businessman) falling prey to the deranged machinations of Dr. Heiter (the wonderfully unhinged Dieter Laser); and the third is a descent into desperation, madness, and violence that few horror films successfully pull off. Throughout, Six is keenly aware of the mad-scientist improbability of his scenario, but creates a paradox in presenting a world where a man could harbor notions of three people sharing the same digestive tract; as such, there is also a thread of deliberate, pitch-dark humor that permeates the proceedings. While the tonal inconsistency of ""The Human Centipede"" suggests that Six should try harder to streamline his concepts into a more synthesized, less episodic whole, the film overall is a refreshing example of the originality of which the horror genre is capable.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The Human Centipede has a weird pop culture status as a body horror tale of people being sewn together and... I was kinda surprised by how tame it seemed. I mean, yeah people do get sewn together into a human centipede and the movie does cover how disgusting that is but I was expecting more. But, reputation aside, how does this actually hold up?Not well, it turns out.The movie just doesn't make any sense. A doctor specializing in separating conjoined twins develops a weird desire to sew people together instead? Ok, sure but in centipede fashion so he can treat them like a pet? That seems like a bit of a jump. Mob violence feels out of place, the science is attempted but really, really doesn't work. It's also technically a foreign film, which is fine but it runs into problems, most notably with languages. Either pick one or give me subtitles. The whole thing could be in over 100 languages for all I care but put subtitles on there so I can have some clue what's being said. Oh, and not to just tack it on but the acting is super sloppy and amateur hour.When all's said and done, The Human Centipede was something I wanted to cross off my list of ""shame"" but it's kinda just all hype. It's a trashy, sleazy film with strong sexual tones that feel super clingy given the nature of the film and it's story, acting and pretty much everything is basically nonsense. I give it credit for not shying away from showing the 'centipede' and committing to what it's doing but that's all I'll give it credit for.

There was never anything TOO gruesome or exploitative. Even the stomach churning ""FEED HER!"" scene is mostly left to suggestion. The acting isn't great at the beginning, but once the girls are sewn mouth to ass, it's obvious they were cast for their ability to show absolute terror and disgust.

It was the closing gala night film (what else would close?) I think the theatre helped make the experience of this film better than watching it alone.The title and trailer made this film the hype sensation it was and the most talked about horror film of the year. Can a film live up to such a bizarre and disgusting premise? The answer is yes and no. The film does deliver on what it promises, a human centipede and it has some good laughs in it. I found the film to be a comedy more than a horror. Although, with every positive, there is a negative and the film doesn't go FAR ENOUGH!!! What!!?!?!?!?! Is he serious? Yes, I am. With a film like this, one that has generated such a considerable amount of buzz about how grotesque the subject matter is, you would expect the film to be pretty disgusting. The Human Centipede is not disgusting. First of all, it's all imagination. The film has one scene that might get people gagging a bit, but I expected more than half of the film to be like that. It's not. The director Tom Six seems to have let the concept get the best of him and thought to himself that this concept alone will make a entertaining film. The answer is unfortunately no. A concept does not make a film. I don't applaud Tom Six, I applaud the two actresses who had to 'act' 3/4 of the film in the centipede position. The film tries to build some suspense but it's pretty hard when you have three people moving at a snails pace around a house. The film has it's funny moments, which are all primarily given by the mad doctor, the brilliant Dieter Laser. He knows he's in a crappy film and he plays up the role beyond hilarity and over the top cheese. The Human Centipede is a horror film that is weak on the horror and would rather rely on a concept that try to say something about modern horror or anything for that matter. Characters do stupid things, the 'horror' is hidden and makes you think about the disgustingness rather than show it. The Human Centipede follows with a few words (The First Sequence). So expect a sequel, especially since the film was such a huge thing. The film got so much buzz over the concept alone. There was hardly any chance that the film would be able to match it. So a lot of people will be setting themselves up for disappointment. It is a great concept, otherwise people wouldn't be talking about it, but the film on the other hand falls a little short. Well, at the screening they asked for some people to demonstrate the human centipede. Once a guy saw that two females were on stage, he ran up there. He was also Asian, coincidence? Before the movie started they also told us that the tagline they used was correct. Is this really 100% medically accurate? Who knows, I hope not.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Like, I could get in trouble for viewing something so disturbingly grotesque. This may sound ridiculous to some people, but it's true. I genuinely wondered how such a repulsive, twisted film could even come to fruition. Over time, other extreme horror films have been brought to my attention (SALO, Serbian Film, etc) which, from reading the description alone, seem to make this film sound pretty weak in comparison. Still, parts of this film still haunt me a little, and I've never dared to rewatch it after all these years.Is it a great film? Or even a good film? Well, no, not to me... but I can't slam this with anything less than a 5/10, because there's no denying its status of uniqueness within cinema. Do I recommend it? Again, no, not really. Anyone who's interested in this doesn't need it to be recommended to them -- they've certainly already heard of it and given it a shot and determined whether or not extreme horror is something they wish to delve further into or not.

52,Nodriesrespect,The Conga Line Starts Where ?!,10,6 November 2010,"Now this is more like it ! Over this year's Halloween, I saw both Kiwi goremeister David Blyth's weeping sore WOUND at the Razor Reel Fantasy Film Festival in my hometown of Bruges, Belgium, and my eagerly awaited DVD copy of Dutch shock jock Tom Six's infinitely superior recipient of massive Internet pre-release hype, the self-explanatory HUMAN CENTIPEDE. Even though anyone who would care to watch it inevitably knows what it's about already, I have discovered the oh so deliciously guilty pleasure of seeing people (usually of the non-genre fan variety, yes, there really is such a beast) turn slightly pale as they struggle for a response to my outlining the basic premise for their benefit, so here goes...Since his retirement, esteemed surgeon Dr. Heiter (the astonishing Dieter Laser, a bit part character actor since the late '60s, who was described to Six as ""a dehydrated Christopher Walken"" !) has retreated to the quiet of the German countryside, the better to focus on what is to become the crowning achievement of a brilliant career. Having built his fame on the separation of Siamese twins, Heiter's dream consists of successfully accomplishing the exact reverse, literally connecting people one after the other to form the grotesque creature the catchy title refers to. Boasting ""100 % medical accuracy"", the physical specifics of this operation are best summed up by the porn abbreviation ATM which, for the really naive and/or Internet unversed, has nothing whatsoever to do with banks ! Essentially, it means that the first and, all things considered, most fortunate person on the centipede will continuously get his butt kissed as the follower's mouth is stitched to his rectum, a procedure repeated with each successive participant, with a continuous intestinal tract running through their bodies so that all parties can be properly...er...fed ! A first experiment involving the devious doc's pet Alsatians, glimpsed in a photo and commemorated by a tombstone in his backyard, has gone tragically awry. Having learned from his mistakes, Heiter feels the time is right to create the human equivalent.Enter a pair of typically clueless American girls, whiny Jenny (Ashlyn Yennie) and her comparatively more level-headed BFF Lindsay (Ashley C. Williams), whose car breaks down when they get lost en route to a trendy club in the middle of the night. Forfeiting the questionable aid of a dirty-talking fat slob (an indelible portrayal by one shot - for now ! - Bernd Kostrau), the pair none too wisely decide to leave their vehicle and go look for help. No prizes for guessing who their Samaritan turns out to be ! Problem is that the dainty dames are a poor physical match for the robust Dutch truck driver (René de Wit) the doc abducted in reel one, so an unfortunate Japanese tourist (Akihiro Kitamura, himself a promising director of genre-bending oddities like PORNO and I'LL BE THERE WITH YOU) gets drafted as a last minute replacement to pull the train on the centipede.Does my esteemed readership still bear with me ? If so, let me assure you that this film plays quite differently than any cold light of day description would lead one to believe. Those expecting a non stop barrage of grotesque gore will actually come away disappointed. Correctly assuming his far out premise (born out of a running joke among the director's circle of friends of what would constitute proper punishment for pedophiles) contains more than enough shock value in itself, Six takes the slow - meandering to some - approach to his as a result surprisingly thoughtful realization thereof. Although all three unwilling participants are deliberately sketched in crude cultural clichés in the first act, they really come alive once they're all too literally connected with nary a single opportunity for both VERY dark humor (the ""feeding"" sequence which, albeit largely suggested, will separate the men from the boys) and almost operatic tragedy left unexplored. As a trivia note, Six selected the character of Katsuro to take the lead rather than either of the girls because he wanted both creature and creator unable to verbally communicate with one another as, in his own words, ""that would have been weird"" ! Really, Tom ?!Bursting onto the cinematic scene with the politically incorrect GAY, Six has steadfastly refused to be pigeonholed and continues to follow his highly personal career trajectory. Even though HUMAN CENTIPEDE will be categorized by many as firmly belonging within the confines of the horror genre, more specifically reviving the ""body horror"" cycle of early Cronenberg, it hits so many apparently discordant notes along the way for that to be a comfortable fit. The initial revelation of the centipede provides a perfect example, an unexpected ejaculation of pure visual poetry as the filmmaker pulls out all the stops, brazenly bathing his titular monstrosity in warm golden sunlight, courtesy of Six's regular DoP Goof de Koning, like his mentor equally unconstricted by the still rarely well-employed digital technology. This immediately imbues the creature with both human dignity (circumstances notwithstanding !) and an unlikely Giger-esquire beauty. Although the director has gone on record promising a sequel that will contain all the grue and gore which here he wisely withheld, as the centipede swells to a whopping twelve (!!!) participants, it's hard to believe that this will in any way improve upon his maiden voyage and offer anything quite as memorable as its sublimely understated haunting final image, the full implication of which revealed only through reflection.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

This failed, but Heiter wishes to try again, this time with humans. Sadly, Heiter did not investigate why the first experiment failed.Heiter's plans go forward with some bumps in the road. For instance, he is rather cavalier about leaving sit the vehicles of the people he has kidnapped, all near his home.So, will Heiter succeed, or will the victims find a way to escape?Fraught with logical problems and holes in the plot to the point where little if any of it made any sense.

54,ElijahCSkuggs,'You are the middle piece!',8,30 April 2010,"What most drives my love for the genre of horror is the room for creativity. It's levels of creativity can stretch further than any other genre. Well, I think so anyways. And this nimbly bimbly thought process of mine is backed up with the ridiculousness that is, The Human Centipede.And I'm speaking for myself now, so don't get all prissy, but one of my favorite ideas inreally any genre of film is when the Mad Scientist is involved. And luck be true, what we have here is basically a story that revolves around a monstrously evil, Mad Scientist. And to make matters worse, he's German. The Human Centipede: First Sequence (they should skipped out on that last part), begins with a couple of high-end broads who are traveling Europe and just living and loving life. So, they're heading out for the night to meet up with German hottie, and party it up, but of course along the way, they break down, the cell phone doesn't' work, they're accosted by a pervy foreignerand then sh!t really hits the fan. If you've heard of this movie before, you know exactly what is going to eventually go down, so I don't need to say anymore. If you don't know about the movie...just read the title.Besides that other Serbian Film being talked about so much this year, The Human Centipede is easily the other most talked about horror film coming out. It's supposed to be disgusting, vile and downright gross. Well, put those party hats on because for more or less, it is. You're not shown extremely graphic stuff, but what you do see, and what is implied is done well enough to get you squirming in your undies.The film delivered of course in the insanity department, but it also succeeded, almost perfectly, in how they casted the Mad Scientist. I first thought it was Udo Kier, but soon thereafter realized not only was it not Mr. Kier, but this guy is arguably cooler than Kier! This guy was a stone-cold villain, with menacing stares, peculiar expressions and an overall evil-as-sin demeanor. Hats off to that guy for carrying the film, as if his character wasn't as strong as he was, this film could have possibly come off as some joke film. Some of the lines he delivers are just pure, psychotic, German gold. 'My sweet centipede.' Hahaa...good stuff. The film ain't perfect though. Setting up the movie was cliché, as the girls were entirely unlikeable, and rather stupid. Actually even deep in the movie, the decision making on their parts verged on mental retardation. And this is where you're supposed to realize it's a horror movie, led by a Mad Scientist. The good stuff is what matters, and believe me, the story itself and how it's presented was all good.I admittedly had high hopes for The Human Centipede. I wanted over the top sickness, I wanted to enjoy the acting, and I wanted something just memorable. And that's exactly what I got. Expect a fun performance by heir doctor, a human centipede, and sickness, and you should have a fun time with this.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
55,Falconeer,Represents the Death of the Horror Genre,2,27 March 2021,"... And pretty much the death of cinema in general. ""Human Centipede"" is the reason why I don't watch horror movies made after the late 1980's: cinema has devolved into a collection of shock value scenes, filmed artlessly and without talent or imagination. I truly believe that this celluloid abortion is nothing more than an inside joke, suggesting that people who seek out current American horror films are basically setting themselves up to eat feces, symbolically. Unless you are a young teenage boy, or have the mentality of a a person that age, you will get nothing out of this joke of a movie. Or maybe the film was made for guys who have been rejected by women all their lives, and get a kick out of watching them consuming each other's fecalities... Stuff like this makes me so grateful that there are so many films of the 70s and 80s that are there to be discovered, that I never have to resort to looking at something like this to be entertained...",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
56,ajs-10,It's pretty grim...,5,28 March 2011,"This film gained a lot of notoriety when it came out, not least due to a rather effective marketing campaign. Although it's not the kind of thing I'd usually choose to watch, I'll admit to being slightly intrigued by it and so decided to give it a viewing when it arrived on TV recently. It's certainly not the best film I've ever seen, but it does do what it says on the tin and I can't knock it for that! More of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please kidnap more victims while I write the next paragraph).Dr. Heiter used to be a famous surgeon. He specialised is separating Siamese twins and was very good at it. Now retired and living alone, he turns his mind to putting things together, rather than separating them. To this end he has already tried an experiment on his three rottweilers and is now ready to move on to the next step. Having chosen and kidnapped his first victim, a truck driver, he can't believe his luck when two young American tourists, Lindsay and Jenny, arrive at his door having had car trouble. They are quickly dealt with and sedated in his cellar. Unfortunately for the truck driver, he doesn't match and so another subject has to be found. This time it's a young Japanese man called Katsuro who the doctor brings back to his cellar. And now it's time to begin the experiment but not before one of the makes a break for it. I will leave my short summary here so as not to upset the Spoiler Police too much.To be honest, I found this film was quite badly made. I don't know if it was because it was cut for a TV audience, but there seemed to be gaping plot holes and continuity errors all over the place. The best performance came from Dieter Laser who was everything you'd expect from a mad German scientist. Ashley C. Williams as Lindsay, Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny and Akihiro Kitamura as Katsuro were all adequate without being anything special.Over all, I found this film quite disappointing with some debatable production values and a pretty bad script. Ultimately it's not very pleasant and I didn't find it particularly entertaining. Definitely not one for the squeamish and one I don't think I'll be giving a second viewing to NOT recommended.My Score: 4.7/10",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Decently acted--at least for its classlessness--and filmed stylishly in the Netherlands. The concept of the human centipede is completely childish and unoriginal, and the controversy surrounding it is thrived by people why are offended by fart jokes and have never anticipated the possibility of coprophagia. There are better and worse things in this world to raise controversy over, and this film isn't one of them. The film ends way too easily, but very few will complain that it ended too quickly. The structure and pacing are also terrible; the opening scene (actually filmed during the final day of shooting) is virtually useless save minor and insignificant character development, and the film doesn't really have a third act. Those who made the film and those who complain about how disgusting it is should both be subjects to criticism for contributing to the creation and notoriety of such a terrible film.*½ (out of four)",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
59,DonFishies,A wildly enjoyable film destined to be a cult classic,7,10 October 2010,"Being a Canadian, sometimes it takes a while before some movies reach us. And with new formats for watching films popping up in increasing numbers across the United States, sometimes it takes even longer to see some films. But when the Toronto After Dark Film Festival announced that The Human Centipede (First Sequence) would be their Closing Night Gala film, I knew this was an unmissable opportunity. And even after seeing the film almost two months ago, I cannot help but shake the feeling that I saw something truly special.If you read anything online about movies, or you follow movie news in any capacity, chances are you have heard about The Human Centipede. The film developed a certain notoriety for the very idea it is based around. For those few who have not heard, the film concerns a mad scientist and former surgeon named Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser) who kidnaps three victims (two of them being female American travelers looking for fun across Europe) and stitches them together through their mouths and rears into one organism as an experiment.Now I am not one to judge another's twisted imagination, but obviously the idea the film centres around is inherently disgusting and repulsive. Add to that the tagline of being ""100% Medically Accurate"" and you have a film that will divide audiences right down the middle between people who have the morbid curiosity to see Tom Six's heinous and wildly original vision, or those who find the idea revolting and nauseating. One watch of the trailer will likely divide audiences even further, as it gives a taste of what you are in for should you venture into the film. And rather sadly, it ruins a bit of the surprise of what Heiter's creation looks like.I only say it ruins some of the surprise because knowing what the creation looks like before seeing the film hinders its impact. The sheer idea of what it looks like, and the physics and ""accuracy"" behind it, are significantly more disgusting than the film actually is. Sure, the film is rather sick and twisted for the majority of time, and there are a lot of scenes made explicitly to not be for the easily squeamish. But once you get past the idea of the human centipede itself, there is really nothing that should irk, repulse or keep you from watching for the remaining period of time. You may even find yourself a little disappointed at the limits the film takes and does not take. Sadly, the idea is more horrific than the final product, and the hype around that idea has already made the film a genuine success right from the start.Looking past the rather slapped together storyline (there really is only so much story can go into a film that is more based on an idea than anything else), the other reason anyone should seek the film out is Laser's performance as Dr. Heiter. I cannot recall any recent performance that is nearly as demented, as ridiculously overacted, as involving, as nearly insane, or as deliciously evil as Laser's. This is a character that needs to be seen to be believed. Laser comes off as both unintentionally hilarious and downright psychotic in every scene he appears in. Never once does he waver or even consider not putting every ounce of strength he has an actor, into this character. This is the kind of legendary, entire self-involving performance people raved about Sacha Baron Cohen pulling off in Borat (and to a lesser degree, Brüno) a few years back. But Laser makes those performances come off as amateur in comparison. He is the real deal and a menacing and truly horrifying actor if I ever saw one. He is absolutely perfect in every sense, and he sells the idea and the film even better than the title and the hype does. No other actor in the film even comes close to how amazing a performance he gives.But there are problems. As mentioned, the story is a bit of a mess, and does not serve any real point other than to get to the moments before and after the centipede is created. The haphazard survival story that comes about really does not even attempt to go anywhere, and some of the more emotional sequences come off rather silly in the grand scheme of things. But the film moves past these elements, and does away with them almost like they are nothing. The film knows it was made to be about a concept more than it is a cohesive whole, and having Laser's performance is merely an added benefit that likely was not initially envisioned when it was being scripted. Six relies too much on the creation of the centipede and in turn, Laser, to keep the film going from start to finish, that he allows everything else to become secondary to it. But really, if anyone goes into this movie expecting anything more, they should not be searching for a film like this in the first place.As a film-goer with full knowledge of The Human Centipede going in, I came out wildly surprised by the film. Sure, it was not an overly great film and I do think the envelope could have been pushed even further, but Six has created a wildly original film that manages to be wildly enjoyable. But I doubt if I watched it again alone it would have nearly the same effect as it did watching with a crowd. This is a movie that practically begs to be watched with more than one person (just think of all the drinking games that could come out of it). It is a movie that is destined for cult status, and the rare movie that lived up to its hype in some degree. Let's just hope the sequel does not overdo it too much.7.5/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Better yet who has the even sicker-state-of-mind to sit through this? I rented the DVD and was not astonished by the acting, the cinematography, the music, or it simplistic and predictable storyline. How did I learn of this film's existence? Merely by watching an re-run of ""Tosh.o"", where our humble host actually recommends the movie, basically in the same way you'd cruelly recommend a friend to watch the infamous ""Two girls one cup"" video. and in the same sense of that viral video the only real production value of this film is its shock-value.It lives up to many classic clichés,like the idiotic yet attractive women whose car breaks down and seek help where they shouldn't,and the undeniable MAD scientist, or in this case 'surgeon'. The film adds the horrendously laughable tag line to the DVD "" 100% medically accurate"", which it is not even close too. I'm sure any idiot can discern that. I mean I laughed incredibly hard when the credits rolled, just imagining how much any person's career must be in the toilet to actually be a part of something so pathetic, whether they be director, extra, actor or the screenplay writer.Kudos to the tragic collapse of truly great horror to this garbage.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The writing mainly consists of moaning, screaming, whimpering and screeching and a few dialogues that are so atrocious they are just kept to bring the characters to the surgeon's house.The first few scenes look as if the girls are being chased already by the madman since they are so frightened right from the start. The Japanese actor has nothing to do but yell incoherently and writhe in pain. Even the girls have unappealing bodies so there was no eye-candy to salvage the hopeless film.

63,asda-man,"Masterpiece not, unforgettable definitely not!",8,20 March 2011,"""The Human Centipede"" is definitely a love it or loathe it film. I can certainly see the controversy surrounding it as it has the demented German surgeon obviously inspired by the horrific things nazi surgeons did in the war. Germans are definitely not going to take to this, I think they'd like to forget about the war but this is really exploiting what they did on a sickening level, but thankfully I'm not German.Yeah, I'm English and so it didn't offend me disturbed me. It disturbed me in such a way that it has left a scar in my brain and watching it was certainly an experience I will never forget. I found myself watching the credits roll (something I don't normally do) I was confused and didn't really know what to think about what I just witnessed. But something that has that effect on you is very rare in my case it's only happened on such disturbing brilliance like ""Martyrs"" and ""Mum & Dad"" and so surely that must mean something.You know when a film is good if it becomes more of an experience rather than watching a moving image and Tom Six's ""The Human Centipede"" certainly became an experience for me. The premise is so disturbing and insanely original! The film certainly had it flaws with the somewhat clichéd first half but when the surgeon actually makes the centipede it actually becomes not clichéd at all and actually gripping stuff.The directing was beautiful, Tom Six is really a talented man, the lighting and slow camera movements really added to the coldness and isolation of the film. Dieter Laser really did an incredible performance as the mad doctor, his face is so menacing (no offence Dieter) and his deep German accent actually becomes quite scary. He really is a frightening villain! I heard that this was meant to be a comedy but I didn't find much of it funny at all. If this is a dark comedy than it's too dark for me to see it.In the end ""The Human Centipede"" certainly won't win the critics over, but I'm no critic, I'm just a horror fanatic and this film really stuck with me. You have to make up your own mind about this so I'd definitely say give it a go",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
64,doctorsmoothlove,I Said What What (in the butt),3,25 October 2010,"The internet meme ""buttsecks"" and the ""back and forth"" scene in Me and You and Everyone We Know are indicative of a new cultural development in our world. Anal sex has somehow gained sufficient public awareness to become the butt of jokes. People who make these jokes have presented themselves as crudely adventurous if not possibly homophobic comedians or appealing to the presumed immaturity of their audiences. These jokes can be funny and not disparage anyone's sexual preference as we have learned from Miranda July. Since this has been going on for a few years (out in the open), it was time for a new phenomenon to emerge: the insertion of anal sex \ into the larger Western cultural framework.Enter The Human Centipede by director Tom Six. Here is a movie about a mad German (this is important) scientist who kidnaps three people and surgically joins them anus to mouth. The head of the new creature is a Japanese person and the bodies are from the United States. Dr. Heiter had only the interest of an inebriated or midnight audience in mind when he decided to begin this project. I feel confident in this assertion as we are left to watch him maintain the most rigid of evil German stereotypes imaginable. Dieter Laser plays him so perfectly I cannot imagine a more iconic bad movie character of 2010.Six came up with the idea for this movie by suggesting an anilingual punishment for pedophiles to a group of friends. His lack of appreciation for the concept he would later present as a serious horror film translates into his having no idea of what to do with the movie. There are several ways to not enjoy it. Assuming you're a humanist, the idea will disgust you. Six pushes his audience that direction. The movie is surprisingly restrained, with only one gross-out instance. There is a basic drawing provided by Dr. Heiter to set up the idea. How do you think the human centipede relieves itself? Even if you are a humanist (or not) and are not turned off by the situation, you won't enjoy the lack of plot. After the surgery is complete, almost nothing happens. The people scream and some stupid police officers arrive and disappear. The creature frees itself and attacks Heiter before its head and rear die. Why is there no commentary beyond having the doctor be German, the head Japanese, and the rest from the United States? Are we really supposed to accept such an outdated cliché without questioning it? Maybe we are. I would have been willing to dislike the movie slightly less if I had reason to assume that Six didn't see himself as being above the material. But, no; the movie is nothing more than a 90 minute blabbering on buttsecks.The Human Centipede has been marketed as the one must-see foreign mostly English-language horror movie of the year. It is supposed to be this year's Antichrist. It isn't. Lars Von Trier put himself in equality with his unusual material and produced a movie that managed to make talking foxes terrifying. Perhaps someone else will make anal sex interesting or hopefully erotic.Not Recommended",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

I'm no doctor, but there seem to be major flaws in his medical design - oh well.

66,baileycrawly,No False Advertising,7,12 March 2021,"One of the most interesting things among film communities since 2009 has been the reaction to The Human Centipede. Everyone loves to talk about how nasty the content is (and, believe me, it pushes the boundaries in that regard), but what people fail to acknowledge is that the film offers exactly what it advertises. It's a low-budget horror film that sees its characters medically conjoined to satisfy a sadistic evil doctor's desires. It is, without a doubt, among the most disgusting movies ever made.
But that's exactly the point. Tom Six didn't set out to make a beloved piece of cinema when he did Human Centipede. He wasn't trying to drastically change the landscape of cinema forever. He's a man with a creative enough mind to dream up something this ridiculously politically incorrect, and then find the means to make it a reality.
As a horror movie, the plot is extremely basic and has more cliches than most people would care to admit, but you don't put a movie like this on for the plot. The primary value this movie has is the shock vactor. It's a movie you get a couple of friends together to watch because of the morbid curiosity that most people have, which makes you wonder just how far they're willing to go. It's not a movie for the squeamish or the soft, nor is it a movie for perverted people.

LOL) find themselves stranded in the forest, then manage to make it to this crazy doctor bent on creating the titular experiment in medicine/science. Other than the obvious disgust, I had two basic reactions to this movie. The first half I reacted similarly to how I heard Spanish audiences react- with laughter. I am like- NO effin way! LOL Laughing at the doctor's crazy antics, the dumb things those two American girls would do. Now, jump ahead to the second act, and the three people are conjoined from mouth to anus, with the excrement from the one person feeding the person behind them. Now, at first I thought in the doc's little showcase of what he was about to do (I heard this was for the director's own horror), that the digestion systems of the three would be altered so food would go through them in stages. This is not the case, however, yes- just as disgusting as you can imagine! LOL Well, for me, I'm thinking now, this is simply murder since the two in back are just ingesting the toxins coming from the person in front of them- and this doc didn't think things through well enough.

68,rooee,Tom Sicks,2,1 September 2011,"Owing a little something to envelope pusher extraordinaire Takashi Miike, not to mention Pier Paolo Pasolini (plus a dash of Lars Von Trier), Tom Six has created a mad professor movie whose title tells you everything you need to know. Now you just need to sit down and endure it. Like Salo, A Serbian Film et al, this is too absurd to be taken seriously, too ugly to be satirical, and displays a paranoid need on the part of the filmmaker to produce physical revulsion in its audience, rather than, say, skilfully disarm, disturb or unsettle us.I started wondering halfway through – long after the stitching was done – whether the shooting script contained lengthy sections where the only directions were ""Jenny mumbles desperately"". It's not a movie to admire the nuanced dialogue, but rather to marvel at the elaborate mode of torture – or (more likely, given waning attention levels) the pristine upholstery and Dr Heiter's (Dieter Laser) geometrically perfect feng shui.Perhaps Six should have considered holding back the flagpole operation a little longer, because this is a film carried on its high concept, and one which hardly eschews cliché: from the shallow late-teen victims (who are presumably being taught a ""lesson"") to the bumbling cops who want a peek in the cellar, Six embraces the sub-genre and leaves no expectation unsatisfied. Which, paradoxically, is hugely unsatisfying.Ebert famously stated that The Human Centipede belongs to a world where the stars don't shine. But I think they do – they just shine dimly and depressingly over an artform where even independents lack ideas. Perhaps the oral-anal chain is a symbol for endlessly regurgitated homogeneity; perhaps the lack of invention, atmosphere or genuine tension is a joke on us, the audience, as we somehow struggle through to the 90th minute, consuming without thought, without choice.Thankfully, we do have a choice – we can watch Dogtooth instead.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

If it were not for the infectious spirit of the audience, I probably would have shut it off from boredom with a home viewing. For those hoping to watch a geek show that crosses the line, there's not a single money shot in this cheaply thrown together trash and the execution is so poor that you can't help but have a condescending smirk for most of the running time. The out of left field concept of running a digestive tract through a few people sewn ass to mouth, is certainly, um, different, but any marks for originality end at the concept. Though I would have loved if Tom Six recorded all of his investor pitches when shopping the script around. The dialogue delivery of the two girls before their mouths are full of something entirely else, are porn quality at best. The super hammy performance by Dieter Laser is at least committed to this nonsense and he's absurd enough to hold your attention and get some laughs.

A twisted concept exists in the mind of director Tom Six, but it's one that doesn't take shape due to a number of factors. First off, the acting is undeniably questionable, chiefly the trio that make up the 'human centipede' and the doctor whose mental state engulfs rational thinking. Grief is not felt for the blithering three, as the girls' (Ashley C. Williams and Ashlynn Yennie) common sense doesn't kick in until miles after it's too late. They're strapped to hospital gurneys, ready for their procedure, just as a young Japanese man is. The questions that will be filling your mind do come (no spoilers here) as Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser) runs through the conventional duties an owner would do with his pet. Loopholes are aplenty, the most obvious being the centipede's attachments and whether it's possible. Others exists, but that's for you to find and decide for yourselves. The Human Centipede has quickly become a cult film, but for the wrong reasons.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
72,druid333-2,You May Want To Take A Pass On That Sloppy Italian Dinner Before (or after) This Film,8,20 August 2010,"Tom Six is a director from the Netherlands who's films are something of an acquired taste (he has not always made it easy for audiences to warm up to his dark humour). The Human Centipede (First Sequence)is another addition to his back log of films. In this one,two attractive young women from America,Lindsay & Jennie are traveling through Germany. They are invited to a party one night. While driving to the party,they experience a flat tyre in the middle of some dark woods. Walking around for hours (and in a rain storm to up the ante),they come upon a house in the middle of nowhere. They find out that the owner of the house is one Dr.Heiter,a once brilliant surgeon,who had successfully separated conjoined twins,but was kicked out & had his license suspended for unethical experiments. It seems the good doctor is looking for human victims for his latest experiment:the construction of a human centipede. What follows is an exercise in what is being regarded as one of the sickest,grotesque moments in cinema (which I digress:certainly there are things way more gross & disturbing out there,either in porn,underground video/film release, or on-line). Either way,most audiences are in for a corker of a roller coaster ride at whatever cinema will screen this. According to legend, Tom Six is currently at work on the next episode of this film,which is being co titled ""Full Sequence"" (and will make this film seem like 'My Little Pony',in terms of shock value). Dieter Laster plays what has to be one of the most deranged mad doctors since Udo Kier played Baron Frankenstein in Paul Morrisey's 'Flesh For Frankenstein' (released in the United States as 'Andy Warhol's Frankenstein',which was for it's time pretty extreme,as it received the dreaded 'X'rating for it's gory content),as the intense & deranged Dr.Heiter. Ashley Williams is Lindsay,Ashlynn Yennie is Jennie,Akihiro Kitamura is Katsuro. With Peter Blankenstein,Andreas Leupold,Bernd Kostrau & Rene de Witt.Tom Six writes,directs & edits this parable in unorthodox medical experiments that will obviously thrill some,and totally disgust others. You have been warned. Spoken in English,and German & Japanese with English subtitles. Not rated by the MPAA,this film contains outbursts of strong language,bloody violence & some truly disturbing images that are grotesque.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
73,Thrashman88,...If Only They Knew How To Change A Flat Tire!,7,1 September 2013,"""The Human Centipede"" will definitely repulse most of its viewers. It's not so much as gore-filled as say, ""Hostel"" or ""Zombie"", but it's the idea behind the movie that will leave a lingering, nauseating feeling days after you've seen it. The story is simple: 2 American girls on vacation in Germany are invited to a party. They rent a car and on their way they get a flat tire. Unable to fix the problem by themselves they walk in the middle of the rainy night and arrive at what looks like a decent, upper class residence. A creepy old man let's them in so the girls can use his phone. Right from the start we know this guy is evil through and through. It seems the German guy is a respected surgeon, known for his ""siamese twins"" separation procedures. But the guy (who is ironically called ""Josef"", a nod to the angel of death himself: Josef Mengele)wants to try a new surgical procedure on the girls and with the help of another victim (a Japanese guys), he will create what he dubs, ""The Human Centipede"". No explanation is given as to why this Josef guy wants to do a procedure that serves no purpose at all (unless he wants to sell freaks to traveling circuses), nor any background is ever mentioned or hinted at (it seems the director wanted to avoid any audience sympathy for this deranged doctor). Still, ""The Human Centipede"" remains a harrowing experience to watch.When the movie was over, all I could think of was that the girls would've save themselves from A LOT of trouble had they known how to change a flat tire. Sure, they were going to a fancy party, were all dressed up and stuff but they never ever checked for a tire replacement in the trunk. They thought it would be ""much easier"" to walk in the middle of the night with the pouring rain on them in a country where they barely knew anyone or the language. If it was me directing, I'd call this flick, ""The Flat Tire""!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Part of me doesn't even want to attempt reviewing this one. But I'll give it my best shot. HUMAN CENTIPEDE is not so much a viewing experience as an endurance test. Think SAW or HOSTEL and then multiply that kind of, uh-hum, plot by a hundred. It's a curiosity, for sure. But it's not enjoyable to watch or sit through. Okay, here's the story: In Germany, a mad surgeon kidnaps three people (a Japanese man and two girls from New York) and performs a horrible experiment on them, where each person's mouth is attached to the other person's behind, creating a human centipede. And from there, the trio is continually humiliated and abused by the doctor. Naturally, they make attempts to escape to no avail. Even when the police finally show up at the house, they are so incompetent! By the end, I couldn't help but wonder if the director, Tom Six, gets some kind of a kick from this sort of thing.

78,jerekra,It is what is is.................,4,21 April 2013,"Upon hearing about the Human Centipede for the first time, I must admit that the concept was pretty revolting to me. I tried to make it a point to never ever see it in my entire life. However eventually I decided that I maybe should see it so that I can confront it head on and then that would be the end of it. So I watched it eventually with a few of my friends. It was a mixed bag.Basically it is about two girls who wander upon a house that is in the middle of the woods. The man who lives there drugs them and ties them down and kidnaps another man and then reveals his plans for them. He is a retired surgeon and his plan is to connect the three of them...........mouth to anus................thus making a human centipede.For an independent film.......I guess this film was what I expected. The acting is pretty bad, except the creepy surgeon guy I thought was good. The story is pretty predictable in how it starts out.As far as disturbing goes............this film might be one of the most disturbing ideas ever thought about. The whole idea of being connected to another person's anus is pretty much as bad as it gets. When the centipede gets created and the people see what happened to them it is pretty sad for them. I actually felt bad for them.Its a pretty cheap horror film with a disturbing concept. I can not really recommend it. But if you like disturbing things happening to people, maybe check it out.

79,dschmeding,This is a misguided comedy,3,10 May 2010,"When I read the plot of this movie I thought this movie must be incredibly sick and sure it is but the movie has nothing but the basic disgusting idea going that you can read in the plot.Its pretty cheap shock value in that department because the movie is a basic horror set-up with 2 dumb girls having a break down and ending up in a mad scientists house (Rocky Horror Picture Show anyone??). From here on the movie takes an incredibly slow pacing in order to fill a feature movie with one basic sick idea. Its all set in the house of the evil doctor who drugs his victims with roofies (or a tranquilizer gun when hunting outside). The doctor who specialized in Siamese twin operations soon introduces his reverse Siamese twin operation to the unsuspecting victims with an incredibly ridiculous overhead presentation using some sketches that look like drawn by a child. At this point anyone must realize that either director Tom Six is an idiot or he has a strange kind of humor. Showing these sketches in a movie with a tag-line ""100% medically accurate"" is a joke by any means. The previous experiment with dogs that is presented with the doc sadly watching photos of his ""3-dog"" and having a gravestone engraved with ""My sweet 3-dog"" in his backyard are a joke.And after the ""operation"" which is hardly shown you just see the 2 girls plus 1 guy in the front walking through the doctors house. The front guy is Japanese and talks Japanese throughout the movie (which is stupid for a tourist in Germany)... the girls are Americans, the other actors are German and so they keep talking in all these languages with subtitles while the doc makes them sit by the pool or teaches them to fetch the morning paper.See... this is a joke, a really bad one that seems to try to be artsy with the long use of crane shots and mixing several languages, using no music etc. Bestpart is when the polices comes watching for the missing persons and the doctor decides to also drug them to add them to his experiment... WTF?This movie is ridiculous... the characters have no depth or motivation, the acting is often mediocre and the horror is non-existent except for the basic mindf**k everybody hooks on to.I won't even go in the basic absurdity of it all that would leave the front guy with everyone behind him poisoned. Although director Tom Six seems rather serious in his interviews I hope for his own sake that this movie is the misguided comedy I take it for.

This movie plays like a B movie side show act. Six looks only to use simplistic story telling techniques and minimal character development to bring his creation to life. This movie was made only to shock and disgust and rarely does either effectively.The story line is quite generic and could be lifted from numerous other horror films. Two American college girls traveling in Europe are on their way to a party when their car breaks down in the countryside. Both girls are extremely annoying and shallow New Yorkers who brave the rain to find a house occupied by a mad German doctor/scientist, played by Dieter Laser (I love that name). Perhaps the best part of the movie is Laser's performance as the insane doctor who will stop at nothing to create this monster. Along with a Japanese guy, it is explained that the surgery will connect the three young people ass to mouth to create a ""medically accurate"" new animal. And why does he want to this? Probably either for shits and giggles or to launch a new German fetish porn site. The movie promises a Human Centipede and you eventually get a Human Centipede. While there are some sick and twisted images, it really does little to create a sense of empathy for the characters that are in the unfortunate positions. Then comes the question of once you've created a Human Centipede, what do you do with it? He takes it out in the back yard for a bit, then at night he locks it up in a cageTom Six is currently in post production for next year's sequel which promises a longer centipede and hopefully a better plot.

Tom six
2009""The Human Centipede"" is a fun film and you will find it so if you like mad-scientist, serial-killer, slasher films. Dieter Laser was the perfect choice for playing Dr Heiter who is a mad, eccentric, vile nut-job with the leer of a mantis. In no way does the surgeon display any humanity so in that respect the viewing experience isn't convoluted by misplaced sympathy. Ashley C Williams, Ashlynn Yennie and Akihiro Kitamura make a great centipede and I found myself yearning for them to escape the mantis-embrace of Heiter.
 Although there are weak points in the film's plot they do not bring the film down. Maybe if we had been shown Heiter hunting for segments more the film would have generated more hopelessness and terror.
 You will squirm, you will cringe, you will laugh, you will cover your mouth with your hand, you will long for a good outcome, and you will see a horror icon in Deiter Laser alike to Christopher Lee and Anthony Hopkins and I dub him ""THE HUMAN MANTIS"".

In reality, the Human Centipede has an admittedly gory idea but hardly any graphic content at all. It's a conventional horror film, with its usual gigantic plot holes (the characters never use the chance to escape or kill the villain), but the loony basic idea and the better-than-usual acting put it a little above the average.

88,metalrage666,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,1,19 November 2015,"Human Centipede is a horrid, despicable movie that really had no business being put to celluloid. I've watched my share of atrocities, but this is on a whole new level and I had heard that many potential actors simply walked off the set once they realised what they had to do and what the movie was about, and on watching this, I wouldn't be at all surprised if that were true.Set in Germany, the plot centres around 2 American female tourists on a holiday through Europe. They decide to go out to a nightclub and on their way there, the hire car gets a flat tyre and with no mobile phone reception (of course) they are for all intents and purposes, stranded. A car does come along, but the driver is not interested in helping them and makes a number of sexual comments instead, but with the 2 tourists not being able to understand a word of German they don't really get it. Eventually they cotton on to what he's on about and ignore him. The girls then decide to take a walk through unknown woods in an unknown country in the middle of the night to try and find help. Why they didn't just follow the road they were on in anyone's guess. Although given the title of the movie, we're not discussing Shakespeare here. After a heated, childish argument and soaking rain, the 2 girls come across a rather nice well kept home owned by a renowned and retired German doctor made famous by performing separations of conjoined twins. At some point however he's turned quite mad and is now more interested in joining people together in the worst way possible. No explanation is ever really given as to why he went in this direction. After a healthy dose of Rohypnol, the girls pass out. When they awake they are bound to hospital beds in the basement, along with another victim, a truck driver captured earlier. The truckie is then killed as he's now considered incompatible with the 2 girls. A third tourist, a Japanese man, is captured and brought to the house. All three victims are then shown a makeshift slide show outlining their fate as unwilling participants for a human centipede where they will be surgically joined together sharing the same digestive tract. Apparently the doctor had moderate success when he performed the same operation on his 3 rottweiler dogs and even though they all died from the operation, if at first you don't succeed, yadda, yadda, yadda.It sounds repulsive and abhorrent and it is. After the ""success"" of the operation, the Japanese tourist being at the front of the centipede, spends most of his time screaming abuse at the doctor or trying to raise the alarm. The 2 girls being the middle and end of the centipede are, for all intents and purposes, effectively silenced for the rest of the movie however spend the entire time sobbing. The doctor then goes about trying to ""train"" his new centipede pet, (what for is also never revealed), but it is what it is. The scene where victim one has to defecate right into the mouth of victim two is particularly repellent, but that action is the crux of the movie. In reality, the 2nd and 3rd victims will never get the nutrients they need from the waste of victim one and subsequently victim 2, so the absurdity of the experiment should be obvious.In the end the experiment fails, as it was doomed to. After an attempted escape, the Japanese tourist kills himself by slicing open his own throat. The girl at the end of the line dies as she develops a blood infection, leaving the girl in the middle surgically stuck between 2 dead people. Two detectives investigating the missing persons are also killed who in turn manage to also kill the doctor with a lucky shot to the head. The movie ends with the fate of the middle centipede victim left unknown.This movie has no redeeming quality whatsoever. It's complete drivel from start to finish and I had read that the premise of this movie stems from a joke about criminals and quite frankly that's where this should've stayed. The fact that this god-awful mess has spawned 2 sequels is a sad testament to the state of what the human race considers ""entertainment"".

The only good actor was Dieter Laser. He was one creepy guy. But for example lets take Ashley Williams and Ashlynn Yennie. These two girls were horrible at acting. The fake crying was the worst. It really got to the point of annoying. I see what they were trying to do with this film. Sewing three people together to make a human centipede. Yeah I get it. But how it was done, I don't get it.

92,Simon_Says_Movies,Intriguing or repulsive? (likely both),8,10 May 2010,"It is very difficult to review a movie called The Human Centipede (First Sequence). There is little chance one will be lured to a viewing under false pretences so if a movie delivers what you expect, is it not then an undisputable success? Yes and no as the film is a struggle between concept, execution and nausea but what is admirable, in addition to its fearless boundary pushing, is its restraint. Yes you read that correctly, restraint. Contrary to so many of the torture porn films that try to punch up the shock value through sadism The Human Centipede has almost no blood and lets your imagination fill in the horrific blanks.If you know nothing about this movie, allow me to enlighten you. The film revolves around a deranged surgeon who propels the old hallmark of a 'mad doctor' to delirious extremes. He kidnaps people and sews them together mouth to anus (yes you also read that correctly). Through that procedure which involves removal of the teeth and stitching together the skin of the forward and rear victim, the gastric system is thereby connected. This combined with slicing ligaments in the knees to prevent erect walking and you got yourself one human centipede.Likely, your mind is already made up on if you want to see this movie; you are either intrigued or repulsed (likely both). What elevates The Human Centipede from its high concept is the tension, the elements of pitch black humour, the subtle skewering of horror conventions and finally the performance of the main villain. The good Doctor Heiter is played by German Dieter Laser (or as I like to pronounce in a bad Arnold Schwarzenegger impression, 'Deeder Lazer') and he is truly terrifying; icy, ruthless and completely unsympathetic towards his captives. He has no motives behind his motives. His drive to create this abomination stems from the death of his '3-dog', which I'm sure you can fathom what that entails, but his desire to attempt anything in this realm to being with is never explored.The Human Centipede is directed by Tom Six and the man knows how to terrify and disgust in unison. The movie does lose some of its momentum around the ¾ mark but bursts back to life at the finale. The final scene is perhaps the most powerful and affecting in the entire movie and stayed with me far after the initial shock had faded. The slogan for this movie reads '100% medically accurate' and while I'm unsure of the validity of that statement it really stands as a moot point; plausible or preposterous, The Human Centipede does its job the best since the original Saw.Tom Six is already planning a sequel entitled The Human Centipede (Full Sequence). The dark cloud that looms over this project will be the tendency of directors to try an one-up their originals, usually through increased gore, instead of expanding upon the elements that worked, such as the tension and the allowed space for the viewers mind to go wild. Necessity of a follow-up aside, this is one of the single most brazen and memorable works of horror in many years; see it if you dare.Read my review of the sequel: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1530509/reviews-106",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
93,thisissubtitledmovies,pushes it out a little further than most are comfortably used to,8,20 August 2010,"Few would have thought that a joke between Tom Six and friends would ultimately result in the film that has provoked worldwide debate over its release and certification.The cinematography adds to the atmosphere of the film in every aspect. Though not always as flashy as it promised, a delightful light flare during an early scene promised a visually stunning film. These moments of great style are infrequent, with Six preferring to allow the cinematography, like the narrative, to play servant to the horrific set pieces that the film is punctuated with. The look of the film, alongside the lead's performance, is played straight and is clinical. All precautions are taken to prevent the film from lapsing into a hammed up gore flick of little merit or mood.Though the film has its faults, mostly in the unimaginative set up for the main body of the narrative, it also has a lot going for it. The Human Centipede is actually quite an old fashioned horror film that has sutured together the key elements in any film of its genre, and then pushes it out a little further than most are comfortably used to.

94,piratecannon,Limping Along,3,27 December 2012,"Since its release in 2009, The Human Centipede has earned quite the reputation as a downright sickening horror film that's not easily forgotten. After finally working up the nerve to watch Tom Six's first major studio production, I can confirm that it is, in fact, every bit as gross as rumors have indicated. It's also completely ridiculous.If you haven't heard anything about this movie, here's the deal: Dr. Heiter, a retired surgeon who became famous for his ability to successfully separate Siamese twins, has made it his mission to drug and kidnap those stupid enough to venture near his secluded German homestead. He does this in an effort to create the first ""human centipede"" (it's pretty much exactly what the name implies). Heiter explains to his victims that he will remove their kneecaps and sew their mouths to another person's corresponding private-area to create a ""chained"" organism. Why he wants to do this is never fully explained, though we're told he successfully completed the procedure on this three Rottweilers.In short, he's bonkers.As disturbing as the premise is in and of itself, The Human Centipede is proof positive that a movie cannot survive on concept alone. From the get-go, it suffers from the atrocious acting of its two female protagonists: Lindsay and Jenny. They're obnoxious Americans who decide to go clubbing while on a tour of Europe. When their rental car is crippled by a flat tire on a dark country road, they venture through the wilderness to try and get help. Eventually, they encounter the good doctor, who invites them in for drinks and creepy banter.Though it's hard not to feel some sympathy for these young ladies because of the utterly horrendous situation we know they'll end up in, their idiotic decisions create a ""serves-you-right"" attitude that's hard to shake. This is one of those horror flicks where you'll find yourself yelling at the television in a vain attempt to prevent the girls from succumbing to every cliché any person with a temporal lobe would know to avoid in the given situation.The movie does start to show some promise once the gut-wrenching transformation has taken place—I have to imagine part of this has to do with the fact that our two female leads are no longer able to speak—but just as things are looking up (in terms of the film mustering a tangible fear factor) a rushed resolution—and I use that term very loosely—to the whole endeavor brings the proceedings to a screeching halt. As was the case with the first third of the film, what we see happen in the end is the result of shoddy writing and nonsensical decisions by all of the characters we're otherwise supposed to be emotionally invested in.I can't resist the irony implicit in the title, which accurately reflects my assessment: The Human Centipede blunders from scene to scene as if fatally wounded, and is never able to gain the momentum or complexity that could have made it one of the horror greats.Better luck with the next sequence.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The scariest part of the film was when the girls had a blow out on the road at the beginning.The acting by both of the girls was absolutely abysmal.A really boring film which would be better renamed 'bandage appendage' or something like that. I could have hooked up better effects than this in my living room with me, the wife and the dog.What a yawn.

96,MovieProductions,"Gross, boring; one of the worst movies ever made",1,31 March 2011,"Zero stars out of (****)Out of all the most god-awful atrocities to hit the silver screen of the past decade, making people cringe with the thought of losing their hard-earned dough, ""The Human Centipede"" takes the cake for the worst film. No film thus far has been this repugnant, and juvenile in a while. At the same, just dull. No words can express how much I loathe this film. From the opening shot to the last, I sat there dry heaving, while waiting for a single interesting moment to happen. If your titillation is gross-out gags, then so be it. But when your product is so tedious and uninviting, I could care less about chucking up my last meal.Oh where to start? The acting is absolutely the worst I've seen. Honestly, these actors should've walked away with Razzies in their hand. I could not stand those four knuckleheads. I've seen better acting in recent M. Night Shyamalan films. And yes, that's saying a lot. Furthermore, the script is unbelievably unrealistic and nonsensical. The decisions these characters make are just unwatchable because of their sheer stupidity. Literally a woman is running from a man, while there's a working telephone right next to her, so what does she do? She doesn't bother to look, and ends up running to a room. Not only that, but she drags out an unconscious character, taking her dandy, sweet time. But no, the killer can't possibly be there! And the stupidity doesn't just end there. Save your excuses. Even the dumbest situation I can be in won't even compare to match the mind-numbingly idiotic situation these goofballs have gotten themselves into. Not to mention the direction is just so awful. Every scene is dragged out, poorly acted, and poorly staged. For being a gross film, I did almost dry-heave, but not once did I even puke, or think, ""wow, this is really interesting."" If your purpose is to make a ""2 Girls 1 Cup""-esque plot, and not entertain your audience in any way possible, that is just a waste of celluloid. All in all, save your time. Save your money. This might be the worst movie I've seen of all time. That's a strong statement, but honestly, I can't remember being this uninterested or repulsed by a film in a long time. I'm just glad this film is slowly fading away from my memory. With all the movies to see, why choose this one?",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
97,slake09,Don't believe the hype,3,22 May 2010,"This movie got a lot of hype for how bizarre, shocking and original it is. Unfortunately, the hype is wrong. The movie is a one-trick pony: once you get over the idea of connecting a bunch of people into a centipede, there is nothing else going on.The shock comes when the evil doctor sews everyone together. That gets old after a few minutes; before and after that you get the standard horror story you've seen a million times.I watched this because everything I heard said it was original, shocking, and different from any other horror movie out there. There is a bit of originality, but basically the movie just isn't that good. Maybe in the sequel they can keep it going.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The performance of Dieter Laser is really impressive and fortunately he is strong enough to carry the movie on his shoulders, which two german girls do what they can unfortunately they have their mouth full for a long time so the actresses take a long time to make it difficult also have to get around on the floor. ""Mr. Kamikaze"" is surprisingly the second best actor because he communicates all the time in his native language does not understand him and he manages to convince through gestures and facial expressions to communicate with all people and even to communicate with the audience.But the whole movie is such a boring one-man show that I can not understand how one could even believe to be able to fill a whole movie with this dry concept, much less a horror movie.

100,TheEtherWalk,"""Next thing you know he's gonna want to arrange a meeting, where he will gas you, stuff you in the back of his van and make a wind chime out of your genitals.""",7,10 June 2010,"This line from Eurotrip is all I could think of during the first half hour of this film. I mean the premise couldn't get more bizarre, and I was expecting just another torture porn fiasco. But by the end, it turned out to be a rather fascinating study of madness and doomed obsession with playing God.What really holds this all together is the performances of Dieter Laser and Akihiro Kitamura as the Japanese man used as the 'head' of the centipede. The two girls never really get a chance to act beyond the first 20 minutes, but with a premise like this it's understandable; Their mouths are basically sewn shut for the majority of the film. (Insert misogynist joke here.) They can only communicate by holding each others hands and mumbling. Kitamura however is literally like a mad dog on screen, bristling with anger and the will to escape and exact his revenge. He represents the determination of all creatures to be free of the will of others, which makes him the most relatable character.Then we get to Dr. Heiter. Dieter Laser is effortlessly creepy as the Frankensteinish surgeon. He lives in an out-of-the-way house in the woods, and his obsession seems to center around the passing of ""three dog"", his Siamese triplet dog who he appears intent on resurrecting. This is never explored fully but it seems like a logical explanation. Heiter's house is one of my favourite things about this film. Its maze-like hallways are only ever lit by natural light, giving the film a claustrophobic feel and ratcheting up the tension in certain scenes.Don't see this movie expecting another Hostel. Very little of the actual surgery is shown, which is kind of refreshing. The movie never goes for shock value, opting for a more humanistic approach. There's a few squeamish scenes but you won't be vomiting in your popcorn or anything. I also loved the ending, which is as thematically fascinating as it is satisfyingly bloody. Despite having one of the strangest premises in recent memory, this film is easy to recommend. If you can get past the rather silly opening setup and the doomed-from-the-start evil plot, there's a lot to enjoy here. It was also scary enough to give me nightmares, which not many films can accomplish.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

A repugnant, ugly, repulsive, and overwhelming terrible movie. Few films have nothing at all redeeming in them but this is one of them magnified 100 times. The supremely untalented director, Tom Six, is almost criminal in his abuse of the audience. His imagery is unholy in its intense perversion and crushing in its utter depravity.

103,mdnobles19,Not half bad but needs a better ending,6,1 May 2010,"Much like the Hostel films this movie aims to shock, terrify and repulse and much like a nightmare you beg for it to stop. This movie raises the bar when it comes to grotesque, stomach turning violence and is a crazy new turn in the horror genre yet it has similar elements from other films like Martyrs, Hostel, Pig, Vacancy etc. which doesn't make it feel that original as it should have been and it just ended up being a rehash of them than surpassing them but I'm happy to say that it didn't suck balls like Martyrs and the horrendous Pig which made you mad, annoyed and frustrated than anything. I thought that Dieter Laser plays an fantastic psychopath and chilled me to the bone and he is a villain that could give anybody nightmares, great work! The supporting cast was OK but over acted sometimes but I have to give it to them for making their horrible situation raw and not make it a laughing stock which it could have been. The ending was a little bit of a let down and was anti climatic and I really didn't think it went to the lengths which it could of gone but it definitely backs up its title The Human Centipede because while you like it or not you will see one in this movie, bring a bucket just in case! I really don't know how they're going to do a sequel to this it just doesn't make sense right now other than following it from the ending but where will it go from there unless it's a prequel which I can picture that happening than a straight up sequel, I'm interested to see what they're going to do with it. Overall I didn't love it or despise it I just thought it was a very descent, well made shocker that's bolder than most Hollywood theatrical released horror movies these days and I give kudos to the cast and crew for that and it had me glued to my seat in horror on what was going on and that's what a horror movie should do and I recommend it.

104,twilliams76,What the F?!?,5,9 July 2011,"This is a disturbingly twisted, absurd yet original movie ... and it is the first of three! Made on a miniscule budget, The Human Centipede gives its audience some truly horrid moments. Two young (and annoying) American girls are in Europe and headed to a club when their rental car blows a tire in the middle of nowhere after dark (in these types of horror films -- surprise, surprise!). Needing assistance, they seek out the nearest shelter ... which just happens to be inhabited by Dr. Crazy-Psycho-Sick-Brained-Bastard. Offering the girls water while he ""calls"" for help, he has secretly drugged them to get them where he wants them (them along with another unfortunate third).From the VERY literal and non-misleading title of the movie ... one can pretty much assume what he wants them to become. This is one of the sickest movies I have probably ever come across, and yet ... it is watchable -- highly watchable (as one continually asks themselves WHAT is coming next?!).German actor Dieter Laser plays the mad doctor (who was world-renowned for separating Siamese twins) very well as he is most-convincing as a warped genius (who has LOST it). He may play for some slight camp ... but in this movie its allowed to work. There are many, many, many plot holes (or craters) here and there throughout the movie, but they can be overlooked because something with a title-like-this is given some liberties.While this film was titled specifically for the curious-minded, it is not for the feint of heart or queasy.

It isn't even really a movie, just a single idea stretched out. The central concept - of three people surgically stitched anus-to-mouth - holds a certain sick fascination, but that appeal could have been exhausted by a 2-minute short film, or even a set of photographs.Instead, writer-director Tom Six appended the straightforward illustration with a drama about how it would arise. Spoilers: it's just how you might think. Just try to imagine the circumstances that would lead to someone doing this, and what would follow on from it. I can guarantee your answers will be no worse than Six's, and probably better.

That's it, it's not a thriller, it's not a comedy, it's not a drama, to my knowledge it wasn't even marketed so it would be unfair to claim that it was hyped or has misleading marketing. As with all horror it's subjective, if you're the sort of person that spots errors in 'paranormal activity' or 'blair witch' instead of allowing yourself to be engorged in emoting with the main characters.... well you're not going to like centipede. Personally I found it horrifying to imagine, for two hours, how I would feel if I was part of a human centipede and in that situation.

Horror as it should be!!",10,16 October 2010,"Well, well, now, this is a little gem we have here, a rarity in the world of horror, a film that refuses to pander to a moronic audience. The brain-dead audience that is expecting the happy ending to come soothe their souls, the audience that truly believes that ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is pure horror. ""Oooooh, how exciting, and a little bit terrifying, I'll go along for the thrill ride, but I expect that everything returns to normal afterwards.""For me, horror is not about cheap scares, creaking doors, horror is about a pervasive, life- denying, sickening atmosphere, horror is pure misanthropy, an utter negativity that is alien to petty, human existence. And that is why this film is so brilliant in its design and execution; there is absolutely nothing redeeming here, there is not the slightest glimmer of hope, you feel a wonderful calm when you know that these sheepish human beings are being sent straight into pure hell, without a chance of escape.

Ha, ha, congrats nay-sayer, you could not have given a better review, a more healthy recommendation, your pointing finger is like honey to flies. On the other hand you have the intelligentsia, the academic high-brows who seems completely unable to watch a horror film without soiling its pure and visceral nature, by dragging it down into the mud of multi-layered meaning. Well, I guess it is much easier for squeamish minds to digest a horror-film of this nature if you consider the film to be a giant metaphor, if you intellectualize it, you thereby pacify it. Are you really unable to watch a horror-film of this sort without demeaning it to a lowly position of a social commentary? How sad.

They usually contain over-the-top acting and doses of black humor. The first couple of ""Saw"" movies, the ""Final Destination"" series, and classics such as ""Re-Animator"" come to mind.Unfortunately, ""Human Centipede"" is just gross. If extreme or shock horror movies are on your radar, then you already know the premise. The actor playing ""Dieter,"" the deranged surgeon does a great job with the part and definitely has the look for such a role (he would make a great SS agent in a Nazi movie). The two girls and the guy who become the title character also show the right amounts of shock and disgust when they realize what will become of them. The movie is also shot and edited well. That's where the positives end, however.It's possible that nowadays people make movies with an eye toward what fans on forums such as these will say about them.

117,unemployedvirgin,The Mad Scientist Just Got Cooler!,8,18 December 2010,"THE CURIOSITY: Before pushing the play button - keywords ran through my head with little information i had from the trailer. Words like ""nazi doctor Frankenstein Udo Kier gore-fest cannibal rim-job"". The director's idea intrigued me alone, since i had doubts about how something like this could be shown on screen.WATCHING THE FILM: Okay time to state the opinions! Firstly i liked the fact that the two girls weren't the typical blonde personality whores of the usual horror flick, instead you were coaxed on by grown women. Dieter Laser was amazing, just what i had in mind with an added sprinkle of insanity. Tom Six has a eye for cinematography, a step by step dissection of the subject matter and ballsy enough not to shy away from the reality aspect. I didn't find it distastefully gory though - to my surprise. It was more about the concept itself that shocked me, simply because we can all make funny jokes about: flaming farts, assassinations, methods of torture. But to see an idea in action is a whole different experience. Also, the use of having no soundtrack songs was great, good old composition music at appropriate intervals - basically it builds tension. This movie is appropriate for the times we're in if you think about it - these are the days of 2 Girls 1 Cup, man dies from being ""bummed"" by horse, war crimes in various countries..etc. I find myself thinking right now as i'm typing this, it says a lot about how much we've evolved in the last 100 years of cinema. FINAL THOUGHTS: Brilliant exploration/exploitation horror, hints of black humour made it easier to digest (pardon the pun). Hope the sequel is as good if not better, to be honest this one ain't for the squeamish ones out there who faint at the sight of blood. Yes the images and concepts you see will stay in your head (probably for a couple days) but it's so worth viewing.

118,darklydreamingrahu,Mad scientists rejoice!,7,15 October 2011,"A lot of ""free speech believers"" claim this movie should be banned. That fact alone garnered an additional star from me.Mr. Laser is a phenomenal mad scientist. He barely even has to act. His face alone is enough to creep you out. The concept is twisted and the execution is depraved. If you've seen films like Hostel or Salo, and not freaked out or fainted, don't expect to see something worse. The gore in this one, for the most part, is implied. This low-budget gag-fest does a great job of giving you just enough indications to keep your mouth open and your eyes glued. Aside from Dieter Laser, the acting in this film is atrocious. The two lead females are two of the most annoying characters (prior to both of them not being able to talk) I've seen in a long time. To be fair, they do a decent job of on-screen crying and looking really scared. The Japanese guy is decent, and has a really well-acted scene at the end.Overall, this is a decent low-budget horror flick with solid scenery and great usage of lighting and atmosphere. The centipede is twisted enough to keep a horror fan's interest, but not so over-the-top that it looks cheesy. Anybody that says any film should be banned should re-evaluate their values. This is fiction and everyone has a voice....even if it's one you don't like. Really this movie is a 5/10 or 6/10 if I'm feeling generous, but because it has offended so many mainstream movie-goers so badly that they feel the need to sign up on IMDb and WARN the world and call for a ban....it gets a 7/10.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
119,PKazee,Hilarious comedy!,9,29 July 2010,"I'm surprised at how relatively few of the reviews mention that this is a comedy. Perhaps its the difference between watching it alone at home, or watching it with a large festival audience. I saw this with roughly 1000 people at the Fantasia Film Festival and everyone was roaring with laughter. The tone is set right off the bat when a truck driver pulls over to take a crap in the woods and is shot with a dart while his pants are around his ankles. In another scene, a Japanese guy is captured and hollers something to the effect of ""Watch out! We Japanese are known to have superhuman strength when cornered!"" There's also the ""My Sweet 3-Hound"" tombstone, and the framed picture of the 3-Hound creation on the droll Nazi's TV set, both of which serve quite well as guideposts toward the comic tone of the film.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

121,scoup,Why all the hatred of this movie?,9,15 March 2012,"I have no idea why so many people have rated this movie so low. There must have been a group protesting the disturbing and twisted story idea. (Interesting side note - many reviewers have only reviewed 1 movie - this one).Let's get one thing straight - this is a Horror movie and I was truly Horrified! Mission accomplished and credit due to the producer/writer.Horror movies are supposed to invoke fear and suspense. I thought the actors were excellent and I felt their terror and pain.Human Centipede was visceral and engaging. At no point did I think that there was gratuitous gore or violence. If I am correct, I do not believe that one bare boob was shown; if there was one, then that goes doubly to prove this movie was engrossing because I don't remember it. Third, there are over 300 reviews of this movie with many expressing disgust and revulsion; it has gotten people fired up enough to comment so I believe it is successful in its purpose. Definition of Horror: 1. An intense, painful feeling of repugnance and fear. 2. Intense dislike; abhorrence. 4. Informal Something unpleasant, ugly, or disagreeable. Please take a moment to read some of the reviews so that you too can enjoy the irony of people describing the aforementioned qualities to the HORROR movie they just watched. Sublime...Comic relief - there was just enough of it with the rantings of the Japanese guy to offset the tension. He cracked me up.Were there plot holes? Yes, a couple. But nothing worth noting.Regarding the concerns of believability and technicality, please check out IMDb's top 250 movie and laugh at the number which stretch in the areas of ""believable and technical"" (I DO like these movies and in no way want a debate on details; just a generalization on being overly critical of a horror genre): Examples - Star Wars, Batman, Lord of the Rings, Inception, Matrix, Terminator, Toy Story, Raiders, etc...To each his own - and if you want to watch something horrible and disturbing, I recommend this.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
122,AnusPresley,One trick pony,4,29 December 2011,"And that's all this film really is - a one trick pony extended to 92 minutes, something that was no doubt conceived in a very drunken night at a pub and finally brought tortuously to life as a real project. For that I must commend Six - living up to the Henry Rollins maxim, ""don't talk about it, do it"", and damn what anyone thinks.The film itself for the bulk is a compendium of dumb z-grade slasher/horror clichés that, while annoying at first, does become interesting in that I think Six deliberately sought to pack as many as possible into the one place. As an exercise, that did keep my attention.The surgeon Dr. Heiter played by Dieter Laser is perfectly cast, and is really just a bargain basement Lance Henriksen clone - I think he has now assured himself work for life in similarly deranged roles for gutter cinema, a la Jeffrey Coombs. A dream job IMHO. Good luck to him. Love to buy him a beer.Overall though, this did fall well short of my expectations. As others have noted but, the ending is quite sadistically exquisite, leaving the sole surviving protagonist in a situation that should get posted to all the WWJD? forums out there. But as for the rest, there are no real surprises beyond the title premise.Rating this only 4/10 - sorry. Watching part 2 tonight and expecting improvement. But that said, this film is a must for the collection of any gutter cinema aficionado. No doubt about that. It is not a keeper for repeat viewing, but it is a nice thing to pull out for the visitors who boast they've seen it all.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The man cast as the doctor was just painful to watch, and the whining New Yorkers should have been killed off in the first 5 minutes to spare me their awful screen presence.Had it been acted by some known stars, it might have actually fared well. The script was junk.I'd like to end by saying this is the worst horror flick I've ever seen except for the four Paranormal films, but even they're better than this tripe.

I watched many horrors with really ugly things but this was too much for me. Man, compared to this the Saw films look like a Disney classic. Not mentioning the bad plot (good old Europe going wild again, no signal in Germany, etc. etc.) and that two extremely stupid chicks (who are unable to find out how to change a tire, who are going for help into the woods when there's a road and who don't call the police while staying long minutes in a locked up room near a phone) this story is just simply the sickest, most disgusting thing I've ever seen. How could this thing win awards? And how it is possible to make sequels to this lunatic nightmare? There is (or should be) a limit that shouldn't be crossed, even if it seems to be original. Writer and director Mr. Six states he wish to make original movies and pushing the boundaries. He should rather seek for professional help. There are stories that never should be told. This is one of them. I highly recommend to STAY AWAY from this.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

I started watching it by pure curiosity and almost halfway through I could not keep watching [...] this seems more oriented for some sort of pseudo-deranged group of people but I'm not quite sure how you can appreciate this movie if you have a straight mind.The acting is atrocious and especially both actresses who besides scream stupidly are kind of useless in the movie.The main doctor's personality is frantically boring. He's cold. I know this was the purpose but such distance just really does not help the case of the movie. There's no much of a story around him and why he was brought to doing that.The plot sucks considerably. There's just no story or anyways, if there is one, it's essentially flat and boring.

I had read about it and out of boredom decided to search for it & check it out. I will say straight out that if you are going into watching this hoping for any outrageous gore you will be severely disappointed. This is neither Hostel or Saw. It's disturbing in its own way but not in a gore hound sort of way. It's way too surgical & precise in it's execution to satisfy any of that sort of fetish. What we have here is a dark psychological thriller that's ripe with tension. One built within framework which is most decidedly shock and awe driven. It's power is in interestingly enough in the fact that it shows you so little. You know what it is you're viewing and you feel wrong for looking but at the same time you can't exactly look away either. It becomes in effect it's own guilty pleasure. It shows you only what it needs to (very little gore as I've mentioned ). Just enough bare bones for you to get a glimpse into the fantasy of this maniac surgeon. He has you, he has your attention, rather you want him to or not. The power to look away is no longer yours, you've become his captive audience & that's precisely how he planned it all along.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The maker Tom Six succeeded in making the most awkward sadistic movie with the most insane doctor character, but there is no where in the movie for justifying or reasoning the character from the character perspective. Well there is nothing conveyed in the movie other than plain cry,pain,sorrow and anger and if there was anything that the creator was trying to say other than that, then it was 0% conveyed.

131,geekgirl101,"Trashy, creepy, sickening, and boring at the same time",3,14 April 2013,"I honestly don't know what to say about this movie. It's pretty obvious it's gonna be a horror about a crazy scientist who creates a human centipede, and that is pretty much the story. It's not horrifying, it's not scary, there's lack of a decent plot, it's nowhere near as freaky or creepy as the title would have you believe, although for someone with a sensitive stomach like mine I couldn't help but wretch at the disgusting scenes.I was literally screaming at the two girls at the beginning. They left the car in the middle of the night instead of staying by it, and when they did decide to leave they wandered off into the woods. There was plenty of opportunities where one or both girls could've escaped, but instead when Jenny does escape she decides to go back downstairs and rescue her unconscious friend, exerting all her energy into dragging her out of the house whilst losing lots of blood, making loads of groaning noises as she tries to drag her friend away, and then gets knocked out by a tranquilizing dart when she's only a dozen feet away from the house. In the time it took her to go back and drag her friend to safety she could've ran away through the woods, gotten onto the main road, flagged for help, and have her friend and the other guy rescued by the authorities, but then I guess that wouldn't have made a very interesting movie, not like the original plot was any more interesting.This movie could've been so much more instead of just being about 3 naked people on all fours being held together mouth-to-anus crapping into each others' mouths. Dieter Laser plays his role as an estranged, psychopathic scientist very well though.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

133,bobhartshorn,See this 'sick filth' now!,9,7 September 2010,"Baring more than a passing resemblance to Anthony Balch's 1973 Brit Schlocker 'Horror Hospital', this weird and grotesquely funny outing from the Netherlands starts deceptively in familiar scary-movie terrain with the introduction of Lindsay and Jenny (Ashley C.Williams and Ashlynn Yennie), two bimbo American tourists stranded on a road trip in the German woodlands following the breakdown of their vehicle during a rain storm. Finding what they believe to be solace in the isolated lodgings of a retired Siamese-twin specialist surgeon - the suspiciously monikered Dr Heiter (Deiter Laser) – things take a turn for the worse when they wind up drugged and bound in the loopy host's operating theatre. A framed photograph of an earlier experiment at the Doctor's bedside - the dead and buried '3-Hound' - is a big clue as to what is in store for our hapless heroines.After wrong-footing us with a wave of ropey acting, hokey dialogue and genre clichés, writer/director Tom Six's freak show starts to do exactly what its title threatens and, via a dread-inducing diagram demo, it's not too long before our damsels in distress find themselves down on all fours, gastrically conjoined face-to-bum-crack x 2, with a third captive, Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura), leading the way. Surprisingly, THC is a far more palatable affair than this grisly synopsis might suggest, with the slick visuals, black humour and admirable restraint on the ketchup bottle gamely shaping it into a car-crash spectacle you cannot tear your eyes away from. The resistance to turn the graphics all the way up to 11 makes Katsuro's inevitable 'call of nature' moment far more – ahem - digestible too, allowing its 'finer' details to exist only within the viewers' mind.At the centre of this glorious pile-up is Laser's all-consuming, all conquering performance as the uber-mad surgeon. His bug-eyd skeletal features and uncontrollable tantrums are an ugly, compulsive joy to behold, offsetting sharply as they do against the sterile artifacts and antiseptic interiors of his sanctum sanctorum. Heiter's fire and ice mood-swings and refusal to interact with his stitched-up prisoners as human beings, heightens our sympathies and grief for the whimpering girls and the raging Katsuro too.It's no coincidence that a man from the east figures in the Doctor's ghastly equation as Six himself has commented in recent interviews that the characters – German, American and Japanese – represent the main players of World War II, and Heiter's experiment mirrors that of the more heinous and sinister crimes committed by Nazi scientists behind closed doors. One enlightened, and very insightful IMDb reviewer pointed out that Katsuro's involvement is also symbolic of Hollywood's depressingly in-exhaustive practice of remaking Japanese horror films for the US teen-market. As a literal illustration of the West being force fed the regurgitations of the East, it takes some beating. Another metaphor THC brings home to roost, is the horror of becoming part of something you have no control over; the terror and helplessness of wanting to escape from your body, and the realisation that you have been cemented into a faceless chain of servitude from which there is no escape. Even a breakdown in the system (suicide/sudden death) , or intervention from external forces (incompetent, shaggy-haired policemen) will fail to save your bacon and leave you stuck between a rock and a very hard place indeed, as is the case with the horror-upon-horror ending.Certain detractors (including a few critics that really should know better) have taken THC at face value and written it off as ""the sickest film ever made"", adding the usual ""Degrading to all those that choose to watch it!"" film flam along with a few (completely unfounded) accusations of misogyny. B*ll*cks say I! - Six's movie is certainly outrageous and disturbing, but it's also socially aware, darkly humorous and well made enough to be thoroughly deserving of its forthcoming sequel – 'The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence' - which is currently being shot in London and due for a 2011 release.

The only thing 'interesting' is waiting to see the human centipede and seeing how it ends. All the bits in between are neither here nor there. The girls acting is just shocking, so shocking they could easily star in a porno. The police at the end are just as bad. The scientist is the only one whose acting is believable, either that or he really is a nutty scientist. How on earth he manages to get the 'centipede' to last more than a day or two as he does in the film is beyond me as its completely medically impossible to keep people alive sewn together like that.

135,johnnyrj,this one left a lasting impression,8,12 June 2010,"So I'm sitting there after having watched the first games of the 2010 World Cup and finishing off a 2nd bottle of wine when I decide to dig through some movies I had recently grabbed. Low and behold there's The Human Centipede just beckoning me to sit for a spell. So I load up the bong to camp out in front of the computer for a bit and hit play.Our two main characters at the beginning are cute girls who are 'lost and stranded far away from home' (excuse the Gamma Ray lyric steal) which sets the mood for your typical horror flick. The acting is questionable, but not the worst I've seen by far. Anyone who has seen Komodo vs. Cobra knows what I'm talking about. Besides that they are cute and delicious so who really cares how solid the acting is. Some of the dialogue is actually viable so there's that.I was really considering whether or not to ditch the movie at the onset as it was a bit slow gathering momentum, but then along came a spider in the form of our good doctor. The girls needed help, his house was nearby and fasten your seat-belts kids cause this movie is about to take you for a ride.I honestly had absolutely no clue as to what was about to take shape in the basement / operating room. I saw images from the cover and heard some scuttlebutt online, but I just figured maybe he was mutilating some folks to make a funky human centipede type thing via thorax etc. Holy crapanoli Batman was I in for a shock! I've seen some sick stuff in my time and didn't think there'd be much left that could come close to Cannibal Holocaust as far as revolting film, but I stood corrected.This movie definitely pushes some limits friends and neighbors. Even the most hardcore fans of the genre will take pause to absorb what the good doctor pulls off. Nevermind all the verbal internet diarrhea related to the medical experiment in this movie. IT'S A MOVIE FFS! It's supposed to be fantastical and absurd and shocking and that's exactly what our director accomplishes. Sure there are holes (pun intended) galore with the actors and languages and plausibility between this fact and that, but none of these things take away from what's happening on screen. There's sheer terror and revolting turns that'll keep the fan of the weird, bizarre and disgusting quite contented.I'm surprised they actually found people to play these parts. I'd have been laughing my ass off the entire time being hooked up to another person's back door while filming. I guess that's why they didn't hire me :( For all the questionable acting there are plenty of solid scenes which compensate. There are worse actors, there are worse scripts and much worse films. If you like this genre, The Human Centipede is worth a serious look. Don't go by one bad review. I still can't believe the director pulled this off :) This was a fun ride in the land of the totally messed up!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

He's a mad scientist! That's what mad scientists do! Mad science stuff!IMDb classifies The Human Centipede as Horror / Drama / Thriller. It is also an intensely black and macabre comedy. Some of the dialogue is hilarious, such as the threats made by the Japanese 'segment' of Dieter Laser's insane creation.Technically (Yes, technically!), the film looks way more expensive than its budget would suggest and the craft on show (direction, lighting, acting (!), camera) is very professional. Given the constraints of the situation, the actors especially turn in a fine job. One day you're a couple of girlfriends, looking for the local disco and getting lost, the next you're a helluva lot closer than you or nature ever intended!I saw the film at a market screening, laid on as an extra because the first one was full to bursting.The Human Centipede is a sick and guilty pleasure and I loved it.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
138,Erichnathanbennett,"Pointless, stupid, bad acting",2,19 January 2011,"This is basically what the film is about. This is like the synopsis but what really happens.It starts with this old German guy who is jacking off to a picture of his dogs and this trucker goes to take a wizz. Then the old guy takes out his tranquilizer rifle and takes the trucker guy out and puts him into his trunk; that's just the opening scene.Then it goes to these two American girls who are driving to this party (by the way this takes place in Germany). And then they get a flat tire. So they decide to go get help. Next scene it takes place in a forest; they figured that if they're going to get help they won't walk on the road. They'll walk in the middle of the forest at night; in the rain. Finally they see a house and they knock on the door and the old German guy from the beginning says to come in and asks if they want anything to drink. They say yes. So he's like drug; drug. And when they drink it he says ""Side effect; rape drug."" Next scene they find themselves strapped down to beds in a basement and next to them is some Asian guy. And then the German guy explains that he is a retired doctor and his dream is to create Siamese people. And during this scene the camera keeps going to this grave that basically says here lies three dogs conjoined together (you kind of get the feeling what's going to happen). So he's explaining all the positions with a diagram that looks like it was drawn by a first grader. He's going to perform surgery on them so that they are literally ass to mouth so the digestive tract goes all the way throughout them. So the positions are A, B, and C and everyone's like please A. So one of the girls escapes but the doctor catches her and says ""Ah, I found my B."" (which would be a good idea to other people, especially at work like ""I found my B."") Next scene you see a blanket over all three of them which actually three people ass to mouth. And the doctor removes the blanket and shows a mirror to them and they freak out. (The Asian is A and the two girls are B and C which is an A plus because they don't get to talk anymore and they weren't that good). So then they begin to walk or crawl or something and the Asian says ""Oh no, oh no,"" and he turns and says, ""I'm so sorry; I have to sh*t."" That's something that stays with you.So then two cops come by and they ask if they seen any kind of unusual behavior because there was reporting of missing people. So then the doctor drugs one of them. And then he heads back to the basement and the human centipede is gone. He says ""I know I left it here."" One thing I couldn't understand is how does a human centipede crawl up a spiral staircase in about a minute. My dog can barely walk up a spiral staircase.So anyway the cops find the human centipede in the master bedroom. Now when a person sees something like this you can imagine it like Jeff Goldblum in The Fly. So someone might run away or vomit or scream. But the cop said are you okay. By the way, the doctor's house has an indoor in ground pool. How can you have an in ground pool and a basement. But anyway the doctor shoots the drugged cop. And the Asian dude says, ""Look I've had enough of this,"" and he takes a knife and he slits his throat. And then the other cop comes into the room where the doctor is and the cop shoots the doctor but the doctor shoots the cop. And by now C girl is green because she's been eating double sh*t so she dies. So now you've got a dead doctor, two dead cops, dead A, dead C, and B is still alive which you do not want and then the camera pans up into the sky and that's how the movie ends.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
139,nysalesman100-1,This is one sick movie,5,27 September 2010,"The concept and execution was pretty sick, but I have to say that I couldn't stop watching it - mostly in the hopes that justice would prevail and this sick doctor would get what he deserves in the end.One other reviewer commented that it wasn't medically accurate, and he was mostly correct; especially when he said their vascular systems needed to be connected. Any first year med student would know such a procedure (if anyone was sick enough to do it) would first require resecting the bowel throughout the organism (#1 has all digestive organs except for a colon, #1s small intestine is resected into the small intestine of #2, which spans from her anus up to her mouth (other than a long small intestinal tube #2 has no digestive organs whatsoever) the same is done with #3, but she keeps her colon as the final stage of digestion). Once the vascular system is hooked together urinary tracks can stay independent as all three can remain with active kidneys to filter the liquid from the blood). The only thing the early reviewer missed was by saying that checking compatibility could not be done in a basement. He is incorrect there, checking compatibility is nothing more than doing a blood type and a histology match (all of which can be done with a simple latex agglutination kit, purchased though any lab supply catalog). Heck, if given a vacutainer, a centrifuge, a can of white latex paint, and a live lamb or a mouse, I could home brew the test myself.

140,Marjeez,Pointless Review,5,23 July 2010,"I'm unsure as to why I'm writing this review. Not only is this movie hard to review, but no matter what anyone tells you, your mind has already made the decision of viewing or skipping ""The Human Centipede"". There is a huge dividing line between your decision. First, you must be a hardcore horror fanatic to sit through one of the grossest movies to ever grace the cinema. Secondly, the plot of the movie needs to interest you. A psychotic surgeon holds three humans hostage, surgically attaches them together to form a centipede. If you are still reading my review, you'll probably end up watching ""The Human Centipede"".Now onto my personal opinion. This movie is a huge ""MEH"". There are many great aspects and many horrible aspects. While I applaud the writers for somehow creating a realistic feeling to this film's absurd plot, there are several moments where the viewer is frustrated by the low level of intelligence of these characters. The film is divided into English, German and even Japanese. Whether this is a positive aspect or not, this is where a few laughs come into ""The Human Centipede"". Since the surgeon is German, he is difficult to understand at times when speaking English. But luckily, the dialogue itself is unnecessary. The main gross-out factor comes not from the blood or gore, but from how the humans are attached themselves. I urge everyone to skip the trailer. The trailer is a time-line of the movie and ruins 75% of the what gives this film some interest to the viewer. I will recommend this film to certain people simply because in an age where most horror films are disappointing, ""The Human Centipede"" is a fresh, unique, fast-paced disgusting thrill ride.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

142,akuma634,"No plot, no character, no gore, no point, not one redeeming quality",1,13 November 2010,"I decided to give in and watch The Human Centipede bluray this morning. I've been watching plenty of bad movies for fun lately, the last ones I've seen were The Worst Horror Movie Ever Made, Troll 2, and The Room. All very fun and entertaining bad movies but The Human Centipede was the opposite of fun and entertaining.I went in with no expectations and ended up just screaming at my TV for an hour and a half. I haven't seen so much stupidity in a horror movie since Hostel, Rob Zombie's Halloween, Martyrs, Gutterballs, and Return To Sleepaway Camp. It's rare for me to hate a movie only minutes into it but this gave me no choice. It starts with an old German man who looks like Butt-Head with a little Beavis bone structure, he's sitting in his car early in the morning and looking at pictures of what appears to be dogs sniffing each other butts. Then a truck stops behind his parked car, the truck driver walks to a chain link fence (in a very public area with several dozen cars passing by the second) so he can go number 2. The German man takes a rifle out of his car, tries to conceal it under his coat, and nonchalantly walks behind the truck driver, shoots him, and we see the opening title. I'm not sure how there were no witness or anyone who heard the shot.The main plot is about two obnoxious American girls on vacation in Germany who want to attend a party. They leave their room and drive through the woods in the middle of nowhere when they suddenly get a flat tire. They have no idea how to change a tire so they start bickering and crying for minutes while an old pervert who speaks no English pulls up to harass them. Eventually they wander through the woods while screaming at each other and saying their names in every sentence, because I guess that's how people talk. They do find a house so they knock and Butt-Head answers the door and invites them in. He then gives them drugged water, freaks out when one girl spills her glass, demands she drinks more water, and eventually he gets suspicious enough for the girls to worry but by then they're already drugged. They wake up in restraints only to find out that the doctor is going to kill the trucker because he isn't a tissue match. He leaves and comes back with a Japanese guy, that is the very depth of this character. The only thing he ever does in the entire movie is screams in Japanese at the top of his lungs. When he has the three people he needs, he shows a slide show of his evil mad scientist plan to create The Human Centipede. A medical experiment that makes absolutely no sense and has no practical application.For a while not much is really going on aside from Dr. Butt-Head ranting and acting like an idiot and the three victims crying like babies that need a diaper change. On the day of surgery one girl tries to escape and it's one of the most pathetic escapes I have ever seen, it's logic hurdle over logic hurdle like refusing to leave through the front door and steal the doctor's car, eventually the doctor catches the girl and makes her the middle of he centipede. The surgery scene is incredibly boring. You see some teeth pulled off screen and there's a circular incision that is barely shown, that is as gory as this movie ever gets. 1963's Blood Feast had a ton of gore and while looking laughably bad almost 50 years later, it is much more gruesome than The Human Centipede. 46 minutes into the movie you see the actual Human Centipede, which is three people with stitch effects on their faces and tons of bandages. The doctor parades them around the house, tries to teach them tricks, makes the front guy eat out of a dog dish, screams at them a lot, and the three of them do the usual routine of crying and the Japanese guy screaming in Japanese.There isn't any more plot I can reveal without spoiling the movie but it only gets stupider. By the end it just creates a void where any sense of logic or humanity should be. The movie is just very boring, nothing much happens, there is just barely enough violence for an R rating, little nudity, no real plot, no characters or development, and just a very dull movie. I think what could have saved this movie is just taking the idea and making it into more of a comedy like replace the German doctor with Tommy Wiseau or The Iron Sheik and replace one of the girls with someone like Paris Hilton. Just outright spoof your own movie and it could have some watchable content. There is just nothing in this movie that I can possibly recommend. It isn't the worst movie, Manos: The Hands Of Fate and Birdemic: Shock and Terror were much worse and a lot more boring. The Human Centipede just goes nowhere and doesn't even make any attempt at being an interesting or original movie.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

I love it,8,15 November 2020,I feel like the bad reviews are from people that probably shouldn't of even been watching this movie in the first place I love horror and Particularly gore so it would be like my trying to rate high school musical of course I'm going to give it a low rating so it is not my place to review it. Although this movie doesn't actually show a lot of the gore the suggestion of it is enough. The concept is awesome and disturbing whoever came up with it is a mental genius.

144,carry-on-man,Horror as it should be,8,4 August 2013,"First of all, ignore all the 1 outta 10 reviews, any real horror fan would not refuse to watch a film on the grounds that it's sick or disgusting. What we have here is a very clever remake of Frankenstein, which seems to have gone over most people's heads. Mad scientist creates a new life form from the body parts of reluctant donors, said life form turns against the scientist bringing about his death. It's grim, dark and utterly without hope right until the final frame. It's not, as some have claimed, badly acted. Dieter Laser is an excellent villain and the decision to film it in multiple languages is genius as it adds to the confusion and chaos. It has a chilling scene where the mad scientist explains to his would be donors what he's going to do to them, and it's followed by a nerve wracking attempted escape scene and it all ends in a nihilistic nightmare of despair...what's not to like if you're a horror fan?",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

""medically accurate"" is just plain false advertisement. I'll skip out all the medical details, but they could have done into a little more detail to make things more believable, and fill in some plot holes. .. how did they get onto and off the lawn without ripping every suture? They didn't do so well just going up the stairs at the end. And something that just kept bothering me, kept making the film look fake was the wrong angle / position for the actors mouth to anus attachment. Looked more like mouth to above tailbone. A little more time could have been spent explaining things, and making it more plausible. How exactly does the girl swallow the mans feces without vomiting, out her nose, and into her lungs drowning herself?

That being said, it was also rather unwatchable, from poor dramatic and cinematic quality. Weak dialog, absurd story, moronic plot development, awkward and unconvincing acting, and nonsensical characters.The only thing I can say about this film, which can give it some noteworthiness, is that never before have I seen a film which does not possess one single ounce of worth. Its noteworthiness is that it is 100% completely worthless. I want you to think carefully about that. I'm describing a film which is not even a tenth of a percent worth making. I've seen a lot of terrible movies, but I've literally never seen that before, and that is damnably impressive, if you look at it from a Mel Brooks ""Springtime for Hitler"" angle.That's probably why the South Park creators felt it worth bringing to everyone's attention, those jerks LOL",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The only reason I even kept watching to the end was to see just how much it would suck so I could come online and rant about it. I love horror movies, and can put up with more cheesy, idiotic ones than most people, but The Human Centipede takes the cake as the most painful to watch, pathetic example of a movie that has ever been made. I've seen porno movies with better acting, and nothing about this movie is suspenseful or terrifying, just shock value grotesque scenes in a ridiculous plot that never develops into anything interesting for even one minute.

152,evilpinklolita,Great movie if you can handle gore and an unhappy ending,7,2 September 2013,"Human Centipede is not a horror movie for the faint of heart. The haters should have realized the movie is not going to appeal to anyone who doesn't have a strong stomach and an extremely open mind. I liked it because most themes in the horror movie genre have been done repeatedly and are no longer interesting. This one seemed pretty unique. Also, since the setting was in Germany (the characters are German and the location was overseas somewhere, though the movie is in English), horror movies are somewhat different. I thought it carried tension throughout the movie. The plot line was lacking since the synopsis of the video acts as a spoiler. Anatomically, maybe it wasn't realistic. But then again, most horror movies (or all movies for that matter), aren't realistic. That's what makes them an escape, which the victims don't. That is the reason I only rated it a 7.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
153,superal1966,A Pointless and Disturbingly Visual Insight into the Directors Mind,1,2 March 2011,"*Contains Spoilers*Where to start.Probably firstly that the Human Centipede defies belonging to any real genre of film. It's hard to review and place this film as it is totally pointless.It tries to use an abstract concept thrown in with a lot of gore, much left to the imagination but succeeds in doing nothing. It's not scary on any level and what gore there is certainly doesn't add to the film. I'm not one to be phased by gore in films providing it compliments and enhances the plot, for instance in films like Saw, but I think it is totally unnecessary in this film and if I could only use one word to describe this film it would be 'sick'.Rather than being artistic and original like many have argued, to me it comes across as a visual display of a directors, very worryingly so, mind.Onto the film itself.I'm not medically minded but the idea seemed totally implausible even to me. Just entertaining the idea for a minute I imagine for the concept to work an awful lot more surgery would be needed in connecting them together as one creature. Secondly the fact two friends and a random Japanese guy are perfectly compatible seemed awfully convenient, that they all happened to be lost in the same woods at roughly the same time and ended up at his house. The Detectives didn't quite fit the bill either, I can't imagine the detective who found the trio would just run off leaving them without radioing for a medical and or more police.Once they were sown together nothing really happened. I assume Lindsay who was in the middle was eventually found and somehow detached but it doesn't tie up any ends, not that it really mattered.Being honest this film is utter garbage that isn't worth anybodies time or patience and should be avoided at all costs. I hear there is going to be a squeal that is going to show all the gore that was left to the imagination in this film, which to be honest, for me would make the film pretty much unwatchable unless there is actually a film behind the pointless and endless dribble that is in the Human Centipede.It's a contender for the worst film I've seen and I'm a little concerned about those who have given it positive review. It's clearly a 0/10 but unfortunately I'm forced to give it a 1/10.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Prostitution is legal there (a good thing), pornographic magazines and videos are freely available (why not) as are gory exploitation films which can be watched legally by anybody over the age of 16. Nobody likes Germans very much. The society is that of the Netherlands. The boy became the writer/director of this movie.Unfortunately all the influences (not even mentioning Salo, Hostel, Saw etc.) didn't produce a top film. Rather the opposite - WAY opposite.The sad fact is that this laughable piece of utter garbage will make money because it was produced cheaply and seems to belong to a popular genre - horror. Actually the ""horror"" is confined to a few short scenes of gore. The concept of the ""centipede"" is laughable to begin with and the result is unconvincing and downright ridiculous.This does not even belong in the ""so bad it's good"" category.

When it is about horror the American taste is in charge: creepy but still reassuringly in the end (I make some exceptions, one out of standards lately was ""Drag me to hell""). This dutch movie does not match that kind of taste at all: is disturbing, brutal, perverted, humiliating and still it manage to be funny... which is the creepiest part of it. I read some people considered the acting ""poor"", I wonder if they were watching Dieter Laser or someone else. Because that one was astonishing performance. I also read there is no plot. I wonder what is the plot in the mainstream horror movies though. A serial killer killing hot girls and letting clues to the police-hero-man? Some monsters in the wood killing a group of friends except one (""The evil dead"" was great, the copies are rubbish)? A devil child? ""The human centipede"" is not a master piece, but it is far different from the others and genuinely disturbing, there is no redemption, no happy ending, exactly as a horror movie is supposed to be.

The Human Centipede is all that. It takes Frankenstein and Hannibal Lecter to a new level. Part of its truth lies in the fact that people are kidnapped and held captive in homes to be tortured....these stories have been in the news in various countries including the U.S., Germany and England. Several times a year a news story breaks about a person being rescued from house of horror. The original premise is a possibility. I had a stomach ache from tension through most of the movie.

It wasn't, and I suspect many people viewing this film miss the point altogether. It's like a laughable horror film from 1939 updated to 2009 standards. Dieter Laser is wonderful as the mad scientist, and brings to mind Bela Lugosi as Dracula. The background music that is played when the camera is looking at something evil is a real knee-slapper. Ashley C. Williams and Ashlynn Yennie as the two chicks without a clue do a great job with their rolls, and they almost look into the camera and say, ""You know, we are pretty SCARED!!"" When the mad doctor hauls out a victim from the back of his car, it is revealed that the guy was drugged from a dart gun: the colorful dart still sticking out of his butt clear as day. Funny! When Ashley C. Williams is darted, she goes through all kinds of facial expressions before dropping to the ground.

While pretty much all the characters in the movie were horrible, the acting was actually really good, especially the main antagonist (Dr. Heiter) While this movie may be classifies under the horror genre, it does not feel like as much of a horror movie as it does just a torture porn, but the idea of the dehumanization of innocent people is a very sinister concept.

161,john-souray,A little bit shocking....,5,11 October 2010,"""Is this the sickest film ever made?"" demands the Sun, the British Murdoch tabloid, in a thrillingly prurient tone, and gloatingly quoted on the DVD sleeve.Well, probably not, no. And that's part of the problem. It's neither as bad nor as brilliant a film as the 1-star or 10-star reviews would have you believe. It's as though, having had such a disgusting idea, so pleased was writer/director Six and his team with his own transgressive naughtiness that he couldn't be bothered to think any further to develop anything approaching a plot or a character study.If you've read anything at all about this film, you can't help but know what to expect. And that's what you get, no more and no less. We get a standard car breaks down in the dark woods - increasingly frantic search for help - finally finding an isolated home - horror film cliché introduction; a mad scientist who announces what he wants to do; he then does it, and ....er .... that's more or less it. There's an attempt at a sort of bleak ending, though it doesn't really work. I mean, if two detectives go to the trouble of getting a search warrant, and then fail to return to the office, how long do you think it will be before (a) somebody notices and (b) works out exactly where to start looking? (Incidentally: that house in the woods. I recently wrote a very disobliging review here of the awful ""House of the Devil"", and sneered at, amongst other things, the Addams family architecture. The set here in this film by contrast is one of the best things about it: impeccable modern German/Scandinavian minimalist styling, and seldom lit with anything less than brilliant clarity. All those budget horror film ""cinematographers"" with their interminable sequences in blurred gloom should study this and think very hard about what they see.) The residual power of this film is due not to the work of the Director or the same man's script, but rather to a bravura piece of pantomime villainy by the anorexic-looking Dieter Laser. This is not a name I recognise, though looking at his track record, he clearly will be known to German viewers, and some English-speaking cable viewers. I understand that Laser himself contributed to the development of the character; if so, we can't be sure who wrote what, but in any case it is a fantastic performance. Asked if he is married (his two female guests are undoubtedly nervously trying to check out how risky he may be) he replies simply and shockingly that he doesn't like people. The bleak and cynical delivery of this nihilistic misanthropy is brilliant, but the script just doesn't give him enough to work with.We needed more of this. We get a hint that this man really is or was a brilliant surgeon. So what happened? What brought him to this madness? This doesn't need to be a convincing psychological study; pantomime will do. But the story needs, deserves even, better than this mechanical and perfunctory plotting.""100% medically accurate"", chortles the publicity for this film, a claim about as credible as the ""based on true events"" nonsense that contaminates so many cheap shockers. I notice that Mr Six is now tagging his sequel as ""100% medically inaccurate"", so he's probably realised how risible this is, but I'm afraid the damage is done.Shocked, or sickened? Yes, a bit, but only a bit, and not as much as you were hoping, Mr Six. To tell the truth, after seeing the film I'm no more shocked than I was when I first read about it. You're going to have to try a bit harder next time; perhaps some new ideas, too, and not just a re-run of the ones you've already had?",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
162,nintendofanof1993,Disgusting.,5,13 February 2011,"This movie is very sick and I wouldn't even recommend it for the hardcore sick and psychotic blood and guts fans. This movie had great potential, but squandered it. The story is very original in a sense it deals with some surgery to fuse three helpless victims into one being. It must have taken a very sick mind and a very sick man to develop this. The first part of the movie is pointless, its also crude in the way it begins. The whole intro is just meaningless filler. You can hardly focus because nothing else is going on. There's no build up whatsoever, so your really just waiting for the people to get stitched together. But the movie has ways of pissing you off! Take for example the Japanese character, he cant speak English. So they give subtitles, that's great and all but my complaint is why would you put words for the viewers to read if they are already bored!? It makes little sense, the characters are all bad actors. They just scream and that's it. The two actress's are very annoying because all they do is scream and it annoys you after a while. The mad scientist is decent, you cant understand him half the time, and his motives are never really explained. The movie just throws everything at once at you expecting you to grasp every single concept of the characters. The part where the doctor performs surgery is just sick and nasty, its incredibly pointless. Since it was never really explained why this man decided to stitch three people together, it really bothers you and makes you wonder why your still watching. I rated this movie a 50%, im being very generous here. I think this film could have been disgusting but a good blood and guts kinda movie. But that's simply not the case here. The only reason I can think of for watching this movie start to finish is for the sake of saying "" I watched this movie"". And I wont even go into the ending, its just that bad.

163,nrbarton,A breath of fresh air? (Not for persons 2 and 3),7,24 May 2010,"I remember when I first read about 'The Human Centipede (First Sequence)' being made and thought the plot synopsis sounded rather silly. Looking into the story in more depth and it's not quite as far fetched as you might first think. It's about a scientist called 'Dr Heiter' who is well known for separating Siamese twins and now likes to experiment joining people together instead. He has a plan to create what he calls a human centipede.The movie is very silly and certainly not based on a true story but is possibly based on or inspired by a true scientist 'Josef Mengele' who, under Nazi rule, was allowed to carry out sickening experiments on twins. He'd attempt to attach twins and transplant their organs and alter eye pigmentation. Of the 1,000 pairs of twins used, only about 200 pairs survived.So in the movie we have a similar warped German scientist. Two very beautiful American girls' car tyre bursts in the middle of nowhere and, as they're both apparently incapable of even attempting to change it, they go to look for help; guess whose house they come to? Yeah bad luck girls.You've probably heard this movie is sick, and it is, but it's not as graphic as you might expect. In a way I was disappointed that they didn't show the joins between the people properly and had them wearing these bandages throughout. This was partly to cover up genitalia I expect but it seemed like a cop out in an otherwise uncompromising movie. Still it's the idea that is the disturbing thing. Another problem is that you already know what is going to happen pretty much due to the title and plot synopsis so all the time one of the three was trying to escape I knew they wouldn't. I felt there wasn't enough plot to fill an hour and a half so it was quite drawn out.I have to give this movie credit for at least trying something original. It's not that scary but is rather gross, disturbing and works well as a horror because in most horror movies the threat is death; in this the threat is a fate worst than death, especially if not the head of the centipede. It ends with a situation that I really hope I'm never in.It's a truly horrible movie, so horrible that you just have to laugh and I think the humour is intentional.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

I worked in the film industry for 10 years in Art departments so somehow horror for me always ends up being a comedy. But occasionally when something controversial circulates I need to see it, at least so I can join in the conversation at the bar.So #2 is out which I've researched. better watch #1 first. And I'm also fairly well versed in where the bottom of the barrel is on the 'net so concepts like the one visited in this film seem positively mild by comparison.So the best way to watch a dangerous horror film is backwards, which is what I did with this. Watch the end first then find out how the film got there, and so on. That way there's nothing sinister around the corner and I won't laugh to death.The end truly is gruesome and is probably the best ending I've ever seen for a horror film. The end really is horrific! I don't think I could imagine anything worse, if I wanted to find a definition of hell then it would have to be close.I think Centipede certainly works, both on the screen and at the bar. As a film it has certainly got tongues wagging. I can see a new dance coming on which might finally replace Nutbush at parties.Definitely not one to show the wife and kids though.One annoying thing though which makes a mockery of the ""100% Medically Accurate"" claim.

I hope that no one would ever want to do that.This movie left me in thrilled-horrified all the time. I never expected what will come next. But the storyline is kinda slow. I seriously expected that the human centipede will be 'produce' at the end of the movie. I was expecting the victim to struggle more before being turn to the human centipede. You know, like all the other movies which they had to struggle to survive before being killed or tortured. That's the more concept i like.And the most disappointing part is the ending. It doesn't seem right to have an ending like that. The polices really don't help much. They are like dumb-ass police who never been trained to be a police. So easily killed.But, however, the movie is good to watched for the thrill-horror-rated r lover..",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Certainly didn't expect to laugh as much. Also we were both genuinely interested about how the experiment would work. Had a few tropes, two teenagers and a cabin in the woods kind of thing, but it worked fine. Remember this is a bargain basement movie, it did a good job, well done guys. Just get past the first 5 minutes of hammy acting and the rest is quite enjoyable indeed. Contrary to popular belief, very little gore, more the suggestion of torture and violence, but that is often way more chilling.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

If you watch this expecting to be any more enlightened to why this film was thought up and subsequently made, you won't be. I watched it, the film itself was shot pretty well in large, however I got to the end of the film and feel nothing but indifference for the whole film if i'm honest. On a lot of levels it is a good horror film, it has moments which generally send a chill down your spine, it has a lot of psychological undertones in places which I really thought added to how creepy this film is; but the notion of sewing mouths to bums is a tad farcical and even with the premise the film is built upon, its hard to take it seriously, which then leaves you watching it like Scary Movie or Dr Giggles, with more of a tongue-in-cheek slant on the film, which is a shame really because a lot of the film is really well presented and does get under your skin on lots of levels.I purely think the fairest review i could make on this film was to sincerely express my confusion and how I watched it and it just left me as I started it, no better off but no worse off either. If you like horror films and have 90 minutes on your hands and have seen every other horror film you can think of at that point in time, then watch it.

170,DamnYouGoogle,Oh Tom Six...why?,2,8 May 2010,"I wish I could say this movie was self aware of how bad it was executed, sadly I truly think Tom Six is not only proud of this but finds it revolutionary...Here is A quote from Mr.Six himself paraphrased ""Why make movies unless they are original."" and i respect that quote on a lot of levels...now lets review this movie.A mad doctor is kidnapping people (Totally original), in his house thats in the middle of nowhere and apparently never checked on unless of course you are a lost tourist (UNDENIABLY ORIGINAL), so he can experiment on them and make his mad vision come to life. (Most original concept ever amirite?) So generally speaking this movie kicks Tom Six's own quote in the balls, put thats fine why cant there be a good movie about a mad scientist and his whacked out brutal experiments the answer there is none, but there is a reason why it didn't work here.Six seems to have problems moving his characters out of the first dimension and this starts to show almost immediately instead of a proper prologue of some sort the film just simply begins, we are almost expected to know why this scientist is a mad scientist, and why he wants to make this human centipede.At this point we met our (loosely put) protagonist 2 American tourists who get lost on the way to the club...apparently there are no highways in Germany, so their car gets stranded in the woods (Tom's originality once again shines in such a plot device) after not being able to get help because their cell phones aren't getting reception (there goes that loss end) they stumble into the doctors house where we begin our last 75 minutes of useless shenanigans another tourist is kidnapped off screen and brought in then seriously it plays out like every movie involving A kidnapped person ever has...and to top it off there is some Tommy Wiseau quality acting in this baby, that comparison being made there is a lot of similarities between this and Wiseau's work, id go as far as to call it, ""The Room of Horror Movies"".Its badly acted, written, directed, and just plain annoying to sit through, it doesn't even have the camp value movies like Troll 2 or Plan 9 have its just all around bad film creating...but then again Tom Six did make it.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
171,PopcornJury,Humanity Has Suffered at the Stake of the Centipede,1,19 October 2010,"Holy mother of god.I love reviewing these types of films. Why? Because regardless of how experienced, well- credentialed, or well-versed you are in cinema, you can throw all notions of expertise out the window in an effort to tell the 100% truth. There doesn't need to be talk of plot, cinematography, score, or script, rather just a simple statement that sums up the entire viewing experience. Well folks, here it is: the Human Centipede is one of, if not the worst film ever made and it will not only make you uncomfortable and upset, it will make you extremely uncertain of the human condition and how unethical someone could be. Then again, I didn't have to tell you that considering the title of the film pretty much says it all.(Harsh content ahead) For those who haven't figured it out by now, this film is about a literal human centipede. Three humans, stitched together, ass to mouth, kneecaps cut out, treated like an animal by a scientist with no motives other than an obsession with genetic and surgical mutation and mutilation. It's sick, it's twisted, it's horrible in every way shape and form, but at the same time, it's not THAT violent. We know what's going on, we see it, but it's told in a less violent, less grisly way than many would imagine. The story had me spinning, but I never once had to turn my head away.Many that I've talked to about this film have asked me on simple question: Why would you rent this film? Quite frankly, for me, it was an absolute interest from the moment I'd seen the trailer. What's next was the critical acclaim that the film received from those around the world wide web. Some critics praised it for what it was (unique, gruesome, the next stage in scare-tactics) and others refused to rate it (Roger Ebert refused to use the star-rating system in fear that it was too unethical of a film to critique). For someone interested in film, I decided it was in my best interest to step up to the plate. To my dismay, I didn't like it at all. Maybe it's the Ebert in me, but much like him, I don't think this film deserves to see light in the day in any circle other than those with an extreme interest in seeing the bizarre, over-hyped, and extremely unusual.Would I recommend this movie? Not one bit. It's a horrible piece of trash that won't appeal to anyone other than those looking to get a look at the object of pure insanity: the Human Centipede. If it was well executed, it could've pushed boundaries, moved mountains, etc. Instead, it puts humanity back a few notches.The Human Centipede has already been given the nod for a sequel. Hopefully production moves slow. There's not enough space in the world for one human centipede, not much less two.For more reviews, visit http://www.popcornjury.com",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

I was in complete shock for the three victims, in a way that i felt ashamed to be a human and for watching. the doctor - i agree with all the other reviewers is lance henricksons double is superbly cast as the villain. The three actors of the centipede very very brave in doing this, the intimate contact it involved showed courage and the actor and actresses deserve awards for their roles. the end of the movie left me dumbstruck and thinking what the hell was that all about and why - the very point the director and writer of a movie like this wanted to make !! for being 100% medically accurate - its is total rubbish - its core value is to shock the viewer to extreme.my problem with this film is its material and it giving mad men an idea - indeed I have just seen on IMDb that the sequel deals with this very issue.i am ashamed to have watched this movie and hope it is never allowed to be shown on any British television channel again !!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

174,markusibbetson,Just a terrble movie,1,11 June 2020,"When I heard about this movie, it had the hype of a video nasty, the sort of film that gets banned in many countries. I don't know if this film ever was banned, but if it was, then they have seriously low tolerance for horror films.
The premise of this film is unique, I'll give it that, but it fails to deliver beyond that. Basically a mad, German scientist wants to create a 'centipede' from humans after trying it out with dogs. So he kidnaps a man and two women and stitches them arse to mouth, thus making his 'centipede' (dodecapede really).
This film had the potential to be a great body horror, but despite clearly wanting to be a gross-out horror, it's a little too clinical. The bodies were joined 'perfectly' by a skilled surgeon, which removed any chance of him creating a malformed 'creature'.
Things could have been much more gross and repulsive and would have made for a better film. Before I saw it, I was expecting a deranged man in his cabin in the woods, who creates an abomination of grossly fused human bodies. The choice to have a skilled surgeon working in a clean surgery in the basement of his remote house took a lot away from the film (although this way of doing it was more realistic as there's less chance of infection etc in a clean surgery).
As the two women spend their time surgically attached to an arse and the guy at the front only speaks Japanese (if I remember correctly) there's no room for character development. The sicko doctor is already as developed as he's going to get (I can't for the life of me remember if it's explained why he does what he does). The cop that tries to come to the rescue is generic and has no backstory at all.
This movie has a rather bleak ending (everyone dies), the cop and the doctor kill each other. The middle girl dies (can't remember why, possibly due to an infection), the guy at the front slits his throat when he realises there's no escape, and the poor girl at the back is left to die of starvation because she can't free herself of the other two.
I would not recommend this film to anyone really (if you really want to watch it to find out how bad it is, then be my guest). There are far better horror films out there (especially if you want a gross out horror)",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

This film, about a mad German surgeon famous for separating conjoined twins, who now wants to CREATE triplets conjoined by their gastric systems is just revolting nonsense. The tension in the last scenes involving the policemen, and some believable ways it was shot, earn the film whatever stars I have given it, but from a script standpoint, it is utter nonsense.

177,wolfcub7,Painfully crappy writing and too weird premise to even shock,1,20 January 2012,"First of all; There is no intelligent plot built around the sick premise and no meaningful message included. That alone makes a movie not worth watching unless it's clearly a horror comedy, which this is not supposed to be. The main victim characters are bleeding imbeciles who do not fit into the movie. They're so moronic that they're not even funny, as in this wouldn't work even as a parody.Second of all; This premise is so weird that at least I can't wrap my mind around its sickness and thus with me this film fails even as the pointless thing it's trying to be.Third of all; The trailer makes the beginning look scary, but is it really? NO. Because the two girls are the dumbest bimbos in the long sad history of dumb horror movie bimbos. The list of reasons is lengthy so I'm just gonna reveal the two biggest ones:They accept a drink from (a creepy-looking) stranger although he made the drink out of their sight, and they drink it even after the guy had said that he doesn't like human beings. His exact words! He did not say ""I don't like people."" He said: ""I don't like human beings."" And they don't even try to get out IMMEDIATELY after he left the room, after saying that and behaving menacingly. Finally the other girl states that they have to get out of there right now and this is the point when the other girl drinks the water all up regardless of all the screaming warnings they'd just had. And...a minute later they're still sitting on the spot without a single attempt to even get up, even though the drugged water hadn't yet made them completely disabled.At the point I had to watch the girl empty the water glass into her mouth, I seriously wanted to bang my head on the wall over a fictional movie. Those characters would not have worked me up like this if this was supposed to be a serial killer movie like ""Friday the 13th"" which aim at as huge body count as possible, as in, a movie in which brainless bimbos are almost justified seeing to its aim. But this is not trying to be one of those.Seriously, I hope Six has learned since this film, that in order to make a scary movie or in any way enjoyable movie, one should not create characters whom the viewer actually wants to be killed off in as painful way as possible because the characters are such bleeding imbeciles that it's unbearable. (I should make clear at this point, that I do NOT feel this way about anyone real like those girls. I would not wish them dead nor tortured, I would just be extremely annoyed. But it's easy to hate on fictional characters whose fates don't hurt anyone.)These characters DON'T come off as victims we should feel sorry for and they DON'T come off as suicidal either. I mean, other than the series of irritatingly moronic choices that they make, the movie does not make them come off suicidal at all nor even retarded. Which leads to the conclusion that they're just simply imbeciles and crappily written characters, and so make the movie that much worse. Hence, those girls made a series of moronic choices before that water glass thing. (And kept on doing many more afterwards!) You'd think the sick premise would be at least a little enjoyable then as it attacks those crappy characters? Well, it's not. At least I was so annoyed with them that I wanted to see them offed, not have to bear with their moronic mistakes in efforts to escape from utterly weird scientific experiment which wasn't in any way interesting even in itself. This of course leads to that the script sucks over-all.The actor of the villain was certainly well picked but does not save the movie that has nothing good to offer and has the most moronic victim characters ever.Painfully crappy writing, too weird premise.

178,eferoth,"Well, this was a waste of time...",2,25 August 2010,"So yeah, read the movietitle. Now read it again. Now watch another movie, cause thats all there is to this film. Thats the story.The acting is terrible, although it gets better as soon the two female leads cant speak anymore... because they can't speak anymore and are reduced to whimpering. Maybe the Japanese guy is acting the hell out of this, I don't know, there are subtitles but he's still Japanese. They act differently and I rarely watch real Japanese cinema.Camera and overall presentation is shoddy as f***. Mask is equally bad. I could have brought this thing to film in my sleep. Diapers to hide everything? Please.The story, again, is about this German Frankenstein guy, ex-specialist surgeon for siamese twin separation, sewing three humans mouth to anus because... I don't know. He did it to his dogs before and they died, so it should work with humans? This obviously implies tasty things like only the front person getting to eat while the rest only gets the ""passed on leftovers"". And thats it. There's a lot of crying and screaming happening in the first half and then a lot of whimpering in the latter, and of course Frankenstein spouts a lot of bullshit, but I really didn't care.You know I like watching Splatter once in a while, or controversial movies, or shocking movies, but this one is none of the above. There's no gore that deserves mentioning, never manages to gross anyone out that hasn't seen ""two girls, one cup"", never gets you thinking of anything other than your to-do-list and it just dripples from scene to scene.

179,DiscoViolento,pretty much a non-film,1,11 October 2010,"Human centipede is a mix between the good old mad scientist premise with a bit of hostel type torture porn thrown in. While I'm not a fan of the torture porn genre, I very much love mad scientists and so I sat down to watch The Human Centipede, knowing that it would probably be quite disappointing.So now, a good hour and a half later, I'm sitting here confused and bewildered.I have seen a lot of film, but never before have I seen a film completely missing a script. It seems like the director came up with the idea and then told the actors to make it up as they went. Most of the dialog is made up by ""stop"" and ""please - first in English, then in Japanese - and I'm not sure switching languages is enough of a variation to qualify for a script. The Human Centipede has less of a plot than a music video.The acting is a mixed bowl of good, decent and bad, but as this is a horror flick, great acting is not something you'd expect anyway. The locations are actually pretty great and the special effects are pretty good. But in the end, it doesn't matter what concept you have, what actors you have or how great of a house you've found for your shoot. If your film doesn't have a script, it's probably not a film worth making.

180,josephledbury,"Vile, Disturbing and Crap",4,21 October 2013,"(Warning: Some moderate Spoilers)I am a huge Horror film fan who loves a dark, disturbing movie. But unfortunately I thought this was not what it could have been.Tom Six directed and wrote this movie, and I'm thinking what is going on in his head to create such a disturbing movie, and weirdly enough he came up for the idea of The Human Centipede when he was drunk.The plot is two young, attractive, vulnerable female tourists in Germany brake down in the middle of the woods. And unfortunately for them they knock on the door of a psychopathic man who is a retired surgeon who's expertise was separating conjoined twins. He also kidnaps a Japanese tourist and creates something that is a disgrace to human nature. The Insane veteran doctor plans to attach his three victims via their gastric systems and finally create his sick fantasy.With grisly special effects and details about how they centipede was made, this movie has made it's self to be one of the most disturbing and visually disgusting movies of it's time. It was a bad and messed up idea, because there are hardcore horror fans out there (like me) who like a real grisly horror, but it just wasn't good at all. There are aspects of this movie I thought was good like the build up to the creation and the character Dr. Heiter was a very chilling man who's obsession with conjoined twins led him to something in-human.For me the script wasn't that good with a lot of bad language and some strong sexual references, which is okay but taken over the limit a bit.The most chilling moment in the movie is when Dr. Heiter says in a very dark and chilling way ""I dislike humans"" and that for me is when the girls fate was sealed and gave out a very chilling atmosphere and made anyone watching have there hairs go up on the backs of their necks.I have watched lots of disturbing, gruesome Horror movies but this is one of the most dark, disturbing and awful movies I've ever seen and the most grisly and disturbing part of the movie is watching the surgery. Watch in horror has the doctor makes gut wrenching incisions in grisly detail and create something that is against nature in all it's right.Overall it was a bad idea but should have been made better, but if you have a weak stomach, probably best you steer clear because I almost threw up. Should have been made better as the script wasn't brilliant and some of the build up was some what ridiculous, but when It comes to the horror and gore, it's very detailed. Decent acting from unrecognisable actors and actresses but The Human Centipede (First Sequence) has made it's self one of the most graphic and disturbing movies of our time and I highly recommend it to hardcore Horror movie fans who have a strong stomach, but don't recommend it to people looking for a good thriller that will win Academy Awards (this will probably win a few Razzies).

I thought it was about a person with a long back and lots of legs that could crawl but NO! It was just disturbing I wish I never watched it. Ok so let's start at the beginning. This old psycho dude had this dog centipede but it died and he's like ""Well I should make a human centipede"" so he does. He kidnaps this dude but then he realises that he doesn't want this dude in his human centipede so he kills him. He then kidnaps another dude who he does use.These two girls get lost so they go to his house and the dude lets them inside. They pass out and wake up in some random medical room basement. The dude tells them about the human centipede procedure and says that he is going to use them three people to make it. They try to get away but that doesn't happen. They get used for the human centipede.The dude pulls out all their teeth but not the man he kidnaped because he is going to be the front part. He stitches one of the girls mouths to the front parts butt and does it again with the other girl but she is the last part. He takes them outside and makes the front one eat. The front one has to poo so he poops into the girls mouth and the psycho dude it yelling out ""FEED HER FEED HER!"" It was the most disturbing part and was really gross. I think it was the cops that later came but the front dude kills himself because he doesn't want to live like this and the end girl dies because she is sick and has had no food or water. The middle girl is still alive and is stuck and THATS THE END OF THE MOVIE! I'm not joking that literally was the end! And that's how the movie goes as well.

182,MrJustRight,Misunderstood Masterpiece,7,4 June 2020,"Reading through some reviews, I feel this film is misunderstood. First off, regarding the acting, which has taken some heat, I must commend Dieter Laser's performance as Dr. Josef Heiter -- a better acting performance you will not see. Yes, the girls' performances are sub-rate, but this is to be expected, and it seems almost like an homage to classic horror films, almost like a way to slightly desensitize audiences from much care, or perhaps a way for some to relate. Incidentally, the rather poor performances of the two female leads lend to a greater fear for the main attraction, seemingly bolstering Laser's performance.People also complain about the script, or rather the lack thereof. That, to me, is part of what makes this film such an original masterpiece. The forming of ""the human centipede"" is all the more frightening without solid explanation or understanding. It's organized chaos, like music -- Dr. Heiter dances at the completion of his ""centipede,"" notably without music accompanying the dance. It's horrific precisely because this ""madman"" takes pleasure out of doing this, without any condolences or cares.The film noticeably focuses a long time on one of the lead girls trying to escape before the experiment. Watching this film multiple times, this becomes tedious, as I'm just waiting for the experiment to begin, and it's unbearably cliche. However, to first-time viewers, this is hope-building. It gives viewers the perception that they may be watching a classic Hollywood horror film in which the protagonist(s) escapes the villain. This makes Dr. Heiter's conquer and subsequent success evermore disturbing, and what makes an otherwise typical horror film legendary.The ending of the film is particularly masterful. A sole survivor, stuck hopelessly between two dead counterparts, without rhyme or reason. The total absurdity of what happened sinks in, as the camera lifts above-ground and into the sunny nature, contrasting two worlds, one of horrific inexplicable tragedy on the ground, and one of indifferent harmony in nature. The indifference of nature beckons Dr. Heiter's indifference to his victims, or perhaps slightly hints at a mocking of his victims, wherein the sun glimmers despite the situation on the ground, without care.People too often need to see a film with an understandable ending, something where they can go home and say, ""so that's what happened."" This film goes deeper, it hits one on a deeper level, not everything must be ""understood"" in a pleasing way, or even in a displeasing way. What's the point of her suffering, people may ask at the end of the film, what was the point of what I just watched, they may say -- the point is that it was pointless, as was her suffering, but in a harmonic way, in a musical way, much like life.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

There was very little in the way of scary moments in this film other than a few escape attempts by the victims. I found myself squeamishly anticipating the capture/torture/operation of the victims, but even that was a letdown, and once the centipede is created, it just gets boring.This was essentially a low-rent version of Silence of the Lambs; a guy kidnaps people and puts them in his basement where he turns them into a perverse personal art project. This movie, however, has horrible acting and implausible situations.The American chicks were so dumb and annoying that by the time their mouths were sewn to each other's asses, I was glad just to not have to listen to them talk any more. The cops were bumbling and stupid - what police officers would accept a drink from a possible murder suspect?

The film industry really needs a severe overhaul and its about time the world woke up to itself and simply stopped creating such disgraceful exhibitions of human degradation. No wonder some of the human race are in such a mess! What is it that people get out of rubbish like this? Do they get off on human suffering or do they relate to the mentality of the deranged psychopaths? Furthermore, what type of person creates a story like this? Not someone I would like to be associated with at all!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
187,Monoxstride,"Disturbing, intriguing, funny, and most of all Excellent.",8,2 April 2011,"There are two reactions one seems to get after watching this movie.1). What a great movie! 2). This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life.Personally, I think it was fantastic. I'm getting very tired of horror movies being exactly the same. This was a unique plot. I've never seen any movie like this before in my life. There was lots of twists and turns that had me on the edge of my seat for almost the whole thing.There was also a bit of humor I got out of it. I'm not really sure if it was intentional or not, but the demeanor of the scientist I think was kind of funny occasionally.The best aspect of 'The Human Centipede' is how disturbing it was. I mean, that's the whole point of it. But it really delivered unlike many horror movies. I will admit there were times that I couldn't look. The last time I remember that happening was in 'Hostel 2'.To finish it off (No pun intended), the ending was absolutely great. Unpredictable, and unexpected.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

I must say very original! Now days it seems the horror genre has become remakes or PG-13 crap.. So i can appreciate some original stuff.. Cast, lets face it, is horrible. Dieter Laser as the doctor was pretty creepy.. Ashley C. Williams(the prettier of the 2 American girls, IMO) who plays the horrible part of the middle of the ""Human Centipede"" .. Got to give her props..i mean the 3 people in the Centipede had it rough but miss Ashley had to shoot a big portion of the movie with her face attached to some dude's butt(OK not in real life..but really, really close to it) and have some chicks face attached to her own! And the Oscar goes to... I hope her career continues and one day she gets to play the front of the centipede! Anyway, weird and gross ""The Human Centipede"" is original and besides the ending( girl on end gets sick and dies, guy up front kills himself, the doc engages in a shootout with 2 detectives leaving all three men dead.) which has poor Lindsay(Ashley C. Williams) attached to 2 dead people and really no way out of a prison-like homemade hospital is a pretty good film which I'm pretty sure you haven't seen anything like before!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

I rate this movie 4 because I see there was an effort. and they try to scare people ""Don't knock on strangers house.""The movie is slightly funny because because of the Japanese boy that poop in the mouth of the girl. It's kinda disgusting but the funny part is when he said ""kumenasai"" The movie is like anime. because of there Exaggerated acting. And the police in the movie is kinda lame.

Granted, I have been one who most enjoys movies that aspire to the highest ideals of humanity. Horror has rarely registered high in my personal ratings with a few stellar exceptions, Alien being the first that comes to mind. Horror films often descend into the world of just trying to be out right offensive by pushing the limits of what they can get away with putting on the big screen. I am all for an occasional good scare. Take for instance the first Halloween film. That when scared me half to death when I was in my early teens. That was good horror achieving what horror is meant to achieve, scare your wits out of you. This film is just twisted and wrong. Makes me think of the Saw films-out to just make you squirm in your seat. I admit that I walked out of this film after just a short while, but I refuse to waste my precious time on such garbage. I also must admit that I only watched what I did so that I could write a review to try and discourage others from subjecting themselves to this filth. STAY AWAY from this one.

194,anythinghorrorscott,The Human Centipede Only Manages to Disappoint,4,21 June 2011,"Not since the brilliant French film MARTYRS (2008) has a movie come on the scene, grabbed you by the throat, and essentially dared you to watch it without flinching.  This is what was promised with THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE, which has gained quite the cult following. Does it deliver? In a word, not even close. This film is full of bad acting, pacing problems, and is a victim of being over-hyped so much that it couldn't possibly deliver what it promises. But who's fault is this?As the film opens we join Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser, resembling the love-child of Lance Henriksen and Udo Kier) who is sitting in his car in the shoulder of the road.  He's staring fondly at a picture of a canine centipede in which he joined three dogs to make one long creature.  The opening ends with  the good doc drugging and kidnapping a fat trucker.  Flash to our heroines, Lindsay (Ashley C. Williams) and Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie), two American tourists traveling across Germany.  They're getting ready to go to a party that is apparently in the middle of nowhere (judging by the roads they're traveling on).  On the way, their car gets a flat tire on a very remote road and after an encounter with an older, very creepy German guy they decide to walk and find help.  Guess which house they end up at? Is any of this sounding familiar?  It should - it's the set up for about 1,000 flicks.  The ""strangers lost in a strange land"" is nothing new. But those who bought into the hype will remain patient. I did. Unfortunately, this patience is never rewarded.In case you haven't already noticed, it becomes obvious that there's something very wrong with Heiter. We learn that he was a world-renowned surgeon who specialized in separating Siamese twins.  Now retired, he's doing ""research"" in his home lab - that's never a good sign.  He's obsessed with creating a three-segment human centipede in which three subjects are connected mouth-to-anus, sharing one digestive track. Heiter sees the arrival of Lindsay and Jenny as a windfall opportunity.  He already has the fat trucker, so he does what any good host/mad scientist would do:  He drugs the girls, chains them up in his basement operating room and preps them for surgery.  It turns out the trucker's tissue samples don't match the girls, so Heiter kills the trucker and then kidnaps a Japanese tourist.  Perfect match.Now THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE has all his pieces in place, and you can just feel a sick combination of dread and anticipation welling up inside as Heiter explains to his subjects what he's going to do to them:  remove their teeth, remove the ligaments from their knees, and alter their anuses in order to connect them mouth-to-anus.  Then just as he starts the procedure the scene fades to black and the operation is over.Where's the horror we were promised - the stuff that was supposed to challenge us to keep our eyes glued on the screen? Presumably, that was left on the cutting room floor in order to rush to reveal the titular abomination about 30-40 minutes into the running time. We see the centipede (yawn) and then watch as Heiter trains, that's right, trains his new pet.  This is a huge problem; after writer-director Tom Six blows his wad in a most anticlimactic way, you quickly find yourself losing interest.  There's just nothing to keep our attention after the human centipede is revealed. The entire film suffers from a very slow and lumbering pace, and let's be honest here, there's barely enough material to fill a short film let alone a feature length movie. And is this material all that original? I seem to recall a novel written by H.G. Wells called THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU - in 1896!! In it Dr. Moreau is basically turning people into animals. Yes there are a lot of differences in the two stories, but if Tom Six focused on the story, characters, and social commentary more than trying to make a disturbing and graphic film, he would have had more success.The only interesting character is Dr. Heiter. There's no doubt he's completely crazy, but what makes him so dangerous is that he's focused, intelligent, and determined. He doesn't look at his prisoners as people; they're simply subjects to help him with his research and are no different than a lab mouse.  It's pretty clear Heiter doesn't like people and seems to have grown tired of the human race.  People, to him, are subjects to be experimented on.  Laser plays the part beautifully - the one shining performance in this otherwise annoying cast. The girls, at least after being captured, are whiny and annoying.  During one of cinema's most epic-failed escape attempts, Lindsay makes so much noise you just root for Heiter to capture her. (At one point she actually tries to hide under water while Heiter stands by the side of the pool.) There's not one second when you think she'll succeed. This entire escape scene feels tagged on in order to pad out the running time.For a supposedly disturbing flick, with a totally twisted premise, THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE is actually quite blood-less. One tag line for the film is ""100% Medically Accurate,"" and that's the main problem.  The approach is so clinical that there's no over-the-top mayhem that could have catapulted it to cult classic status - or at least made it a midnight movie favorite. In fact, all the the ""disturbing"" imagery is included in the trailer.  So if you saw the trailer you've essentially already seen the entire film. Besides Dieter Laser's performance, there's nothing here to recommend, and on top of everything else, the sound quality is terrible.  Apparently, there's already a part two in the works with a 12 segment human centipede.  Meh.  Skip this one and go watch MARTYRS again",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
195,Bmore1984,A True Coming Together Film,4,27 August 2012,"A negative review here because the film is repulsive, ghastly or strange is inappropriate. Most persons who saw this film knew its substance beforehand and what they were getting themselves into. I feel for the rare person who did not. Yikes... The film was specifically designed to shock and pervert, just like other films in the gore-horror genre. Tom Six should, in fact, be credited for creating a product as original and intriguing as it was over-the-top and cheesy. The novelty alone is exploration worthy.The film's undoing, however, is the lazy and paltry writing. The inability to tell a coherent story around this experiment, especially the what and why, is beyond frustrating. For example, we never learn why the madman is actually engaging in this experiment. Why mouth-to-anus? We are simply forced to conclude that he is either insane or has a god complex - both lazy cop-outs.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Others in this class I suppose are things like cannibal holocaust which is a failure I was glad of what happened to them, the crew were aggressive murdering b*******, another is clockwork orange again even Kubrick epic failed in this genre as you don't feel sorry for the lead as he's a nasty rapist piece of scum it was great seeing what was happening to him, and this follows on the same lines really, as far as shock value it scores high but at the same time its so badly done, especially the plot its so stupid, I think the director was literally just going for shock value and everything else he chucked in to make up the film, what I will say is Iam so glad my mind can't and doesn't come up with sick stuff like this I think he needs help really I def wouldn't want him anywhere near my kids or anything, he obviously can't make a decent film which is why the end result is a shocking, but piece of crap filmmaking.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
197,danthsmith,a true original,1,1 September 2009,I was lucky enough to see this at Frightfest and came away thinking I'd really seen something disturbing and original. Easily the most original and likely to be lasting film of the festival. A true cult is born. Something of the tone of David Lynch and the same effect of queasy laughs and impression of real obsessive imagery as th first time I saw Eraserhead. Also a little of Cronenburg. (although it's not at all comparable as a film) its the closest I can get to describing it's impact. on the surface it's a horror film with one of the greatest mad scientist performances ever from Dieter laser it also has a really disturbing central idea. The less said the better as the novelty is part of the fun. It's filmed really cheaply but competently and I look forward to the sequel.

200,thefoxzzwlgames,Why was it filmed?!,5,7 June 2021,"After watching the entire trilogy of the Human Centipede, I can say with confidence ""Why was it filmed""?!.Although for me there are practically no advantages in this film, I want to say about the small part of the positive moments that are there.1. The idea of the tape itself, although disgusting, is original, but I do not understand why it was necessary to do part 2 and 3, it seems to me that such vomit
was not worth making a whole trilogy.2. For the main characters (two women and one Chinese), I personally worried, although I think they are very stupid, I do not want to stretch the review with an explanation of ""why""? I'll give you an example: at one point, one of the girls is released and runs out of the basement of a mad surgeon breaks a window in one of the rooms and now you can say with a stretch that this is a happy ending but it comes to an understanding that only half of the film has passed and if this woman now runs away from his house, she will come to the nearest police station and tell what happened to her and in which house this psychopath is located, the police will come there, tie this freak and put him in a mental hospital, but that's not going to happen because it's a horror movie and she's like a complete fool trudging out there to get her friend out if she didn't the end would be much more positive.3. The actor who played the abnormal surgeon coped with his role very well you really hate him and sincerely hope that he will die.But all the same, the advantages that I have described do not compare with the scale of disgust and misunderstanding.""Why was it filmed""?! I asked myself this question more than once during the viewing.I will say a few words about the 2 and 3 part they are even worse the only thing that happens there is an increase in the centipede and the stupidity. The second part is trying to be an intellectual film so that it doesn't fall into the mud at all because if you take off all this curtain of the art house and stop saying that the director is a genius and it's just you're stupid, this film will just become a thrash abomination. I don't want to talk about the third part, it's just a bit of a mess and it's not clear why it was made.Conclusion:This film has an original idea if you remove the numerous cliches, then maybe you get a film on the weak seven. Because a movie with such a plot a priori can not be highly appreciated and nominated for an Oscar, no matter how much the creators of this ""masterpiece"" would like it.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Even with its sickly plot, director Tom Six makes his best shot of doing a project he himself had dreamed of, that took a lot to create, and for investors to come on board took balls to do. Even though this film is nasty and sickly, a great lead performance from Dieter Laser as Dr. Heiter makes it good enough for me to say that if not see it in a theater, rent it to give yourself a terrifying evening in. Watch it just for the lead performance of Dieter Laser, he just captures this role and runs with it to the furthest extent to go with the material, some may vomit during it, some may never see the world the same again, but see it for its lead",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
202,ruthnoakes,5 Stars just for making me laugh so much,5,10 September 2010,"My friend stayed over and watched The Human Centipede (directed by Tom Six) with me last night.The worst (best) part was Dr Heiter, played by Dieter Laser. He was truly creepy looking, and his acting made you feel like perhaps he was this scary in reality too. The film was about his being a surgeon; he used to separate conjoined twins, but then becomes fixated with joining living things.Naturally, this leads to his ideal of a human centipede, connected by sewing their mouths to each others butts, so that they share one digestive track. Implausible in the long-term, and hilarious, so I was glad when one of the three victims died from infection. That was the most medically accurate part.The film was not scary, but hilarious. I just couldn't stop laughing at what idiots the characters are. One of the two female leads had the chance to escape, but hides instead of smashing the window to escape straight away. And the Japanese guy, played by Akihiro Kitamura, who is also a captive, actually stabs Dr Heiter with a scalpel, but only in the foot and leg. He goes crazy and bites him, but instead of using his chance to kill the crazy Doctor, or knock him unconscious at least, he chooses to just attempt to run away (difficult with two girls surgically attached).I had no real sympathy for the characters because their survival instincts were poor, I like it when characters truly try their best and are beaten down, but these three were mainly moronic and therefore deserved it. The very few chances they had to escape they wasted completely.As ridiculous as this film was, it's worth watching because it's one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, and wasn't too badly shot.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Although at times the acting was good it was missing something, when i watch a movie and an actor is just nor believable it ruins everything that is good about that movie as i am so distracted i just want to walk out.The storyline was not very strong and the filming in my opinion was not what people look for when going to a cinema. This movie is the perfect example of why people are turning to sharing movies with each other over the Internet. It is just a waste of money and time sitting in a cinema which you do not want to leave because you have paid good money to watch something that was just not ready to be released.If producers are going to continue producing this type of entertainment they must not expect people to willingly pay to watch it. I am sure with a rewrite and a good producer this movie could have created a great fan base as the ideas behind it are fantastic, it could have encouraged a whole new genre of movies and been entertainment that people are prepared to pay to see, this movie just disappoints on too many levels to even try to analyze it more than to say i gave it 3 stars for the idea and took seven away because of the conversion of the idea to the screen.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

In addition to create a funny story to pass on posterity, The human centipede didn't shake me or my friends (fainted one apart) so much. I wouldn't call this movie a splatter, because the bloody scenes are not many. I think that what upset of this film is the general idea: a horrible, inhuman, insane mutilation with no reason.

206,katherine_stears,"Movies Suck: Dear Movie Industry, This movie. Do more things like this.",8,23 June 2010,"...The concept of this movie shocked a lot of people, and disgusted even more, and even Roger Ebert wouldn't give it any stars, claiming the star system to be ""unsuited to this film."" People left the theater during test screenings, and all in all, this movie got a lot, and I mean a LOT of bad hype. Needless to say, I HAD TO SEE IT.A lot of people slammed this movie for being a huge disgusting gore fest but it wasn't really nearly as gory as movies like ""Saw"". In fact, the gore was fairly minimal, and necessary; People getting shot/stabbed and bleeding, the surgery scene had a little blood, and one part where one of the girls tried to escape, she accidentally ripped an IV out of her arm and that bled quite a bit. Other than that, I can't really think of any scenes with blatant bloodshed. But really, this movie didn't need to be swimming in blood. It was plenty disgusting on its own, and I say that with a big smile of approval of my face, and two thumbs shoved high into the air (or they would be if I wasn't using them to type)...The film is made in a really simple way in a way that works, I think, unbelievably well... I think one of the things that surprised me the most was the lack of soundtrack the movie had. Most movies use music as a way to build atmosphere, but if there was any music in this movie at all I didn't even notice it. Even the end credits were just the surviving girl's hysteric cries. I think that's what really impressed me; The movie didn't NEED music to help build atmosphere. It did that quite well on its own.The movie was scary in a very dark and cruel way, and the idea was completely and utterly original. One of the reviews I read about the movie compared the plot to something out of a Junji Ito comic, and that's the exact kind of feel I got. A bit slow-paced, but so interesting and terrifying in such a new way that the pacing is hardly a deal-breaker. The movie is an excellent display of the something so disgusting and original and will surely fill your evening with nightmares of eating someone else's feces for the rest of your life, and if you have the stomach for it, I couldn't recommend it enough.Go see it RIGHT NOW.

207,HorrorFIlmReviews,Ted Munns Horror Film Reviews - The Human Centipede 'First Sequence' (2009),5,15 June 2011,"I stumbled into a small screening room a year or two ago, looking for the place where I had a job interview. Instead what I found was one of the first screenings of this film (pre-release). Before I could explained who I was and what I was doing there, security attempted to chuck me out of the cinema for being a protester against the screening of the film. I never watched the film that day, but from then on I looked forward to its release.Plot: Two American girls on a road trip through Europe, break down on a stormy night, on a German back road and when looking for help and a phone they end up finding a house alone and in the middle of know where. Their host is the very creepy, Dr. Heither (Dieter Laser).Hot or Not: Is the film scary, a little, is the film disturbing in its content yes (until I watched 'A Serbian film' in which this film can't compare in terms of sickening subject matter) The film has it's creepy moments, but it is the violence and the themes that over shadow anything else within the film. Although I love horror, I am not the greatest fan of torture films, I would rather see a film with atmosphere that goes out to frighten it's audience, rather than shock them. Saying that I did enjoy 'Hostel', but maybe that was because it had strong character development where this film does not. The same can be said about 'A Serbian Film' which also had strong character development. In this film the characters seem just to be props for torture. The setting could have been used to better advantage however the film did remind me very much of Martyrs (2008) which is a far superior film.The ending of the film is extremely daft and clearly shows the director had know where to go with the story once the concept of the centipede was created.Birds and the Bees:Yes, but nothing of a nice nature.Acting: The acting in this film is good and the Dr is very creepy and plays his part very well. The leads Lindsay (Ashley C. Williams) and Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie) are also good considering these couldn't be very pleasant roles to act in. However Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura) is annoying and the ending is just ridiculously annoying involving his character.Overall:The film is OK, it craves cult status but only the hype surrounding it has made it a bit more than just a straight to DVD Torture film. It is shocking in places and this may appeal to some, however it was a one view only film to me. I would stick with 'Hostel' or 'A Serbian Film' if I was to go down the torture porn route.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
208,chloemichelleashby,Shocking? No. Made me feel dirty? No. Disappointed? Yes!,5,12 April 2017,"After watching this film tonight for the first time (I know, i'm late), I felt I should leave a quick and too the point review.My summary does sum it up really. Years ago I had been warned by a few people to never watch The Human Centipede because of 'dirty messed up ideas'. Now i'm just sitting here wondering 'were these people being serious?.' For the first 20 minutes, I think this film would suit the comedy genre much better, wont give any spoilers but i'll say this, ever felt like you were hoping the two stupid people in a film would just die already? Well expect that feeling to rise back up when watching this. The acting was also not great, did improve a little as the film got on it's way to the end, once the credits started rolling. Don't get me wrong though, it wasn't the worst acting i've ever seen, unfortunately.Now the reason why I didn't get as 'shocked' as some of the other reviewers, I assure you that i'm not one of these weirdo's who get off on torture porn/horrors with a little blood. I'm a normal 24 year old female. But as I watched A Serbian Film only a few months ago for the first time, i'm very unlikely to get shocked at this. A Serbian Film really did shock me and I personally think the shock factor was more extreme but better. So when I was watching The Human Centipede naturally comparing, I found the hype didn't live up to the name. The stretched out scenes did not add anything for me, I knew at the back of my mind I just had the thought 'Is this it?' Plus, the script is nothing to really rave about either. So now i'm just sat here debating with myself whether to give it a 4 or a 5 rating...I'll give it a 5 as i'm feeling generous. To be honest, think I've rated one of the Bring it On films a 6 so that really does sum it up.Would I recommend this film?

209,andrei-galgau,pretty darn good actually!,8,21 March 2012,"Well, first of all, and I intend this as a reply to most negative reviews, you must judge this movie for what it is: a horror movie. OF COURSE it's not medically accurate, OF COURSE it portrays a bunch of young actors with bad acting skills getting tortured, OF COURSE the plot is thin and revolves around a fairly simple yet very shocking idea. What the hell did you guys expect from a horror movie? Now, as far as horror movies are concerned, this is pretty darn good actually, and belongs up there with some classics like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Hellraiser. So yes, if you intend to see a feature length movie of Dr House you've come to the wrong address, if mindless and gruesome violence is what you want, then come join the party!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
210,TronkyLizard,"wow, what a movie",5,22 May 2010,"And i don't say that in a good way...i don't say it in a bad way either..it's like in the middle..why? well ill tell you why after these messages.quick overview just in case.it's about two girls on vacation in Germany, they get lost, and find a house, this is where we meet the weirdo doctor, where ,(after some little white lies ;p) he gets them asleep and straps them to hospital beds. where the movie finally kicks in with his, ummm...""vision"".the acting, (to me) it's average, it does the job, though at first i would care less about them,(since they are you're typical pretty girls that don't know how to do anything) the situation they are in and the constant suffering just makes you feel really freaking sorry for them. And the doctor, is just so serious an into his job, it's like the actor was BORN to play this character(he just looks like a psycho doctor) i wouldn't be surprised if he was the doctor yelling ""It's ALIVE!!!!"" in Frankenstein...except serious..maybe...i don't know i liked him.This movie is not the most original thing out there though. Once you take the whole human centipede thing into context, everything else about the film it's like your average thriller, suspense film.This movie is not scary, it's not even trying to scare you, in this movie you are through the whole film just wanting to know how is it all going to end!. Will they live? Will they die? Will the house explode in slow motion while racist transformers come save the day!!!??? well i wont tell you cause i don't like spoilers But i will tell you this...This is one of those few movies that once the suspense kicked in, I was in freaking suspense, I was freaking trembling out of the stress of what was going on. And, it's been some time for a movie to give me that emotion. The movie is average, but it did the freaking job. I recommend it for the strong willed (cause i seriously got sick a few times).horror fans should check it out, it's cool.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

In fact, if anything, that's what saves this movie from being a total waste.Points also for music, screen direction and lighting. The only things missing are the plot, which is full of holes, and some kind of meaning to the whole thing - I don't think I ever really understood the doctors motivations, even in his madness.Despite all its flaws, there's something in this movie that made it compelling to watch.

212,gtmail77,Better than expected. Worth renting but not during dinner.,8,12 January 2012,"This script and production could have gone many ways...gross out, cheapo, campy, low-budget action, weird. But I think I see what the director was trying to accomplish and he did...very well. Take a gross, hideous idea but focus on the cruelty and insanity by highlighting the Dr. This film isn't for the faint-hearted in that it's gross but not in a Starship Troopers kinds way. It hits pretty hard. More like a Rob Zombie movie, but with a motive. (Hated Devil's Rejects) It was a great balance of science gone mad with cold calculation, punched up with graphic images and constant feelings of desperation, denial, and acceptance on the part of the centipede. I like sci-fi movies with less dialog - Alien, Sunshine, 2001 - and by muting the 2 girls, the audience can understand more. Plus, they weren't the best actresses in the world. There are a few logic glitches and the usual gripes about opportunities to escape, but one has to get past it. The Dr's line ""Feed her!"" pretty much sums up the whole movie. I've read about the sequel and it sounds like it's more of a typical slasher/basher script with little authentic depravity, just lots of gore. I'll pass on HC2 but rec the first.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
213,pricedominic,My Sweet 3 Dog,2,6 December 2011,"For you to be reading this review, you must either have a slight interest in this film, or you enjoy the idea of humans in centipede form. Both of which would raise serious questions in my head about your own personal mental health. Simultaneously, for me to be writing this review proves that i must have watched it as well, therefore having similar thoughts originally.Now having glanced at a few of the other reviews on here, i can see that a lot of them are saying 'So Gross i wanted to be sick,' 'Worst film ever' 'The director must be insane' and so on. I disagree with these comments 100%. Firstly, the director is not sick, he is actually quite clever in a way. He obviously realised that he was never going to be a great director, he was never going to get the chance to direct a masterpiece. But he yearned for the fame, he longed for the notoriety. And that is exactly what he achieved through this film. When most people mention The Human Centipede, they always include a line similar to 'the Director/Writer must be crazy', or they would have researched his name and quote you it (Tom Six in case you didn't know). This is exactly what he set out to achieve. Now that the praise is over with, let me deal with the actual film.This film is one of the worst films i have ever seen, and not because of the fact that there is a Human Centipede crawling around for most of it. Mainly, it is due to the terrible, terrible acting from all involved. The opening sequence of the two girls getting ready to go out, then travelling and getting stuck in the woods, then leaving their car in the middle of nowhere so they can aimlessly walk around in the rain has to be one of the most pointless badly acted scenes ever. Obviously, if actresses have agreed to star in a film where they are attached to someone's anus via the mouth for the majority of the film, then you aren't expecting terrific performances. But it is still a film nevertheless, and therefore some kind of acting talent is expected, which this film is completely lacking. The two bumbling policemen are a particular low-light of the film. Not only are they both horrifically bad at acting, they also decide to go in for a quick drink with a murderer, and then both get killed very very easily without much struggle at all.Secondly, if you are intending to watch this film to be grossed out, you will be disappointed. I have seen more gore in an episode of Coronation Street than in this film. Once you get past the premise of the film, then there really isn't much at all. You don't see any surgery, they are connected together in a gross way, but nothing is shown other than lots of tape and bandages.The reason why this film has gained so much interest, and therefore quite a bit of money for Tom Six, is because of the ridiculous nature of the plot. I ended up watching it because people challenged me too watch it, and thats how it has spread across the country, like a debilitating disease that has scarred the film industry. I put forward a challenge to you readers...Don't watch this film. Instead, do something useful with that extra time you will have gained. Tom Six is quite clearly lacking in talent and imagination, so lets not give him the credit of watching his pathetic excuse of a film. Once you have read this, DO NOT watch the film and DO NOT tell anyone about it.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
214,halliejopo,Perfect example of an interesting concept that is poorly executed,2,13 October 2013,"At first glance, The Human Centipede is an intriguing, original premise. Disgusting and perverted, but original. However, this film was so badly directed, written, and acted, that it fails in almost every way possible.The two main actresses were laughably bad. Of course, most of it probably wasn't entirely their fault, as they didn't have much of a script to work with. The dialogue was so cringe inducing that this movie became comical at times. But kudos to all the actors for doing the most they could with so little.For those who are considering watching this movie, I can't say that I would recommend it. Even for people who like slasher films, the Human Centipede does not make the cut. Very little scares, brief nudity, and only moderate gore makes this movie very disappointing. Perhaps if the director had made this movie more of a horror movie, it could have been a bit better.Despite all of these criticisms, I have to say that the Human Centipede was a great way to kill time. And it is short, with only about a 90 minute running time. So if your curiosity gets the better of you (like it did me), give the Human Centipede a shot. You won't be frightened or have nightmares, but you will be grossed out and laughing all the way.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
215,MontyBurns1969,Some of the worst acting I've ever seen.,2,22 November 2014,"I honesty cannot think of a worse acting performance than by the 2 females in this movie. Luckily, all they had to do is moan and grunt for most of it.The idea of the movie although original is repulsive. I recently watched a video on 15 torture devices throughout history and not one of them effected me like this one. I thought the doctor did a great job and the makeup was very good, I was impressed with the look of the stitching on the face. The equipment in his basement operating room was actually rented from a hospital so that made it a little more credible and eerie. Those are about all the good points of the movie.Now I could go on and on about the negative things but the scene of them walking through the woods to get help is so ridiculous it's hard to believe it was meant to be taken seriously, maybe it wasn't? Maybe this was meant to be a comedy/horror? Or when the one girl has a very small window of opportunity to escape but instead of getting out and running for help she spends 1/2 hour trying to drag her unconscious friend up a flight of stairs and out of the house, my goodness. I'm not sorry I watched the move, it was entertaining- the sequel is a different story but it's one of those movies that aren't easily erased from your memory even though you'd like it to be.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

But I'm also not afraid to call a spade a spade and point out filth where I see it. There is so much garbage in the world today. You don't have to watch a horror film to be horrified. Just turn on the news. And then someone goes and makes a film like this. A film with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. A film whose plot is entirely based on someone's off color joke about a suitable punishment for sex offenders (this is true. Read the Wikipedia article). A despicable piece of garbage which makes you wonder how someone who would want to make a film like this could ever be offered a camera with which to film it. The concept of the film is neither interesting nor creative. It's just gross. And ""gross"" should never be a reason to make a film. Good entertainment, in my opinion, should either enlighten or encourage. Even dark films or horror films have the ability to enlighten. But Human Centipede does nothing worth mentioning in a positive manner. It's just trash. Pure absolute filth. Beyond the shock factor, lies a lackluster film with crappy acting and ridiculous dialog. You don't care about the characters because there is no background for which to care. The filmmakers here failed at every aspect of their craft. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this film.

219,robfather_87,Very sick movie (not for everybody),4,4 August 2013,"Synopsis: This movie is about a crazy German doctor (Dieter Laser) that seeks to experiment a project on humans. He want to pin them together and make a pet out of them (human centipede).I think mainly because his dogs died and i got the impression he tried the same thing on them. The doctor (surgeon) starts off by getting two female tourists Lindsay and Jenny (Ashley Williams and Ashlynn Yennie). He also gets an Asian boy Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura) to get his creation started. Will he make this project complete??Cinematography: The setting is in Germany and mostly at the house of the crazy doctor. The setting looks OK nothing very bad to point out. They have thought of how a doctor would have it in his home and done the set like it in my opinion should look like. Very clean and sterile place. And many sick paintings on the walls. If you have read any of my other horror reviews you may know that I am not a big fan of CGI effects in modern horror movies because they never seem to look good. In this movie it is nothing of CGI and for me this is a big plus.Acting: The acting in this movie is actually very good especially from the German doctor. Let me give some info about the main actors. Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser) have done a good load of German movies I have not seen any of them. He may be more famous by others maybe for his appearance in the TV series Lexx. If you are German movie fan maybe his best performance there is in a movie called Kaspar Hauser from 1993. Lindsay (Ashley Williams) have not done too many movies, nothing to mention anyway. She did an OK job in this movie. Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie) have not done many movies before but has some upcoming in 2014. She is in an episode of True Blood called ''in the evening''. Nothing much to say about Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura) either but he did an episode of Heroes called ''Acceptance''.Music/Sound: This is not the kind of horror movie you would think or care much about the sound and music, but it is OK nothing to point out there. It was nothing that was out of place or anything. If I should point out a favorite sound-wise in this movie, it may be the sound mixing of the more gory scenes. Costume/Make-up: This is not the kind of movie where you would look much into the costumes but everything looks good, nothing out of place for its time of place or anything. When I talk about make-up it is not always like how they look with make-up. In a horror movie it is more like how the blood looks if it is that and how the mask or things like that looks. In this it is mostly the blood that is the center and that looks great. Also how they look in the scenes where they are the centipede and that looks OK I guess. Not my cup of tea to watch but. Summary: This is a good horror movie for those liking it a bit sick if I should call it that. Because this is a very sick movie I got a bit disgusted at times, so this is not a movie for everybody. Would not recommend it for a first date movie. I always like to recommend other movies that comes to mind for those who like the movies I review. If they want something more likewise. The first movie series that comes to mind is the Hostel movies. If you want more of this movie it is a sequel 'The Human Centipede 2 (2011)' and it is a third movie coming up later in 2013 but it is delayed as far as I know at the moment. For the director of this movie Tom Six I have not seen anything more of him. He has not made many movies but he is the director of all the Human Centipede movies. All in all this is not a bad horror movie but really not for everybody. It was a bit too much for me but if you like it sick and disgusting in a way go for it.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The level of blood and gore is unbelievably domesticated - any episode of the Saw saga wins hands down and the acting skills are almost non-existent.

It's okay.. no connection with the characters coz no character development, lacks some elements that other horror, thriller movies have. The part when the Japanese guy cut his throat was unexpected but then I thought there was no back story behind that or at least some clue. But then I also thought that maybe it was done like that for the sake of unpredictability. I didn't find it that clever.. The crazy doctor was giving off too many obvious clues that he's the murderer to the policemen which I wasn't a fan of. And also, why would the police not bring their search warrant when they went there to search for missing people?? I know it's a movie but c'mon!!! Maybe they went to get their guns that's why they left?? I don't get it!! XD It kinda defeated some elements of the movie for me. This is already gross and I didn't want it to be grosser but it should've put more gross elements on it. Plot build up was okay.. some parts like when they were climbing up the stairs was thrilling and when the protagonist was trying to escape. It's lacking to me. I felt like the Japanese guy had more connection to me than any of the other characters but just a slight connection. I didn't feel the utter dread from the doctor that I feel from other villains. It's kind of predictable coz the policemen died.. I kinda liked the part when the girl protagonist was the only one who survived in the centipede but we all know she's gonna end up dead anyway..*Watched on Thurs., 12/03",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
224,zlarvixen,Original and unforgettable flick,8,24 June 2020,"This movie, contrary to what lots of people will say, definitely wasn't ""bad"". The idea was sickening as hell, and at times the acting was horrendous, but that was pretty much what the film was going to deliver. Nobody goes into this film without knowing exactly what to expect.In my opinion, Dr. Heiter was nowhere near as intimidating as I imagined he would be. His voice definitely gave tingles, but he was only truly scary the first moments we see him escorting the girls through his house that night when their car breaks down. After the operation, he turns into a laughable character, honestly. One of the cops that came to his house near the end stared him down intensely, and suddenly he didn't seem so powerful.In a way, the viewer almost develops a kind of Stockholm's Syndrome towards the doctor - you can't really touch on why, but you can't exactly 100% hate his character. He shows many gestures where he almost hesitates when looking at his creation, and he doesn't appear satisfied with his life. He's so cold, yet there's so much ""feeling"" coming out of him. He doesn't try to hide his evilness - which almost brings out a kind of human quality as a result.Overall, Heiter seems like someone who was mistreated severely in his previous days or someone who suffered horrendous abuse which caused his mental deterioration. In many moments it is seen how he is thinking to himself quietly, he does not have the confidence that most psychopaths do. In the end, I found Laser's character far less menacing than it could be implied.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Finally, a new creative idea, i thought!Needless to say, I was wrong.Typically being set in a very clichéd style: Girls break down in the words, in the rain, in the middle of the night, with no signal on their phones and end up getting drugged by some random man. With the storyline being so new, I really was hoping there would of been a LOT more imagination having gone into the script as I found it very flat and boring.The ""victims"" themselves were also quite tedious. For example, the one girl who had her chance to escape seemed to take actually FOREVER! Fair enough she was dragging her friend along, but it was so slow paced i just wanted to turn off.The surgery scenes themselves did make me squirm a bit and the overall ""human centipede"" idea was quite shocking to see. But that was pretty much it and you knew what was coming most of the time as the trailer pretty much summed the entire film up in less than 3 minutes!The ending, was DREADFUL. Seriously?

You are stupid if you say those things, however.The film has little gore at all, besides a few second surgery scene and some blood, but beyond that it's nonexistent. I'm a fan of bodily horror, it creeps me out and gives me a thrill, because there's nothing scarier than the idea of your own body being completely messed up in horrible ways. And that's the horror appeal of this movie; the idea!In fact, the movie has little more to offer than the concept of mouth- to-anus attachment. Many of the actors can't be taken seriously and plenty of the plot devices used are unrealistic and laughable with that classic horror movie sense of ""WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT!""I give the movie a 6/10 since the idea is so freaky, and the fact that the actor that played the villain is great. If it would of had better actors, better writing, and perhaps showed a slight bit more gore, it most definitively would of been better.

The notion of a Nazi surgeon that specializes in human anatomy/physiology as it relates to Siamese twins / conjoined twins and then decides to physically splice unwilling humans together is mentally terrorizing - especially if the surgery is remotely plausible. The planned surgery here is simply asinine...

233,AMadLane,"Shocking, and shockingly well made",9,30 May 2010,"Guaranteed unlike anything you've likely ever seen (except for the first 15 minutes of set-up, which play a bit like Rocky Horror without the singing), and pitch-perfectly scripted, filmed, cast and (bravely, bravely) acted, this film draws on the medical gorefests of Japan from the mid- to late-80s, such as Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment (where the whole raison d'etre for the film was to showcase a young nude women being surgically dismembered in ultra-realistic style) and the over-the-top camp-gore films of Andy Warhol, specifically his Frankenstein and Dracula, and is at once quite funny (mostly early on) and then rather sad, or almost -- dare I say -- poignant. If you ever think YOU'RE having a bad day...Dieter Laser, the villain, is quite a find. Reminiscent of Udo Keir in the aforementioned Warhols, his massive Teutonic forehead is like a character in its own right. The women, although both caucasian brunettes, are both fine actresses, and only make the mistake of drinking the glasses of water offered by their host -- which of course contain roofies (which do look a bit too much like Alka Seltzer tablets). They pretty much behave the way one would think they would in such an absurdly grotesque situation. The Japanese actor is also called upon to show some acting chops, and has some of the funnier lines, which are subtitled (as is the German dialog). Even the other, relatively minor couple of characters are rendered interesting through accomplished casting. This movie screened for two weekends at midnight at the Detroit area's primary Landmark art house; went away for a weekend or two; and now, is back, apparently by popular demand. Of the audience of approximately 20 last night, only three people left, and that was during the brief, but realistic, surgical sequences. Frankly, I wasn't originally interested in it, figuring it for just some more badly made, cynical torture porn, and while it certainly does share many of the constructs of that subgenre, I must admit that, of our group of four people who saw it together, all seemed to relish its uniqueness and cinematic skill.

I love horror, I love sick stuff (what a weird thing to say) and I love trash, but this movie is in my opinion just plain stupid and doesn't manage to be good in any of the three mentioned sections. Its not scary enough, not gory enough (although the idea is twisted, but in a really dumb way) and its just not good trash either. As the idea for the movie seems to have arisen from a joke, unfortunately so is the implementing of this joke a joke. Tom Six should've saved about 80% of the money and shortened the movie by 80% and we would all have a funny and fairly interesting short movie that would say everything this movie says in a lot less shorter time. This whole never-seeming-to-end movie with a constantly yelling Japanese guy, two really bad acting American ""oh my god oh my god oh my god"" chicks and a doctor that is so stereotype nazilike is just retarded, and I don't mean that in a funny way.

Not out of any like or dislike of the film, but as he put it ""this is a film in which the stars do not shine"". And this is not a negative statement about the film merely a description of the disgust, depravity, and depression in this film.The plot as you well know involves a mad German doctors who kidnaps two young American girls and one Japanese man for the purposes of fusing the three together, mouth to anus, creating the human centipede.The premise of the film alone is enough to make someone vomit. But rather than being a exploitation film, or some fetish porno, and beyond the initial shock of its premise lies a low-budget horror film, with a clever hook, and is effectively executed. And surprisingly there is little gore or graphic imagery that one might expect from a film like this.I admire writer/director Tom Six for what he accomplishes with a low budget, small cast, limited locations, and one horrifying, original idea when compared to what Hollywood accomplishes with all their millions of dollars spent on remakes and ripoffs.One of the purposes of a horror film is to ask the question of ""What's the worst thing that could happen?""

I would strongly recommend not taking this movie seriously, if you plan on watching it. I've read a bunch of reviews on this site where people are complaining about different aspects of this movie, some valid, some I found a little off. Right off the bat, let's take a look at the tag line: ""%100 Medically Accurate"". I've seen a lot of people basically saying, ""Nuh-uh"". Well bravo Dr. Obviously, you called that one. Just one thing. What made you believe that it would be in the first place? I mean, the movie is called THE HUMAN f'n CENTIPEDE! I really got a kick outta how many people were flexing their brains to point out that you can't live off human waste. The set up is kinda weak. 2 American girls get lost in the woods in some area of Germany after their car gets a flat. I guess changing the tire was out of the question, but did they have to go traipsing off into the woods? Guess sticking to the road seemed too obvious. Anyway, the house that they eventually come to for help just happens to belong to a mad doctor, with a hard-on for human centipedes. Add 1 hijacked Japanese dude to complete the party train, and it's time to get stitchin'. Again, I really can't believe how seriously people are taking this movie. I even read someone's review where they worried that this was gonna give someone the idea to try something like this. Really? And I still can't get over all the folks spoutin' the ""OMG, this is sooo NOT medically accurate"" complaint. I really gotta believe that whoever came up with that tag line was in on the joke, and it seems to have gone over a few heads. The best I can offer is to say that this is the kind of movie that your inner 14 year old will... umm... enjoy? No... how about... be able to sit through. If you've shut off that part of your brain, you'll probably really hate this movie, cause you'll be pointing out flaws like a real pro. I mean, straight up, a lot of this movie just doesn't make sense, but again, I must draw your attention to the title. It's not at all scary, but it's definitely messed up. I feel that this is the kind of movie you'd be best off watching with friends (all with a healthy sense of humor) and just try to enjoy on a ""OH, GROSS"" and HOLY SH*T, THAT'S MESSED UP"" kinda level.

241,grahamyounie,"A load of poo, literally",4,9 October 2010,"I won't discuss too much about the plot as most people are aware of the premise. A psycho surgeon kidnaps a group of people in his sick attempt to create a human centipede. He succeeds.What can I say. This film is bad, but it's also quite watchable and you're always wondering what will happen next. The actor who plays the Surgeon is one of the better villains of recent times. He looks, dresses and acts creepy as anything we've seen in a while and reminded me of a German Hannibal Lecter. You may feel that his performance is over the top at times but he's clearly crazy so normal character rules don't apply.The film is not without its share of tense moments. The scene where the Surgeon takes 2 girls into his home after their car breaks down is suitably eery. You know these girls are in trouble and soon enough they know it too. There are a few escape attemtps before we reach the halfway point and we see 3 people stitched together, mouth to anus, and yes, there is a brief scene involving a number 2.Like many horrors, there are a number of moments that should annoy you as a viewer, such as the inept cops towards the end (where's the back up fellas, and your police radios?) and the Japanese mans failure to kill the Surgeon when he has a clear and easy chance to do so, instead opting to crawl away (if it were me i'd have stabbed the Surgeon repeatedly in the neck but nooooooo not this guy) All in all, Human Centipede is a mixed bag. It's not as sick or scary as you might be led to believe but it does have a tense atmosphere, the acting by all is good and with the Surgeon, we have one of the better villains of recent years. I recommend it for horror fans but don't expect it to blow you away. it's not Texas Chainsaw and it's not The Exorcist.

242,diana_bereczky,Boring and Hardly Mad Any Sense...,4,22 February 2011,"The Human Centipede is a film directed by Tom Six and tells the story of a crazy surgeon, Dr. Heiter who has this bizarre fascination with creating ""centipedes"". Two American girls, who are on a trip to see Europe, end up staying in Germany and they decide to go to a night club. Sadly, these silly girls get lost in the forest, (God know why, it wasn't explained, the scene was cut short to just them being in the woods), their front, left, car wheel pops, they whine like idiots to each other and end up at the loony, old man's house and thus begins their days of sheer terror!!This movie, isn't as scary as most horror films I've watch...The Exorcism of Emily Rose, was a lot scarier than this movie that made no sense. The surgical procedures for Dr. Heiter's plan to make a 'Human Centipede' makes no sense really...I don't have a whole lot of knowledge about surgical procedures but anyone who watches this film will know what I'm talking about. Another thought that comes to mind, that makes this film pretty bad, is the sudden scene scenario's. One minute the three struggling humans are struggling to move, the next thing you know they're outside, the next thing you know they're in a cage and they don't explain how these three, poor saps can move without their knee caps! Yes, and I forgot to mention that there is a Japanese tourist who gets mixed up in all this mess...He's not a bad little fighter, just a senseless quitter!I'm giving this movie a 4/10 because it IS different from most horror films that I've watched and it's a pretty good film to make fun of. My whole family, who watched this with me, have made fun of Mr. Heiter because of his bad acting and his accent.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who is sensitive because although there is no gore, the thoughts and the pains of what the people in this film have to go through is rather horrendous. But, seriously if you're out to just watch something different just watch 'The Human Centipede.'For the love of God as well, Tom Six please don't make another sequel and also...You're really sick and you need help!

I was excited to see it was on Netflix when I got Netflix, but then I didn't watch is for a while because I was kinda anxious about it. The only reason I'm mentioning all this is because perhaps my expectations of it were too high. Once it started, I got the feeling it was going to be a long movie. It was really slow and uninteresting. In fact, the whole movie was slow. I didn't feel like I knew the characters enough to identify with them and really feel for them, so where some movies you are on your edge of your seat worried about the character, I was just sitting there wondering about what the actors were thinking or who drew that picture. I also didn't like the mixed languages. The girls didn't understand German and none of them understood the Asian man, so none of them were really communicating. The Surgeon put the one person who spoke a language he didn't seem to know at the front. So really, there was no verbal communication between the two. It was also very tame regarding how much it showed. You see a glimpse of the girls breasts every once in a while and you see the surgeons butt in the pool, but nothing gory. Everything is really covered up. The connecting points of the three people are covered by bandages. There is nothing really graphic comparatively speaking. I really expected it to be more graphic, but it wasn't. It wasn't convincing and it never got me emotionally involved. It felt more like watching a science video than a horror movie. Granted, the idea of the movie was rather sick and the idea of what was going on was rather sick. It's not really worth watching. As for the second one, I didn't even make it half way through before turning it off. It started out better than the first one, but that isn't saying much. Basically, find something else to watch.

It won't be as painful as this film.Don't get me wrong, although I'm not a fan of the sort of splattergore this film is associated with, I thought it as actually kind of tame in terms of on screen violence. After hearing so much I expected the kind of movie where one character spills more blood than could be contained in the bodies of 5 people. Instead it was just sort of.. sick.No doubt the concept of being forced to s--- in someone else's mouth is sick, even worse of your the one whose mouth is being s-a- in, but even describing the film sounds less like a horror movie, and more like Bob Saget telling The Aristocrats. ""And then the mother, she takes her knitting needle and sews her husbands a-- to her mouth, which he proceeds to s--- in. And the talent agent asks, what do you call that act, and the father lets out one last spurt of diarrhea into his wife's mouth and says 'The Aristocrats.'"" But the sickness of the film isn't what gets me. It's the fact that despite all this, it never really goes anywhere. It's really kind of boring. It picked up in a few places, but it never really felt like it REALLY got moving. It just stopped. The main portion was just them crawling around the floor. It wasn't that impressive as either a good horror movie or a good gross out movie.

After about a week I dared my girlfriend to watch it with me so that I wouldn't have to be alone with it anymore. And, of course, I really wanted to see it again. Now that I was over the shock, I was able to appreciate the brilliance of this movie! Dieter Laser is amazing. This guy is as creepy and demented as they come. This in combination with the isolating atmosphere of the movie creates a depressing sort of dread inside of the viewer that is palpable. It makes you feel horrible while you're watching it, but oddly drawn back to it once you step out of it for awhile. Isn't that what great horror does? I remember feeling the same way about Friday the 13th, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, The Exorcist, and The Shining. Tom Six took horror to a new level with this film.

I just think it was very unnecessary and insensitive to be illustrating human experimentation inspired by one of the most sadistic of the Auschwitz Nazi War criminals, Josef Mengele. I think it is quite tasteless and I also don't think it is such a good thing to be stereotyping the German people today with. And considering the mounting tensions between ethnic groups in Europe today, I don't think it's such a great idea to make a movie like this at this time. We have too much chaos in this world now. I think filmmakers aren't always considering the feelings of people, especially Holocaust survivors and their descendants. It seems that it has become so politically correct to be Anti-Semitic here recently and in the past few years, much to my shock and dismay. I think film makers should consider what kind of movie they are making, if they think this film will to add the fuel to the fire of any angry feelings between ethnic groups, harboring grudges or digging up bones, that's the only use I can make of a film like this. It seems just the kind of movie to be labeled 'propaganda' by some, defended as 'art' by others. I myself feel that the film is quite racist and highly misogynist. I seriously could have done without this. I have never been able to peacefully visit the toilet ever since without thinking about this awful movie, and that is seriously not cool. I regret ever watching this film, and it is likely that you may also. I feel as if I need a mental douche and a psychological enema.

251,mane-57963,"Interesting film, but not a good film either",3,28 May 2017,"The Human Centipede, I have to say, is an interesting film. The idea may be ingeniously disgusting, but other than that, this film is a generic horror flick. Two American girls are vacationing in Germany, and after getting a popped tire (haven't seen 3 million other times), stumble upon a retired surgeon's house. He drugs the two girls and kidnaps another Japanese guy. He then tells him of his diabolical scheme: to sew three people together, mouth-to-ass. And that's pretty much it. Pros: -The idea of the film is a unique one to say. Its at least trying to be different -Dr. Heiter's look is definitely good for a horror villain. -Not too boring -The execution of the centipede is very convincing and well-done. Cons: -Generic horror formula (tires popped, meet a bad guy, blah blah blah) -Characters are bland, and 1-dimensional -You really don't give a rat's ass about the two girls, because they're so god damn irritating -Takes way too long to get to the centipede (50 minutes to be exact) -After initially kind of disturbed by the idea, you'll generally get bored of the film after. -Some moments are kind of laughable (Dr. Heiter trying to imitate a chicken)Overall, The Human Centipede is interesting, but really isn't a very good film or enjoyable for that matter.

The Human Centipede, while being original, was more disturbing than scary.Many of the scenes were so frustrating because of how stupid the characters were. I found myself screaming at the TV asking, ""What are you doing? Can you be that stupid?"" The acting is so-so. Dieter Laser (Dr. Heiter) was the best by far! He took his character to a whole new level and his acting is superb. I'm looking forward to seeing him in other films. Ashley C. Williams (Lindsay) was pretty good. Give her a few more years and a couple of other roles and I bet she'll do very well. She has the potential to be a great actress. Ashlynn Yennie (Jenny) was awful. She overacted way too much and I don't see her as a A list actor anytime soon. Akihiro Kitamura (Katsuro) was excellent. Even if there were no subtitles to what he was saying in the movie, you'd be able to see what he was feeling. Great actor.This movie was original. Never in my life would I think to write a movie about making a human centipede, but it could have been pieced together a lot better. The plot didn't move smoothly enough for me to be hooked. I was intrigued at the beginning, but I lost interest when the plot wasn't moving at a considerable rate.If you want to be disturbed or make fun of a movie with a group of friends, by all means rent The Human Centipede.

Yes there are clichés in the film but there's also much originality.More than anything else,this is a film noir! Oddly for a horror, you find yourself initially feeling annoyed and angered by the stupidity of the hapless female victims (nothing unusual there) but strangely sorry and saddened for them at the end. Contrary to what many have said, I thought the acting was commendable considering the tough, awkward working conditions.In summary, forget any dumb references to ""100% medically accurate"". That's just silly.

260,malefor0001,Does it Deserve love? No.,2,14 October 2010,"Well, the Human Centipede sounded like one of those old films when I first heard of it from some old chums, and then I spent £11.99 on it. And, while it's a good horror and scary, it's sicker than Saw 3, and that involves the scene when Jigsaw drowns somebody in Pig Guts. Thge Human Centipede delivers lots of horror, but the Centipede itself was a big no. If it were three humans morphed together, good film. But the film itself was generally sick. All I can say is that, because the film was all about some Siamese Twin Surgeon stitching two women and one Japaneze mans backsides and mouths together to make one big digestive system. Seriously, if this was made in the early days of horror, we may be looking a a good film, but the film was relatively disgusting and disgraceful.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
261,ZomComGod,Not As Bad As People Said...,9,19 March 2011,"I really enjoyed this film. I speak about 3 words in German and am only fluent in English, however I was still able to follow the plot of the film in enough detail to be able to sit back and watch; even without subtitles. The film starts off a bit cheesy and very American, due to the American girls who are obviously the typical attractive, female centre characters. It does, on the other hand, get a lot better. Clearly the director had to 'get into' this film as the making of it progressed. It is shot well and the acting is superb. The film got a lot of bad press and I heard from numerous people about its appalling content. I do not think this is as bad as they all say; it is defiantly no worse that some of the Saw films, and will definitely appeal to a similar audience (such as myself.) The only problem I have with the film is the way the characters seem to have been written with a lack of common sense and seem to be unable to see that a large, heavy lamp will make a better weapon than a shard of glass or scalpel.Over all, very good film and I enjoyed it from start to finish.

262,acari27,"Interesting, original, and not as bad as some people declare-as long as you're not a pussy!",7,16 April 2013,"After reading the reviews and looking at the overall rating (4.6) I was pleasantly surprised with this film-sure-its off the wall-but it surprises me that this interesting little film gets such a bashing. If it was not for the lead actor Dieter Laser-it may well have been dross-however, he is sufficiently cold and sick to have made me really rather enjoy this piece. And the notion that a doctor well practised at separating bodies would have the notion to join some isn't really that ridiculous. I found the girls (like most B grade horror) to be fairly poor actors , and yes-their lack of ability to even attempt a tyre change and then to traverse thick woods instead of walk along a road?-well-that fits with B grade well enough-so i wasn't phased by it, but i found the anxiety and distress of the resulting creature rather moving and realistic, and a wonderful little exercise in horror..sure the Christian family person who loved Titanic and Mission Impossible, who thought 'Precious' and 'The Killer inside me' was sick-and who doesn't like horror is always going to slam this kind of thing-but for the toughnuts who like black stuff-i actually think this is quite well done and satisfying once you get past the initial bore of poor decisions. It has its weaknesses-but overall-for the horror aficionado, for the people who are sick of Hollywood, for the REAL film buffs for whom no genre is too much-id say give it a watch. I enjoyed it. Its not an academy award winner-but its also not one of the dreadfully boring horror flicks that really aren't impactful and are so B grade you can barely remember them a week later. As for the sequel? -even better,possibly brilliant!, not to mention amusing, well if you like black humour -though its really only funny and of interest once you've seen the first. Not for tossers who cant see originality and find any film ""disturbing"".As far as I am concerned this film is drastically under-rated.

The way he takes his gun out of his car and put it under his jacket in the first 3 minutes made me laugh so hard and I should have known right there this wasn't going to get ANY better... The first scene with the girls, they sound like dutch girls trying to speak ""Inglis"". I'm from the Netherlands (where this movie was shot) and I know how dutch people sound trying to speak English... The movie as a whole was just utter crap. Even Uwe Boll can't make movies THIS bad.... There is not much to see. Bad acting. No story. Character's are 2D. It's just a comedy. Seriously. I'm glad I didn't waste any money on this. The whole idea of a human centipede was disturbing. But there should have been:*more gore. *Close-up of tearing seams when the centipede walks. *Shit spraying out of the middle-girls nose. *The operation should be more visible (now you see one tooth pulled and one piece of ass-skin.

Its not nearly as graphic as it could be but that makes it better. The doctor's intense psychopathic behavior is incredible. Directing is top notch, suspense keen, and content - well, its definitely a movie you've got to see to believe. The ending is as horrific as the best of its genre. The Japanese dude gets deep - too bad no one else knows what the hell he's saying. Some may consider this a ""B"" movie but I feel its in a class by itself.

268,moonbeaver,For Horror Fans,8,23 October 2010,"I'm a film lover and a horror fan. I can suspend disbelief perhaps a little better than others. When I watched 'The Sixth Sense', I didn't see the ending coming. I'm not sitting in a horror film trying to fault the writer and the director. I want to like it until I don't.The Human Centipede is a story conjured in a mind much different than yours or mine. When you watch the film you and you begin to put two and two together you'll laugh a little. And if you're watching it with your girlfriend you'll probably start making a few jokes, trying to break the tension. But there's a part of you deep down that isn't laughing. It's crawling into a dark corner. Kudos to the writer for having the integrity to write it. To the producers for financing it. To the actors for taking it seriously, knowing it could be the last role in their careers.To make a seasoned horror fan like myself turn away, to reach for the fast-forward button, I think that's an accomplishment. And not because of simple gore, it's not that. It's because the film forces you to put yourself in their shoes.If you're on the fence about watching this film, you don't need to read any reviews. Just look at the title. The title is: 'The Human Centipede (first sequence)'.
Now, say it out loud. It's called: The Human Centipede (first sequence).",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
269,MJalazo,"A unique premise, but inherently flawed and campy",3,29 April 2010,"As a longtime horror buff (not of blood and gore, but of macabre concepts that make you question the essence of mankind, and who we are as individuals), I was anxiously awaiting this movie. The preview was nothing short of chilling. Kicking back after a long day at work, I found it to my delight, on On Demand.The best part of the movie is Dieter Laser (although over the top at times, I credit him with throwing himself into the role of the deranged surgeon, without apology or hesitance). While not as consistently brilliant as he was in the preview, he manages to create a couple of viscerally unpleasant moments, most notably discussing the details of the impending surgery with his three subjects. He also communicates his personal angst and euphoria remarkably well, non-verbally.The cinematography is also quite good, catching scenes at unexpected and somewhat unpleasant angles. The camera-work as the centipede attempts to climb a spiral staircase is pretty impressive, and unnerving.Otherwise, the movie falls flat. I suppose that all the hype that has surrounded its release raised the expectation levels a bit, but in retrospect, it's hard to communicate horror and agony verbally when two-thirds of the victims' screams are constantly muffles by rear ends. The virtual absence of a musical score also creates a vacuum of emotion at times.Ultimately, while starting off as a modern take on Nazi human experimentation (the abstract concept of which is universally disgusting and a great premise, to be sure), it quickly and disappointedly diverges into an almost satirical autobiography of one man's quest for adoration and respect.Some good aspects, but not what I was hoping for.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
270,tycho-snelder,"Stupid, predictable and an absolute borefest.",4,8 October 2011,"The Human Centipede is a movie notorious for its bizarre premise: a mad scientist kidnaps three people and connects them to each other by stitching one's mouth to the other's rectum, thus creating a human centipede. Apart from this mildly disturbing concept, the movie is really nothing but a waste of 1,5 hours.After nearly 15 minutes of filler that won't be important for the rest of the movie, two girls, Jenny and Lindsay, are drugged and kidnapped by the ultimate person-you-shouldn't-trust-stereotype, Dr. Heiter. He then kidnaps a Japanese tourist named Katsuro off-screen. His role in the movie is basically just to scream in Japanese, which I can't understand. So yeah, I'm not really taking this character too seriously, and neither does the movie apparently, because it sounds like they're recycling his scream sound effects. Dr. Heiter then explains the movie's ridiculous premise to his three victims. One of the girls escapes, resulting in a poorly edited and unexciting chase scene. She then gets caught again, thus confirming that the entire 10-minute scene was entirely pointless.If you're big fan of gore movies, you are going to be very disappointed at this point, because you don't actually see Dr. Heiter constructing the human centipede. All you see is him pulling out a girl's teeth, which is more boring than shocking. After that, we get a couple of shots of Heiter doing nothing, until suddenly, the Human Centipede is standing in front of him. The rest of the movie mostly consists of Heiter trying to train the Centipede like a dog, and his odd arousal when Katsuro (who is in front) is forced to 'feed' the person behind him with his excretion (again, you don't actually see this, but I count this as a plus).This goes on for 20 minutes, until 2 police officers arrive, looking for the missing people. Despite the fact that Katsuro is screaming as hard as he can, the police can't hear him, even though several characters before this scene could clearly hear someone in the basement. It doesn't really matter though, because the Centipede escapes from the basement and manages to injure Dr. Heiter with the power of bad editing. This results in another scene of the Centipede trying to get away from Heiter, veeeerrrry sloooowwwwly. And Heiter tries to catch up with the Centipede, veeeerrrry sloooowwwwly. At least the movie has a consistent pacing.In the end, Katsuro slits his own throat for no reason, Dr. Heiter and the police shoot each other to death, Jenny dies of an infection, and Lindsay is left alone. End of movie.What can I say? Perhaps the premise might have worked if it was used for a short movie, but it clearly doesn't work when the director tries desperately to stretch the movie to 92 minutes by adding pointless scenes and conversations. The editing isn't good, most of the dialogue is predictable and the characters are just not interesting. If you are not a fan of gore, this movie will gross you out. If you are a fan of gore, this movie will bore you to death. Either way, you probably won't like this movie.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

So now we are 40 minutes in to the film and oh yea Don't TAKE WATER FROM STRANGERS EVER EVER!.The mad doctor performs surgery on the the 2 girls and an oriental guy.They are now stitched together from rear end to face.The film fills much better than Hostel or Saw but a few silly moments like escaping is possible but they just Don't bother to go threw open doors to escape.I know I certainly would.The Acting is dry at times by the 2 American girls but is saved by the oriental guy and the Mad Doctor .This is not a classic but I can see this as the film that spawns a lot more films like it.There is a sequel already which seems doubt-fall after the outcome of the film.It had its good moments.I can honestly say I have never seen a film like this but this is not as good as Passolins ""Salo"".Dont watch this film with young children or elderly relatives.I give this film a pass and I will probably watch it again.B",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

It was really not as gory as I expected it to be, the plot itself creeping you out more than anything. I feel as if some parts were just there to fill in voids. It didn't flow very well with the rest of the film, simply there to move it along. The shock and disgust you feel at first quickly decompresses, leaving you sitting through the movie feeling bored and disappointed.

273,Riddle_Of_Steel,Praise and Disgust Simultaneously,8,11 February 2011,"I read through a lot of the other negative reviews written about this movie, and I honestly cannot understand the complaints voiced at all. They sound like the typical rumblings from today's younger, attention-deficit generation of movie-watchers that need to see a ton of over-the-top CGI effects, cars blowing up, ridiculous slow-motion martial arts stunts, nude girl scenes, and senseless gore to keep their attention on what they are watching.How can people this movie be described as ""boring""? It was anything but....riveting is more the word I would choose.It did not show enough gore? A good thriller can scare more with what is IMPLIED, rather than what is SHOWN on screen...and it showed plenty. Surgically attaching three people anus-to-mouth, as horrible as it sounds, is even worse when the creator of the movie does not miss any of them medical complications involved from creating such a monstrosity. If you can make it through the scene when the first guy in the human chain cries that he cannot hold it any longer and has to defecate in the next girl's attached mouth without feeling any ill effects, you must be completely insensitive to human suffering, whether fictional or real.Some complain the characters weren't believable? I beg to differ, Dieter Laser provides a performance that far eclipses Hannibal Lector's most disturbing scenes... The actors acted the way one would expect human beings to behave when under such visceral distress (and being under the control of a madman who threatens to remove their teeth and perform surgery without general anesthetic). I guess some viewers are not able to accept movie characters that do not spout off catchy one-liners or that are not invincible action movie heroes....Then, folks said it was stupid because everybody spoke different languages (doctor spoke German, Japanese tourist, and two American girls)? Really? Of course, whomever said that is probably the type that never questions why aliens from other planets always have two arms, two legs and all speak English in sci-fi, of course. The language barrier was part of the terror...Then, some criticized it as ""bland"", because there was no political message or human message in the movie.....really? What was the higher message for viewers in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? What was the transcendental message in the 5TH ELEMENT? WHat was the political message in SAW?""100% Medically Accurate"", well...I will call BS on that one. But that does not cause me as many problems suspending disbelief as say, a guy who suddenly has his powers outside the Matrix as well as inside (MATRIX RELOADED)....or a dorky hero delivering one-liners like ""Welcome to earth!"" while the whole earth is under attack by aliens(INDEPENDENCE DAY)...or Aliens AND Predators being a common occurrence on 20th century earth, even though there was no knowledge of either in the 24th century when the other Aliens movies took place.Anyhow, I digress, the movie starts out with two really STUPID girls getting stuck in the woods somewhere in rural Germany. At first the movie seems to be drifting towards the ""cliche"", but soon departs far from anything I have ever seen before.It is hard to rate this movie on a ""star"" scale for me. On the one hand, I give at an A+ for concept, directorship, mood, and for creating such a suspenseful, successful psychological thriller. As a body-disfigurement horror movie, this one delivers on SO MANY Different LEVELS. But it was so genuinely disturbing in concept, what was shown, and what was implied, that my wife literally got sick while we were watching it, and I almost passed out myself. Keep in mind, I am no stranger to body-disfigurement horror flicks or gore either-- I loved Alien, the Exorcist, The Thing, etc., played football and saw plenty of green-stick fractures, and two deployments in Iraq where I got to see battle wounds everyday, and laughed at how corny the SAW movies were (besides the fact that I already figured out who the guilty party was in SAW about 2 minutes after I started watching it-- of course it was the dead guy on the floor, he was the one you would least suspect). While those other movies successfully thrilled me, they did not make me go searching for the eye bleach and mind eraser to wipe any memory of having seen this one afterward.So, in summation, I have to rate this movie on two different standards-- as a psychological thriller-- it has no equal, STRANGELAND cannot even touch this one, and SAW is like the preschool version of this movie. They did such a convincing job with this movie, it is hard to rate it as anything than superb and give it the respect it is due. But it is so disturbing, that I don't think anybody would ever want to watch this one a second time....so in that sense, I was not entertained, I was nauseated to the core. I cannot honestly recommend this movie to anybody I care for....it will shake you down to your bones.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Unless, of course, the experiment wasn't to make a functioning human centipede but merely to find out if it was possible to sew someone's mouth to someone else's arsehole? In which case the doc doesn't possess the level of intellect we are lead to believe and instead he is a moronic dick-head in possession of a few too many complimentary sewing kits.Am I being too harsh? Possibly, but if so it is only a little.I may be alone in this view but I have been spoilt with the creme de la creme of psychopaths in cinema and seen so many horror films that have left me speechless and with something real and deeply disturbing to contemplate. Think of all the horror villains out there, all the well known fictional psychopaths and their stories and how chilling the events that surrounded them were. Have you got that image firmly set in your mind? Excellent... now go watch one of those movies instead.Despite having all the potential to live up to the requirements of a damn good horror flick THC just couldn't do it, no matter how much it desperately scrambled about amongst taboos designed to shock and sicken with no real meaning or purpose. The film isn't just contrived, everything about it reeks of a desperation to be the sickest film in town using only the easiest route.I deeply saddened that we weren't presented with anything more challenging. You can almost hear it's silly little voice begging you to be shocked or scared or in some way disgusted by it all, but sadly, the only thing you are moved enough to do, is laugh.The plot is not just weak but has more holes through it than swiss cheese making the entire experience laboured from around 15 minutes in. Not to mention that our heroine is not even the slightest bit likable and every other character seems to have the logic section of their brain entirely removed leading to constant frustration for the viewer throughout. The acting is passable but not a single cast member understands that subtlety (especially in a movie that is otherwise so OTT) is often more moving, captivating and even more terrifying than beating the audience over the head with such obvious and overplayed performances. The film becomes offensive as it progresses, with every step underestimating the audience's intelligence and overestimating it's own cleverness. I am all for some mindless violence, gore and taboo subject matter if it is fun or entertaining... but this film was neither and it wasn't -supposed- to be mindless either. It may not win the #1 spot for ""sick films"" but yes,it IS a sick film... then again so was Martyrs.

Simultaneously, he has produced a piece of horror which may appeal to a niche audience to whom rimming is quite simply a way of life. Ultimately, though, a big part of the movie relies on feeling repulsed by the perverted gratification taken by the quasi-nazi doctor as he tends to his experiment.

I had heard about it when it first came out, and while it sounded interesting, it really didn't strike me as my cup of tea. Several months later I found myself snowbound with my two best friends over winter break, with all of us sick with the flu. To slow the insanity, one of them proposed watching Human Centipede after hearing about it from his Dad that morning. Being exceptionally sick & blazed as hell, my other friend and I decided it was a better option then moving downstairs. That was when things started to get weird.The film itself was definitely worth sitting through from start to finish. While I normally don't think much about the jokes that my friends and I make during films, this movie in particular sticks out in my head for some of the odd remarks that you really could not use in any other situation (""Dude, $50 says that she is going to be in the middle!"" among others). Tom Six did a good job of constructing the perfect twin horror-film-straw-women-that-you-have-to-hate. The movie also did a great job of burning into my head what has to be the greatest one liner of all time: ""FEED HER!"" All in all I would describe this as a okay movie that I personally would never want to see again. But it was fairly well done, and I have to admit that I've never seen anything remotely like it before.I think it's worth pointing out that The Human Centipede does the same thing as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in that while people remember it as being a disgusting and violent film, it's practically bloodless.

Cronenberg's early work comes to mind, but it's so much more cerebral than the visceral thrills Mr. Six has in store for us. Not to say much about the plot but, it involves the evil scientist, (the AWESOME Dieter Laser), performing extremely weird and unprecedented surgeries on a group of patients and the bond formed between the patients as a result of the shared experience. Not for anyone but horror fans, or maybe mad scientists, this film gives you what other horror films won't.

283,zt2112,Not Sure What To Say,5,5 May 2010,"Well first things first.I am not sure why i give this movie 5*.I liked it and i didn't.Guess that sounds confusing.Sorry but i am confused.I like this because it is way f-d up.The plot is pretty original in my opinion.I can't say I've ever seen anything quite like it.This is one twisted Doctor.The writer/director Tom Six is pretty twisted himself.I mean where do you come up with this kind of idea?I know in all the Horrors i have seen, some can be way out there,and twisted but this puts twisted on the map.If you know what i mean.I feel the movie was a bit slow.My biggest and really only problem with it was i found the acting to be real poor(sorry to the actors who had to endure).Without giving anything away i guess it's hard to act in this type of predicament.I will have to wait for the next installment which i will watch,maybe there can be some better acting.If you like twisted and i mean twisted give this a shot.Let's read your review.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Really, don't bother. Really. Fails as a horror movie, check. Fails as avant garde, check. Fails as torture porn, check. Fails as an original work, check (see Robert M. Price's disturbing Lovecraftian story Saucers From Yaddith, written in 1984, well told and much, much more creepy.) Fails as a moral story, check. Fails as a film adaptation of Two Girls and a Cup, check (hats off to the original reviewer who made that comparison.) Fails as a meme, check. Fails as a cult ""good"" bad movie, check. Fails as a script, check. Fails for being medically ""accurate,"" check. Fails even as a failure, check. Fails even to get Howard Stern to watch it. The director/writer, who I refuse to name, needs at least 20 years of counseling, with a morning cup of doody. Weak, runny doody. Finally, don't waste your time. It's not even good for being bad. It's just plain awful. It is film feces. You'll have more entertainment value watching baby spiders eat their mother. This film makes David Lynch's work logical.

285,james-george-wall,Bizarre!,6,4 October 2010,"The Human Centipede.This usually isn't my first, nor my last type of film choice. When a film as a ridiculous title and the case looks pap I won't go near it, I know you're not suppose to a judge a film by the cover and all that jazz, but if you do sometimes you save yourself from being 2 hours nearer to death.However, The Human Centipede gain massive buzz around the net for it's bizarre plot, which intrigued me to watch.First the DVD case. It as a quote from the Sun newspaper, the first bad sign, if the best quote you have is from the Sun you need to rethink your marketing plan. Also The front cover as the front of the Human Centipede pushed up against a frosted window screaming, but I'm pretty sure that shot is never in the film. Usually the front cover as some connection to something that happens in the film...? Maybe it was in the film, but can't have been that memorable to place it on the cover. We have a sub title; First Sequence, which made me believe that there is going to be a sequel, and I was correct, called Full Sequence. Now to me Full Sequence sounds a bit like the end, it's not Second Sequence or New Sequence, but Full Sequence. The only reason I can think of making a sequel to a film like The Human Centipede is to make a franchise, like Saw, Freddy, Jason etc. But Full Sequence? Where do you go from there? More Full Sequence, Double Full... Just doesn't work. Unless they go for the Friday 13th route, The Human Centipede goes to Hell, The Human Centipede goes to Hollywood, The Human Centipede Vs Freddy. Hopefully not. Anyway after you've watched the film you'll probably be thinking how can there be a sequel?Enough of babble on with the film. I honestly thought this was going to be schlock horror, blood and guts, but surprisingly it wasn't that graphic (compared to what I was expecting). The first 10-20 minutes were poor, typical cheap horror, flimsy predictable plot. Basically two American girls are visiting Germany, on their way to a night on the town their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, they find a house to get help. The house is surrounded by woods with nobody else around. The setup as been made.The house is owned by Dr. Heiter, who looks like Charlie Brooker's long lost evil twin. Evil Charlie is a surgeon, who specialises in the separation of Siamese-twins. We first see Evil Charlie at the beginning of the film sat in his car looking at a picture of his beloved dogs, which he has stitched together ass-to-mouth to create a doggipede. Yes it really is a bizarre film.If you think I've given too much away, then you're wrong, because you can read all this on the back of the DVD case, (bar the doggipede, but that happens within the first few minutes). Nothing is ruined.There is a great scene where Evil Charlie as his prisoners strapped up in beds, where he gives them a presentation of what he's going to do. His illustrations are hilarious, but you have to admit doing a presentation is polite, giving them a heads-up.The Human Centipede reminded me of the first Saw film, in the way that it used suspense rather than loads of gross-out scenes, which both films still have, but in moderation. It is probably more of a thriller than a horror. I'm guessing like Saw there will be a ton of crappy sequels that get more and more ridiculous. It wasn't a great film, wasn't even a good film, but it is definitely a film...It's average, a fresh, but odd plot in an over-saturated genre. Horror could have a new cult film in The Human Centipede.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
286,WerewolfWinters,What a bore...,1,14 November 2010,"The movie was a bore and had a 20 minutes with Jerks beginning, with two ditsy American girls who don't think of anything lost in the German woods with a flat tire. Once their cell phones receive no reception they immediately abandon all hope of getting out without wandering the woods around them.Medically accurate? I doubt that. For one, the good doctor stops in the middle of stitching the trio up mouth to anus and scratches his forehead. I'm no medical student but I've talked with those going into the medical profession (nurses in this case) and if they so much as let their belly touch the sink while they're washing their hands they have to re-sterilize their hands.Next there's the whole ""they're compatible"" tested thing, even though he just ran and grabbed some random Japanese man from somewhere (presumably wandering around the woods or something) and he doesn't seem to have the tools or machinery to do much of what's needed.Next he only connects their gastric organs. To make the whole creature live (logically speaking, any medical student could probably delve into it further) you'd have to connect the whole blood circuit and even possibly digestive systems as a person can not sustain themselves on feces as this movie suggests.Oh, and this guy lives out in the middle of nowhere but apparently his neighbors or something heard screaming.After the initial awkward sense of seeing the trio sewed together there's nothing more to the 'horror' movie. The man tries to train them to be a pet and that's essentially the plot afterward. The cover of the movie itself is infinitely more interesting then actually seeing them on the screen.Essentially if you can get past the fact that nothing in this movie is logical than you might enjoy it. I, however, watch horror movies to get a feel that it's something that COULD happen and thus why it would be scary. Since this movie can't relay that realism I'm forced to dump this movie experience into the back of my head and never to watch it again.I will leave you on this note, however; Mr. Ex-surgeon likes to use date-rape drugs.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
287,hulu37,It's worth viewing once,6,6 December 2010,"The Human Centipede: First Sequence is a film with a ridiculous B movie style premise that takes itself so seriously (no winks and nods to the camera) it's almost engaging. Almost.Dutch filmmaker Tom Six tells the age old tale of two American tourists in Europe who get lost and end up on the wrong doorstep on a rainy night. Enter Dr. Heiter. Heiter is a mad German scientist (seriously) who dreams of creating the human centipede by linking three humans into one centipede-like creature. You can use your imagination (or Google) to guess how this looks once he successfully reaches his goal. And he does reach his goal. The three victims (the two Americans and a third captive) try to escape, their screams bring the attention of the police, blah blah blah, murder, gunshots, and tragedy ensue.Does it have a larger message or a theme to be explored? Is it commentary on gruesome Nazi experiments? Hard to say, but no. Not even slightly. This truly seems like an idea that two guys kicked around while they were high and then actually followed through on it.Be warned that there are some truly gross scenes here. That said, it's not a very graphic movie (very little gore or nudity involved) and yet still very disturbing which, incidentally, is a pretty neat thing to pull off. So why should you see it? See it because it's ridiculous. See it because the acting is so very, very bad. See it because it's a gross out movie. See it because it's stupid and marvel at the fact that someone actually financed a movie like this to be madeand because there's a sequel due out next year. It really is fascinating to think about the development process with a movie like this. What did it look like to pitch this idea to investors? What was the casting process like? Hmmm...Have a drink and watch it with friends; it'll be funnier.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
288,matt_back5,Tom Six is one sick man,2,2 January 2011,"I had heard much talk about The Human Centipede and decided to watch it one day. Unfortunately everybody had failed to mention what a sick, disturbing, and overall awful movie it was. If I could I would give you the pros and cons of the movie, but there is almost nothing good worth mentioning about the movie. Here are some of the negatives.1. Terrible acting-The two main girls were almost painful to watch.2. No depth-The characters are one-dimensional and we know almost nothing about them. There is little depth in the story-line also, I still don't know what was wrong with that doctor.3. Why are there no phones? When whats-her-name escapes she runs through the entire house but never stops to pick up a cordless phone. This is the 21st century right? 4. Just plain disturbing-After watching this movie I was about to puke. Just sitting here typing about it makes me feel nauseous.Overall this is one of the worst movies I have seen. Anyone who can sit through this movie and enjoy it must have a sick mind, let alone the guy who actually came up with the idea. If it wasn't for a couple funny parts in the beginning (mostly do to the terribly poor acting) then this movie would have been an easy 1 star.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
289,mortal1,For a low budget movie it's got legs,7,4 April 2011,"Well, where to start? Sat down and watched this after being told you have to see this to believe it. What did they mean? It'll make you sick, it'll make you turn your eyes away. I was very intrigued. I have been watching horror movies since my teens at the cinema and even earlier if I include the Hammer Horrors on late night TV.So I like to think I know a decent Horror when I see one. I am so used to the hype around these movies. I used to fall for the tag lines 'scariest movie ever' etc etc etc. More often than not deflated and let down at the failure of all the claims made in advertisements. Which means in recent years I have become picky about what horrors to watch. Did The Human Centipede live up to the hype. As far as I am concerned on many levels it did. I thought I was going to hate it. Once you get over the extremely twisted premise of an evil doctor attaching humans together in a very disgusting way. This is a really good little low budget Horror. There I said it. I liked this. There is nearly no gore, most of the horror is built in the imagination, in the tense build up and a genuine sympathy for the victims of the mad doctor. Oh.... and what a mad doctor he is, scary, sadistic, and as mad as the maddest hatter! This movie achieves a certain sense of foreboding and dark oppressiveness that big budget horrors never manage. OK, I agree the premise is totally bizarre but it is a horror movie and it makes a great change from the usual slasher movies and supernatural flicks. In a few years this will be regarded as a great example of tense thrilling and yes horrific filmmaking.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

We may have all questioned something odd like that, but they took it to a whole new level.I'm not really sure how to rate this movie. When I first heard of it, my thoughts were along the lines of, ""Eeew, gross, why would anyone make a movie about that?"" Then, I'll admit, my morbid curiosity got the best of me. So, tonight, I braved up, and sat down to watch it.On one side, the movie is gruesome, shocking, disgusting, and creepy. On the other hand, the movie is gruesome, shocking, disgusting, and creepy. These characteristics, you see, are both good and bad. By the end of the movie, I felt horrified, partially because I saw the movie, and partially because part of me liked it. While the subject matter is something I would never have thought of, the movie was done fairly well, as in, standard modern horror film good, which to be honest isn't that good except to a small niche of people, but regardless...The movie would not have worked, however, without the ultimate creepiness--the doctor himself. His demeanor, prowess, and mysteriousness somehow makes it all complete.So, would I recommend this movie? Maybe. If you are a fan of shocking, visually graphic horror movies like the Saw series or some of the foreign horror movies along the same lines, this is probably a good bet for you.

Okay and the cops wow what kind if cop sees his partner floating in a pool and just whimpers the Dr had like 5 minutes to aim and shoot and then after 3 or 4 shots the cop without aiming hits him in the head wow.

This does not even qualify as BAD writing. This film isn't even a horror film. A horror film provides drama though good writing, complex characters, excellent camera/set work (all absent in The Human Centipede). The one singular drama in this film, attaching a mouth to the anus of another, is simply the writers/directors childish attempt to vent his own hidden sadistic desires.For an actor to associate themselves with such a project is an insult to their studies in the arts and theater.I screened this film, going in knowing about what the story was.

Ever been at a restaurant with the guy at the table who takes the conversation way too far? The one who has to say what's on his mind no matter how sick it is. Humor's one thing but this is just plain freak.Now if Steven Spielberg had never made a movie it would've been a crime. Conversely that Tom Six made this film is almost a crime. I read a review that said this started out as a joke and I could believe that. But if that's the case it should've stayed that way. It's like a few people got together, downed a stack of booze and drugs then decided to make a movie about the worst thing they could think of. Then did.Beneath it all it's like the Dutch writer of this, Tom Six, holds an underlying disdain for Germans. The Mengele type doctor (well acted by the way, he was freaky), the perverted fat guy in the car. The cops weren't bad but their actions portrayed them more like they were on the first day of the job as opposed to seasoned professionals. What policeman worth their salt would let a weirdo shout at them and take it? But then Six extended it to the Japanese guy and the American chicks. I'm not American, German or Japanese but it's like he was taking pot shots at everyone. And he definitely didn't keep his powder dry.To add insult to injury the plot is so full of holes. No matter how ditzy you might be, there's some things you'd never do, especially when traveling. And the girls made every mistake in the book. The actions of the captives was really weird too. Opportunities missed to raise the alarm or nullify the doctor that made me cringe.I quite like off beat movies, Toxic Avenger is a fave and I love horror but this was so bad you'd have more chance of a cat playing a Beethoven piano concerto on a TV station that aired it instead of the Super Bowl than enjoying this. It's just wrong on so many levels but I give 1 star to the maniacal doctor. In several parts Dieter Laser looked as maniacal as you can get. Sure glad he's not my doctor. I think I'd just kill myself rather than rock up to an appointment with him.Yes, this film is the poster boy for the worst dressed at a bad dress up party or the saying ""Well, that's 90 minutes I'll never get back"". Don't waste your time with it. If you've been dared to watch it and will, then I feel for you. This film makes Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes look like an Academy Award winning movie in every category. Truly the worst film I think I've ever seen.

I've been looking for a good horror film for a long time, and this might be one of them. Although i hate the use of nudity in horror films (mainly because directors use it to draw in more audience,) i thought the use of it in here was good. They used in appropriately like Henenlotter films.. They didn't have a random orgy scene, they didn't have a girl nude due to an unrealistic accident...They had them nude because they were attached to each other. I like the use of not-so-obvious comic relief that contributes to the scientist's madness. The scientist is training his creation as a pet. He treats them like pets, beats them like pets etc.I like the creativity. A horror movie now is usually a remake of a classic horror movie with more nudity (Ahem..Rob Zombie..) You all bash this movie because it's raunchy behavior, but how many of you have thought about such a plot? The director made sure to stick to the PLOT as opposed to keeping everything visual..The director did something that isn't that important..which is he made sure it was medically accurate to avoid PLOT holes.Yet half of the viewers could care less about the plot, they are concentrated on how ""nasty"" it is. I didn't like the ending.SPOILER! The Asian guy took a piece of glass to his throat.

The fact of the matter is that this movie is not that gory. There are certainly many more graphic and extreme movies out there (AntiChrist being an example).The power of the movie is the shocking subject matter and the continued, tortuous ordeal that the 3 protagonists go through but I think that's the idea of this kind of movie. The viewer gets dragged through the ordeal and then can breath a sigh of relief when its all over and appreciate it for what is is - a bit of shocking fun with a tongue-in-cheek (no pun intended) sense of humour.A lot of criticism has been made about the poor level of acting in this film and although its not great I've certainly seen a lot worse (particularly in horror movies).For those who can detach themselves and enjoy an inventive (yet disturbing) horror movie I recommend this.

Inside the house is a man who lets them in. The girls ask the guy to ring for the break down service and he gets them a drink of water (which has been spiked with rohipnol). The guy pretends to ring the break down service (even though the girls did not give him a telephone number). They drink the water and it gets worse from there. He ties them up in beds in the cellar. He kills a guy and buries him in the garden. He then gets a Chinese guy and drugs him. Later on he then shows a slide show of how he going to stitch them all together (between anus and mouth) to form a human centipede. The man then does this and he believes he has made a great new species. I cannot tell you how many times this film has made me want to be sick. I beg of you if you like sick films this is the one for you and you are not a normal person - you too are sick. If you are squeamish in any way do not watch. The director and film board should not have let this film out for general release. I will do what I can to get this film banned from all countries, starting in the UK.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
310,masteremster,Crap....absolute crap!! (no pun intended),1,9 April 2011,"Happened across this film by mistake, and cannot believe i wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this. The one point goes towards the actor who plays the surgeon, who fits the role of a crazed German guy quite well. The idea of the film is awful, no doubt made up to fill some kind of fantasy for the director. I actually feel sorry for the people who are associated with this, i would be embarrassed. This film will no doubt be a black mark in their acting careers. Medically, none of this could actually happen and its not worth looking past this. Stay clear, do yourself a favour and go and watch a decent horror or comedy, i don't quite know which it was trying to be, but failed at both. And i see there is to be another one coming out soon... its a sad day when something as bad as this is allowed to be made never mind have a sequel :(",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

312,rafsjackson,The situation of the characters is the same as how I felt watching this film,1,20 February 2011,"First off I would like to say that I generally have an open mind, and actually enjoy films that are stupid especially horrors, because there fun to watch. This film however was not fun to watch, and not even because of the 'gore', it wasn't fun to watch because it was just plain awful.Story - We start off with two girls driving to a nightclub (because public transport would never be the better option)where they take a wrong turn and get a flat tyre and no signal, after sitting around for about 5 minuets and being harassed by a fat German they decide to find help, this is the second moment that we see how stupid these women are. Instead of following the road in the hopes of maybe finding a car or a house, they venture in the woods, and apparently get lost for about an hour. They then come across a house in the middle of nowhere, knock on the door and then what follows in the next moment of stupidity for these women. The stranger who opens the door greets them by saying are you alone, while shifting his eyes everywhere, what a lovely man. he then drugs them and ties them to a bed. he then decides to tell them his plans of turning these people into a human centipede (at least the film got the name right)and thats pretty much it in terms of story, nothing else really happens, and I mean nothing a couple of police men turn up, nothing happens and nothing is resolved in anyway The one thing I hate about this film is that it had so much potential, but it seemed they got lazy, not only that but it just doesn't make any sense. They give the worst explanation of why the Dr is doing this 'I hate humans' and thats his motivation? REALLY????? He hates humans? if he hated humans why would he spend 40 years of his life being a doctor separating twins? Why would he want to undo that with his work, we don't get an explanation, and why would he want to create a human centipede? there is no reason I can think off why he would want to? it has nothing to do with his life or his work. A better premise would have been if the Dr was a religious nut who decided that his work on separating conjoined twins goes against G-D and decides to undo his work. But no we get nothing of why he would want to connect someones mouth to there arse. So because of this I felt like my time was wasted The other thing that I hated was that I just didn't care about the nameless characters. The two women were as thick as pigs blood, and all they did was moan,cue in no chance for a personality to develop, and then we were given a Chinese or Japanese man, for no reason who didn't speak German, or English, just his native language, very hard to connect with that. So the whole premise of these people being put in this situation was lost on me when I stopped caring for them the acting was terrible from everyone except the Dr who was actually very good and he is the only reason I gave the film a star....the other reason for the star is that the film was so terrible I was happy that they had the brains to get the title right.overall this film is a complete waste of time, you cant help but ask why during the film, and even then you don't really care. The whole controversy that surrounded this film, such as it being disgraceful and people vomiting in the cinema is complete poo (see what I did there). DO NOT see this film, it will only make you angry",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

315,jonny_3300,a shock film but not very scary,4,7 August 2010,"What made me hear about this film is that my fellow class mates were talking about the film around April time and in my luck i was visiting relatives in USA and they had the human centipede on video on demand so were able to show it me. i was lucky to watch it because it does not come out in cinemas in the UK until 20th August 2010.The thing that made it a good film was director tom six gave a film that would shock his audience. but it almost makes you feel bad for the actors if it was real. tom six also mentioned that he visited a doctor who actually said that the movie is 100% medically accurate and that the human centipede can be done this is mainly what made a lot of people want to watch it, if that wasn't told then the movie would not have had as much of an impact. Tom six also mentioned the first movie is going to be ""my little pony"" compared to the sequel which makes people who have watched the movie feel like they want to see the sequel more. they are the only good points.unfortunately there a quite a few bad points about the movie, considering its a horror its not that scary, its not the kind of film that will make you jump and seems to only make you feel shocked. the film does not contain much gore accept for a bit of sick coming out of the victims mouth and a bit of blood on the doctors lab coat. you do not see the actual operation of the human centipede being made. not many people who i know who have watched it enjoyed the film and most of them are Saw fans. i think personally the thing that made the movie bad was the ending, the cops investigate the house due to people being missing in that area, they split up and one of the cops literally just looks at the human centipede and hears guns shots so goes to the scene and it ends with the doctor and the cop shooting each other at the same time and dieing at the same time, the front man in the centipede before this killed himself and supposedly the back women in the centipede dies from blood poisoning, leaving the middle girl left for dead crying. it is then left at a cliff hanger as you don't know whether the girl dies because the front guy has died so isn't given her food or whether she does get rescued and removed from the centipede.When the sequel comes out ""The Human Centipede ( Full Sequence)"" i will ask anyone who has watched it to compare it to the original and whether tom sixes quote that ""the first film is going to be my little pony compared to the sequel"" then i may consider watching the sequel.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

That I managed to hear virtually nothing about before I watched it is amazing. I'm sure there is a fan-base for this kind of thing but I'm not it.Evidently the writers of this crap got the idea from a statement one of them made about sewing the lips of a pedophile to someones ass. You know, if they had actually used a pedophile-like character in the string I might have been more receptive. As it was, the victims were just people gathered in by the mad-doctor. It was senseless torture with absolutely no point. I had no character to sympathize with. Nobody was developed enough to give me a feeling of anything but grossness. Whether or not the procedure was even medically possible doesn't even matter to me. Once I saw where it was going I realized that the chain was going to die from the back to the front and that was all. What a stupid idea!

318,fruktflugan,"Who's eating more poo, the audience or the actors?",1,27 May 2010,"So, they're trying to squeeze a few cents more out of the hype around the ""Saw""-type movies? Sadly the ones making this movie has no idea on how to keep the audience's interest up, no idea on how to create believable characters or make a decent movie that holds up for more than 15 minutes.It begins rather believable with the two young girls going to a party (if you see them as mentally defective and do not scrutinize their personalities too much) and getting car trouble. That's about what works in this movie...Then there's a series of highly improbable events with completely unbelievable actors and it devolves into a simple type, really bad, SCAT-movie (search the porn shelf for those and you'll see the similarities).* Ooohh, No cell phone reception in Germany!!! Do Americans know that Germany is an industrialized country and their cell phone system is much more advanced and has more coverage than anything in the states?* OOOoooohhh, We cannot fix a flat tire because we have too many cromosomes going rampant. We don't even bother to check if there's something in the trunk of this rental car that can be used in some way!* OOoooohhh, We won't even try to drive the car with the tire flat because then the entire universe will explode. Sure, it'd thrash the rim and everything, but it should hold up for at least a couple of miles when going slow.* Ooooohhhhh, We need to walk for help. Let's NOT follow the road or anything, let's go into the dark scary woods in our high heels and no sense of direction. And let's not check if the cell phone gets some reception back either!The movie keeps going in this fashion and if you do not shut off before the real action begins you are greeted with a couple of unbelievable characters going around on all fours with their mouths connected to each others rectums, eating feces.Thank GOD that I didn't pay to watch this movie. Maybe I should sue the movie company for wasting my time like this.Believe me, it doesn't get any better as the movie continues either.100% medically accurate too... Well, then it must be good... People vomiting in theatres... Well, that's just because the movie is such UTTER CRAP that you cannot help yourself! :DIf you see it, make sure you have the option of fast forwarding through 90% of the movie and just getting to the perverted fecal-eating scenes that the movie's creators probably got a good, decent sized erection by creating!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

As a horror and thriller buff, I check this film out. Low budget with little gore, this movie struck a nerve with me. Given that I was impressed someone would even make a movie like this I enjoyed the simplicity of the movie. With many low budget movies, you expect to have some suspect acting and visuals, but I didn't find either to be a problem. Instead, I found the movie to be entertaining even given the gruesome story plot. Most people have said that they couldn't even get through the movie because of it's disturbing themes of the surgical aspect. My opinion, the movie shows it's best aspects after the first 30 minutes. No spoilers but the last hour is truly where this movie goes bizarre, but in a good way as I don't believe too many people saw that coming. This movie isn't a gore fest, nor is a killer gone wild movie. It's a horror movie that is difficult to place.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

After seeing how that episode went I figured the original film must be better - Boy was I wrong.(If you haven't seen the episode or have no idea what this movie is about DO NOT READ FURTHER)First off, the entire point of the movie is to shock you by the very idea of the human centipede. However, the idea itself is the shock, not the crappy way it was done in this movie. So once you know it, there's nothing to it.The acting is terrible, you hardly see anything, the dialogue is stupid even though a foreign language sounds more believable it still doesn't and the plot is virtually non existent.The characters themselves are so unbelievably it's borderline a comedy and not in the good way.Seriously, this is just one of those movies of ""you had an idea but had no idea what to do with it""",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
322,sango_miroku,A film more about tension/suspense rather than jumpy moments,8,19 January 2013,"I chose to watch this film based on its title. All I had heard were negative things and I was honestly preparing myself for a man that would explode into a poor quality cgi centipede that ate people or something. (I had not watched a trailer beforehand or really read any synopsis or critic reviews.) I was really expecting a terrible film which I could laugh at. After watching the film I was VERY surprised and immediately came online to check what others thought to now feel somewhat embarrassed to say I felt like this film had me pretty gripped, on the edge of my seat, feeling a lot of tension, some slightly sadder feelings and generally pretty satisfied...I want to give this film an 8 out of 10, based on its production quality, the acting and the atmosphere and tension created throughout the film.I don't normally enjoy horror/scifi films as much as I used to simply because I have grown tired of the cheap thrills, the obsession with unrealistic cgi with high budgets and using the same old tricks to scare you.The types of horror/scifi type films I had really enjoyed were REC, The Orphanage, Alien, The Thing, The Evil Dead etc... now I'm not saying The Human Centipede is similar but I did feel like it created similar tension to that which I enjoyed in the other films.I also felt that the main character was played incredibly well and made the film feel more believable (Ignoring the concept of stitching people together into a centipede) but more so the way he would talk, act and stare, he was such a disturbing character I found myself feeling more terrified in ways. A disturbing person felt a bit more realistic than an alien popping out of my chest one day... not comparing the films in any way, just stating why I was allowed to feel scared by a human.The film perhaps was somewhat formulaic, regarding traditional narratives I guess of how scifi/horror films were made in the 90s/00s regarding deaths and perhaps the ending. Not to make it any less enjoyable.My only real criticism of the film was probably the core concept of stitching people into a centipede... I feel as though I didn't really learn quite enough about the doctor to understand what the incentive fully was. We know he's a retired surgeon who had dogs that he stitched into a centipede but that's about it... So I do find that concept a little odd... I would have liked to know if there was more of a reason for the doctor being the way he was with his ideas. There are obviously little bits and bobs here or there where I think 'but in real life, police wouldn't do that' etc but I always try to let that go in a film.I also think the title of the film immediately gives it a bad stigma... As I said I was expecting to watch something more like Giant Cobra vs Komodo Dragon or Sharktopus or something... I think had the film kept the same actors and atmosphere but perhaps changed what the doctor was doing to people this film would have received a much better response. (As I can understand to a point why people would be in a bit of an uproar about what you see) but then again, would the surgeon be as disturbing as a character if he hadn't done something as outrageous? Who knows... If you want to watch this film, go into it open minded... I don't think it is AS bad as people are saying but maybe that's because I was expecting something horrendous? The operation looked very realistic as well and I really felt the actual production of the film was to a high standard. But if you want a horror/scifi film which creates suspense and tension and leaves you not having to worry about something jumping out at you every five seconds you might enjoy this.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

If you like exploitations and horror movies with more naturalistic style, then this one is for you. Human Centipede is a really original movie with a dark sense of humor. It's something you won't forget soon and gets better every time you watch it but also needs a strong stomach of course. I don't wanna spoil the story because the shock factor is higher with the less info about it. The casting is perfect (especially the great Dieter Laser) and Tom Six really knows how to make a good thrill and how to shock his audience to death.

You don't get the sense that the film is posing any real questions to ponder, or that it's doing anything other than trying to shock the audience.I personally didn't find it shocking. Once you get over the gross subject matter, the overwhelming sensation is 'how depressing'. It's got far less shock factor, for example, than something like 'A Serbian Film'. These films are cut from the same cloth though.

The movie starts of somewhat cliché but to be honest, I didn't think it was that unbelievable. I'm not sure I would've done things differently if I were in their position. Actually, I think the story as a whole was quite credible, and the fact that a human centipede like this is biologically possible, makes it even sicker. It left me slightly nauseous.Dr Heiter was an excellent freaky doctor, and I thought the other actors did quite well, even the German police officers, although I found the ending a bit confusing from their part.All in all, I found the movie to be satisfactory. It wasn't very scary and not even that gory, but it was just that twisted, that I can't say anything different than that I was impressed.I would recommend people to watch it, not only for the horror but also for its realism.

I'd heard enough talk about it that my curiosity simply got the best of me.I was shocked to find myself giggling giddily at the close of the film.There was so much to like about this movie. For instance, the villain is superbly portrayed as the ultimate mad scientist. I was quite impressed with how absolutely disconnected from humanity he is. He never communicates WITH his victims in any single instance, but simply communicates TO them at all times, regardless of anything they do or say (or scream). I don't think I've seen that done in a villain quite to this degree. Mr. Laser does a magnificent job here.I was even impressed with the two female leads. They conveyed their parts very well, in my opinion.The camera work is also terrific. There were honestly a few very impressive shots in this film.Now, the premise, as you all know, is very sickening to think about. Thankfully, there's nothing too graphic other than a few quick shots of ""the surgery."" There's not graphical depiction of ""nature taking it's course,"" shall we say. I think it's a good move - the thought of it all is enough, honestly. Considering the subject matter, I'd say it was presented as tastefully as it could be.One more thing: I loved the end. It was horrible, and I loved it! I would say if the premise of this film doesn't absolutely turn your stomach to the point that you wouldn't want it spelled out for you in more detail, and you love a good horror yarn, you don't want to miss this one.It is one of the best IFC films has ever offered",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
329,dpcoronado,Worth a second look,7,12 May 2012,"Beneath the visuals and suspense, this movie is ultimately psychological. If Tom Six, by way of keeping this movie under two hours, manages to lose some people's attention span or over-saturate the viewers with shock, it's because he didn't make the invitation to his mindset alluring enough. But this movie is an invitation nonetheless, and he would probably prefer we stay much longer.It's too easy to get lost in the knee-jerk reaction of how this movie must eventually play out, but I find myself moving past that and trying to put myself into their shoes (all three pairs.) I first say that there wasn't any hate on the dear doctor's part. Something incredibly wrong, yes, but there was no hate. He punished the centipede, and disciplined them--but taking out the aspect of hate or mindless brutality or torture we would expect from someone twisted, we as the viewers are left with not much to base our discomfort with this movie. Which ultimately adds very subtly, a dangerously disturbing feeling: Where does one channel the mental fallout while watching this movie?The doctor even takes on a jovial mode as he tries to motivate them to walk in unison, definitely not someone who ""hates people"" like he states in the beginning. He approaches the segments with care enough to heal them, and not leave them ""neglected"", a good owner. He even buried the previous attempt, his ""sweet three-dog"" and left a pretty expensive headstone! Like I said, not hateful in the least.What I found myself thinking about is how the director's use of madness has a way of drowning out the things the centipede doesn't need, so there is some clarity given to them. The madness reveals their basic needs. B-segment will give up anything to not be put through that ordeal (not said explicitly, but other things suddenly not as valuable, i.e. money.) C-segment wants her mom. A-segment confesses his sub-par life and wants to be human again. All noble things when done voluntarily. When done under madness of becoming the centipede, I think the realization of what we really need just hits home for them, to the fact that A-segment feels that the only way to left for him to feel human, is to die.It disturbs me that I can't find any hate for this doctor. And it's scary to be invited to Tom Six's head, wondering what this movie may have demanded of him to create. I say we can always decline the invite to delve deeper into that thought process, but it would be wrong to label this movie as his gratuitous way to live out this weird fantasy. That maybe the doctor's agenda, but not the director's. Definitely worth a second look.P.S. If you don't like my review, watch it for the sake of seeing how this unravels.

If this would have been made with the same mindset as the Saw movies, this would have been one of the best of the decade. I feel like the actors were kind of forced into different situations when there was an obviously better choice laid in front of them. Especially when the cops arrive at the very end. When you have a search warrant, usually more than two cops arrive at the scene. Also, when the main cop opens the door and find the centipede, a real cop would have called for backup immediately and not left them there, even if he did hear some sort of distress from his co worker.

334,baz111,Why?,1,10 July 2010,"The entire point of this film was to shock, but the way it shocks is more by giving you the image with no point and no reasoning. Of course the film never sounded like it was ever going to be remembered for its script but this is beyond bad.We're first introduced to the two American girls, who pretty as they may be seem to lack any form of intelligence or general common sense. They are driving to a night club (as you do) when they take a wrong turn and end up getting a puncture. Now this is where things get bad. So the girls are stranded failing to know how to operate a jack and attach a spare wheel the girls decide to look for help. Cue a three minute pointless piece of film making where a randy German man gives his thoughts about the girls in German. Laughable honestly. So the man drives off and the girls decide the best thing to do is to go and look for help.. By walking through the woods and coming across a house in the middle of nowhere with a man that answers the door with the most evil face in the world who's first question is are you alone? Welcoming.See the film goes on with its rather pointless set ups like these which just make you think who would do that? I mean there is one moment in the film that really grabbed my attention, the girls are tied to the patient beds and the doctor goes out to bury the truck driver in the garden. He then goes out and gets the Japanese man from somewhere. The doctor then tells them all his dastardly plan then goes off. Later he comes back to start the procedure by injecting them to put them to sleep. Now only at this moment does the one girl decide she can undo the one wrist with her teeth and get out. I understand you have to make the film but bloody hell thats just ridiculous, I mean he'd buried a man and found a new man before the girls even tried to escape? They could have boarded a flight back to the US or even tried to find that night club if they'd have just stopped crying for however long they had been.So we come to the birth of the centipede and things go from bad to worse I'm afraid. See the purpose of this film is just to make you feel sick. There are no scares, no moments of suspense and really there is just no point. Worst film ever!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
335,earlyistimeless,"Good concept, moderate execution",4,10 August 2019,"Its concept is truely original, it's quite a suprise no sadistic mind has come up with it before. That's why its such a pity its execution is rather moderate. Mainly because of the characters too excessive acting, making it feel staged; the stage and the circumstances feeling too clean for a horror; too much detail, especially around the operation itself and the tormenting of the centipede, appears to have been left out; the abduction of the truckdriver and the attemt to escape that could've easily have been left out, and instead showing the abduction of the asian guy and a better ending; the surgeon being too nice to his experiment as a sadist and the start of a ""horror"" featuring two pretty girls getting lost, is unoriginal to say the least.As mentioned before, the end could've been a lot better. It screamed for a section where the last living section of the centipede, would cut the tissue of the other sections with the piece of glass, for her to be able to get help with the bits of the others still attached to her face.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

During these trying times we are all stuck at home and like many of you, I am sure it is becoming more difficult to find movies that can speak to an entire family. My sweet grandmother recommended this masterpiece to us and rather than read the book I grabbed my 6 year old son, Ndugu and my loving wife for a night of family bonding. Normally Rom-Com's are not my thing but I said ""what the heck"" and boy am I glad I did. From the opening scene it was as if we were seen to the couch. As we laughed, cried, laughed again, hugged, and eventually vomited we all agreed this touching tail could not have been done any better. I knew that previous doctor had something up his sleeve but Ndugu saw it first. When he realized the good doctor wasn't sewing their mouths to each other's anus's for fun we all laughed out loud!!! Don't miss this one. You will regret it. Ohhhh, if you have a chance to read the book get the one with pictures. Until next time!!!!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

It is not very common in today's world to find such a heartwarming tail that can be enjoyed by the entire family. My six-year-old son Ndugu watches this every day after school. From the opening scene it was as if my family and I were sewn to the sofa. We laughed, cried, laughed again, Eventually vomiting. That silly doctor. We all knew he had something up his sleeve. When he sewed her face to his butt hole Ndugu could not stop laughing. A true masterpiece. BTW, if you are going to read the book I recommend getting the one with pictures.

In the forums of IGN and Listverse, many had commented on The Human Centipede being one of the most disturbing movies ever, so of course I had to see it, expecting to get disturbed.Unfortunately, this movie does NOT live up to its expectations. I'm giving it a 3 for actually having an interesting concept. I mean - a scientist wanting to create siamese triplets, that's a disturbing thought. But the movie contains so many common (and annoying) movie clichés, the kind that make you shout at the screen and losing interest in the movie itself, and that's very bad storytelling. The acting wasn't very convincing either.I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a disturbing movie experience. If you're desensitized to gore and easily annoyed by bad scripting, it's just not for you.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

You will have to see for yourself.",6,13 April 2011,"Motto: ""Behind every great man, there are two great women."" 'The Human Centipede' gives the viewer a voyeuristic glimpse of the life of hobbyist Dr. Joseph Heiter whose ambitions are both exotic and daring. In the opening scene we find Joe sobbing about his failed past projects. We watch and feel Joe's strength as he makes the decision to put the past behind him and to face the future with renewed optimism. But, as Joe soon finds out, a hobbyist's life is not easy. The next day, Joe learns that a true hobbyist has to make great sacrifices, if he is to complete his project in the best possible way. The enfolding scenes serve as a reminder to all of us that a passionate man does not settle for less than perfection. Joe rests at nothing, does not sleep, and does not eat until his project is finished.After what is truly a great start of his project, we follow Joe as he is dealt a setback and faces it heads-on. Fearing for the worst, in an exciting turn of events, Joe's inventiveness ultimately gets him back on track. From there on, he is heading straight for success. When the last part of his project is finally completed, we experience Joe's intense fulfillment through a rare display of affection (while he is a passionate and intense human being, Joe is not a people's person). In an emotional scene, we find Joe celebrating his success and taking pictures of his accomplishment. In a particularly gripping moment, Joe holds up a mirror to his project, as if for it to see its own beauty. The scene concludes with Joe lifting up the mirror like a trophy—an obvious tribute to the many successes of the German football team.But his success is short-lived. It all starts with a phone ringing. Before Joe realizes what is going on, agents of an intrusive government are at his doorstep, threatening to jeopardize all that Joe has accomplished. Will the forces of bureaucracy prevail, or will Joe conjure up a clever plan to save his project, his spiritual livelihood? You will have to see for yourself.The international cast delivers an enticing performance. No one plays a German like Dieter Laser (Joseph Heiter). Watching Ashlynn Yennie's convincing characterization of an American tourist (Jenny), it is hard to believe this is her debut role in a motion picture. It is a privilege to see Ashley Williams perform as the character Lindsay. Even a novice viewer should be able to recognize her extensive background in theater and musical theater and her world-class training at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Last but not least, although he did not speak any lines in a language that I could understand, I think Akihiro Kitamura played the part of some Japanese guy wonderfully.All in all the film makes for a promising start of what should proves to be an exciting franchise not unlike such hits as Look Who's Talking Now and Harry Potter.Viewer discretion: some scenes graphically depict the consumption of alcohol. Furthermore, the word 'ficken', a German verb, is uttered early on in the film. Finally, throughout the film brief flashes of nudity (nipple slips) can be seen.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

What surprised me the most was how tame it actually was (you really don't see much on screen) and yet it was extremely well made. Dr Heiter is phenomenal in clinical approach to madness, the director does such a good job describing the procedure you don't actually have to see anything to be disturbed, and it was simply beautifully shot (in a disturbingly sterile house/environment) and very creepy. Don't believe the weak ratings on this site, these are simply from people who were bothered by this film.

Picks up here and there through out the movie enough in the right places to keep you interested in watching. Not a ""lose sleep"" over movie but definitely warped enough to be entertaining. If you are tired of slasher/gore flicks and like a disturbing mind bender this is definitely worth the hour and a half of your time. Beginning is a bit typical horror film-ish, females are typical airhead type characters. One is slightly more believable than the other. The whole concept of what is going on beginning to end is unsettling. Starts fairly slow, picks up a little then stays a bit steady for a while. Once the surgery takes place it becomes a little slower then in the end picks up enough to not be a disappointment.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

But the problems here are two major: -The actors are really really bad, I mean really bad like in a school play , they convey no authentic emotions at all. The whole point of a horror movie is to empathize with the victim, how is it otherwise even scary? -The special effects are horrible, in the end, when the doctor fires his gun, I mean c'mon, to bad to describe.

345,lcisneros1026,Surprisingly GOOD performances.,7,13 June 2010,"So I had to see this because I'm into disgusting, dark films. I was both disappointed and impressed with The Human Centipede. One: Film is not as disgusting as you might think. Two: The acting is almost outstanding at times. These actors really embraced their roles. When one of the victims screams ""I want my mom!,"" it was soooo genuine the hair on my arms stood up. And the Asian man has some lines that are downright funny. And let's not get me started on the MAD scientist, sooo awesome. I noticed the girls are newcomers. I hope they don't get pigeon holed in torture porn because they're better than that. My final thought on the film is that Tom Six is playing a joke on all of us. This isn't a horror film but more of a parody of a horror film. While some scenes are genuinely creepy, the film itself is so formulaic and cliché ridden that it almost sounds like Six is saying ""Let's see how far I can go and what poor suckers are actually going to pay to see this film?"" I'm one of 'em. I say watch it. It's better than you think.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

I heard about this film 3 days ago and was lucky enough to catch in on You Tube literally as it was being pulled off there. A complete ""10"" for originality! All though the girls bugged initially, when it became clear what they were in for they stepped up to the plate and delivered awesome performances. I have to admit I wasn't sure that this was a film for me, but I guess I've been a horror buff for too long - I really appreciated this film.

347,chazska,Hitler meets Two Girls One Cup,1,7 May 2010,"So I found out about this movie from a dutch friend and I just HAVE TO comment on this movie. First of all, I think the idea itself is bold, daring, and quite creative. But reckless. No matter how ""creative"" and boldly disturbing the concept of making a human centipede is in such a way for it to be quite an attention-grabbing horror movie, it is still using the usual ""cliche"" storyline (which is not creative), and moreover, this is just not ""consumable"" as a movie. I'd say to Tom Six to keep that idea of his as an inside joke, no need to make visuals and share it. There's this thin line between ""OMG that's gross! (I'm gonna keep watching)"" and ""What the~ PUT THAT AWAY MAN!"" which makes the latter should NOT be shown for large consumption. Personally tho, I think it'd be more successful when treated as a comedy instead. Still... yuck... nevermind that... Anyway, I don't see why I should criticize on more aspects of the movie, and I don't need to give spoilers and the only thing that crosses my mind to sum it up is Hitler meets Two Girls One Cup. And as for the rating... Sorry, I was even reluctant to give that one star... Just... no...",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

However, i have never seen one quite so original as this! It is so outrageous, the mere concept of such a thing is terrifying! Given, the actresses especially were of a low standard, and the production wasn't incredible. There was no underscore and tension lacked in placed, but the sheer obscurity makes up for every technical fault! The use of foreign language to heighten a sense of disorientation and detachment from comfort was effective. I also loved how the doctor was portrayed, i cannot remember the name of the actor, but he was brilliantly horrible! I was texting a friend through the film, and much of my vocabulary amounted to 'sick' 'revolting' 'screwed up' and so on!

349,chrismullally51,"some originality in a world of remakes, solid 8",8,17 May 2010,"There have been few time in my life when i actually read the preview for a horror and actually felt I had to watch the movie. These days its nearly all the same stupid slashers with no point at all.But then comes an idea that, quite frankly is the most twisted i have seen in a while. I was hoping it would deliver and it almost did. I say that because of the casting, my god those girls were bad. I was so surprised of how bad they were it scared me how they got cast, but the saving grace of this was the doctor who seemed to get off on what he was doing. The end was a huge let down, if you watch it you'll find out why there are no spoilers here. It just seemed that all the effort went into the idea of the centipede, and the rest suffered from neglect. The visual effects were not Oscar winning but they served there purpose very well, you actually start to think that with the right motivation that you could actual do this yourself.So before viewing this film just consider the following:1) If your hoping that this will make you laugh, as most of those unintentional comedy horrors do, then your right it will. But this will be uncomfortable laughter. 2) Do not let the 2 girls put you off, they get shut up fairly quick. The only real thing here that is unique is the human centipede, but that is the great thing about the film. 3) Its a human centipede.Over all good, just depends on what your willing to sacrifice to stick it to the end.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

351,WTFjustHappend,The Human Centipede,2,11 July 2010,"There is a hype around this movie that said that this is medically 100% accurate and after seeing the trailer i thought i'd give it a shot.The movie starts of in one big cliché.Cliché (connect the dots) - Two young girls - Roadtrip - Lost in the woods - House of a mad surgeonI am not a medical students but i think that the odds that two random persons are compatible to each other are quite low (that's one of the problems with organ-transplant). How lucky is he that the two girls match! And since the third guy isn't, he just go grab a random Japanese guy out of his backyard, who apparently hasn't a clue what he's doing in Germany(let alone Europe). He doesn't speak neither English nor German nor any other language except for Japanese.The whole movie goes a long in a really slow pace and the shock value is barely there. I had a feeling half way trough the movie that they had to fill up 40 minutes with useless scene's. Then two detectives show up and start asking questions about the missing girls. The mad surgeon was apparently not smart enough to find their car and move it away. Then he tries to drug the police officers to replace the sick third person. I mean how stupid can you be trying to drug the police officers. Like that wouldn't ring any bells at the police station. This attempt fails and they go back to the police station to get a search warrant. In the mean time the mad surgeon get's stabbed by the Japanese. Then they try to flee but this doesn't work and it ends up in that the Japanese guy kills himself. Then the police come back and they force the entry unfortunately they both get killed by the surgeon who couldn't even stand up but he managed to kill the first detective by stabbing him in the neck and getting his weapon and shooting him as well. How he did that wasn't shown so that was kind of strange. Then the other detective get shot as well but not before he shoots the mad surgeon in the head and they both die. Then the scene goes back to the human centipede the Japanese guy is death and the last girl in the line dies as well and the girl in the middle is left sitting there and then the movie ends.This movie was one of the worst Horror movies i have ever saw.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

So when watching it, I expected the sort of film which would push the boundaries of horror to a new level. The only boundary it did push was my ability to stay awake whilst watching it.It would seem that the writer has come up with the concept of a human centipede, then spent the rest of the film trying to come up with some half-arsed attempt at some sort of storyline to accommodate this. The storyline is so full of holes, it is nearly non-existent, and in true honesty, nothing actually happens at all.The film fails to shock or keep the viewer interested at all, and I think that instead of watching the sequel, I'll dedicate my time to eagerly watching paint dry.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
353,kimmi13,The next step in controversy...,7,3 November 2010,"The Human Centipede has generated a lot of hype and controversy due to it's grotesque subject matter. Many people I know refuse to watch it and some to even talk about it as they believe it to be ""messed up"" and the writers/directors to be ""sick-minded"". But I believe that if normal things that weren't thought provoking were put into film, then the film industry would go nowhere. And no matter how many times I tell my friends it is actually a good film, they still won't listen.This film isn't over the top with it's gore and violence, unlike some films e.g. the Saw franchise, however the subtlety doesn't matter as it still managed to hit a nerve somewhere in my body, with the pulling off teeth with pliers, or the slow slitting of a throat. And for me the most disgusting part of the film, you don't even get to see what happens.. really. The feeding and extraction of the human centipede means the food has to pass through 3 people and their gastric systems, and the first time they feed, the front piece has to extract into the second piece. You only see the reaction of the girl in the middle and nothing else, however in your mind you can see what is happening underneath all the bandages and it made me feel quite sick, it made my mind go mad. To make someone like me, who can watch any amount of gore and not really be too fazed, feel that bad at something I can't even see means the director has talent. To gain such reactions from an audience without doing too much takes real talent.The thing I do not like about this film are the two female protagonists... they simply cannot act. At the beginning when their tyre clearly goes flat from a pothole or whatever... they act like they had no idea what had happened, trying to hard to make this horror film unexpected and scary. Their best scenes in the film are when they have their mouths attached to another's bumhole!!! However, the man who plays Dr. Kramer has done incredibly well and has created another classic evil villain. He is creepy, scary, and just plain mad. He is different to other villains as he doesn't wish to kill people for his own joy, he keeps them alive and creates this ""Monster"" so he can be famous for making Siamese triplets. He actually cares about the health of his subjects etc.Overall, this film is highly entertaining and should definitely be considered by people who have a strong stomach as I believe it is a genuinely good film, despite the two female protagonists, and above all it has a horrific ending, one of those situations you can imagine how horrible it would be to be in that situation.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

It's been over a month and I still have nightmares.I can't remember seeing any other flick that has been so repulsive -- there was no entertainment value and really no point to it. From what I've read, the idea for this movie arose during a conversation about a deserving punishment for child molesters.

355,necromorphx,"Great Acting, Great Gore, A Thriving and Traumatic Experience. (Contains Spoilers)",7,9 July 2011,"When I first heard about ""The Human Centipede: First Sequence"", I was shocked and disgusted. I was sure the film should never have been made, and that it was god-awful. But I was, of course, listening to my friends views on the film, and they weren't exactly intuitive (sp). So, after watching the film, I took the disk out of the DVD Player, and thought to myself; ""Wow. That was good"". I had listened to others reviews, and since most of the reviews you guys will read will be negative (and most of them are idiotic reviews that force the reviewers opinions unto you), I intend to be most kind to this film, taking into consideration about its current popularity among Torture Porn, a Positive Review. The plot is, well, at the top of the main page if you must know, but the story revolves around two American Girls on a Road Trip through Europe. The film takes place in Germany, where the girls are still on their vacation. After the Car breaks down in the Woods, the girls seek help from the Nearest House - that being of Doctor J. Heiter's (Dieter Laser) house. Doctor Heiter is, and its safe to say this, not a very nice person. Retired, but very well known in separating Siamese Twins, the Surgeon takes his sick and twisted dream to a new Level, when he stitches his three victims together Mouth-to-Arse. Generally not a joyful idea, but that's what a Horror Film is. I'll give the first Good Point of the film. It features beautiful acting. The acting from the four major actors (Dieter Laser, Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie and Akihiro Kitamura)is amazingly lifelike. When stitched together, the sobbing and pain of the characters is so clear and well displayed, that you could believe what you were watching were real. Of course, the constant Sobbing from the Characters can be annoying at times, but as the film progresses, we loose the sobbing. Again, a large point on how brilliant the Acting is can be demonstrated in the scene when Lindsay (Ashley C. Williams) has to swallow Akihiro's (The characters name escapes me at this moment in time) waste. The reactions to this scene has made me laugh, as they are mostly exaggerated or just plain silly. But the scene is very strong, violent, and gives a large depth of Horror to the film. Now for the plot. Unlike other ""Torture Porn"" films, like ""Hostel"", ""The Human Centipede: Full Sequence"" has a good, strong plot. Of course, it is not answered why Heiter has such a fascination with making a Human Centipede and torturing his victims, but you can guess that living alone can have gotten to him, or that the pressure from his Medical Career finally caught up with him in the end and caused mental affections. One way or another, there is a strong Mystery to the film as to what caused Heiter to loose sanity, and that's very good, in my book. The plot also has a very ""Frankenstein-esque"" feel to it, with the mad Scientist and Tormented Creation, only more realistic ideas and effects placed into the film. While watching, you will get this certain feel of a classic Horror. But there is more, you see. The great part is that the plot is so Unpredicatble, you are left unsure of ""what happens next"". But, sadly, a lot of people are told the negative side of the film, and search the whole plot up online due to them hearing about it and thinking; ""No, I will never watch that"". Two weeks later after looking the plot up, they watch the film. In conclusion, this is a great Film. It is certain it is unique, even among Torture Porn, if I say my feelings without placing Positive or Negative ideas into the description. However, in the end, I am not anything Soecial. I am not stating this as fact - whether the film is good or bad is up to you. Don't just jump to conclusions because of what your friends say - watch the film for yourself, then judge. And remember; ""Your Flesh is His Fantasy"".",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The girl's acting gets better as you can begin to feel their sense of despair and hopeless.I really enjoyed the conflict the man in front seem to have being the only man involved in the terrible situation and also the head of the human centipede.

For the first time in my life, I saw a creation that very obviously required a disturbing mental, emotional, and spiritual pathology to conceive, write, and direct. It was almost beyond belief.The victims included the unoriginal and stereotypical young-women-in distress who made poor decisions and ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time. The villain was a cookie-cutter surgeon-turned-mad-scientist reminiscent of Dr. Moreau. The ONLY originality and imagination were demonstrated in the almost inconceivable inhuman violation, degradation, experimentation, and torture inflicted on the doomed victims which made the Nazi treatment of Jews in the Holocaust seem loving and compassionate by comparison.I rated this cinematic sewage one star because it is not possible to award a zero. It has not a single quality to recommend it. The only film I have seen that even remotely approaches this level of indecency and disgust was Pasolini's Salo: 120 Days of Sodom. Even that revolting film is closer to On Golden Pond than it is THC.Do not see this film. If you see THC, you will want to forget it.

359,Wilkolak,Very original idea in a very repetitive genre,9,21 May 2012,"First let me say that I think most people who would give this a negative review were probably left extremely uncomfortable by the subject matter. I mean, you have three humans, two linked mouth to anus. That in itself should be enough to make anyone uncomfortable; but I think what really stands out here for me is, finally, we have an original idea for a horror film. Let's face it, the horror genre has been stagnant for years and the only time an original idea comes along is with these indie film festival type movies.As far as the acting goes, I have to say I was left feeling there was no stone left unturned. The doctor was the most impressive, his tall, skinny frame and over-sized head really added to his menacing demeanor; ""I hate human beings"", he grumbles; so why not link three humans together mouth to anus and keep them as a pet? After all, a human centipede can have a lot of fun interacting with its master, for example, it can deliver the newspaper. Just be careful because human centipedes have been known to bite their masters; and what would you expect happen when the front person has to take a dump? There is only one place for it to go. Yes, this movie goes there. Sure, you feel sorry for the victims, how could you not? The two girls (who make up the thorax and abdomen) are less annoying than what you would expect from such character types, and the head being played in such a way I would have never expected. Even the most hardened horror fan will find him, or herself feeling a little bit squeamish during this one. To reiterate, this is originality here folks, stay away from the herd mentality.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
360,phuckhang15,This is one of the worst movie so far,1,28 June 2015,"EPIC FAIL I watched this yesterday and it's one of the most disappointed movie ever made.A slow movie, terribly boring and super badly acting. A body horror movie without any gore, no thrill, nothing is scare although the plot seem like more disturbing: a crazy German Doctor like to stitch people together mouth to anus, but the film is disappointed. Also, I guess there wouldn't even be enough sadism or porn for sadism lovers. Just pure stupidity. You shouldn't watch this movie, it's a waste of money and time.

The main doctor was great -very freaky. The idea of the human centipede was not what I was expecting and I thought it was original. It was well filmed and I could not predict what was going to happen next. I did predict, but I was far from it. I take my hat off to the director or whoever came up with this grotesque idea.

You can catch wind of it by reading the plot summary here on IMDb for it.Some might even call me sick for watching this kind of film but I have two reasons for doing so. 1: I had the time and 2: It sounded like it was going to be pretty vile. So I ask myself...'What's not to love here?'While the beginning is slower paced, it does build. Overall, it's an entertaining low budget horror flick. Once you get past the goofiness of it all, you are stuck with the sick plot-line of the movie.Honestly, they are in pre-production for the third one in this horror trilogy. Shocking I know. One things for sure, you don't make three of these if someone is not watching them. Looks like the film got some 'legs'...get it? Got some 'legs'!!

I'm amazed that it got any attention at all, enough for me, a person completely bored by horror films to actually hear about it enough to take the time to watch it.I have taken one single anatomy class in my life, but I think even if I hadn't, I could STILL have made the concept more believable.I was way too distracted by how illogical the idea is of creating a digestive tract through three human beings, at least in the way he is supposed to have done it.I couldn't even feel disgusted by the idea of eating feces I was so distracted by the biological inconsistencies of the whole idea.Plus, most horror films are eager to display the repulsive gore of how exactly their atrocities are accomplished, but in this, they showed only meager clips here and there.Like, seriously? This is a unique idea! I assumed they'd give me some HINT of how they did it and what it meant in a literal sense... COME ON!The bandages around their hips and heads were OBVIOUSLY only to conceal the actors' genitals. There was no actual purpose to have bandages there. It annoyed me.The acting of the girls was pretty horrible, the dialog was meaningless, and the logistics were unrealistic.If anyone ever mentions to me that they want to see this film, I can sum it up for them in probably 3 sentences.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Never before was I so sick and ill at ease. It kind of reminded me of Haneke's Funny Games, only more powerful and crazy and disturbing. Controversial it is.

So.. I knew there wasn't going to be a follow on from the first sequence to the second sequence of this movie. Fortunately for me, I did not watch the first movie (this one), unfortunately, I am burdened with my curiosity for things with hype. I had wanted to know what everyone was talking about, so I decided to watch the second film and let me tell you, some of the reviews that I have read for this first movie, I have come to realise that the second movie is much MUCH worse. I am the biggest horror genre fanatic you will ever come across, it's all I ever watch, to even consider this as horror is a disgrace to the name. After watching the second movie I can honestly say that I have never ever been more disgusted! The fact that this was even thought of (like, who in their right mind, thinks this is OK?! WHO EVEN SITS DOWN AND THINKS ""Hey, why don't we make a movie about sewing mouths to assholes?!"") I have much more to say about this, but then I'd be ranting.

367,dolphinandwhale-80531,Better than its reputation,8,19 October 2021,"I checked this one out with a friend out of morbid curiosity because it has a reputation as an extremely disturbing movie, but got met with a pretty good horror movie - if you can stomach the concept, it is a great watch.Genre-wise the movie is not ""torture porn"" at all, as it does not feature any torture and barely any gore scenes (what gore there is is no worse than most other horror movies, and a movie like The Thing is much more extreme); at its core it is a suspense movie loosely based around the concept of escaping captivity from a madman. The human centipede itself features prominently from around the second third of the movie on, however the ""connection"" is usually covered by bandages, so it is not very disgusting to look at (as long as you dont think too much about the implications).Central to the movie is a stellar performance by the very charismatic Dieter Laser, who deserves more recognition as one of horror's finest bad guys. The movie is especially fun to watch if you speak german, as it features several scenes with prominent german dialogue.The movie has an element of camp to it as well and features several iconic scenes; and most importantly, it is ""100% medically accurate"".",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
368,missrouge,Got to see to believe!,6,8 November 2015,"OK, it's a B movie but, if you are looking for something creepy, you are in the right place! I found a small review in a Facebook group and decided I could give it a try. And I am quite happy I did!I've been looking for years for a movie that would leave me disgusted for real and I found it at last.SPOILER ALERT! At the beginning, there are two beautiful girls in a hotel and it's quite clear they are on holiday and looking for fun. They decide to go out in a club but they get lost. Renting a car in a foreign country is something pretty dumb if you are a girl and using it at night for going at a club is even worse but the damage is done. They walk a lot and find the beautiful (isolated) house of a surgeon who offers them help. Of course, the surgeon is a psycho and puts the girls on drugs. They wake up in a sort of hospital with a man who is soon killed by the surgeon. After a while, a Japanese boy becomes hostage of the surgeon and finally we find out what's going on: the surgeon wants to create a human centipede by bounding the heads of an hostage with the anus of an other hostage.One of the girls tries to escape but she fails miserably. The operation seems quite successful at first (even though the Japanese boy spends his time shouting) and the surgeon starts to train the human centipede like a dog. Two policemen come to ask about people disappearing in the neighborhood but the doctor send them away. The guys bound together try to escape but the Japanese guy ruins everything committing suicide. The policemen came back but the doctor kills one of them while the other is killed few minutes later, even though he kills the doctor at the same time (quite confusing by words, I know). The two girls are left alone but one of them dies of infection and the other is left alone screaming and crying.Even though I liked this movie, I didn't give it ten stars only because sometimes the dialogs are a little too predictable and the policemen are pretty dumb. But it's worthy a try.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
369,Lash125,100% inaccurate... In any possible sense,1,28 July 2010,"Seeing this movie made me realize just how much the ""horror""-industry is focusing on nasty plots, and how little they care about the rest. If you haven't seen this movie yet: don't bother. Rather than merely writing just how laughable this movie is, I do have some questions about the ""logic"" in this movie.For one, we never quite learn WHY this doctor is creating this centipede. What possible purpose would he have in mind? We all know he's going to make the f**king thing, so then what?! Was he planning on keeping it? The logical thing to do would be to kill them after a few snapshots of the accomplishment, but instead he just sort of... teaches them to retrieve a newspaper...? None of this made any sense to me, so the fact that the writers wanted to add some ""action"" to this nonsense is quite transparent.And as if that wasn't enough, the doc implies that he wishes to dispose a weakened link for the ""benefit"" of two cops, thus making it a quadruplet. How far was he going to take this thing? HE DID IT ALREADY!I'm no surgeon, nor involved in any medical business, but; how is stretching out the intestines going to help nutrition-wise? As far as I'm concerned, there isn't too much nutrition in feces. Not to mention water. A human can only survive for like 2-3 days without water, and after surgery I suppose they would need a lot more.Then there is the cops. With people disappearing in the immediate proximity of doc's house, not to mention screams; I would guess routine cops would have brought that warrant along with them the first time. If they managed to get one after 20 minutes being in the middle of nowhere, I mean.I could probably be writing all night about this garbage of a movie, but I really don't feel like spending more time than I need to keep people from seeing it.

375,LeForce,You've got to be kidding me......,1,14 February 2011,"I didn't find anything to be redeeming about this movie. It's not that the production value was bad, because most of it was quite good (minus the script and some of the acting), which makes it all that more disturbing. I even thought the surgeon was well cast and quite creepy. That's about all the compliments I can give it though. I've sat through a lot of movies where I prayed for the credits to roll but none like this. My buddies and I made a pact to watch it so we sat through it no matter how gruesome it got. I halfway expected the police to show up at my door to arrest me for watching it. I can't believe that this streams on Netflix. I guess in some far out way you could make the argument that this is art, but whatever kind of art it is I hope I never see it again. As Tyler Durden would say ""Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken."" I tend to agree when people try and make arguments about what is art. I could make a video where I drowned cats and dogs and hide under the ""it's art,"" defense. Sadly a movie about drowning animals would be a thousand times more pleasant then this movie. I won't go into the plot because it is your cliché horror story. This is the only movie that I would say you are a better person for not watching. Don't let anyone fool you and tell you this is funny because there is nothing funny about it. I have a demented sense of humor, and in no way did I find a single thing even slightly humorous about this film.

The countless plot holes, awful moments of scriptwriting/unnecessary lines and absurd acting make this movie incredibly fun to watch. The fact that anyone would actually try to take this seriously is what surprises me...the trailer should be enough to make you realize you should be getting ready to laugh; not to scream. The Asian character just tops off this movie with incredible hilarity.

The storyline could have been more interesting if the creation of the human centipede was complete, meaning that this was indeed a new creature, strong, which had one identity and not three different people stuck together who act as one only because they are stuck.

384,marmoraflash2,About as bad as a movie can be,1,29 January 2013,"I'd heard someone talk about the film and the concept sounded interesting in a twisted way. Within minutes the movie jumps the shark and it never comes back. Just how astonishingly vapid the movie is can be captured in a couple of examples. Two American women travelling in Germany try to drive to a club but get lost and get a flat tire. They don't know how to change it (that's actually fairly credible given that they show no signs of any intelligence). So they decide to walk to get help: bad idea, but as long as they walk along the road maybe they'll get lucky. Of course, the next time we see them they are wandering through the woods. The film doesn't even attempt to give any reason why they would have left the road because there is none possible. No one with the ability to book a flight from the USA to Germany and manage to make it there could be stupid enough to leave the road.So they wind up at the evil Nazi doctor's house in the woods and he drugs them and turns them into a human centipede with a Japanese dude at the head of it. There are tons of logical problems along the way, but let's just skip over them the way the movie does--except, really? the girls don't think to undo the wrist restraints with their teeth until Dr Evil is standing there drugging the Japanese guy? OK, had to get that one out of my system.The police come and while they are keeping the Dr busy, Japanese guy has an idea. He grabs a scalpel. This is the smartest thing any of the three has done all movie. They lay in wait for the Dr (not easy to do when you are sewed mouth to ass, but they pull it off). As the Dr walks into the room, Japanese guy stabs him in the foot. Good thinking. Then he stabs him in the leg. That's a pretty good idea, too. Then he just leaves the scalpel in the Dr's leg and bites a hole in his neck. Starting to lose his train of thought, I guess. Then--and this is clearly the stupidest thing in a movie full of the stupidest things you can imagine--they decide to crawl up the stairs to escape, leaving the Dr laying there passed out. Admittedly, they're traumatized by their ordeal and they're excited at the chance to escape. But really, wouldn't you maybe kill the Dr? I mean, he sewed the three of you together by your mouths and anuses. If you've thought of this plan, at least think to take the scalpel with you instead of leaving it in his leg so he can come upstairs and use it on you. If you read this and think, well, maybe it'll be interesting enough to be worth watching, STOP. Don't do it. You'll wish you hadn't wasted the two hours.

388,vasco-ac,Worst written movie ever,4,8 October 2011,"While I am no doctor I wont be commenting on the flaws of the medical procedures but there are some major flaws in the script that are worth noting:1st: two American girls who got lost stuck in Germany with a flat tire and no cellphone signal decide do go deep in to the forest instead of even trying to change the flat tire. found a house with a creepy guy and decide to stay.2nd: a girl attempts to escape only when she has the mad-surgeon ready to inject her with anesthesia. while free she either stays still or poorly tries to escape (no broken windows, no knife grabbing or looking for help). she will even try to save her deep asleep friend carrying her around.3rd: so they are stitched together. 3 pairs of arms and 3 brains are unable to attempt an escape right from the beginning (even though they bit him). they could have tripped the surgeon, grabbed his dick for him not to move and, i don't know, killed him. then grabbed a phone or tried to escape.4th: the police goes into the house and one of them gets poisoned. while the girls were poisoned the same way and took them like 5 minutes to be extremely sick, the policeman only felt it at least half an hour later, when he's chasing the bad guy.5th: only three days later (i'm assuming) right into the end of the movie the 'centipede' remembers to grab a scalpel and to attack the surgeon. even though, when going to the carotid, the Japanese in the lead decided to use his teeth instead of the scalpel stuck in the immobilized surgeon's leg (not killing him).6th: the three stitched have to climb the stair to leave the basement which proves to be extremely hard. the author seems to have forgotten that they have been outside already as a centipede (the transportation being, up or down, obviously left out).7th: the policemen came in and split while searching the house. even though one of them passes through the door where the 'centipede' is in, he doesn't remember to open the door and search for the surgeon. when one of them is killed and the other rushes to him, he does open the door and instead of trying to help those people he just rushes, looking petrified, to save his buddy. finding him dead floating in the pool he doesn't try to kill the killer but to save the colleague, getting shot.This are some of the situations that prove that this movie was not even thought of thoroughly to avoid basic script mistakes. not worth watching, i'm not even sure if it is valuable as a what-not-to-do.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

390,Atheist_Fox,"Terrible, on a number of levels",1,13 October 2010,"Where to begin...The plot of this movie is terribly overwrought, having been done any number of times. Two attractive young women are alone and get captured by some crazy guy. He does bad things to them. This movie takes it a step beyond that.Many horror movies have the victims fight back against the bad guy, typically to no avail. In this movie, the bad guy is human, and thus is vulnerable to any of the hundreds of ways to kill him that the victims had at any given time.The main character ""Lindsay"" escapes from her four point hospital restraints just before the evil doctor can sedate her. She does this in about ten seconds. Why she didn't think to do that during any of the previous eight hours or so is beyond me. It's not like she was in the hospital for a procedure. She knew that she was in a really bad situation, but doesn't bother trying to escape until the last minute? When she does free herself, she runs through the house bleeding a sobbing, despite having an IV stand right next to her. It would have been a far more interesting film if she had bludgeoned the doctor right then and there.Later, after the three victims are connected, they finally fight back, with the Japanese man stabbing the doctor in the knee with a scalpel. He then takes a bite out of the doctor's neck. Because obviously, cutting his throat would have been way too smart.I'm not saying that the 'heroes' should always win, but they should demonstrate at least the reasoning capacity of a chimp. For some reason though, this movie's victims apparently lack basic intelligence (even well before the really bad things start to happen), and also appear to lack any kind of 'fight' instinct.For a complete list of things wrong with this film, see every other review.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
391,austin-bull,Why oh why?,2,29 July 2010,"The Human Centipede is a truly misguided attempt at extending the boundaries of the horror genre.The plot is elementary and overused (except for the whole sewing as*es to mouths thing) - two pretty yet silly American tourists, lost and alone, scared and in dire need of assistance as they roam aimlessly in the night away from the safety of their car, blah blah blah... BAM! Taken hostage by a crazy German dude who likes to force people to eat other peoples sh*t. The same old story. Add some Asian guy to be the front carriage of this sh*t train and you've got yourself a human centipede.Credible as the plot is, the movie gets even better when we discover Dr Freakschnitzel is really trying to re-create the glory days when he had his tri-poodle trained like a show dog.To be honest, after the shock of realizing someone had made a movie about such a ridiculous concept, it really becomes apparent how disappointing the film is. I was expecting to be grossed out or sh*t scared (pun intended) the whole time. Neither emotions occurred. Things ran fairly predictably and we were spared most scenes of intense grossness. We were also spared any effective suspense; the scenes without the poop parade were mostly pretty boring. Not to mention the fact that not a great deal actually happens for the first 45 minutes.None of the characters have any depth to them. There is no discernible reason for Dr Nutcase's insanity. The screenwriter attempts to dispense with the audience's questions about his motives in a single line. The two damsel's at the center of this sh*t storm (pun definitely intended) also lose any potential character value after their dialogue is abruptly halted when their mouths are attached to anuses. The Asian guy (who doesn't speak English or German oddly enough) adds no depth to the story other than to yell and scream, foil his own pi*s weak attempts at escape and abruptly kill himself upon the brink of absconsion for some reason which makes little or no sense.If you have gotten to this page, it is likely you know what the film is about already, which means you have already experienced all the movie has to offer - a new twist on the word disgusting. It isn't very well acted or written, but let's face it, this movie is about the novelty. Shock value: Check. Any other credible film qualities: I'm afraid not.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

It was the best film at Frightfest this year for me. Very Original, Very Scary and Very Very Funny!!! Great Performance from those international actors. German, Japanese, American thrown in one chaotic situation. The audience was loving every moments of it. I love the ending too. It is called ""The Human Centipede"" but it really is about us human and that is why it is such a scary film.. It deals with the human dignity and the monster living inside of us. Nowadays the horror films are pretty much the same everywhere. But this one will be something you have never ever seen before. Crazy movie.

This is probably one of the best horror films since Hellraiser. Highly original mouth-to-ass sickness, pitch black humor and unforgettable/ jaw dropping imagery.But above all very scary and intelligent! I wouldn't recommend eating before viewing this movie. Dieter Laser' (baltic storm) performance as Dr.Heiter is brilliant, so are the beautiful middle and tail girl. Writer/ director Tom Six is a genius!

394,myblock,maybe it is art?,1,7 October 2010,"Is it something I'd ever want or need to watch again? No. However, somehow, being someone who never bothered to see Saw, etc., the movie did give me a very keen insight into who we are as a society, and what people want from entertainment.I DO NOT recommend the movie, however, I must say that it may be poorly executed art that speaks to our times and human condition. I don't like Francis Bacon as a painter either, but I respect his work... not that Tom Six has those kinds of skills. Guess I'm just new to this whole genre of film-making. It bums me out, but, hey, people like EXCREMENT sometimes, and apparently they really like watching naked girls eat it. Thank the internet. I did sometimes feel the need to laugh at the mistakes in film-making and, somehow, laughing at people who thought this was a good film. Frankly, I want those 90 or so minutes of my life back, I already know how f*d popular entertainment is, I don't need to sit around having some wannabe director proving it to me.

395,monkeygland69,"Great Premise, Crap Film",2,5 May 2010,"Wow, what a pointless and redundant film.It would seem word of mouth has spread into the anus of the internet and shat out this crap film.Despite the hype, the Human Centipede does nothing interesting with its premise or characters - its almost as if Six thinks the *concept* can do most of the leg work for him.And apparently those taken by the original concept require little else from a film - like working through the implications of its own premise or delivering an experience that can stand on its own feet. Take away the striking *image* of three people turned into a human centipede, and you are left with an indistinct film with few thrills.The mad scientist trope barely transcends hackneyed cliché, and the film completely squanders a great opportunity for subtext: what (for example) is the meaning of a male Asian as the head of the centipede and/or what does two American women following him mean? The plot is threadbare and takes the path of least resistance - the pointless film leads from point A to point B. Despite the 'logical' (linear) approach of the 'narrative', the characters motivations generally defy logic and rational explanation.Unlike great horror movies, this film literally has nothing to say about modern culture, gender roles, human fears or scientific hubris.Even worse, the cheap thrills are standard fare. The only thing that can be said in its favor is that some of the images (creep in the car, the centipede itself) are perversely funny.The film fails to suspend disbelief or encourages identification with its own protagonists either. Instead of (say) feeling sorry for the two female characters in the film, you pity the two female *actresses* playing bare breasted women on all fours and eating crap in the form of Six's 'script'.Dieter was typically creepy as the mad scientist, but he can do this stuff in his sleep. Anyone familiar with his work on Lexx knows how remarkable he can be - his Mantrid is amongst the great scifi villains. And the image of Mantrid's floating head on a jar remains much more incisive than anything on display here.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

I just don't understand the hype on this one. People constantly tell me they were so disgusted by this movie that they had to look away. Why? Have they seen Saw III? Saw IV? Ichi The Killer?

398,akojenni,Was this MEANT to be funny?,1,18 July 2012,"Well, if so, it doesn't quite reach that goal, either. Horror? No. That would require inspiring some feeling of unease, at the very least. Suspense? Not a whole lot of that, either. The purpose of this film is stated pretty clearly in the title, and the film itself is nothing but a dull, plodding journey to reach that end. I love horror films. I always have. I'm not snobbish about it--there are plenty of horror films that are, as Stephen King once put it, just ""going for the gross-out"" that I still manage to enjoy. I even kind of like the SAW films, which are nothing BUT silly splatter films. I'm not squeamish in the least. THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE is, quite simply, the worst things a horror film can be: boring and empty. It holds no surprises and doesn't really offer anything new. It isn't even really that disgusting. This film turned me into a clock-watcher. Sheesh, watch an actual autopsy and at least it'll hold your attention. I really should've known better than to watch this, because the synopsis is all you need. The visuals add nothing, the script is genuinely laughable (as are several of the performances). Go watch ""A Serbian Film"" if you're looking for a truly disturbing film that will not make you giggle or yawn. THAT film is a torture test, and you won't forget those visuals quickly--if EVER. If you're not quite up to that level of perversion (because if you're disturbed at all by, say, the HOSTEL films, you are a neophyte), try FUNNY GAMES (the original OR the remake--they're pretty much shot-for-shot). You might not get the gore you want (for me, buckets of blood does not equal horror), but it is a creepy little film. MARTYRS will give you all the torture you want, but it probably won't really stick with you. However, any of the films I mentioned (including HOSTEL) is preferable to THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE.

Breathtaking.These are just a few of the words that describe The Human Centipede: First Sequence. Every so often in a generation a film comes along that can change you, can break your heart, and thrill you all at once. If you're looking for that movie, look no further. The Human Centipede (THC) is of the caliber that few achieve in the genre of thriller/horror. Writer/director Tom Six took steps and risks no other filmmaker dared to, and came out on top victoriously. Right from the beginning, you are emotionally connected and moved by the the protagonists' plight. You feel their terror as they experience it on the screen before you. The antagonist's motives are unclear at first, but are revealed in a unique and groundbreaking way.**SPOILER ALERT** Dr. Heiter's plans to connect three human via their mouths and anuses is medically genius... an area of science only Six dared walk. As the film progresses, and Linday, Jenny, and Katsuro begin their conjoined journey, you begin to take the sides of the centipede or the doctor... good and evil. A decision which, in a sense, perhaps reflects that of your own demeanor and lifestyle choice.Grotesque? Of course. Life changing? You decide. My call?

But to my surprise, this was really well done. For a movie whose plot is about a human centipede, this is good as it can get. The ambiance was great--creepy and eerily sterile. The acting was surprisingly good as well. They couldn't have picked a better Dr. Whoever that actor Deiter Lasor is, he is the scariest, weirdest German I have ever seen. I really enjoyed this feel-good movie. I hope there is a part two coming soon! I hope this will be the new ""The Blind Side"" at the Oscars next year!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
402,hupke89,100% medically inaccurate,1,22 May 2010,"Starting from a good idea, the director/writer totally screws it up, in my humble opinion. I started watching this because of the '100% medically accurate'-marketing, as I'm a student in medicine. It was far from accurate or realistic.. Not medically, not in any way. I'm only a student and still see some big mistakes. Obviously they hadn't even a nurse on the set.-The odds that two random persons are compatible to each other are quite low (that's one of the problems with organ-transplant). How lucky is he that the two girls match! And since the third guy isn't, he just go grab a random Japanese guy out of his backyard, who apparently hasn't a clue what he's doing in Germany(let alone Europe). He doesn't speak neither English nor German nor any other language except for Japanese.-Girl number 2 shows rejection signs at the end of the movie. Which shows that: a- the doctor hasn't worked sterile (he scratches his forehead during the operation, an error a regular surgeon would never do) or b-he didn't gave immuno-suppressing medication, a real doctor would never oversee such a thing or c- they didn't matched (but as you can see prior to the operation, he had them tested).-About that test: as far as I know, it's not the kind of test you can run in your basement, and I really doubt that you can make a lab do that from anonymous people for someone without a practitioners license anyway. As he is 'retired' (most likely fired for his dog-experiment), it' s very highly likely that he hasn't got his license anymore (= no professional secrecy possible).-By far the most hilarious error is when he has his stethoscope in his ears.. He has it in the wrong direction!!! A stethoscope should be worn so that the ear-canal and the branches of the stethoscope are in the prolongation of each other. Like he is wearing it, it makes a small angle. This is something anyone with paramedical knowledge would see right away. (please feel free to search the internet for proper stethoscope wearing instructions if I didn't made myself clear on this point)-If I were a very sick-minded ex-surgeon, I would have connected their blood-circuit. Without it, survival is impossible from the start. First: you can't survive eating excrement from just one person, second: as the urinary tracts are not connected either, the second and third subject would die from dehydration even before they'd die from hunger and third: connecting the rectum with the mouth makes it possible for bacteria from the lower gastric tract (f.e. E.Coli) to infect the upper gastric tract of the second person resulting in diarrhea in the first place, probably followed by generalized infection and death later on. There's a reason why the intestinal tract is segregated.-And my last point is the following: the second girl dies -apparently- from generalized infection. If that's the case, the first girl would be evenly infected. You should also be aware that dying from generalized infection is quite a slow death involving very high fever and tissue necrosis, which she doesn't shows symptoms of.Except from the medical point of view there are other illogic things: the police's behavior towards the doctor, the neighbors hearing screams(but not another house in sight, and the police shows up very late compared to when the screams might have been heard). And how the hell did the doctor managed to plant the scalpel in the first policeman's neck while unable to do anything else but crawling?Furthermore, there is nothing innovating compared to other horror movies. (See colleagues' reviews) I think I made my point clear, but if realism doesn't bother you, you might like it. Although I really doubt it.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

It is one thing when one makes a movie which is most certainly fictitious and has no significant relevance to one's everyday life, but exclude even slight possibility of occurrence. Zombies, Vampires, Demons etc, they do not exist, therefore one can make that movie as gory, erotic, pornographic, violent, disgusting, or anything else that comes to mind, as he/she wants.

405,dumbrunete424,"""The Human Centipede"" has a good concept to it, but was horribly executed, and plot-wise, was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",2,15 June 2010,"This review is practically all spoilers, so if you actually do want to see this film, I suggest that you don't read any further.The concept for this film is a rather good one when it comes to thrillers, but it was done rather poorly. First of all, in the beginning of the film, when we first meet our lady victims, the more and more they actually talk, the more and more you want their mouths to be sewn. Skipping forward, the first time we meet Katsuro, the Japanese tourist, he is being dragged out of Dr. Heiter's car, and there is no further explanation than that. Heiter wakes Katsuro, Jenny, and Lindsay up and then tells them what he plans on doing to them. After his whole presentation, he drugs Katsuro and Jenny again, but Lindsay escapes at the last second and darts upstairs. Heiter follows her, and they eventually end up in his swimming pool room, where she falls in rather comically. Heiter leaves, with Lindsay still in the pool, and then we watch as Lindsay tries to get Jenny and drag her back upstairs. There is a 5 minute sequence of this, when they finally make it outside and Heiter poison-darts Lindsay in the neck. The middle is just weirdness, although somewhat comical as Heiter tries to train the centipede to get his mail for him. Skipping to the end, Katsuro grabs a scalpel when Heiter is upstairs (dealing with police, of course) and hides around the corner, so when Heiter comes back downstairs, Katsuro can stab him in the legs and feet. You'd think at that point, too, if they were trying to escape, that Katsuro would slit Heiter's throat, too, but NO, instead Katsuro bites Heiter's neck and leaves the scalpel in his leg. The centipede then crawls upstairs to a room with a supposedly open window, and when it turns out the window is closed, Katsuro grabs a lamp and tries to smash the window open. By this time, Heiter has made it up the stairs and is now in possession of a scalpel that had been left in his leg. You would think that Katsuro would attack Heiter with the lamp he has in his hand, but he chooses to instead set down the lamp and grab a piece of glass. Then after making a speech which no one but himself can understand, he kills himself with the glass. The police are back at this point, so Heiter drags himself to the pool room and waits for the police to come in so he can shoot them, and he, in turn, can also be shot in the head. Back to the centipede, Lindsay and Jenny are left there, and then Jenny dies. We are left with Lindsay, the middle piece of the centipede, still alive, and then the movie ends.These are just the surface problems I have with the film, but they are the major ones. Hopefully you won't be like me and waste two hours of your life watching this.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
406,antoni-mcvay,Enjoyable original idea.,8,20 June 2010,"I actually thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was quite an original horror movie concept and all throughout it had me wondering what was going to happen next.Dieter Laser did a good job playing the villain, he was sufficiently creepy. I think the reason a lot of people didn't like the film is because they didn't have too much of an explanation about his character (particularly his motivation), so he might have seemed creepy for the sake of it to some people. Personally I liked that as it leaves you thinking more and allows your mind to create more effective horrors than if you have everything explained to you.Ashley C. Williams was enjoyable as the female lead, although there were some typical horror movie clichés where her character does something blatantly stupid where you just want to slap her in the face and say 'don't do that!'. This is one of the main reasons I didn't rate this higher than an 8 as I think the writing could have been a bit more creative with her character so she could have seemed more intelligent and stronger. Still though, it didn't stop me enjoying it, I just think the boundaries of creativity could have been pushed a bit further to turn this into a classic.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

408,bnewman7229,Spoiler Alert: Not a Good Choice of Movie,3,26 August 2010,"When I think of a horror film I imagine blood and other grotesque things. That is what I was expecting with The Human Centipede. It starts out with two American girls touring Europe who get broken down. They are stuck in the middle of the woods in Germany. For some crazy and stupid reason the girls go walking around to find help. Notice how in horror films they always do something stupid that no one in their right mind would do. The girls find a house where this German Surgeon lives. He is known for separating Siamese twins and has decided to go in reverse. The sick doctor drugs the girls and ties them in a hospital bed. There is already a guy there and apparently he didn't meet the expectation bar. That poor guy dies for no reason at all. The surgeon goes and kidnaps this Asian guy. The psychotic surgeon has this plan of creating a human centipede. He will be sewing the ""patients"" mouth to anus. He has already attempted this with his three dogs, who are dead. After explaining the ""procedure"" to his now ""patients"" he sedates everyone and performs his ""miracle"". When they wake up he gets a mirror and shows them what they look like. The crazy doc. is so overjoyed by his ""masterpiece"" he cries. How touching! As expected when you sew someone's mouth to someone else's anus there will be poop somewhere in this equation. No worries, you don't see the actual fecal matter enter the mouth you get a warning when it happens though. The cops who this entire time apparently have been investigating the missing people show up, without a search warrant. The crazy surgeon offers them drinks and tries to drugs them. A little fight breaks out and cops leave to get a search warrant. As in any horror movie the victims try to escape. After his little pet centipede attacks him they move up to the bedroom where he eventually catches up to them. The Asian guy slits his throat and the cops return, this time with a warrant. They begin searching the house and one cop gets shot as the other cop finds the centipede. Without calling for backup or anything the cop goes to check his partner. Both cops end up dead and so does the surgeon. The movie ends with the girl on the end dieing and the one in the middle left alive. All in all this movie was a waste of time. It is stomach turning don't get me wrong, but there is little to no horror. The only thing it leaves you wondering is ""where would I be placed?""

Both the script and the actors are very bad(except Dieter, who seems to be struggling with his boring role as a mad scientist).As a German fellow i have to put something right : Germany is not a third-world country, we actually can use our cellphones anywhere, AND we do not recommend running into some scary wood to get better reception.Well, i can barely hope the sequel,probably involving an even longer centipede, will be better, which should not be very difficult - i also hope it will cut out the scat, which the director probably expected to be shocking and turn out to be very lame and unrealistic.I'm sorry for all the people who actually payed to see this crap.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The idea of an insane surgeon trying to make the siamese triplet is fantastic, definitely original, and the way it was executed was fantastic, but all the reviews I read talked about ""disturbing"" and ""repulsive"" content....which in my case hyped it up even more...That was the bummer for me, the movie itself isn't gory at all really, yeah a couple scenes here and there, but nothing ""repulsive"" or really ""disturbing""...I will admit it COULD have been, because with a storyline/idea like this it's kind of obvious how extensive the visuals could have gotten....but I have to give the director credit, because where the visuals could have been completely over the top, he kept it tame and in some points unseen, thus leaving it to the watcher's imagination, which depending how vivid the individual's imagination can be, is the determining factor to the level of disgust that can be had by this movie overall I really enjoyed this movie and must say it was a breath of fresh air given most of the ""horror"" movies that come out these days....and I'll admit, I am looking forward to the sequel Gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ""Eat S**t and Die!""....It's DEFINITELY worth the watch!!",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Before I even begin reviewing let me just say that I do understand the 'point' of these kinds of movies, they're not created with Oscar winning cinematography, acting or plot or anything else some of the more pretentious reviewers here panned the film for, it's merely meant to entertain on a 'lower' level and be a kind of stupid fun, this movie was neither. It wasn't over the top shocking or even cringe worthy in regards to content or gore and it took itself far too seriously to be considered a satirical horror film like Shaun of the Dead. I can forgive the director for abusing every single horror movie trope (stupid American girls, take the woods not the roads, killer stalking prey in empty house, mad scientist, creature feature, incompetent cops, no cell phone service, broken down car etc) these tropes and more are the bread and butter of almost all horror movies and many entertaining titles have made good use of them...Six seems to believe just using them without putting any thought into context or execution will build suspense and make a good horror movie...he is sadly mistaken. The entire surgery scene could have been exploited MUCH more and the whole 'derp let's fuze the mouth to the ass and call it a centipede!' really? Completely lazy and unimaginative, it seriously looked like the actors were just playing a pornographic version of follow the leader. Which leads me to my next point, why are all the good bits covered in bandages? The entire centipede looked completely sterile and not disturbing in anyway at all. I walked in expecting torsoes sewn together with limbs cut off and re- attached into different positions with the end product being something that could have come out of John Carpenter's 'Thing'. Six had a game winning pass thrown at him with the whole mad scientist + fused human bodies thing but fumbled the ball completely. If he at least managed to elicit some sort of emotional response out of me whether it be by making me actually care about the victims (LOL), feel a general sense of dread or suspense or just thrown tons and tons of gore at the screen so I could at least be grossed out I would have considered this film at least half of a successful attempt at a B movie. All my other beefs with this film have been more than adequately addressed in the other negative reviews.TL;DR if you seen this movie on Starz, HBO, Showtime or some other movie channel go ahead and give it a watch if you feel like wasting time (literally) otherwise give it a pass and pray the next guy to tackle a premise like this does it better.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

I can't wait for the second edition i hope it is as disturbing as the first! AS for the inaccurate parts of the film all i can say is although this is true about the medical side of the movie, you really can't liken it to real surgeons, as no real surgeon would ever perform such a surgery in the first place.

I understand that Six meant this as a dig in response to getting such poor reviews before...but it really is a work of art. My argument: it has a unique plot, it has a believable character (in the doctor), and it certainly goes to extreme lengths to set it apart from cult classics and new generation gore fests. It IS a work of art. Six should be applauded for his creativity and gall to go where no one went (or wanted to go) before.

Yes its a torture film in the worst way , not in shock gore, violence, rape, but in metal and spiritual abuse. This film invested way to much time in showing the disgusting nature of dehumanizing the victims that you lose faith in humanity. A single scene involving suicide, (That should stand for something) tries to explain the intent of the film, however should have been a cut to the director apologizing for the 91 min torture he inflicts on the viewer.This Film missed the mark when he decides to not just scare the viewer but force them into a suicidal contemplation after reflecting on their life choices.

But the viewer, unbelievably disgusted, is saved a bit from the horror of the images. The bandages around the procedure areas are never removed, saving us the grace of seeing any detail of anus-to-lips. There is also only one bathroom scene through-out the movie, and yes, it is a very hard watch, very hard. I found the movie to be more visual and thought sparked of the visual than anything else. There's a lot of gore, but it's more the imagination of actually having to experience this that gets to you. Yes, it is visually striking, and you'll wonder for days when you can finally forget the images.

This however, is the most pointless, boring, god awful piece of crap I've ever seen. I really expected to see the doctor chopping people up and picking the 'choice' bits to sew onto another person. That, at least, wouldn't have been as boring as this garbage I subjected myself too. Once the doctor sewed his victims together, the movie just got stupider. Sure, being kidnapped would be scary. And given, having someone subject you to bizarre medical torture would be horrifying. But why the hell would the Doctor even bother sewing a someones mouth to another persons butt? Amusement?! Give me a break. At that, I couldn't fathom why they wouldn't just pull themselves apart, sure, it would hurt like hell, but they WANTED to get away... right?! The ending had to be the worst part. Once the other two victims had died, and everyone in the house but the 'Middle' girl had died, why the hell didn't she try to get away? The Asian dude cut his throat, and the redhead croaked, why the hell couldn't she cut her friend off her ass, and her face from the Asian dude??? I'm pretty sure that no major arteries would have been compromised, she wouldn't have bled to death. Maybe I'm nitpicking, but if I'm pretty sure anyone in her position who wanted to escape and survive would do that... right?!

435,lin-wnd,surgeon tries to construct three people with one digestive tract,2,27 October 2011,"Inspired by the Nazi medical practices, The Human Centipede (First Sequence) contributed the same atrocity as the Holocaust. Although the use of gas chambers was absent in the film, the experimental ideas of Dr. Heiter's character, played by Deiter Laser, evoked similar dehumanizing aspects. As a world-class surgeon, Dr. Heiter's region of focus is separating Siamese twins. However, he turns to a glaringly different interest as the film opens with him sobbing over the death of his masterpiece: three dogs with one digestive tract, a centipede. Director Tom Six applies this same concept to humans by drawing the viewer's attention to the sickening procedure that Dr. Heiter takes to construct the 'Human Centipede.' In doing so, Dr. Heiter goes beyond extraordinary means to find his subjects; a male foreigner and two American tourists were his captives. Instead of evoking fast-pacing heart beats and excitement that is common in most horror films, The Human Centipede just puts the viewer's gag reflexes to test. While myriads of horror movies depict inhumane story plots, The Human Centipede topped it off by being potentially realistic, adding to the shock that has already been inflicted from the scenes above. Too often did I find myself comparing real life occurrences to the chaotic plot of the film. With the many psychotic incidents of murder and abuse in today's world, The Human Centipede might even become an inspiration to the lunatics. But it wasn't those aspects that would distance the viewer from the film. Rather, the poor choice in character representation dragged the appeal a couple notches down. The highlight of my annoyance occurred as American tourists, Lindsay and Jenny, faced a vehicle malfunction. The scene united amateur acting techniques with unsupportive lines, lessening the appeal and credibility of suspense. Moreover, the random insertions of curse words in alternating sequence from Jenny to Lindsay, took away from conveying frustration for the vehicle situation. These flaws hindered the viewer from immersing himself into the character of the tourists, creating a distant atmosphere. What is more disappointing is the scene was used as a segue to the next, which forced the viewer to watch another minute and a half of pointless rolls of film.With nuances aside, The Human Centipede effectively created a cold atmosphere by the use of lighting. Particularly evident in the cellar scenes, the vibe felt by the blue tinted lighting naturally heightened the suspense of the film. From the golden yellow living room to the contrastingly gray-blue cellar, Six gives the viewer just enough time to adjust to the color difference, while also placing the viewer in a position hungry for tension. Combined with the slow deliverance of Dr. Heiter's lines and the maniacal explanation of the surgical procedure, this exact instance evokes the greatest amount of chills as the lighting from the overhead projector shines from the chin on upward of Dr. Heiter's face. The cellar and the somber lighting becomes the cue for all horror. As the lighting of the film added to the horror effect of the plot, the sound throughout the film provided setbacks to the finer artistry of the film. The tug of war between the diegetic sound and lighting lured the viewer in at some moments, while pushing him away at others. This inconsistency was present again, in the cellar. This time, it occurred during the death of the first victim. The sobbing of the two American tourists was overemphasized, devaluing the death of the first potential centipede. The excessive stress placed on the cry of the ladies distracts the viewer from absorbing the greater picture: the first display of unemotional behavior from the mad-surgeon, Dr. Heiter. I find that the diegetic sound focuses too strongly on the noises that Lindsay and Jenny make more so than the actual plot of the scene. For instance, I discovered that I was more drawn to the panting of the human centipede rather than the centipede itself. While the film might not have been classified the best of its century, the cinematography certainly made up for it. The tracking shot of the 'Siamese twin' artwork at the inception of the film stresses the importance of it, giving one the ability to draw conclusions. Along with the low-point shot, Six draws the viewer's awareness by emphasizing the artwork. This approach gives away an idea of the plot while simultaneously keeping the viewer in the dark. The tracking shot, once again, is used as Ashley Williams tries to escape the Dr. Heiter's mastermind plan. Up the stairs and to the bedroom, the shot vividly displays the fear of Ashley and gives an adrenaline rush to the viewer. The transition also aids in the development of anticipation. The lengthy, gradual transitions down the long corridor of Dr. Heiter's home create the perfect setting personified by horror movies. Particularly in the time of Lindsay's escape, the slow transitions contributed to the labyrinth effect, forcing Lindsay to be trapped in time and space. It was interesting to witness that the use of music was minimal. It is safe to conclude that horror films usually rely on the nondiegetic sound to design the ambiance of the environment. However, Six shifts the weight of the music to lighting, generating a unique method to surprise the viewer with fear. The Human Centipede incorporates both ingredients of success and failure. While the plot was catchy for its unforeseen gruesomeness, it alone is not enough to satisfy the viewers. The awkward characters and obnoxiously loud sounds at some points, took off a few stars for the rating. Contrastingly, the evident efforts that Director Six put in carefully manipulating the position of the camera shots were noteworthy.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
436,patrickromsim,"A disturbing fetish porno, deceptively disguised as a horror film",1,6 August 2011,"What strikes me as repulsive about this film is not mainly it's disturbing storyline and silly plot, but that director Tom Six actually thinks he has made a ""horror movie"". He has not. ""The Human Centipede"" is complete and utter sexually exploitative, torture porn trash, deceptively packaged as a horror film. Nothing about this movie is remotely horrific in the true sense of what the genre and it's many facets have attempted to portray on screen for 100 years. It is not scary. It is not intense. It is not terrifying. It is just plain disgusting and sick. This film is nothing more then fetish porn born from the obviously sick and disturbed mind of it's director. Of course, if that was Tom Six's intent by making this garbage, then he has achieved greatness. Having said that, I will admit that Dieter Laser's performance of Dr. Heiter was truly inspired. Had he been the villain in a more worthy film, his portrayal would have been legendary. Instead, he will just be remembered as that crazy doctor in that perverted fetish porno, who sewed three people together, ass to mouth. What a waste of a truly creepy villain, played by an equally creepy actor.As for the story, it is so incredibly flawed that one has to wonder just how many minutes Tom Six spent writing the script. Of course when most of the dialogue is coming from two girls screaming into the butt-holes their lips have been sewn to, how much time do you need to write brilliant lines like ""mmmm....mmmffff...mmmm""? Which brings me to one of the major problems with the film: the ultimate reveal of the human centipede. The film could have actually been a real ""horror movie"" had it ended with the unveiling of Dr. Heiter's perverted creation. But instead of building the suspense and developing the characters further, we spend the better half of the movie trying to watch these three conjoined humans crawl around in adult diapers and crap down each other's surgically affixed throats. Gee, real suspenseful. Seriously, watching these three stooges try to navigate up a basement staircase was almost laughable. And the fact that the two girls never shut up or stopped crying, even with their mouths sewn shut to an anus, conjured up feelings of annoyance rather then horror or sympathy. The only time in the film that I actually agreed with the mad doctor was when he came in and told them to shut up or he was going to cut their vocal cords.To sum it up, Tom Six's fetish porn, ""The Human Centipede"", is nothing more then a disturbing attempt at shocking the audience with vile and disgusting images, generated from a sick man's mind. It is not horror. It has no redeeming value and no true moments of terror to qualify it as worthy of wearing the ""Horror Movie"" mantle. Six has vowed to one up himself for the sequel, but from what I hear, the film is already banned in the U.K. and I certainly hope it is banned in the U.S. as well. In fact, they should just ban Tom Six from making any further films in the future or at least get him some psychiatric help. He seriously needs it. He could also do with a creative writing class as well. Maybe with a little schooling he will learn the true difference between what really defines the ""horror film"" genre and the ""fetish porn"" crap he makes.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Is it coincidence that the three victims of Dr Heiter's Chilopoda Frankenstein are all either non-white or non-male? I sincerely doubt it, the stereotypes are rife in this picture and not, it seems, for cinematic purposes.Has this film achieved it's goals merely because I and others have taken to the web to voice our concerns? In this writer's view, any assertion that this film's purpose is to push boundaries and draw debate is a frail shield to it's opposition who say 'too far'.The problem isn't solely the content, it is the manner in which it is portrayed. The Saw franchise successfully portrays the sadistic acts of a madman, whereas in Human Centipede (First Sequence) we feel that the madman is not the Doctor, but the man behind the camera.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

Once it's on, your inticed, and have to see what happens next.Over all, for most people it wouldn't be considered that scary. The real horror is in what he's going to do to the people, but this is revealed almost right away. It's clear that the villain wants these people alive. While he does degrade them,and dehuminize them, after the first 20 minutes of the movie it's clear that the worst it over.The only reason this movie deserves a seven is because of originality. Never has this been done before. Despite a few flaws in the storyline there's no doubt that this movie is sick, twisted, and will impact you afterwards.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

It is out of pure curiosity that got me to watch this film. I did not find it scary nor disgusting. The only acting that was good was from the Doctor (bad guy) and the Asian male victim. The actresses in this film were bad. I did not find myself having sympathy for them. I actually didn't find this film that bad at all, just kind of weird of course. Never seen anything like it, lol. To think that someone came up with the idea is just kind of funny. Nobody likes sh*t. I think the scene where the Dr is showing the victims what he is planning on doing to them, showing drawings in his surgical room, was a good scene. It's kind of funny when the centipede is ""connected"" and they are in the yard and it's ""feeding time"".

The acting was bad and the whole idea was bad, I really just hate the idea too, some people may like the idea but I really don't, the only reason I watched this filth was because my girlfriend wanted me to see how bad it was, and how right she was. Probably the most enjoyable moment in this movie is when the screen goes black at the end, that is honestly the most enjoyable frame of the entire movie.

442,matusow,A Touching Tale,9,16 April 2012,"This beautiful film tells the story of a lonely, misunderstood surgeon who - in a relentless effort to help humankind - labors intensely to develop and perfect novel surgical methods. The doctor is an extremely sympathetic (dare I say lovable?) character, whose humanitarian impulses reveal themselves in unexpected ways. He kindly provides thirst quenching water and safe haven for two souls whose car has broken down. We see that he gently and mercifully euthanizes a truck-driver who was clearly very ill. Subsequently, he caringly digs the grave himself, and thoughtfully buries the gentleman next to his own beloved pet (just like family, I thought). Finally, the selfless Dr. Heiter - a renowned surgeon with many demands on his schedule - provides, at his own cost and little chance of remuneration, cutting edge medical services to three strangers whose insurance benefits are unclear (it is highly likely that the extensive medical interventions documented would have been covered without a referral from the primary care physician). After surgery, he provides love, food, education - this last, a valiant attempt to teach his creation a useful skill, carrying a newspaper - is stubbornly refused by the unappreciative centipede), and provides ongoing medical care. The Man... is a Saint. This is a lush tale, well-told. Kudos for a very memorable movie.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
443,GothAlbinoAngel,No Sound? Still the Wickedest thing I've seen since Final Destination,9,17 May 2012,"Oh. My. Goddess. Let me tell you, RIGHT NOW, that I only marked this as a nine instead of a 10 because my laptop didn't have sound when I watched this film... and my laptop was malfunctioning. I cannot believe that someone was this inspirational and amazing. Tom Six did a magnificent job on this film and as soon as I possibly can, I'm going to buy this movie and just watch it (With sound). The character, Lindsay, was my favorite. The way she acted cool, collected, the way she escaped from the trap, but was brave enough to go back and rescue her friend, Jenny, EVEN THOUGH there was a high risk she would be caught again. She was beautiful and courageous, putting her friend over herself and often having to comfort her friend. Jenny, though not as high in my ranks as Lindsay, was also amazing. Her emotion, her acting, her constant fear and dejection was enticing and breathtaking. Katsuro, with his constant insults toward mad scientist, Josef Heiter, made my skin tingle in anticipation of what would happen next.I only have few criticisms about the film. Many around me point out that though he connected the digestive tract, how were the characters to urinate with those diaper-like things on them? And if the women were to have their menstrual cycle, what would he do? Nevertheless, Tom six delivers this production in a wicked fashion of horror and intrigue. I merely call it horror because, by my own rights, when I saw it, I was horrified that someone could even think of doing that to three innocent people and not feel even the slightest bit guilty. I loved this film and I'm sure that, once I hear it as well as see it, I will change my rating to a ten. Many thanks to the Six siblings for bringing forth a creation unmatched by others, not even 'Friday the 13th' or the 'Child's Play/Chuckie' series could compare.

I really don't disagree that the plot is a little twisted; its pretty messed up. However, the story line is extremely original, which nobody seems to give it credit for. In addition, the film has surprisingly good cinematography that helps create the desired dramatic effect throughout. Finally, the acting isn't horrible; It is even surprisingly good in certain scenes. Overall, ""The Human Centipede"" doesn't deserve most of the negative reviews it gets, because I guarantee at least half of the people that rated it had their hands over their eyes the whole movie or haven't even watched it. If you enjoyed Saw, then you'll probably feel slightly intrigued by this movie; I know I was. If your even a little on the queasy side then FOR GODS SAKE DON'T WATCH THIS and please DON'T WRITE A REVIEW ON IT. IT'S CALLED ""THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE"" DO YOU EXPECT IT TO BE WHOLESOME?

The movie builds op a creepy tension but at the end 3 people are fusioned together and it looks quite dull: The movie idea have been copied straight from Silent Hill horror game Homecoming from 2008.The make up artist Rob Hillenbrink worked & operated in this movie, although he lives a private life in the Netherlands. Special make up was teached & given but even working with all types of people of ethnicity in these movie Loft. Rob Hillenbrink & his son discriminated in the past Asians, Indians & Jewish people.Because of the weak Dutch Law system this information was never send out public in USA or England.

I don't even feel like it's a horror movie, since it's not scary at all, just disgusting. Some kind of background would have been nice, more than what is given about the scientist. I mean did he just wake up one day and was a complete loony or what? And the story didn't make sense, the cops were... I don't know, unreal? What kind of cops behave that way?

I have seen a lot of gore when it comes to horror and I must say, this was enjoyable but I would never classify it as being a ""gore"" film.The movie starts out like most films in the horror genre, two girls in a different country...cliché problems cause them to seek assistance. From that point on it still carries the formula of horror/gore but the goal of the film definitely goes in a different direction than most, obviously since it is called The Human Centipede.Not going into too much detail I can assure you this film is VERY tame. No gore, a tad annoying, and a few moments of shock value. I can count on one hand how many times there is blood on the screen, trust me most slasher films are more violent than this! The only warning I can give to anyone who watches this...it just falls flat in the ""OH MY GOD"" moments.Also, the noises of the lovely train of people can get kind of annoying.All in all, it was enjoyable, different, and not as disturbing/shocking/horrifying as everyone said is was.

I know that the folks who like this sort of thing, are the highly intellectual types and see more in these films than I do, as I am lacking in vision. That sounds condescending, no doubt. But I really didn't mean it to be. It's what I've spent most of my life thinking, was the case. Then, I saw this, ""film."" Afterward, I read these reviews. Now, I don't know weather or not I'm, condescending. I watched this, after having seen an episode of, South Park, some time ago. I thought it was just a more twisted story line of the writer's and let it go at that. Then, I happened upon a compilation of ""worst endings of (whatever the year was),"" and saw ""The Human Centipede!"" I couldn't believe it! Then, I saw there had already been a sequel! So finally, I watched it, earlier tonight. I had to come to IMDb immediately, just to see what others' have said... (My faith in Trey Stone and Matt Parker is fully restored. I'm so grateful, that they didn't think of this first.) I couldn't get through the whole thing, I must admit. My lack of imagination doesn't allow me to (do whatever it is, that it's not doing... is it, ""grasp?"" is it, ""overlook?"") things like, the character's not using a phone when it sits before them, or running when the opportunity presents itself... I can't bring myself to get past those things, long enough to get all the way through to the end; which I've already been told is a bad one, by one of the intellectual folks who like this sort of movie (a'hem... I meant, ""film."" sorry...). Anyhow, I thought it was awful.

It wasn't particularly well acted and up to when the girl was drugged after dragging her friend out of the house it had the usual clichés, but despite that it still held my interest. There were sooooo many times when the characters acted stupidly (as happens in these sort of films). But when they got to the part when the Centipede was 'made' it was an strange/interesting concept, and thankfully most of the disgusting parts were in the mind rather than shown on-screen. Thoroughly depressing ending too, although I suppose that with the two policemen getting killed would mean that more police would go to the house.

Please don't bother watching this if you are easily disgusted by any form of sadism. Reading the synopsis you are aware of what kind of film this will be. This movie actually doesn't showcase much gore as it is not the primary focus of this movie.Dieter Laser is an absolutely phenomenal actor playing the creepy sadistic surgeon Dr. Heiter. I mean his face just cries out villain. The two girls acting is mediocre at best however it doesn't take away from the film.Of course there are moments where you will find the girls' stupidity purely vexatious but of course without that this movie wouldn't exist.Overall this is an excellent horror film with in my honest opinion the best villain/antagonist portrayed by Dieter Laser.

What I am saying is that this got released to the public, and it was advertised, and Tom Six purposely made it so controversial and disgusting to get more people to buy it. That to me is NOT what a film should be about, and if people want to watch torture porn, there should be a portal for that; it shouldn't be out there for any freaking person to watch (I know it's an 18, but the internet exists).On a positive note, the German dude that plays the doctor is a fantastic actor and I give him credit for that.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

468,matthew_battles,100% Medically Accurate - My Arse!,1,24 March 2014,"While there are some truly God-awful films out there, I think I'm safe to say that this film takes the top prize in my book as a film worthy to forget.The feature length film (barely making it that far as it just barely crosses the 90minute line) 'stars' Dieter Laser - as the demented Dr Hieter I'll talk about him a little later, Ashley Williams and Ashlynn Yennie as *Insert horror movie cliché alert here* two hopelessly shallow, lost, blonde American tourists travelling through the German Backwoods *sigh*, and Akhihiro Kitamura another tourist but from Japan who doesn't speak a word of English and guess where the good Doctor decides to place him in his horrible scheme?Oh, the film also 'stars' Andreas Leupold and Peter Blankenstein (real surname on IMDb) as two of the most ridiculous movie detectives I've ever seen... Bernard Kostrau also puts in an appearance in the film as, and I'm quoting his IMDb character here - Dirty Man in Car - a character who appears for little more than a minute, and makes obscene sexual comments to our two plastic female stars.Barely five minutes into the film, our two female characters are lost in the German forest. They spend the next few minutes bickering, they're supposed to be best friends but have less Chemistry than a GSCE science project, before they come to the house of Dr Hieter - the only house around for miles.If that's not bad enough the obviously creepy doctor invites them in and offers them drug spiked drinks...After explaining his ingenious plan to his horrified three captives - I'd just like to take a second and say that this scene carries the best acting in the entire film - but lets face it - who wouldn't be repulsed as someone tells you that he is intending to cut your cheeks off and stitch you permanently to the arse of another human being? One of the female characters decides to make a run for it and gets caught in the pool by the doctor who then delivers the only line worth quoting in the film; ""You are going to regret your little escape, in fact I'm thankful for it, because now I know definitely you are the middle piece!""While the film is said to be 100% medically accurate, I would take this with a pinch of salt - the simple fact that a single doctor could not carry out this operation; three sedated people would need constant monitoring as the operation is carried out to make sure that none of them dies is bad enough, but to even pretend that a person could survive being attached to another person's arse is simply ridiculous - a little juvenile here but - a single fart would actually kill the person behind them!So once you've gotten over the shock of these three people permanently stitched together you then remember that these characters are about as three-dimensional as a Pancake! They came out of nowhere, have no personality and don't seem to have any redeeming or sympathetic qualities, you simply don't care. In fact by the end of the film you simply wish they'd all shut up because you've spent the last 45 minutes listening to them moan!Now onto the main character Dr Hieter. Hieter is actually based upon a real person; Doctor Eduard Wirths - A Nazi (surprise, surprise) surgeon who was obsessed with the thoughts of attaching organs and limbs onto the body of another (usually this was done with twins) to see if they could make a better soldier.. Hieter is - like the rest of the cast - two dimensional. He has no personality, no history, no motivation for his crimes and no redeeming features.I have no idea how this film was even funded, though I will say this for the film - it does provide horror fans with a slightly horrible ending; after a daring escape attempt by 'The Human Centipede' the Japanese front piece randomly gives a monologue about how horrible a person he is and how he deserves to be in his agony before delving a piece of glass into his throat and dying. Dr Hieter then returns to his pool and kills the two police officers and somehow taking a bullet to the forehead in the process and dying. The two remaining members of the centipede then clasp hands as the back piece sobs her last breath and the 'middle piece' is then left to scream and moan and cry as the camera pans upwards.However, despite all of the characters deaths in the film - it has been announced that the director of this train-wreck is releasing a sequel; 'The Human Centipede - Full Sequence' featuring a 25 person centipede.

470,sonanovotna,Extremely entertaining!,9,27 January 2018,"I've been reluctantly planning on watching this movie for years. Through many references, jokes and memes on the internet, I have always been aware of the concept of ""human centipede"", and was greatly repulsed, very apprehensive, but also a bit curious about this controversial movie. However, nothing about having your mouth sawn to somebody's anus and being forced to eat their shit really screamed ""must watch"" to me. But recently, I dared myself to watch a whole bunch of controversial and weird movies that I otherwise perhaps wouldn't be all that into, so I finally gave The Human Centipede a shot.And to my astonishment, I really really liked it! The biggest part in it played the main villain, doctor Heiter, who was just amazing. There are many movies that are sorta ok, but you just can't get into them because there is no character in them that you really like, or find interesting enough to follow around. Not in this one! Doctor Heiter is a character I fell in love with immediately, he was just so delightfully creepy, weird, evil and completely batshit insane in a really entertaining way, almost like a comic book or an anime villain, it's hard to explain to people who haven't seen for themselves. This guy and his great yet bizzare acting really makes this film worth seeing in my opinion. To dispel your worries I have to say, the movie wasn't nearly as explicit as the concept would suggest. You can never actually see the anus being sawn to mouth, you can't see much of the operation at all, and the finished centipede people are wearing sort of diapers that cover both the anus and the mouth, so you can't see anything. The shit eating actually only took place once on screen, again with nothing being really visible and the scene ending rather abruptly (which I've actually been very grateful for because I've been dreading it all along).All in all, this reads more like a movie about an insane german psychopatic doctor who kidnapps three people and tortures them for no reason like a fucking maniac, than a movie about eating shit, which I was very pleasantly surprised to discover. Long story short, I was throroughly entertained throughout the whole movie and was not bored for a moment. People who give this movie low reviews are simply taking it too seriously, and are not relishing the absurdity and ridiculousness of it all. Watch this movie as a dark absurd comedy and you are set to go! Now I'm not really sure if I wanna give the sequels a watch, because without the dear doctor Heiter who unfortunately perished at the end of this movie, it just won't be the same, I'm afraid...",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
471,thekyraimani,DISTURBING...not sure if it's in a good or bad way!,5,20 April 2018,"I was wary of watching this film at first but I'm glad I exposed myself to it. This movie is more ""creepy"" than ""scary."" This is the kind of movie that will sit on your mind for days after you've watched it. Overall, a decent movie to watch if you're looking for a slow burn suspense film.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
472,jm-49844,Horrible just horrible,1,2 September 2018,"First off the whole movie was just stupid in my opinion and second there was no point in the movie. I can't believe they made this movie into a series. Why the hell would a guy capture two girls and a Japanese guy just to cut open certain body parts and connect them into a ""human centipede"". This is the worst movie I ever saw in my entire life.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

474,shivsm-95506,HORRIBLE & INHUMAN.,1,15 October 2018,"This is the worst concept for a movie ever seen. Just sadistic, inhuman & horrible. Writers thoughts stinks more than anything. Never watch this or make such thoughts.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
475,pfuhlsborn_on,Puuh... what a waste of...,1,25 October 2010,"This movie has it all: The crazy Nazi-surgeon, stupid American girls, freaky experiments, and stupid policemen, one of them apparently unable to speak or refusing to say something without seeing a paycheck. This could be actually a good B-Movie. But it is so frustrating serious and therefor just laughable dump. Not everything is bad, some of the acting is alright. Maybe it would have been even better, but you probably need a lot of time to convince the actors, they all that crap is happening and that this is actually working. If you have to spend a lot of time on that, there is not much time left for directing. The probably best feature is the camera-work. This person made really some descent shoots, although not very inspiring or creative, but all working very well. It still doesn't cover that the script could fit on the manual of a scalpel. Some of the shoots are just they toooooo long to bring the movie to its 90 minutes. Altogher: Boring, boring, boring, and very unnecessary, badly written, full of clichés, and nonsense.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
476,xrainbowsplashx,you may all hate me buuuut.,7,19 November 2010,"i must say i was impressed by this film. in the beginning i wasn't so sure due to two younger girls trying to slut it up with their outfits, oh so suddenly get lost and get a flat tire. Of course the best idea would HAVE to get out of your car and walk :rolls eyes: into the woods and oh whats that?! finds a (of course a decent sized, and beautiful) home in the middle of no where. Oh my, safe at last. this TOTALLY seems like the best idea...ever. especially after sitting there seeing that picture on the wall of the babies..no not creepy at all. in fact hey..lets just drink this total strangers water because that too just screams FANTASTIC IDEA!!!! So OK, no lie..i was losing a bit of interest when it first started. After a little it caught my interest again when it stroke me that this is no ordinary ""horror"" film. Actually, you can cross off the quotation marks all together because in my honest opinion (oh i can see the angry mob with their torches already) i thought this was the perfect example of a horror film. I mean come on!!! Your not taking some dude in a mask and a knife with big ol boots on, doesn't speak a word..slowly stomping its way to you. You also don't have that monster horror and whatever else kind of horror i can think of. No, this to me brought that sense of fear, that sense of fear that i search for in movies. The same kind of fear that the ""Nightmare on elm st."" films brought me. That knowing that there is ""NO escape from this"" sense. doomed. I think another thing that caught my interest is life in general. How messed up people are in this world. Watching this film, i was really able to visualize someone in this day in age trying to pull this off. This movie was disturbing, messed up, but i think thats what made it shine. again it gave that fear, that fear thats very rare to find in a movie. and forgive me (i can smell the smoke from the angry mob burning my house down) if you can give that sense of fear, not only have you won me over, but you have also won the name of being a true horror film.",The Human Centipede (First Sequence)
