0,MartinHafer,Extremely over-indulgent but it has its moments,6,10 June 2007,"In some ways, seeing this film is a tad disturbing to me. First, the film has a pretty big budget and plenty of gloss--and this has the effect of muting Eddie Murphy's natural comedic talents. Second, while it's obvious that he and his buddy Arsenio had a great time making this film, I felt like I was watching an inside joke and just didn't see what all the hubbub was about, as the movie made huge bucks at the box office. While there were some decent moments here and there, it just seemed like Murphy was standing around smiling at the camera expecting to be loved and adored instead of being funny. This was especially true during the scenes where he and Arsenio played multiple roles--it just wasn't all that funny.",Coming to America
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Likable film, Murphy shines",8,25 September 2010,"I don't think it is John Landis's best film or anything, but there are a lot of very likable things about this film. I agree that when the film slows down, some the jokes do too and the pacing lags slightly then. That said, it is confidently directed, has a sweet story and the jokes that work do outweigh the ones that don't quite. The film looks good too, with some interesting locations and lush cinematography and the soundtrack is memorable. Eddie Murphy does a fine job carrying the film and manages to be very likable, not to mention some fun cameos of his courtesy of clever make-up. Arsenio Hall is good too, and it is wonderful to see James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair again, same with scene stealers Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy. So in conclusion, I like Coming to America very much, and Murphy does shine here. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Coming to America
2,SnoopyStyle,simple fun,7,14 June 2016,Prince Akeem Joffer (Eddie Murphy) is the pampered heir to the throne of Zamunda. He is restless especially with his parents arranging his marriage. He wants to meet someone with a mind of her own. King Jaffe Joffer (James Earl Jones) assumes he wants to sow his wild oats and sends him off for a 40 day trip. He chooses to go to Queens with his best friend Semmi (Arsenio Hall). They pretend to be African students and get fast food jobs.It is simple fun. The characters are fun. It's the first time Murphy is doing his multiple character thing in a movie and it feels fresh. He and Arsenio have great chemistry together. The romance isn't quite as compelling. This is a simple story which follows a very standard formula. It's not breaking any rules and everybody has a good time.,Coming to America
3,kosmasp,Queens and Princes,8,7 March 2021,"In Germany the movie is called Prince from Zamunda (and the sequel just got a 2 added to the title). And that Prince being played by none other than Eddie Murphy. Back when I was little when I watched Eddie Murphy movies, I always saw them dubbed in German. He has quite the high pitched voice, which may or may not have certain ... meaning, but let's not delve into what they were doing back in the day and how this can be viewed nowadays.I've never been to New York, but like the Prince it is a dream of mine. He did realize that dream - and probably had a similar stay as I would have! Me because I wouldn't have any money, he because he wanted to get away from all the privileges and see what ""real life"" is like. Which also includes working and bathing himself (a joke that is quite sexual and has the nudity that was one of the factors that led to the R rating).Arsenio Hall and Eddie Murphy both play many roles in this and have quite some fun (even in drag, which gets sort of reprised in the sequel for an inciting incident). Generally speaking there are quite a lot of good people here - and knowing that Wesley Snipes almost got the role of Eddies nemesis in this movie is more than funny. It worked out for everybody though.The movie is not entirely PC, but Eddies character really going out of his way to empower women and what their role in society/Zamunda. The opening shot looked like a matte painting and then we get dragged into the palace with quite a skillful shot ... John Landis as you know and expect from him.A nice throwback to the 80s (hairstyles and such), although some parts of New York probably still look like this. There are other people who are better judges on that. Good comedy, if you are not too easily offended",Coming to America
4,jboothmillard,Coming to America,6,4 May 2007,"A good example of the black comedic (sometimes) loud-mouthed comedic actor's early roles, heading towards The Nutty Professor, from director John Landis (An American Werewolf in London). Basically on his 21st birthday, Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) of Zamunda, after wanting independence and a near marriage to an unknown woman, he rebels against his father, King Jaffe Joffer (James Earl Jones) and takes his sidekick Semmi (Arsenio Hall) with him to New York to find a wife. He does not understand the American culture, but when he eventually sees the woman he is interested in meeting, he goes to work at McDonald's rival restaurant McDowell's for her father, Cleo McDowell (John Amos), owner of McDonald's rival McDowell's. He has many dates with Lisa McDowell (Shari Headley), and Semmi meanwhile gets with Patrice (Allison Dean), but neither girls know of their true identities. It is pretty much when Akeem has fallen for Lisa that, after a telegram, the King and Queen Aoleon (Madge Sinclair) come looking for him. It has a great happy ending though, when after finding out he is a Prince, she marries him, and accepts the lifestyle. Murphy also plays Clarence, Randy Watson and Saul, and Hall also plays Extremely Ugly Girl, Morris and Reverend Brown. Also starring Paul Bates as Oha, Eriq La Salle as Darryl Jenks, Frankie Faison as Landlord, Vanessa Bell Calloway as Imani Izzi, Louie Anderson as Maurice, and cameos by (then unknown) Samuel L. Jackson as Hold-Up Man, Homeward Bound's Don Ameche as Mortimer Duke, (then unknown) Cuba Gooding Jr. as Boy Getting Haircut and Jim Abrahams as Face on Cutting Room Floor. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Costume Design and Best Makeup. Good!",Coming to America
5,blanche-2,Murphy at his peak,7,30 May 2009,"""Coming to America,"" made in 1988, is one of Eddie Murphy's best films, about a pampered African prince who decides to search for his wife in Queens, New York. Right there, the concept is great.Akeem (Murphy) decides he doesn't want the arranged marriage the King (James Earl Jones) has arranged for him. Though his intended is gorgeous, she has been raised to be his wife, has no interests of her own and no thoughts of her own - everything is predicated on what he wants. Akeem wants to experience a life without luxury and a woman with some original thoughts; his father agrees to let him travel for six weeks. He and his servant (Arsenio Hall) go to New York, where they live in a horrible apartment house in Queens. Attracted to a woman, Lisa MacDowell, (Shari Headley) whom he sees at a church meeting, Akeem takes a job as clean-up and garbage person at her father's (John Amos) restaurant, where Lisa works in the office - McDowell's. McDowell's looks exactly like McDonald's and is under investigation for trademark infringement, though there isn't any - don't like the yellow M fool you - McDonald's has a Big Mac and McDowell's has a BIG MICK.There are some hilarious parts of this film, the funniest for me being the introduction of Akeem's wife to be. There's a dance done by dozens of women - frantic and long - until they finally fall to the floor in submission and make a path for the bride to be. She's in a gold sequined gown with a train that goes out to the street. The other scene that cracked me up was James Earl Jones' appearance in New York wearing what can only be described as a lion fur, complete with the head.Old-timers will love the bums who get the big handout from Murphy.Murphy is hilarious, but his real genius is in the minor characters he plays throughout the film where he's unrecognizable. He's joined in this by Hall, who for the size of part he has, doesn't have a lot of lines.I'm not sure what happened to Murphy's career - he certainly made some wonderful movies - his role in ""Dreamgirls"" was a different turn for him, and very successful. He is a tremendous talent whose films for the most part lately haven't matched his abilities.See this one.",Coming to America
6,Quinoa1984,Possibly Murphy's best film,10,1 March 2001,"Sure Eddie Murphy has triumphed in The Nutty Professor and even in the underlooked Bowfinger, but I think Coming To America might just be his finest work (considering Beverly Hills Cop III).  The story has Murphy as a African prince who decided to go to America (where else would be go- Queens, NY) with another prince type guy, played by Arsenio Hall, as Murphy look's for a wife.  At times, I almost thought it would be like Arthur, but it isn't much like it though, thanks to multiple roles.  In fact, Murphy and Hall have so much fun playing there characters (the barber shop scenes include some of Murphy and Hall's best stuff) that it is worth looking at through a few flaws.  Favorite line- You should change of the name outside to the 3 putzs.  A",Coming to America
7,tavm,"Eddie Murphy plays a really sweet character, for once, in Coming to America",9,18 February 2012,"Before this movie, Eddie Murphy mostly played smart-ass guys who said a lot of profane things which was very evident in his stand-up programs as well. Here he plays Prince Akeem who seems the be the sweetest person who's only use of the f-word-or any other dirty one-was in greeting his Queens neighbors in mistakenly thinking they're warmly greeting him. This was Murphy at his most charming and charismatic. So we want him to get the girl here and Shari Headley is so charming as the leading lady. And Arsenio Hall was perfect as his sidekick Semmi. Actually, both Murphy and Hall do some other characters that are also very funny. And besides them, there's also James Earl Jones, Madge Sinclair, and John Amos to round out the compelling veterans in the supporting cast among newcomers like Samuel L. Jackson and Eriq La Salle and Louie Anderson. What else, well since Eddie and director John Landis were also involved in Trading Places, there's an appearance of a couple of that movie's players that was another bright spot in the picture. Really, all I'll now say is if you haven't seen Coming to America, what are you waiting for? Watch it!",Coming to America

9,hitchcockthelegend,"Just tell me you didn't love me when you thought I was a goat herder, and I will never bother you ever again.",5,7 September 2012,"Coming to America is directed by John Landis and adapted to screenplay by David Sheffield and Barry W. Blaustein from a story originally created by Art Buchwald. It stars Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones, Shari Headley and John Amos. Music is scored by Nile Rodgers and cinematography by Sol Negrin and Woody Omens. Plot finds Murphy as Akeem Joffer, an African prince who comes to the United States in the hope of finding a good woman he can marry.Released at a time when Eddie Murphy was ruling the 80s, Coming to America proves to be viable material for Murphy's talents. That's not to say it's a great film, a good one? Debatable now, and it was for sure a success at the box office, but it feels like a lazy excuse for some one liners and the picture hangs on a flimsy premise thread. As a whole it barely works as a romantic comedy (in fact the romance is distinctly tepid), but as a series of comedy set-ups for Murphy and Arsenio it does entertain the nostalgists and those who like immature gags. You do feel that with director Landis stating that Murphy was a pain on set-that Eddie had lost the zest and the willingness to learn that he had on Trading Places five years earlier, that Murphy didn't let Landis produce the picture the director originally envisaged.No doubt about it, I liked the film much better back in the day, back then the fish out of water comedy hadn't been done to death, and of course Murphy was still coasting in on the wave of charismatic success, which to myself and many others was enough to warrant being in his company. However, watching it now it feels tired and weary, the one film in Murphy's 80s comedy output that doesn't hold up, a chore to get through at nearly two hours in length, many comedy sequences stretched too far (the multi character gimmick played by the leads runs out of steam), an indulgence to ride in on the appeal of the film's two stars. The film actually marks a turning point for Murphy, he would follow this film with eight years of cinema mediocrity, something which I do believe lends Murphy fans to praise Coming to America far higher than they should.It's certainly not a stinker, not at all. There is occasionally fun to be had, some well written gags, honest intentions to create a charming characterisation for the people. While a cameo appearance by a future star is always worth watching. But in the minority as I am about it, and I do consider myself a Murphy fan, I have to say the film smacks of cheating and laziness, and no amount of penis gags can alter how I now feel about it. I'm off to cuddle my copies of Trading Places, 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop. 5/10",Coming to America
10,Boba_Fett1138,An original comedy with Eddie Murphy in top-form.,8,23 February 2006,"""Coming to America"" has got to be one of my personal most watched comedies. I just always loved watching this movie. It has got a great and original story and some great characters in it, played by some good comical talents.Best decade for Eddie Murphy were without doubt the '80's. He was original and fresh back then and he made some great other movies such as ""48 Hrs."" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"". His comical talent shined truly the most back then. In this movie he also is in top-form, with his eternal wide smile on his face. He plays his character with lots of originality and humor. Beside the main part, Murphy also plays some other characters in the movie. Due to the Rick Baker special make-up, he is completely unrecognizable in his other roles. The supporting cast of the movie is also really solid. Arsenio Hall is really great and funny in his role and he has some excellent sense of timing. Whatever went wrong with his acting-career? James Earl Jones is also truly unforgettable as the king. Other strong roles are being portrayed by; John Amos, Madge Sinclair and Eriq La Salle. Samuel L. Jackson also shows up in one of his very first movie-roles. It might sound cliché now but his talent already really shined in the one very short scene that he is in. He really made a great strong and lasting impression. Another well known actor that shows up in his very first movie-roles in this movie is Cuba Gooding Jr..It are really the characters and the actors that portray them that make this movie a bit of a classic one. It's a great comedy with some great humorous sequences in it and with a fun ""Trading Places""-, another John Landis and Eddie Murphy movie, reference in it as well.This is an excellent fresh original comedy to watch, mainly due to Eddie Murphy who really was in top-form. Even if you're not too fond of '80's comedies in general, this is a perfectly watchable and recommendable movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Coming to America
11,Uriah43,In Search of a Princess in the Borough of Queens,7,15 November 2019,"As the sole heir to the throne of the African kingdom of Zamunda, ""Prince Akeem"" has a problem in that his father ""King Jaffe Joffer"" (James Earl Jones) has arraigned for him to be married to a young woman he has never met. And even though his bride is certainly beautiful enough, as his wedding date approaches he becomes even more uneasy. So when he is finally introduced to her at the royal engagement ceremony he decides take matters into his own hands and talk to his father about the situation. However, rather than cancelling the wedding-as Prince Akeem had hoped-King Joffer only partially relents and allows him to travel abroad for a month or so to ""sow his royal oats"" before returning to wed his prechosen bride. What the king doesn't know, however, is that Prince Akeem has a totally different idea in mind in that he plans to use this time to find his own wife. And although he has never been there he decides that there is only one place to go to find such a mate worthy of a throne than, quite naturally, the borough of Queens in New York City! Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I enjoyed this film due in large part to the acting of both Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall (as his loyal friend ""Semmi"") who played their parts in a thoroughly amusing manner. On that note, it should also be mentioned that the two of them also took on several additional roles which were equally hilarious in their own right as well. In any case, those viewers interested in a good comedy might want to check out this particular film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Coming to America
12,HotToastyRag,Cute 80s classic,7,1 September 2021,"Eddie Murphy stars as an African prince visiting America for the first time in this classic 1980s comedy. There are lots of jokes making fun of his foreign background, but then again, there's a lot of sarcasm about how great America is as well. He thinks it's going to be a wonderful world full of kind people making their dreams come true - and instead, he travels to New York City.If you missed this one in 1988, you can check out the recent sequel or you can put on your retro goggles and stick with the original. This movie definitely feels dated, but if you like Eddie's humor, you'll probably still love it. It's pretty silly, so if you'd rather see him in a more sophisticated comedy, rent The Distinguished Gentleman. You'll see James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair as his parents, the king and queen, and Shari Headley plays his American love interest. Both Eddie and his sidekick Arsenio Hall play multiple parts throughout the film, which is always fun to try and spot them through different disguises. And in an adorable cameo, Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy surprise the audience by reprising their roles from Trading Places. If you haven't seen that comedy first, you won't get the humor, but then again how many people haven't seen it?",Coming to America
13,FlashCallahan,Looks like a Bulldog....,10,24 July 2011,"It is the 21st birthday of Prince Akeem of Zamunda and he is to marry a woman he never saw before.Now the prince breaks with tradition and travels to America to look for the love of his life....This film was the last highpoint of Murphy's career as the lovable sweary character, any highs after this were from wearing fat suits or talking to animals, But this is the Murphy that made him famous, from breaking the fourth wall to playing more than one character, Coming to America has it all.Easily his most accessible film after BHC, Murphy exudes charisma as the humble Prince looking to find love. As always the story is simple and leaves room for some of the funniest skits ever seen in a Murphy movie.It's almost as is Sandler has broken onto the set with characters like Randy Watson and his band sexual chocolate, and the scene at My T Kutz where they are discussing how old Joe Leis is.Murphy is flawless, and has great support from Jones, Amos, Hall, and the rest of the supporting cast.It's almost spoof like the way Landis has made it, but thanks to clever narration, it sticks to the story, rather than becoming a series of sketches. There is a wonderful reference to trading places, and the film will not only have you laughing, but leave you with a big smile on your face.One of Murphys best movies, and one of the most influential comedies of the eighties.",Coming to America
14,Aaron1375,I just did not think it ran well on all cylinders.,5,1 July 2008,"This Eddie Murphy comedy was somewhat funny at times, but I don't know...for me it missed the mark. Started out relatively strong, but faded in the end when it got a bit to sentimental, which admittedly a lot of comedies tend to do. The story has Murphy as a Prince who is to be married to a woman who has been groomed to be his bride by following his every command. Eddie's character does not want this though, he yearns to find real love so he is off to America a place where not everyone knows who he is to find Mrs. Right as it were. He gets a job as a worker at a McDonald's rip off type joint (which to me is the funniest parts of the movie) and falls for the daughter of the man who runs this establishment all the while keeping his identity as a prince a secret. Arsenio is rather good as his faithful traveling companion as is most of the cast. They are not the problem, the fact this movie tends to lag is. Slow lengths of the film where there is not all that much funny stuff going on, the movie is under two hours, but feels more like a two and a half hour movie. I say I would have liked it more had they trimmed it down ten or so minutes and kept the laughs going throughout the whole movie as they were the first part of it.",Coming to America
15,Wuchakk,My all-time favorite comedy,10,14 March 2014,"In ""Coming to America"" (1988) Eddie Murphy plays the likable prince of a rich African kingdom, Akeem. He comes to Queens to find his future queen accompanied by his best friend & servant, Semmi, played by Arsenio Hall. He understandably wants a wife who will love him for who he is and not for his great riches. So they get hired at McDowell's, a McDonald's knock-off, where he meets the shining daughter of the owner (Shari Headley). Is she the one? Will she find a fast-food mop boy appealing enough to marry? As noted in my title blurb, ""Coming to America"" is my all-time favorite comedy. Why? Simply because it's a laugh-riot from beginning to end. The first time I saw it was on TV in 2000 and I couldn't stop laughing; I saw it again last night (after purchasing it) and it had the same effect.Everything works here -- the characters, the jokes, the story -- to make ""Coming to America"" one of the greatest comedies ever made.GRADE: A+",Coming to America

I rewatched it to set up the mood for the sequel that just came out so many years later and that I will watch tomorrow. The first one is still funny, maybe not as funny as the first time I watched it but still good enough to entertain me. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall both play four different characters and credits to the makeup artists that did a good job changing their looks completely. The movie got nominated at the Oscars for Best Costume Design and Best Make up. Maybe not really Oscar material but they did a good job altogether. The story is enjoyable to watch, maybe a bit simple but then again it's a simple movie.

17,Mr-Fusion,One of Eddie Murphy's best,8,20 December 2013,"Were it not for the lousy ""Beverly Hills Cop III"", John Landis and Eddie Murphy would've pulled off a wicked hat trick of awesome movies. But we still have ""Trading Places"" and ""Coming to America"", the latter of which remains a sterling example of both a director and star who know what the hell they're doing. Murphy gets the chance to show off his comedic wit and his ever-likable persona as the unhappy African prince who goes to America in search of true love. Both Murphy and Arsenio Hall hold a masterclass in playing an array of different characters in the same scene, resulting in a number of setups that keep ""Coming to America"" very memorable and . . . nay, a classic. This is a genuinely funny movie with great performances all around (not least of which from John Amos, Eriq La Salle and James Earl Jones), and loads of comedic bits.Fantastic movie.8.5/10",Coming to America

What can I say? I had to rent it and see it for myself, after all, this was the decade where Eddie was king of comedy. I have to say that my friends were right this was just a really funny and enjoyable movie. We have Eddie as the lead and John Landis directing, there is no wrong. Well, that's wrong of me to say, just love these two guys. But is the movie as good as everyone says it is? I did laugh and have a good time, this was something original for it's time and just had a good time entertaining the audience.Akeem Joffer, the prince and heir to the throne of the African country Zamunda, is discontented with being pampered all his life. The final straw is when his parents present him with a bride-to-be he has never met before, trained to obey mindlessly his every command. Akeem concocts a plan to travel to America to find a wife he can both love and respect. He and his servant & friend Semmi arrive in Queens , New York, and after several scrapes, find an apartment. They begin working at a local restaurant called McDowell's passing themselves off as students. Akeem falls in love with Lisa, Mr. McDowell's daughter, who possesses the qualities the prince is looking for. The rest of the film centers on Akeem's attempts to win Lisa's hand in marriage, while adjusting to life in America and dodging his royal duties and prerogatives.I know everyone loves the line ""the royal penis is clean"" but my favorite that had me on the floor is when Prince Akeem has moved to Queens and he's all excited, goes outside to scream good morning to everyone and some guy says ""F you!"" and the Prince doesn't realize that it's actually an insult and screams ""Yes! Yes! F you too!"". Trading Places is one of my favorite comedies of all time and I loved that John Landis included the Duke brothers joke into the movie, I nearly died laughing, but there is a flaw in that joke. Unfortunately for those who hadn't seen the movie would not get that joke and John should have taken that into consideration. But I really did enjoy this film, I'm really glad that my friends wouldn't stop teasing me that drove me to see Coming to America, this is the Eddie Murphy that I will always be happy to watch.8/10",Coming to America
20,sddavis63,One Of Eddie Murphy's Finest,9,23 September 2002,"I know this is going to put me in the minority, but I am not at all a big fan of Eddie Murphy's over the top and in your face style of comedy. In fact, in many of his movies I find him to be vaguely irritating. That is not at all the case, however, with ""Coming To America,"" which - in my view - must surely rank as one of his best efforts.In this movie, Murphy adopts a deliberately low-key and somewhat innocent style of comedy as Prince Akeem of ""Zamunda,"" which serves to make him all the funnier. Akeem travels to America in search of a bride, after rejecting the arranged choice of his parents, the King and Queen (the great James Earl Jones - who was perfectly cast as the King - and Madge Sinclair respectively.) He decides that the appropriate place to find a bride who will eventually be Queen of Zamunda is, of course, Queens, N.Y. - and the story takes off from there. There is a stellar cast of primarily black actors. In addition to Murphy, Jones and Sinclair, we see established actors such as John Amos (in a very funny role as the father of Akeem's love interest) and Arsenio Hall as Akeem's servant. Also interesting are somewhat early views of then (1988) lesser know black actors such as Samuel L. Jackson, Vondie Curtis-Hall and Eriq LaSalle. Shari Headley (with whom I was unfamiliar) does a reasonably good job as Lisa, who Akeem falls in love with.There are not many weaknesses to this movie. Unfortunately, Murphy slips back into his more outrageous style playing a couple of lesser characters who hang out at the local barber shop and, as I often find with Murphy, I found those scenes irritating. But as Akeem he was wonderful. Headley's performance didn't blow me away, although it wasn't bad, and the scene in which Akeem and Semmi (Hall) seem to ""interview"" prospective brides in a Queens bar started out humorous, but got old very quickly. Minor quibbles, though. This is a very funny movie.9/10",Coming to America

Not going to watch the other one tonight as I was planning to watch them Back2Back because damn, they're both right at 2-hours and at least this one really, REALLY should've been 90 minutes. (Can't judge the 2nd one yet.)It was fine. Some jokes made me laugh, but they were so few and far between. Mostly it was a lot of dead air in a script SOOOO incredibly A-B-C there wasn't a single surprise or shock to the very last minute. EVEN for 1988 this felt very formulaic.Prince Murphy of Zakanda is (insert title) to find a bride instead of entering into an arranged marriage per his culture's tradition. His father, Mufasa, gives him 40 days to find his love and guess where this is headed.It's cute and harmless. I understand it's Eddie Murphy, so he'd want to be a bit raunchy for his fans back then. Eventually, he'd dive into wholesome family friendly films and probably make 10x more than his Rated R stuff. Not that I'm knocking the R-rating here, but with just a few minor edits, this could've 100% be a family and feel-good movie for all ages.My point: Either go big or go home. He just threw in the most minor adult scenes and language just to get that R. I would've loved it to embrace the R and pander 100% to his fans OR just edit out less than 1-2 minutes and PG it.For the most part, I'm an Eddie fan. Probably my favorite of his is The Nutty Professor, but he's been in plenty hilarious films. I'm just down the middle here with this one.

22,ElMaruecan82,Pure 80's fun ...,8,17 April 2012,"""Coming to America"" is one of these films that best exemplifies the 80's exuberance and unique appeal, it's raunchy and outrageous on the surface but sweet and good-hearted inside. And the film carries such a tender naivety in its portrayal of the fictional country of Zamunda and Royal Family's lifestyle that it makes today's films depressingly cynical in their desperate attempt to copy reality by any means or feature likable losers making their bones on redeeming bitches.Yes, a country like Zamunda is very improbable but that makes the beginning of the film so fascinating. That Prince Akeem, waking up on his 21st birthday, would be treated with such an exaggerated devotion echoes one of Cinema's greatest values: escapism and dream. It doesn't work in every case but here it does and for a simple reason: the ""Coming to America"" plot line perfectly contrasts with the ""Coming from Zamunda""set-up, Zamunda had to be in a total opposition with New York for the film's own comedic purposes. It doesn't avoid some clichés like the passing of zebras and elephants to show that the film is set in the African continent, yet it's one of these moments we remember the most from the film just before, as the trailer says, the fairy tale stops as soon as the first shot of New York City appears.""Coming to America"", directed by John Landis and starring Eddie Murphy, is in the same vein than their previous work in ""Trading Places"", a movie that I compared to Frank Capra's classics. Only this time, it's not a wags to riches story but quite the opposite, it's a Cinderella story told in reverse since it's the Prince Akeem who comes to America to marry a woman, and as he explains to his friend Semmi (Aresnio Hall) : ""I want a woman who will arouse my intellect as well as my loins"". This premise leads to a succession of situations so funny that you almost forget about the romantic purpose of Prince Akeem's trip and the presence of Arsenio Hall as the second lead of the film is responsible of that as he literally outshines all the other cast members and creates the perfect comic-straight man duo that this kind of stories need. Semi's priceless look from the window when Akeem shouts: ""Life. Real life! A thing that we have been denied for far too long!"" is the perfect counterpart to Akeem's naive enthusiasm as he joyfully gives the F-word back to an angry neighbor.After they find a place to live and a job, the whole New York's discovery part is a tribute to the actors' extraordinary talent to portray different characters from chatting barbers to drags, from singers to pervert reverends, they both nail their roles and we, as viewers, are invited to spot them every once in a while. Eddie Murphy is top notch as the old Jewish man in the barbershop, such an uncanny impression that I admit it fooled me the first time I saw it. The beauty of ""Coming to Africa"" is that it features two levels of true appreciation, one on the story and another through a series of sketch-like vignettes demonstrating two sides of the actors' talent, without overdoing them. In a way, ""Coming to America"" prefigures the appeal of Eddie Murphy's ""Nutty Professor"" and his wonderful talent as a comedian when given a good role, and Prince Akeem is one of his best. But to attribute the success of the film only on Eddie Murphy's talent would be untrue, and even more unfair.Another force of the film relies on the whole casting, starting with the perfect couple that could have ever played Akeem's parents: James Earl Jones as the authoritarian King Jaffe Joffe and Madge Sinclair as the most comprehensive mother but no less Queen Aoloan, both who'd team up later to play much ore memorable royal couple in a certain Disney film set in Africa. Both Jones and Sinclair possess a majestic and absolutely irresistible aura, and the powerful image of King Jaffe Joffe inspires an ominous sensation beautifully conveyed by the music that accompanies his own entrance in New York. The rest of the cast include another veteran actor, John Amos, as the McDowell restaurant chain owner, Shari Hadley as his beautiful daughter, Eriq La Salle as her soon-to-be ex-boyfriend, Samuel L. Jackson in his typical scene-stealing 80's supporting roles and it also features briefs but heart-warming cameos of Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy as  you know, and if you don't, well, make a guess.As a comedy and romance (not a romantic comedy, mind you) the film is not without some predictable situations, but it delivers what is expected, it's funny, it has a happy ending, and most of hits scenes can be watched regardless of their context. It's a great movie to watch and re-watch and its classical status can't be denied, since 24 years later after its release, the image of Murphy as the Old Jewish man, Arsenio Hall as a woman, the McDowell's logo and the unforgettable 'Soul Glo' will forever be associated with the 80's, a decade where movies were made just for fun and only for fun.",Coming to America
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Undeniably charming.,7,10 March 2021,"Though 'Coming To America (1988)' isn't exactly hilarious, the fish-out-of-water comedy has an undeniable charm to it, which is principally down to Murphy's effortlessly likeable lead performance. It follows the beats of its genre fairly closely, but it's still a satisfying overall package filled with charismatic characters and memorable moments. There isn't all that much else to say, really. It's just an enjoyable time. It's perhaps worth mentioning that its strong portrayal of Africa, Africans and, even, African-Americans was somewhat rare for its time (I mean, most modern movies are still lacking in this regard). Plus, despite some slightly misogynistic elements, the picture focuses on a man who wants to fall in love specifically with an intelligent, independent woman who will challenge him despite his royalty. That was pretty rare to see on-screen back then, too. 7/10",Coming to America
24,Cineanalyst,African-to-American Fairy Tale,8,11 February 2021,"Preceding ""Black Panther"" and Wakanda coming to the big screen by three decades and adopting the rom-com genre instead of that of the modern superhero burger, ""Coming to America"" and Zamunda is a delightful African-American fairy tale. Sure, much of the comedy is quite immature. Eddie Murphy, along with Arsenio Hall, seem to find the production to be largely an excuse to play multiple, heavily made-up parts as if participating in a series of SNL skits. And there's a prominent gag referencing Murphy's prior role in ""Trading Places"" (1983). Yet, the Ruritanian romance, but in Sub-Saharan Africa instead of the usual Hollywood fictional Europe, is such a wonderful piece of African-American fantasy that any minor deficiencies in the picture otherwise are easy to overlook.It's like an old-fashioned royal fairy tale. A prince and pauper, or reverse Cinderella, the prince pretending to be a commoner so to find a princess. The love triangle involving the other, unsuitable suitor. The fish-out-of-water culture clash. The framing of an African, or outsider, of long ancestral roots, perspective on America, specifically New York, along with such American staples as the not-McDonalds burger chain (and other, burger ""king""). Even the natural-vs-artificial hairstyle gags work well. It's a highlight of Murphy's career, and I eagerly await the sequel (even if they do replace those charming, if obvious, matte paintings of the castle with CGI), with expectations having only been raised by Murphy's prior comeback entry of the hilariously reflexive ""Dolemite Is My Name"" (2019). The supporting cast here is good, too, including Hall, James Earl Jones who is perfect as the king, Madge Sinclair as queen, that pretty ""ER"" doctor (Eriq La Salle) as the rival knight, and even Samuel L. Jackson popping in to shoot a shotgun and cuss the place up. This '80s classic holds up well.",Coming to America

27,Irishchatter,Good Eddie Murphy movie!,8,19 February 2016,"Even though I'm not a big big fan of Eddie Murphy, I think this one he did, was actually pretty good. Now what put me off with this movie was the fact, at the beginning, breasts were shown even when they were needed to. I know I'm a woman and proud to have breasts, however, I just wouldn't consider showing them off in PG. I just think it's rather pointless since its not all to do with porn! That's why it lost 2 stars from me.Anyways I really liked the way the story went. It's different and looks refreshing, I mean like c'mon this was 1980's and it's now 2016, to me it just looks like a fresh new movie! It's one of the movies that makes me felt that way for no absolute reason!Shari Headley was such an amazing actress. I really liked her beautiful pink dress in the end. I reckon, it does really make you feel like a princess when wearing it, it is so long! Seriously, it is stunning on her, I'm jealous!It's a good movie with a few laughs and I think it's fair that I give this a 8/10 rating....",Coming to America
28,ironhorse_iv,This movie makes you feel royalty,7,21 March 2013,"This movie is so rich with funny scenes that you can't help feeling good about yourself after watching this movie. There are so many gems in this movie from the ""She's Your Queen"" song, the McDowell's vs. McDonald's shtick, to the preacher relating a bikini pageant to God's creation. There is countless amounts of funny humor. Coming to America stars Eddie Murphy as Akeem. Akeem is an African prince from the made up country of Zamunda. The depiction of Zamunda was hilarious, and I'm floored that some critics took it serious due to it making fun of Africans natures. First off, the portrayal of Africa is nothing like Africa itself and I think we all know that not all African women are subservient and are only interested in wealth. Yes, the African culture stresses obedience among other things but there is a fine line between being obedient and being subservient. Let's note that the portrayed is very fictitious, so don't get too serious about this. Most people who saw this film surely know that many African countries suffer from dire poverty, so some people might not find the story of a fabulously wealthy ""African Prince"" aristocrat going to America, not interesting. The reason for this is that Zamunda is based on the country of Zaire. Akeem's father, King Jaffe Joffer (James Earl Jones) the cap and lion pelt sash wearing king is modeled on Mobutu Sese Seko who ruled the country of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) from 1965 until shortly before his death in 1997, was one of the most evil dictators of the 20th Century, right up there with Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and Idi Amin. The idea of a popular movie glorifying this level of theft, treating it as an object of amusement, is nauseating to some. Still the movie is interesting. Akeem go to Queen to avoid a loveless, arranged marriage and find a wife whom he can respect for her intelligence, non-materialistic and independent. That's so funny in a way, because how he misunderstood that by going to Queens that we will find a royal type woman. He will give up all his wealth and stand up to his domineering family in the name of freedom to feel disconnect in America due to the fresh off the boat misunderstanding of everything, and getting into all kinds of ridiculous situations with being an immigrant in America. Eddie Murphy's playing of the pampered prince was equally funny as Murphy manages to look smug and naive at the same time. I could easily understand his need to get away from the Royal Family and see what some other part of the world was like. Akeem and his sidekick Semi (Arsenio Hall) get mediocre jobs at a McDonald's rip off, McDowell and meet some interesting characters on the way. Characters like Lisa McDowell (Shari Headley) and her father Cleo (John Amos). Star spotters will have a field day locating Cuba Gooding Jr., Donna Summer, Louie Anderson, Eriq La Salle and Samuel L. Jackson in their minuscule supporting roles. Not only those Murphy and Hall play the two main characters, but countless amounts of sub characters in makeup. The make up on this film is amazing. Eddie Murphy was Clarence the barber and horrible singer Randy Watson. Believe it or not, the Jewish guy is also Eddie Murphy. Mind blown. Hall was also Morris the barber and Reverend Brown in the film. The movie was light and frivolous, just as expected. Gags were aplenty. The acting bordered on corny, but that's common in comedies. I left the video wondering if Queens was actually that bad or if it was just all part of the joke. Good funny movie and a very sweet story, made at the peak of Murphy's popularity. Check it out.",Coming to America
29,The-Sarkologist,This is one good Eddie Murphy movie,8,18 November 2011,"This movie is famous because of the number of characters that Eddie Murphy and Asinio Hall manage to play. It is not that this is something new, but rather the make up is so well done that you cannot even recognise them. One character that Murphy plays is in fact white, and when I suggested to my friend that this was Murphy, his reply was - it can't be, he's white! The basic plot is simple. Murphy is Adeeb, the heir to the throne of an obscenely rich African country and he is going to be married to a woman whom he had not known until she was presented to him on his 21st birthday. He has had everything done for him since he was a kid and is getting sick of it. When he learns that his wife to be's opinion is tailored so that everything he likes, she likes, he gets fed up and decides to go on a trip. His father thinks that it is to sow his wild oats, but he wants to find a wife. So he takes his servant, and goes to Queens in New York because, logically thinking, that is where he is going to find his queen. Moreso, he wants to live like a pauper and hires the grungiest flat available and gets a job as a floor mopper at McDowells, a restaurant that is very similar to a certain other restaurant which shall remain unnamed so as to protect me for defamation.The plot and themes aren't deep, but that is not why I watch these movies. I watch them because Murphy has a cool sense of humour. He plays Adeeb, a naive African prince really well, and he plays the other characters even better. The barber shop scene is the highlight of this character swapping, even though he also plays the lead singer of a band called Sexual Chocolate.The movie is very formulaic with the beautiful woman that Adeeb loves and the horrid, slimy boyfriend. In the end, as can be expected, she decides to marry him. This is not what I am interested in, but rather the spice that Murphy adds to his movie. Also the tie-in with Trading Places is also quite cool.",Coming to America

31,johnnyboyz,Does enough with its humour and its sweet narrative but do not expect anything more than mere good fun.,6,24 April 2008,"How much do we know about Africa? How much do filmmakers know about Africa? Recent films like Blood Diamond and Sahara with their ideas that Africa is either one large desert with corrupt officials poisoning water supplies or either a series of villages getting liquidised and a massive slave trade as they work for their lives uncovering diamonds are the sorts that would probably do enough to discourage you from ever going. Then you have African films and films made by recently deceased director Ousmane Sembene, who set his last film Moolaadé in an actual village; away from disease, liquidation and poison water  maybe it's the sort of place travel enthusiasts would love to go to and just get lost within for a week.Then there is Coming to America; a sweet and charming 1980s comedy made by the Americans about Africans quite literally coming to America  the ultimate fish out of the ultimate bowl. Director Landis clearly does not want to take sides when it comes to either ideas of representation or stereotypes. He shies away from Africa's problems (and I mean BIG problems given it was 1988) and instead focuses the African based action on the royals of fictional (surprise, surprise) country Zamunda and their routines and hardships. Prince Akeem's (Murphy) biggest worry in a standard day is not where the next meal or a clean drink of water is going to come from but the annoying flower petals that constantly get dropped at his feet throughout the day but he is also frustrated with his inability to live his own life.But Landis isn't stupid and uses the setting of Africa as a utopia full of beautiful female servants, waiters waiting on you every need and a palace complete with acres and acres of giraffe and elephant roaming garden only to compare in a drastic manner the situation America (New York's 'Queens' in particular) finds itself in; it is a brutal and quite powerful comparison between America as Americans know it, yet perhaps refuse to accept and a far off continent know as Africa. And so the prince of this heavenly kingdom grows tired of being pampering and grows some ideas that incorporate Freud's readings: the scene I question is when Akeem discusses moving away and breaking off from his parents' supervision (something all adults must do eventually) in a room that disturbingly resembles a child's nursery, what with its quite wallpapers and colourful surroundings.So instead of staying behind and risk becoming a perhaps less psychotic Norman Bates, Akeem travels to America with his good friend and royal supervisor Semmi (Hall). They are African's instead without everything to gain, nothing to loose but everything to loose and nothing to gain  but that's the way Akeem wants it and the experience of everyday life in a 'normal' living environment is set to do him some good. What follows is a standard but enjoyable and somewhat funny venture through someone's life via meeting people, getting jobs, meeting members of the opposite sex and most importantly to Akeem, living out. But this is where the humour and the manner in which Landis wants to sit on the fence or not becomes a little blurred. Most of the innocent humour is limited to jokes about royals: Queens, palace, kings, etc. but there seems to be some ill motivated gags revolving around a barber shop where three African Americans and a Jew hang around all day; discussing various things like who the best boxer to ever live was  the fact that Cassius Clay changed his name to Mohammed Ali seems to spark some sort of undertone and needless racism but Murphy's energetic delivery aids in the racism going under the radar. Maybe Landis was lucky he had such a performer to give that delivery.However familiar the routine is, the execution is fast and snappy which entertains. Boy meets girl, girl is already taken by someone else of a higher level and boy must win girl. The spin on this is that whoever watching might have been in that situation, Akeem's trump card the whole time is that he is a hundred times richer than the supposed already rich guy the girl is with. This situation in the past has had Akeem's caricature as a poor and unknown guy who must work his way up but the spin on the material here is refreshing. Then again, the nasty product placement in the form of McDowell's instead of McDonald's is sad even if it comes off as a spoof in both name, emblem and choice of meal. The film also dabbles into the lives of others working at the restaurant and one sad case's own America Dream as he attempts to work his way up the fast food chain's ladder into management. Coming to America's finale may seem a little formulated but it's just the motions being gone through. The racism may seem in bad taste what with the 'black awareness week' thrown in as well as the barber shop sequences but the film is uplifting and somewhat funny. I just wonder what royal themed location they would've chosen has the coin come up Los Angles: 'King Estates' in south L.A. perhaps?",Coming to America

He has lived in a lap of luxury by his king father(James Earl Jones) and his queen mother(Madge Sinclair, ""Trapper John, M.D."") The king was not only loyal, but somewhat very demeaning.

He goes out to America to find a bride. He and his servant Semmi(Arsenio Hall) goes out, and head for Queens, New York(My birthplace to be exact).

Then the go to this McDonald's knockoff ""McDowell's"" who's owner(John Amos) has a daughter(Shari Headley) who is seeing this Jeri-curled man(Eriq LaSalle, before ""ER"") who is big money and demeaning at the same time. To Akeem, love was a big deal to him, the wealth wouldn't make him any happier than he is. This movie is like the way of African royalty without the stereotypes.

The premise of the film sees a pampered prince head to America in an attempt to find a bride that he can truly love.Main Character
Eddie Murphy is a huge name in comedy and this film had his fingerprints all over it and he is fantastic. Prince Akeem is such a charming and charismatic person that it is hard not too root for him in this film and want to see him succeed. His character actually has some depth to him and it is interesting the way they handle him wanting to go to America and it sees him really grow as a person and Murphy is obviously funny and charming himself as he does that.Supporting Characters
Arsenio Hall plays his trusted advisor Semmi and I thought he was great also. These two just have such a great dynamic together and really bounce off of each other well, really it feels like a buddy comedy with these two funny guys who are having a good time together. Shari Headley plays Lisa and as the film progresses you see the dynamic between her and Akeem progress well and again they have good chemistry together and are a nice duo together that you are rooting for. James Earl Jones and John Amos play roles here as respective fathers of Akeem and Lisa and they are both really good, it's no surprise but they are delightful to watch here. Also there is a cameo from a now huge actor, if you don't know who then I won't spoil it but it had me laughing out loud.Story
The film has a nice and funny story, it is funny seeing Akeem & Semmi travel from Africa to America and just the different cultural shifts and the way they take things in stride is very funny and charming to see. Also the whole romance aspect is nice enough and you do end up rooting for the two protagonists, but it just feels a bit safe. No spoilers but this is a film that doesn't take too many risks and that isn't the biggest issue in the world but it doesn't throw many curveballs and it just feels very similar to plenty of other films from this time period and since.Script
The script is very good, the main job of a comedy is to make you laugh and I definitely laughed, maybe not hysterically but I laughed quite a bit here so it did that well. Also as I said the romance aspect is well handled and it is sweet and feels deserved.Style
The film has plenty of very funny jokes, it even pushes a few envelopes at times without feeling too much and that can be a difficult skill to master. But I think this film does have a bit of a pacing issue, it is 2 hours long and I am just not sure it had to be so long, I think like 10 mins could have been cut from the 2nd act and it would be much better and moved in a nicer flow.Overall
Overall, this is a great comedy and one that will make you laugh. If you like fun comedies with a sweet romance angle then give Coming to America a go and hopefully the sequel is at least of a similar ability.",Coming to America

He lives a life of luxury and is waited on hand and foot. His father King Jaffe Joffer (James Earl Jones) has selected a bride for Akeem to marry and expects Akeem to marry this lady due to it being tradition in the kingdom of Zumunda. However, Akeem is very much against this tradition of 'forced' marriage and wants to marry a bride that he truly loves. With the approval of his father, Akeem along with family servant Semmi (Arsenio Hall) both head to New York for a 40 day period. King Jaffe sends Akeem to New York so that he can 'sow' his oats and then he expects him to come back and marry the woman that he's selected. However, Akeem is determined to find a princess of his own choosing.This is another in a long line of 'fish out of water' comedies so it was never going to win any prizes for originality. However, the way that Coming to America creates the humour is very funny. Akeem and Semmi both arriving at the airport and saying to each other 'don't make it obvious to people that we're rich' whilst wandering around with huge gold chains round their necks and whilst carrying about 20 suitcases, Akeem stepping out in the road and shouting 'Halt' to the Taxi Driver, the scene where Akeem is asked to mop the floor and starts pushing the mop bucket round the floor whilst the mop is still in the bucket. All these scenes were really funny, but what I liked about it is that a lot of the humour was quite subtle rather than being 'in your face' humour.One big plus with this film is the whole premise itself; Akeem could continue living the life of luxury and continue to be waited on hand and foot, but that's not the life that he wants. In order to find his ideal wife he's prepared to slum it out in a rough neighbourhood in New York, do manual labour. He's also looking for a woman with intelligence, but he also looks for a woman with morals. It also really helps that Akeem is such a likable guy - he's wealthy, but is still generous and isn't arrogant. He's also caring and is also a very moral person. I really liked his character and when I saw him in ordinary clothes when he's in New York I almost forgot that he was a prince. The fact that Akeem is looking for a woman with intelligence and morals means that the romance angle of this film is already far less shallow than the romance that you'll see in most rom-coms (which is one of the reasons I normally avoid rom-coms). The blossoming romance between Akeem and Lisa (Shari Headley) was both touching and convincing and it just gave me a really 'warm' feeling inside whenever they shared screen time together.Murphy puts in a good performance which is far more restrained than what we are used to seeing from him. Hall is also good and the chemistry between him and Murphy was excellent. James Earl Jones probably gave the best performance and it was a good choice to cast him in the role of King Joffer - his booming, deep and commanding voice helps to give him a real sense of authority. This film also features Samuel L Jackson in a minor role before he hit the big time. Murphy also experiments with taking on multiple characters himself which is something that he also did later in his career in The Nutty Professor. He's a talented actor and Coming to America was probably about the time when he started to reach the end of his peak. It's a shame that he doesn't seem to enjoy the same amount of success that he achieved in the 80's as he is a really good actor.Coming to America is a wonderful film that is funny and touching at the same time. It's a predictable film, but it's also a 'feel good' film which put a big smile on my face when it finished. Definitely worth checking out.SIDE NOTE; There is a scene in Coming to America which links back to Trading Places which is another of John Landis' films. I won't say anymore than that, but I thought that this scene was really funny (although you'll need to have seen Trading Places to understand the joke).",Coming to America
46,r96sk,Good,7,5 March 2021,"I didn't enjoy it as much as expected, but 'Coming to America' is nevertheless still good.Eddie Murphy is unsurprisingly the star of the film. Any notable scenes include him, which isn't a shock given the obvious and the fact he plays a number of characters; on that note, only Akeem amused me - the barber shop guys... not so much, to be honest.James Earl Jones (Jaffe), John Amos (Cleo) and Frankie Faison (landlord) are the most noteworthy in terms of those away from the lead, while there is even an appearance from someone named Samuel L. Jackson - what ever happened to that guy?!I wanted/anticipated much stronger humour, if only due to Murphy's presence. I can't say I laughed that much, which is disappointing. The romance parts are probably more memorable to me, even if it's kinda familiar in those regards. With all that said, I can see why loads thoroughly enjoy this - it just didn't fully land on me, personally.Still worth viewing and I'm very much up to see the sequel.",Coming to America
47,gcd70,Light hearted fantasy/comedy,5,28 October 2007,"John Landis' fantasy-comedy is very light-hearted and thinly scripted. The story finds 'Prince Akeem of Zammundah' (Eddie Murphy) traveling to the United States with his assistant (Arsenio Hall) to find himself the ideal bride.The film can be a lot of fun, and sometimes funny, but one must not take proceedings at all seriously or ""Coming to America"" becomes corny and flat. Ultimately predictable, and with no substance, it may not be much of a movie. However, isn't it nice to see Eddie Murphy in a much tamer picture which has seriously toned down the language, even if it does pop up here and there.PS Look for the in-joke from ""Trading Places"". Very funny!Thursday, January 7, 1993 - Video",Coming to America
48,dworldeater,Classic Eddie Murphy,8,31 May 2020,"Although Trading Places is a much better film, the second collaboration between John Landis and Eddie Murphy is up there. Coming To America is an easy movie to like and while I met some younger people that have not seen it, I have yet to meet anyone that has seen Coming To America that didn't like it. It blends outrageous comedy, and romance and John Landis balances this all out by making this a good movie to boot with characters and story audiences can care about. It would be easy for this to get too over the top, but never does. Coming To America is very funny, but it is a romantic comedy as well, but does not get too sentimental to where it gets in the way of the comedy. Eddie's sidekick Arsenio Hall has great comedic chemistry with Eddie and is very funny in this film. I think Coming To America easily holds up and does what it does well enough to warrant a sequel after all these years that I can't wait to check out. The support cast did well too, I especially enjoyed both dads,James Earl Jones and John Amos who both starred in two of my favorite barbarian movies that came out the same year. In closing Coming To America is great entertainment with quotable dialogue and is one of the more memorable comedy blockbusters that came out in my youthful days.",Coming to America

The excellent cast involved really takes it a long way with good writing to help it along.It's admittedly not a very original story structure, so while it is not all that refreshingly unpredictable, but it's good to see a foreign royalty in an American setting, and an African one at that.I do think this is consistently funny and has maintained over 30 years, so definitely check this out if you haven't.",Coming to America
50,justin-fencsak,The movie that made Eddie Murphy king at the box office,10,3 March 2019,"Long before Black panther became the highest grossing black movie of all time, there was coming to America a modestly budgeted comedy starring nearly an all black cast and directed by John Landis. I was way too young to remember this film so I saw it on tv recently and laughed crazy like heck.",Coming to America
51,PredragReviews,"""What is this, velvet?""",9,8 May 2016,"Hilarious tale of an African prince named Akeem (Murphy) and his royal servant (Hall) who head off to the United States in search of the perfect Queen. After deciding to go to New York City (they saw that the city had a borough named ""Queens""), Akeem becomes a pauper in order to woo the perfect woman (Shari Headley) to become his wife. Although the film had many pre and post-production problems (director Landis almost walked off the set due to a fight with Murphy; Murphy was successfully sued by columnist Art Buchwald for ""stealing"" his idea of an African prince who goes in search of a wife) the final production is pure comic genius at it's best. Undeniabley, Murphy is the king of a thousand faces. Eddie Murphy gets a chance to deliver a more restrained performance with this film and he manages to do so very well.The film features many hilarious scenes and characters especially a group of boxing obsessed senior citizens who spend their days arguing with a barber shop owner. Murphy and Hall demonstrate their levels of versatility by managing to go under heavy makeup and portray several different costarring roles. This is an excellent film, well produced and flows beautifully from one scene to the next. The movie has a brilliant cast of African Americans. This is Eddie Murphy at his best with witty dialogue, good jokes and romance. If you like Eddie Murphy, and you like comedy, then this is a film not to be missed.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Coming to America

53,philip_vanderveken,Excellent humor and a nice story,7,10 April 2005,"I once used to be a fan of Eddie Murphy and his movies, but in recent years the only one of ""his"" movies that I loved was 'Shrek'. He's excellent as the voice of Donkey, but the rest of his movies aren't exactly the best examples of fine humor (think of movies like 'The Nutty Professor'). It's a good thing that from time to time you can still see one of his older ones on the television, so you won't forget that the man really has some talent.In this movie Eddie Murphy plays, most of the time, the role of Prince Akeem of Zamunda. On his 21st birthday he'll have to marry a woman he has never seen before. Because he isn't too happy with that and because he wants a wife that can do more than doing exactly what he tells her to do (like for instance barking like a dog), he decides to go to America to find the love of his life. The only problem is that the girl shouldn't love him for his title and his money, but for his personality. At first all he gets is a big culture shock, but eventually he'll find a girl he really likes...This movie is really one of the funniest Eddie Murphy has ever made. It has a good story and offers plenty of laughs, but this isn't a comedy full of toilet humor and may therefor seem dated to the youngest viewers (let's say those who were born in the nineties). Personally I really appreciated the fact that not all humor was about farting, vomiting and other bodily functions, but perhaps that's just me, perhaps I'm just getting too old to understand today's humor (almost 27 right now). There are some excellent parts in the movie (I really love those old men at the barber shop for instance) and overall the quality is high enough to enjoy the entire movie. That's why I give it a 7.5/10.",Coming to America
54,jellopuke,Occasionally great,7,7 April 2021,"Some of this movie is hilarious and really works well, but some of it is bogged down with a romantic subplot that Murphy never really nails. The fist out of water parts are gold, the rest not so much.",Coming to America
55,mike48128,Eddie Murphy in a Sweet Old Fashioned Love Story !,9,24 August 2014,"A real change of pace for Eddie Murphy! There are a few ""breasts"" and a lot of ""F"" words, (both cut for cable) but otherwise it is almost ""PG"" in nature. Incredibly rich and spoiled African Prince Akeem (Murphy)travels to America to Queens New York, and finds his true love, ""Lisa"", at, of all places, an imitation ""McDonald's"", owned by her greedy father! He is engaged to a gorgeous princess, but wants to marry for love. Also stars Arsenio Hall as Akeem's man-servant and traveling companion, and James Earl Jones as his rich father, an African King (Of course!). There's a lot going on in this movie: The ""Tribal Dance Number"" (choreographed by Paula Abdul) looks like it was performed on the same Paramount Soundstage as the ""Ethiopian"" dance scene from ""The 10 Commandments."" (Note the ""marble floor"".) Locations filmed in Queens and NYC. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall in several ""cameo"" roles as the Barber Shop characters, including Eddie playing the ""Jewish Kibitzer"". Jim Belushi in a gorilla suit! Outstanding but obviously ""phony"" African sets and matte paintings with wild animals running around everywhere! Very funny and clever, for the most part! (Without all the swearing, I would have given this movie a ""10""!)",Coming to America
56,Abdulxoxo,A classic in everyway,8,11 January 2021,"The story is told from the prince akim's point of view, focusing on his search for his ""Queen"". The story presents one comedic scene after another. Eddie's so engaging as the royal prince that you couldn't help but cheer as he overcame each obstacle. What makes his performance even more impressive is that he plays the other characters most notably the dudes in the barber shop. The romantic elements are very much alive and well. Eddie comes off quite convincing in his gentle wooing of his beautiful, charming and intelligent girl Lisa from Queens. Arsenio Hall's chemistry with Eddie also lends to some good laughs. The overall cast performance is terrific, the production/set design, cinematography and other technical values remain in the background, serving the narrative well.
A sequel is coming, I just hope they won't ruin it as I think this movie is perfect the way it is, it doesn't need any sequel. But judging from the trailer it kinda looks solid and all the original cast has returned. I can't wait.",Coming to America
57,mjw2305,Gotta love this off the wall comedy,7,29 December 2006,"Eddie Murphy is the Prince of Zamunda, he is very wealthy and very pampered. When he refuses to marry the bride his father has arranged for him, he goes to Queens to find his queen. With his closest companion (Arsenio Hall) they try to blend in with the everyday people of New York, taking jobs as cleaners in a local burger bar.The entire film is packed with slick gags, hilarious characters and delightful parody. Coming to American is a romantic comedy that entertains you again and again, and Eddie Murphy is on top form throughout.Recommended 7/10",Coming to America
58,Howlin Wolf,"Look out Queens, royalty of a different kind is on its way...",8,24 July 2007,"The 'Innocent Abroad' is a pretty standard device for a comedy, but for me what makes this example stand out is both Eddie Murphy's dedication to his craft and the fine gallery of supporting players that are on call to back him up. Of course, these days we know by now that Eddie isn't fazed at all by taking on multiple roles, but this is the film where arguably that tactic has paid off the most, and this initial success came relatively early in his career. Today when he tries it, the makeup is left to do the work but the jokes rely heavily on bodily functions. The bonus in this film is that the humour in ""Coming to America"" is largely cleverer, and yet the makeup is still terrific! So if you're expecting a reputed disaster of ""Norbit""-sized proportions, then you have nothing to fear.Joining in the fun are such familiar faces as John Amos in the role of the prospective father-in-law, and even a brief cameo role from a pre-fame Samuel L. Jackson that nestles alongside other well-known names and faces... For director Landis this represents something of a 'career plateau' too, as he has since struggled to be this contemporary or relevant again. A unique group produce big belly-laughs and a nice warm feeling, then. This is expertly constructed late-80's comedy.",Coming to America
59,oneguyrambling,For those who think that Murphy is either a talking donkey or actor in bad comedies.,9,27 December 2010,"It is 3 minutes and 45 seconds after the movie starts that the central character of Akeem, played by Eddie Murphy actually speaks. It is 45 seconds after that when the first joke is fired, not a great one it must be said (it's literally a toilet joke), but from that point on you don't go another 3 minutes 45 seconds without laughing, quite often not even 45 seconds.The beauty of Coming to America is that it relies on what is almost a threadbare plot and gives enough room for the actors to provide the funny, in the wrong (*cough* Sandler) hands lesser comedians (*cough* Schneider) could kill the film with their hamming (*snort* Ferrell) or lack of range (*ahem* ""Look at me, I'm down to Earth"" - Aniston).Luckily at this time Landis had Murphy in his prime, Arsenio as a great character actor and foil, and a bunch of bit part guys and dignified straight men (John Amos, James Earl Jones) willing to dumb down just a little.That threadbare plot involves the sole heir to the throne (Murphy) of a made up African nation going to America to find his bride, as he is not happy with the arranged marriage being prepared by his parents in his native land.The lushness of Akeem's situation is very clearly illustrated early on, he has dozens of people at his beck and call, barely does anything by and for himself, and has access to anything and anyone he chooses.His Father the King is James Earl Jones, and he clearly wants Akeem to follow tradition and accept his custom built new bride. When Akeem shows some trepidation the King agrees to let him take a break, thinking that a month away will let him ""clear his system"", or perhaps something less crude, so he will come back in a better frame of mind. Along for the ride is his faithful friend Semmi (Hall) so he has someone to talk to and to keep him out of trouble.Once in America, specifically New York, Akeem and Semmi seek to blend in. Early efforts don't go so well, which would generally be the case when wearing the GDP of some nations, and having more staff on hand than many multinational companies.After they manage to simplify matters by moving into a dingy apartment they get to the business of getting Akeem some tail. They hit every disco in town with no success, other than highlighting Murphy and Hall's talent for multiple roles and proving that every chick in New York is apparently nuts.The local barber points the boys in the direction of the Black Awareness Rally happening that night, and it is at that event that Akeem notices Lisa MacDowell (Shari Headley), a confident, intelligent and beautiful young woman who is the daughter of the caterer to the event.Search over. Only Lisa MacDowell does not know that Akeem exists, and he does not want to win her over with money and tales of ""don't you know who I am"". Besides that Lisa already has a boyfriend, the son of the Soul Glo empire named Darryl (Eric La Salle).Leo MacDowell (John Amos) runs a Macca's rip-off restaurant called MacDowells and Akeem and Semmi get jobs there as cleaners, never letting on their true backgrounds.Over time, Lisa acknowledges Akeem and they gradually seem to be getting nearer and nearer... then, just as things heat up Semmi and Leo meddle (Semmi 3X!) and stuff gets complicated.><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>< Now this is a comedy, and a damn good one, so aside from the factual stuff above it is hard to explain what happens without just recycling the jokes, and I ain't no Two & a Half Men writer. Suffice to say that Murphy and Hall play many roles each, often in the same scene, always to great effect, and that there is not too much dead space between laughs from the first scene through the last.When you have a million jokes being fired every which way they aren't all going to work and some fall a little flat or haven't dated extremely well in 20+ years, but no joke stands out as failing or as being embarrassing. Highlights include the Soul Glo jingle (still hilarious), the Black Awareness Rally performance by Randy Watson (Murphy) and emceed by the Reverend (Hall), and the early ""courting"" ceremony when Akeem first meets his (arranged) bride to be.Aside from the songs (the background music is great) this film hasn't dated a bit, despite the fact that I can't think of a single white guy in a lead role (aside from the lettuce-washer!) it shouldn't be taken as a ""black"" movie, Coming to America is simply a funny movie, period.I knock .5 of the score simply because the last 10 minutes lag just a tad, the first 100 odd minutes are comedic perfection and extremely rewatchable.Final Rating - 9.5 / 10. For everyone who thinks Eddie Murphy is a talking donkey (and hack actor) please watch this to see that at one time he was the best in the biz.",Coming to America

61,DunnDeeDaGreat,That boy Eddie Murphy good,10,11 February 2002,Coming to America is one of Eddie Murphy funniest films to date.

Arension Hall is also very funny as Eddie's sidekick. 10/10,Coming to America
62,brchthethird,Another slam dunk from Eddie Murphy,9,14 November 2014,"This is a hilarious, heartwarming comedy with Eddie Murphy at his peak (and playing multiple roles for the first time). The plot is rather simple: African prince leaves home to find in true love (in Queens, NY lol). However, what sets it apart from other fish-out-of-water comedies is the depth it gives the characters. The story isn't rushed, and it gives you time to spend with each character, so that you care about them, and what happens to them. I mentioned earlier that Eddie Murphy plays multiple roles (as well as Arsenio Hall, who also does a fantastic job). Here, he has four: one (obviously) as the main character Akeem, a soul/funk singer Randy Watson (who looks like a combination of Rick James and Kanye West), a loudmouthed barber and an old Jewish guy (completely unrecognizable, incredible makeup job). He even gives a distinct personality to each of his other characters, and elevates every scene he's in. Another great thing about this movie is the star-studded cast, from James Earl Jones to Samuel L. Jackson in a small role early in his career. Nobody is wasted, and everyone has their opportunity to shine. But more than anything, after this Eddie Murphy would never hit the comedic heights he did here. His film career arguably peaked here, although he would have a resurgence in the late 90's with The Nutty Professor and a couple others. Overall, this is a great movie experience the whole way through, and has a satisfying (if cliché) ending.",Coming to America
63,hall895,Charming but could be funnier,6,1 June 2013,"Coming to America is a movie which is generally remembered fondly. But in retrospect it is not quite as funny as you might remember it as having been. It has enough laughs to keep you more or less satisfied but it never truly reaches the heights of comic genius. The comedy is hit and miss, some of it really works but much of it does fall flat. The movie does have a story and a star that are sweet and endearing. Yes, this may be the one time Eddie Murphy can be described as sweet and endearing. He plays Prince Akeem, heir to the throne of the fictional (and somewhat bizarre) African nation of Zamunda. It's impossible not to be charmed by Akeem, who after being pampered to ridiculous extremes his whole life just wants to be normal. Most of all he wants to find love. In Zamunda a marriage has been prearranged for him. His beautiful bride-to-be has been groomed to be completely obedient and subservient to him. This is exactly what Akeem does not want. He wants an intelligent, independent woman who will love him for who he is, not for his wealth and royal status. Akeem will set out on a journey to find his ideal woman. Destination...Queens? It is here, in a run-down area of perhaps New York City's least glamorous borough, that Akeem will seek his bride. He adapts to the commoner's life pretty well, almost reveling in being a poor man mopping the floor in a fast-food restaurant. His friend and traveling companion Semmi meanwhile longs for the lavish lifestyle they have left behind. The back-and-forth between this odd couple provides some laughs. It does not take long for Akeem to zero in on his ideal woman. Lisa is the very smart, and very beautiful, daughter of the owner of the restaurant in which Akeem works. Unfortunately she is in a relationship with Darryl who, in one of the movie's gags which doesn't work very well 25 years later, is heir to a Jheri curl fortune. Lisa's father likes Darryl because he's got money. He would never approve of his daughter being with poor Akeem. If he only knew. Akeem will never let on about his wealth. He will try to win Lisa's heart using his personality alone. It is a very charming pursuit.By Eddie Murphy standards Coming to America is a very tame comedy. There is nothing all that raunchy or outrageous about it. Unfortunately there are stretches where there is not that much funny about it either. Comedic high points are scattered throughout but there are some pretty long lulls between the better moments. The movie is performed very well. Murphy is excellent. Arsenio Hall, playing Semmi, proves a good partner for Murphy. Shari Headley is excellent as Lisa, making it very easy to see why Akeem would fall in love with her. Eriq La Salle makes for a convincing jerk as Darryl. John Amos has some very good moments in playing Lisa's father. And James Earl Jones is a commanding presence as Akeem's father, the king of Zamunda. But for as good as all the performances are the movie never quite kicks into high gear. It is paced rather slowly, taking quite the meandering route to the finish line. Murphy is very charming as Akeem, and the character has a few good fish out of water moments, but he is not as consistently funny as you would hope. In fact the funniest Murphy moments in the film come from some of the other characters he plays rather than from Akeem. And that is a problem in what is for all intents and purposes Akeem's movie. This is a movie which definitely has you rooting for its main character. It just doesn't have you laughing with him enough. Not a bad movie by any means. But no comedic masterpiece either.",Coming to America
64,phubbs,Coming to America,10,6 April 2019,"Wait up, there has been a movie made by a major Hollywood studio which focuses on a story set in Africa. Which then shifts to focus entirely on African Americans. With an almost entirely black cast, focusing on various parts of African/African American culture. And it was directed by a white man!! Bu..bu..but! 'Black Panther'! yadda yadda yadda...Yep believe it or not (and many won't) but this was done many many years before all the 'woke' left-wing media would have you believe; and what's more, it was actually directed by a white male! Shock! Horror! Social media outrage! Luckily that white director was the genius that is John Landis. Yeah it helps when you hire people based on merit rather than race and gender, but I digress.The Plot: Very much in the vein of a classic fairytale if you will. The Prince of a fictional wealthy nation in Africa (Zamunda) grows tired of his privileged lifestyle. His every want and desire is pandered to, he is mollycoddled and spoilt. He may be a good man who is young and good looking but finding a true woman is hard because of the fact he is a Prince, a King in waiting. Unfortunately this is made even harder by the fact that he is down for an arranged marriage. So in desperation he flees (sort of) to America in order to find true love. To find a Princess (or future Queen) who will love him for who he is and not his wealth (tall order).'I want you to bathe him thoroughly'Right so first off this movie has an amazing cast all round, I think we can all agree. But undoubtedly this was and always will be an Eddie Murphy tour de force. There are many things to like and hark back to in this movie but surely Murphy's array of distinct characters must be at the top. From his genuinely solid performance as an African Prince Akeem. To his gold-toothed loud-mouthed barber Clarence. To his greasy perm haired crappy soul singer Randy Watson (easily the best). Each performance is incredibly unique showcasing Murphy's versatility. Indeed when I was young I never even knew Murphy was behind these characters, straight up. But that can also be attributed to Rick Baker's fabulous makeup throughout. I think the stand-out example of this has to be Murphy's old Jewish barbershop customer Saul. The makeup (essentially whiteface) is so flippin' good for years, as a youngster, I never knew it was Murphy.The rest of the cast was like a who's who of African American actors at the time. The legendary James Earl Jones played King Jaffe Joffer, a big man with a strong sense of national pride and tradition. Wearing a pair of thick rims on his face, typical 80's suits adorned with some unique jewelry and an amazing, if somewhat un-PC, lionskin complete with head around his torso. Its like he was born to be an actual African King. Arsenio Hall played Semmi, Akeem's close friend, along with his own selection of classic weirdos. He was another of the old ranting men in the barbershop, an ugly female in a nightclub which was fudging hilarious, and his best performance as Reverend Brown. A buck-toothed balding raspy-voiced man of God...who was kinda creepy.Alongside there was also John Amos as Cleo the concerned father of Akeem's Princess-to-be and owner of 'McDonald's' rip-off McDowell's. Shari Headly played Lisa, the Princess-to-be of Akeem's desire. Madge Sinclair was the more down to earth Queen of King Joffer (they had an arranged marriage). And Eriq La Salle was fantastic as Lisa's also greasy perm haired creep of a boyfriend. Smaller roles and cameos included the likes of Calvin Lockhart, Samuel L. Jackson, Cuba Gooding Jr., Vondie Curtis-Hall, and Don Ameche with Ralph Bellamy playing the same characters from John Landis' earlier movie 'Trading Places'. So this officially means 'Trading Places' and 'Coming to America' are in the same cinematic universe. Akeem gives the duo a large wad of bills (as they are homeless after the events of the 1983 movie). We are left to assume they use it to get their fortune back, but did they succeed?Another strong element in this movie is the locations. The American set parts of the movie are filmed around various New York boroughs and just like 'Trading Places' New York sells the movie brilliantly. There is no better city to film in than Manhattan and its surrounding boroughs for atmosphere and culture, especially when it's cold and snowy. Again just like Landis' 83 rags to riches movie each location sets the scene perfectly and gives you the viewer a really pitch perfect vibe. The cold weather also helps sells the reality of the situations making you glad you aren't right there at that point in time. There's just something so cool and photogenic about old 80's New York in the cold and wet, so gritty vibrant and real.I should also point out that the African sequences, although clearly done on sets, are highly effective too. The costumes all look very well designed, authentic, rich and vibrant in colour. The royal interiors all look lovely and again very colourful, and I'm sure based somewhat on reality. And the large ceremonial dance sequence is also impressive in scope and I'm sure also based on reality, with some artistic license.But how can I not mention the biting comedy here?? Back in the day this movie was considered by my folks to be off limits, oh yes. Even the cut TV versions were frowned upon. Obviously they knew it was a comedy but the near-constant profanity and odd bits of nudity were a big no no back then. Far too raunchy (don't laugh, different times). But yes this movie is like a flippin' gold mine of errr...comedy gold. Cruel, unapologetic, definitely not for the faint-hearted liberals, and epic. There are moments of cutesy humour such as Cleo's obvious grovelling towards Akeem when he discovers he's mega-rich. He then goes on to really kiss King Joffers ass which is done to a tee, only to then stand up for his daughter when the King rebuffs them both which was heartwarming.Then there are the moments when Murphy and Hall let loose and bring the house down. Hall as a slutty big-haired nightclubber who wants a threesome has to be a small highlight. The other crazy women are also very funny too (actual actresses). Murphy as Randy Watson and his band 'Sexual Chocolate' is another top spot. He preens himself as he struts across the stage whaling out his tone-deaf lyrics. Meanwhile Hall as Reverend Brown bounces around the stage praising Jesus and his adoring followers. When Akeem and Semmi decide to blend in with Americans and get kitted out in local attire. Queen Aoleon telling Joffer to put a sock in it as he yells at Akeem for going after Lisa against his wishes. Nice little moment that, you're thinking...yeah you tell him! And of course the constant pressure Akeem feels to look poor so Lisa doesn't catch on to the fact he's a Prince of an African nation.'bit of an insect problem but you boys from Africa are probably used to that'In the end one of the most interesting aspects of this movie is the simple fact that it's actually a very good story. Yes its a somewhat crude and crass comedy at times. Yes there's plenty of silliness and hijinks that now comes across as kinda daft. And yes there are many many elements that would be deemed offensive by today's overly sensitive society. But in amongst all that is a truly heartwarming fairytale of searching for love in a big city. There is a solid sense of family in the movie, on both sides on the coin, and every character is generally likable including the 'bad guys'. A touching tale of two different cultures (effectively visualised) coming together and living happily ever after. Arguably Murphy's best comedy/film.Question is, what happened to McDowell's? I wonder if Maurice became manager?10/10",Coming to America
65,Stampsfightclub,Murphy shines in enjoyable romantic comedy,8,16 January 2007,"Eddie Murphy (Trading Places) stars as ambitious Prince Akeem, a want to be romantic in a world where he gets everything he wants, apart from the perfect partner. He sets on a journey to America with his friend and Akeem hopes to find his Princess.It's an enjoyable tale about a good natured likable Prince trying to find true happiness in his life. The parallel between the norm of the rich and spoilt setting of the palace to the poor uncomfortable surroundings of a rough Queen's neighbourhood are brilliantly executed and allow audiences to see what some people go through.The differences in culture are often remarkable, given that America is the land of opportunity and is portrayed as being a difficult struggle for immigrants and other local residents. Some scenes are quite emotional which spreads audience's uses and gratifications.As a comedy genre, this worked well, especially when the pair find stuff aren't going their way in the poor world. It's a slow moving comedy filled with fantastic comedy performances as Murphy portrays a variety of characters once again and he does so brilliantly and he has to be admired. His central character Prince Akeem is simply fantastic.Likable, funny, charming and positive he is a great character for this movie and makes the story fall brilliantly into place.The narrative is slow moving, conforming beautifully to the comedy genre with physical scenes (one with luggage) and funny lines (one in the apartment) and is combined well with a somewhat conventional predictable but equally sweet and enjoyable romantic scenario. Many may argue the love story is far-fetched but it is simply enjoyable and inspirational for negative people.The ending was atrocious. Never have I seen such a good film that has had such an anticlimax at the end. It's poorly directed and has no realism to its nature, it is poor.But apart from the ending the film will make you smile and make you giggle and laugh hard on occasions.Personally I would watch it again just for Murphy's brilliance but the entire film is accepting and harmless fun",Coming to America
66,tbills2,Eddie Murphy is Comedic Gold,8,12 May 2013,"Coming to America is Eddie Murphy's undisputed best comedy. It's a very lovely, endearing comedy and definitely one of my favorites. Murphy pours out the talent in excess playing a variety of outlandish characters; he and Arsenio Hall truly shine, glistening as lustrous as Darryl's SoulGlo soaked hairdo. Murphy and Hall are a delight as Prince Akeem and Semmi, however they leave most of the jokes for their other funnier parts. Murphy falls into the role of Randy Watson and gives us something for the ages, Sexy Chocolate. Hall generates charisma for Reverend Brown. Clarence, Saul, and Morris in the barbershop make for a memorable scene serving as a slight introduction and significant landmark to Black-American culture. The makeup and costumes for these characters are excellent and you can hardly recognize the stars. When these side characters appear on screen the rest of the movie becomes irrelevant to the momentary pleasure of the given scene. James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair are strong presences as the King and Queen establishing an uneasiness to the plot. Shari Headley seems bound for stardom playing Lisa McDowell. John Amos is as likable as ever as Lisa's dad. Allison Dean stands out as Lisa's sister, Patrice. Samuel L. Jackson shows up for an unforgettable robbery scene. While Coming to America starts out as a straightforward comedy, it gradually settles into a touching comedy-romance. Coming to America has no forced punchlines. The laughter comes out smooth.",Coming to America

68,Maziun,Eddie Murphy's last great solo movie,8,31 December 2013,"If somebody in the 80's would say that people will run away with scream at the mention of "" a new comedy with Eddie Murphy "" he would end in mental hospital . Eddie Murphy was AWESOME in the 80's . ""48 hours"" , ""Trading places "" , ""Beverly Hills cop"" and finally ""Coming to America"" – all great movies , a true classics. Add to that a successful stand up tour ""Eddie Murphy RAW"" and a quite successful music career (with popular ""My girl wants to part all the time"" song) . After such successful decade came much weaker decade – the 90's. Still Murphy made great ""Mulan"" , good ""Life"" , decent ""Distinguished gentleman"" and ""Metro"" . Eddie lost his touch in after year 2000 . Yes , he got Oscar nominee for ""Dreamgirls"" and was great in ""Shrek"" franchise , but his solo movies became terrible disasters that nobody wants to watch. Today Eddie is not funny anymore and keeps making all those dreadful family friendly crap movies . Maybe some day he will be back""Coming to America"" is Murphy's second movie made with John Landis . Just like ""Trading places"" it's a movie with a lot of heart underneath lot of fun . It pretty much feels (just like ""TP"") like an movie that Frank Capra would made in the 80's. It's not a romantic comedy as many of the reviewers say , even if the love story is important part of the movie . It's a comedy and romance mixed together very well – an reversed version of ""Cinderella"" since it's prince who comes looking for woman , not the other way around. It's hard to believe today that this movie was made by Disney. We have some nudity , F-words , sexual jokes and even some toilet joke . Yet , everything is presented here with such charm and good taste that you won't be offended , but laughing out loud. The movie does throws too many jokes and some of the are obviously weaker than others . Overall the movie manages to have a high quality jokes from the beginning to the end.Most of the fun here comes from the confrontation of live in Zamunda and America . Those are two different worlds . Zamunda is presented as a country straight from fairy tale . The movie never makes an attempt to copy reality. Zamunda has to be in a total opposition with New York for the film's own comedic purposes . Same goes for a simple , but incredibly effective duo of Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) and Semmi (Arsenio Hall) . First one is amusingly naive and enthusiastic about everything . Second is pessimistic and down to earth . Together they hilarious . One completes another and the results are wonderful.The power of the movie might lay in the performances of the actors and actresses . ""Coming to America"" is probably one of the best acted not only comedies , but movies of ALL time. Every character that we meet here is memorable , likable and has at least one great comic moment (for example : the lady at the post office). ""CTA"" is pretty much a black movie , since the only non-black person here is Louie Anderson (creator of cartoon ""Life with Louie"") as the sympathetic worker at McDowell's restaurant.The main star is of course Eddie . This film marks the first time Eddie Murphy played multiple characters the same film. Something which has gone on to be a trademark of his (""Nutty professor "" ) . Murphy is top notch as the old Jewish man in the barbershop . Yes , the make up is brilliant too , but it's amazing how he disappeared completely in that role. It shows you how REALLY TALENTED guy he is . Murphy also makes Prince Akeem a true human character – when the movie needs it you can see an intelligent , humble , sensitive human underneath all that joyful attitude.Arsenio Hall also likes to dress up ( he's hilarious as the woman in the bar) and gives a great supporting performance as Murphy's sidekick . He's pessimistic attitude brings a lot of fun. Who could forget James Earl Jones as the King and as the Queen ? They both are perfect royal couple – tough on the outside and good hearted inside. No wonder they played another royal couple – in ""Lion king"". John Amos is delightful as the greedy but sweet McDowell , Shari Hadley is charming as Lisa , Eriq La Salle is amusing as the shallow playboy .Watch out for really young Cuba Gooding Jr. as one of the barber shop clients , Samuel L. Jackson as a robber and for Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche appearing in one of the most brilliant easter egg EVER . ""Coming to America"" was one of the movies of my childhood . After all those years it holds incredibly strong . It beats the s*** out of Murphy's recent comedies and it's simply one of the greatest comedies EVER. It's funny , charming , has heart , it's wonderfully acted and has all the magic of 80's cinema . I give it 8/10.",Coming to America
69,AhmedSpielberg99,Decent Com-Rom!,8,21 January 2021,"It feels as if the filmmakers behind this movie followed the term ""Rom-Com"" as literally as possible, only switching the two parts of the acronym together! The first, and better, half of the movie is pure comedy. It's admittedly a bit stretched-considering it serves as a build up for what's to come- and has a couple of jokes that just didn't land. But there's no denying it's the part that garnered the movie a hint of originality to it as well as a dash of heart-warming moments that proved later on how potent-and even essential-they are.Much of the humour emerges from the fish-out-of-water interaction between Prince Akeem and the New Yorkers. So on the surface using that comedic trope in that particular context would make the jokes unbearably clichéd-well, yes and no. Yes because they are clichéd for the most part. No because they ultimately come off as surprisingly refreshing. That was in part due to Landis's decision to make Akeem, as well as his friend Semmi, stick to their character ""regal"" roots as firmly and seriously as the comedic nature of the story, and the comic charm of the duo, would allow. It's Eddie Murphy who's also responsible for rendering the humour effective, as he was in full control and command of his star power.The second part is where the movie became almost entirely ""romance"" film. Granted, the transition between ""comedy"" to ""romance"" was quite smooth so much so you barely notice, so it's just a matter of lack of consistency as we look at the whole picture. The real problem lies in the fact the movie totally succumbed to the archetype story it tells and, as a result, I was able to see how it's going to end miles away. The fact that I was invested in every single character and immersed in the goings-on is what compensated a great deal for the story's predictability, and kept the movie afloat for me. I can gladly say that I'm excited an curious to see how the sequel is going to turn out.(8/10)",Coming to America
70,Isaac5855,One of Eddie's Biggest Hits (Overrated in My Opinion)...,6,3 April 2007,"Eddie Murphy had one of his biggest hits with COMING TO America, an expensive and somewhat entertaining comedy which found Eddie playing the crown prince of a fictional African country who travels to Queens, New York to find himself a wife after deciding that he's tired of being waited on hand and foot and not thrilled about having no say in the wife that has been selected for him. Eddie's Prince Akeem and his manservant Semi (Arsenio Hall) arrive in Queens, pretending to be broke and get jobs at a fast food restaurant where Akeem falls for the owner's daughter (Shari Headley). This film is lavishly produced and well cast (James Earl Jones and the late Madge Sinclair are perfect as Akeem's parents, the King and Queen)but there's a certain emptiness about the whole thing that doesn't sustain a film of such length and expense. Murphy is charming as Prince Akeem and he also gets to shine in one fabulous scene in a barbershop where he and Hall play everyone in the scene, but the film does not sustain interest until the end. Eddie later became involved in a lawsuit that claimed he stole the idea of the film from someone else which also casts a pall over the film which makes it hard to view all these years later, but it was one of Eddie's biggest hits and for his hardcore fans, there are laughs to be found, but personally, I think Eddie has done better work (BOOMERANG, THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN, THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, BOWFINGER, DREAMGIRLS), but judge for yourself.",Coming to America
71,emm,"Murphy still holds the throne of this ""comedy fable"".",7,6 May 1999,"COMING TO AMERICA was Eddie Murphy's finest hour, and a big shift from raucous movies prior to this. So far, this remains to be Murphy's best effort, and not like these overblown remakes of the 90s. It's still the old-fashioned love story where a modern-day Cupid finds a new mate. but it took a genius like John Landis to turn it into a royal fairy tale set on the streets of Queens. And talk about a BIG movie, because it certainly feels like one! Murphy handles a very capable part as an African prince using his ""royal oats"" to find the new bride-to-be he really wants. While he seriously proves to be funny (and has often tried), he's less vulgar and much more profound in his comedic acting. Notice how two cultures collide, and how they interact directly with the movie's sense of humor. Best moments: the ""cameos"" of Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall anywhere in the movie. Whenever you see any of John Landis' creations, always remember to look for the little ad that says ""See You Next Wednesday"".",Coming to America

It is the story of a 21-year-old African prince who has been extremely pampered all his life, and now has to marry a trained submissive queen. But Prince Akeem is restless and wants to see the outside world, and with his family's permission, he does so along with his faithful servant Semmi, deciding to go to Queens, New York, not realizing what it is like. He and Semmi even take up jobs as cleaners at a fast-food restaurant.Though they are the proverbial fish out of water, instead of stumbling through the rest of the movie, they prove to be quick studies, visiting a nearby barber shop with elderly people arguing loudly about subjects like boxing, going to bars and nightclubs and finding weird women, and then a storefront church featuring ""Black Awareness Week"". Finally, Akeem finds a woman he likes...who is engaged to another man who is rich but unlikable. Can he get her? The main characters give credible performances in all their roles (Murphy and Hall play multiple roles in the story), and the movie eschews crass humor for a standard but credible storyline.

My brothers and I used to watch it over and over again, and knew some of the dialogues by heart.Silly, outrageous with a pinch of romance, this movie is just fun. An African prince is tired of being a prince and wants to live a normal life to experience that, wants to experience love and not to be handed everything. He lives everything behind, takes a few millions (ha!) and arrives into a working class NY neighborhood in his fancy car. He gets a job as a cleaner in a second rate burger place, he fancies the owner's daughter, but she already has a suitor, who is cooler than he is. Said like this, is sounds uninteresting, but all the gags, situations,dialogues and acting make this work in inexplicable ways.Eddie Murphy is great in his different roles in the film. Arsenio Hall, cheeky and hilarious, and the perfect counterbalance to Eddie. Earl Jones regal as always, Amos is very sweet, and Eriq La Salle is just totally hateable in his role of Mr shiny curls.

He's a comedic actor who I don't get tired off and manages to bring such a delightful presence to each film he acts in. Coming to America is one of his ventures that is very funny.Coming to America revolves around Akeem, an African prince who travels to Queens, New York in search for his bride.Coming 2 America has arrived and to prepare I watched this film for the very first time. The entire cast of this film is great. Eddie Murphy as usual is fantastic. He plays a likeable character and you root for him the whole way through. The film doesn't use his comedic talent to the fullest but I guess with the way the character was written he's meant to seem more sweet than funny. Regardless there are scenes where Murphy shows his comedic abilities and is able to shine. Alongside him, Arsenio Hall is also terrific here. Him and Murphy have great chemistry with each other and he's really funny here. It also surprised me by the amount of characters both play. It shows their range in comedic acting and how good the makeup team were in disguising them. John Amos, James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair were all great. Shari Headley was great even though I wish there was more to her character. There were also a few cameos showing big actors who were not that well known at the time like Cuba Gooding Jr. and Samuel L. Jackson.The film had plenty of jokes to make you laugh throughout and the way some actors delivered those jokes made it even funnier. From a story standpoint, there is room for improvement. I thought the whole romance angle wasn't developed enough and the film ended too neatly in my opinion. A conflict is set up towards the end which could have developed characters further but the film decided to wrap it up as soon as possible. It felt as if a chunk of the film was missing.Aside from those issues, Coming to America is a decent watch. The acting is solid by everyone especially from Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall who seemed to have a lot of fun making this film and there are a great amount of jokes that are genuinely funny.",Coming to America

It was always skirting around the edges of being funny without ever making me laugh out loud. Considering this is a comedy this was far from ideal.Despite this, I did enjoy the film. I thought it had a pretty interesting and enjoyable premise, which allowed for lots of great scenarios and interactions. Eddie Murphy has so much charisma and screen presence, so a film with him at the helm is never going to be awful.

I first got wind of it by some bus ads that focused on the fact most of the main characters were played by Eddie Murphy. To my knowledge this was the first time an actor had played so many roles in a movie, of such diversity (this was before he tried this several more times, generally all in awful films except ""Bowfinger""). Eddie Murphy was a star and when the reviews came out I knew I had to see it. I'm not sure when I saw it, but I'm pretty sure it was a year or so later on VHS. Here's my Top 20 things about the movie.1/ Sexual Chocolate. Randy Watson's parody of ""The Greatest Love Of All"" opened my eyes to the crappiness of modern music. Hilarious scene.2/ Screen debut for Cuba Gooding Jnr and one of the first for Samuel L Jackson (and yes there was an ""F"" bomb) 3/ The song ""She's Your Queen To Be"", most notably the line about being ""free from infection"" 4/ Arsenio Hall. Awful as Semmi, but brilliant as Morris and Rev. Brown.5/ John Amos' line ""I feel like break dancing"".6/ ""Soul Glo"" 7/ Maurice talking about his rise through the ranks at McDowell's 8/ Frankie Faison as the landlord. Just discovered he was Chris Rock's manager in ""Down To Earth"" and was in 40+ episodes of ""The Wire"".*Darren, this may be the clincher to getting me to watch it.9/ The barber shop scenes.10/ The girl who talks about her Hollywood ambitions.11/ Akeem courting Lisa.12/ Akeem meeting his wife.13/ The Black Awareness rally.14/ ""I do not use chemicals. Only fruit and berries"" 15/ The basketball game 16/ Scenes at their apartment 17/ The night club scene 18/ The hold-up scene 19/ The bad acting of Shari Headley 20/ Sheer rewatchability.

While in Queens, Akeem poses as a poor man and goes to work for McDowell's Resturaunt. Soon he finds love in the owners daughter Lisa (Shari Headley).Coming to America is one of Murphy's classic's. What ever happened to him is unknown to me. He is funny, he has depth to his character , and is able to portray the naive prince. Arsenio Hall is even funnier as Semmi and various other characters including an insane minister, a predatory woman in a strip club, and a hairdresser. Arsenio Hall out does himself in this one, making you laugh in almost every scene.Both Murphy and Hall play many roles and are hilarious. The story is filled with laughs of adapting to their new environment and working at a restaurant being sued by McDonald's.

The only scenes that seriously felt annoying or unnecessary were the ones with Murphy and Hall try a bit too hard by performing multiple roles, like the Black Awareness Rally or the barbershop trio jokes.",Coming to America
90,Dockelektro,Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny,8,22 September 2001,"Man, this is a classic cult movie among my family. We were still kids and we already quoted and saw this movie endless times. The movie is a knock-out laugh fest until it ends, and has an unbelievable amount of surprises and gags that will make you laugh your pants out. Eddie Murphy is genius as Akeem, an african prince searching a bride, as an hysterical barber, as a failed pop singer who leads a band called ""Sexual Chocolate"" (truly classic), and as a white old man with an accent. Yes, you read it, he does all this. Arsenio Hall is also a treat as Akeem's friend, Semmi, as one of the barbers, as a preacher (gotta see it to believe it), and as a horny woman in a bar scene(!!!). If you have the faintest sense of humor, you'll laugh until it hurts, guaranteed fun with actors who later became important doing career-starting parts (like Samuel L. Jackson and Cuba Gooding Jr.). A great great comedy, a true jewel. See it, it's an unmissable!",Coming to America

The other night I was flipping my channels on my DIRECTV system only to come to HBO and find Coming to America on. I never saw this hit comedy, but now after 13 years I got to enjoy the many laughs of Eddie Murphy he is just as funny as can be in this film just like his many other fun hits. Murphy is just as funny as can be playing a prince who ventures to Queens, N.Y., in search of the perfect princess. Scene after scene is just great laughter, I love seeing Eddie Murphy work as a McDonald's janitor! Now that was a thing that looked good and provided much humor! Plus Arsenio Hall and James Earl Jones give great performances to be noticed. Watch Coming to America it is one of the best from Eddie Murphy.",Coming to America
92,cosmic_quest,One of Eddie Murphy's funniest films,8,23 May 2006,"It may be very much an Eighties film but 'Coming to America' is as funny now as it was in 1988 and is probably one of Eddie Murphy's finest films.The films sees Murphy's character Prince Akeem of Zamunda turning twenty-one and now being of age where he has to marry. While his traditionalist father King Jaffe Joffer (wonderfully played by the regal James Earl Jones) is determined that his only son marries a Zamundan woman groomed to be queen, Akeen is a romantic who wishes to find true love. Defying his father, he and his servant Semmi travel to Queens, New York to find his bride and, upon arrival, take the roles of poor African students so he can be sure the girl of his dreams is marrying him for his personality rather than his title and riches.Eddie Murphy totally threw himself into the role of Akeem (as well as undertaking the roles of other characters in the film under the guise of heavy make-up), bringing to life the boyishness and genuinely kind-nature of the character. Arsenio Hall is great in the supporting role of the disgruntled Semmi, who has little interest in leaving the lap of luxury to lead what he sees as the down-trodden life of a typical New Yorker. And Eriq La Salle is just hilarious as the sleazy, self-absorbed boyfriend of Akeem's new love.There are many scenes in the film that are absolute gems, in particular the palace scenes where we see how a Zamundan prince is lavishly treated as well as the basketball game where Akeem meets a delighted Zamundan royalist and when the father of the girl Akeem loves discovers who he thinks is a goat-herder no good for his precious daughter is in fact a prince. It also gives an interesting insight into how outsiders view what makes an average New York native (I loved Akeem indulging in what he learns is a New York salutation, of course, littered with swearing!).'Coming to America' is a brilliant comedy that may be slightly dated now although that only adds to the charm of the film. Look out for cameos from Randolph and Mortimer Duke from Murphy's 1983 film 'Trading Places'.",Coming to America
93,Pookyiscute,Not my favorite Eddy Murphy flick...,5,28 December 2005,"I gave this movie a five, because it's half and half, or I guess, so so.Eddie Murphy is the only reason why this movie was funny at all. Had he not been in it, it probably wouldn't have even been known, let alone well-known.At the beginning of the film we are introduced to Murphy's character, a Prince of an African country in present day. It is 21st birthday, and his parents have selected him a bride, to be his Queen.He does not want to be married to someone that have picked, so he and his friend, played by Arsino Hall, go to America to find himself his own bride, who he will love, and not just be forced to marry. They decide on New York, and more specifically on Queens, in hopes that he will find his ""Queen"" there.After their luggage is stolen, and they have no luck at any of the bars they go to in finding a suitable woman, they go to a ""Black Awareness"" rally, and he sees the woman he wants to meet, and eventually falls in love with.Throughout the movie, while working for her father at a McDonald's knock-off restaurant, he tries to win her heart through his charm and sophistication, and goodness.My favorite thing in this movie is that her name is, Lisa, and so is mine, so it just makes the movie that much more enjoyable for me. :) There are some humorous scenes in the film, but if you're looking for something like Beverly Hills Cop or even a Nutty Professor, you won't find it here. It's light, and off-beat enough that it's entertaining to watch once or twice, but not the sort of movie you would necessarily want to have in your DVD collection.And now, an excerpt from the film, ""I have a date with Lisa! Isn't that exciting!""",Coming to America
94,Darkjak007,When you think of garbage think of Akeem,7,5 March 2021,"Coming to America was directed by John Landis and stars Eddie Murphy And Arsenio hall. Eddie Murphy stars as an African prince named Akeem who on his 21st birthday is meant to be married however he does not feel satisfied with this current arranged wife's, devise a plan to go to America and find his own queen. Eddie Murphy delivers one of his greatest roles in his whole career as akeem is all around a Likable guy. You can't help but laugh for how naïve he is when he arrives to America. Murphy also shows how much of a diverse actor he is. He is not only Akeem but he also plays the barbershop men and the lead singer of sexual chocolate randy Watson. Arsenio hall as his man servant Semmi gives a funny performance as he disagrees with akeems methods And that all this common man lifestyle is beneath them. The movie doesn't seem like much at first from its basic plot of just the rich person falling in love with the poor person. Shari Headley as Lisa McDowell states throughout the whole movie how she doesn't feel like anyone makes that decision of who she marries but she ends up marrying a king .Though it still delivers fine great amount of humor Alot of jokes are funny it's not loud it in your face to the point that it comes off as obnoxious it's subtle humor. The the random dates meet ups one stating she worships the devil and the other saying she's Joan of arc reincarnated. And also the two homeless men Akeem gives us a huge stack of money stating their back but you never really see exactly what they do. It's also really nice throwback movie when you look back at the people in this film and how far their careers have come even to the more smaller role. Cuba Gooding jr as the man getting his haircut inthe barber shop and Samuel L Jackson as the robber at McDowell's. Coming to America remains one of the most Remember comedies of the 80s and still to this day is a classic That still holds up.",Coming to America

96,cinephile-27690,My Favorite Eddie Murphy Movie!,10,31 July 2018,"Edddie Murphy is one of my favorite actors, yet there are few of his movies that I enjoy. This is the one I like the best. Those who think he's too obnoxious will find Coming To America to fit the bill.The plot follows a prince who goes to America to experience culture and to find a bride. The humor goes throughout, but it's not joke after joke.One part I love is the Prince wakes up on his first full day in America and he screams out: ""GOOD MORNING MY NEIGHBORS!"" A neighbor who was rudely awoken responds: ""Hey! (Screw) you!"" Not knowing profanity, the Prince responds: ""Yes! Yes! (Screw) you too!""Another impressive fact is that Eddie Murphy and his co-star Arscenio Hall both have 4 roles. Murphy, along with the Prince, is a band singer named Randy Watson(and his band is called Sexual Chocolate),he's a barber, and most impressively, he is a white man in the barber shop.Hall plays Semmi, who is Akeem's assistant and friend. He's a man in the barber shop, a hilarious Pastor, and has a cameo(for like 20 seconds) as a woman that wants to have sex with Akeem and Semmi.Oh, and by the way, Akeem's parents are the voices of Simba's parents in The Lion King, and Samuel L. Jackson has a cameo.Now, I've mentioned the comedy. Now what about the drama? Eddie Murphy is not all laughs in this, this has some great drama as well. I will let you spot it out for yourself.I cannot find a single critique for this movie, hence why it's my favorite Murphy movie. This is definitely a comedy to see.""Hey can you see I'm- Coming to America!""",Coming to America
97,higherall7,Going to Africa...,8,11 April 2021,"The concept is a novel one. It is told with warmth and humanity and a kind of humor and charm that leaves no parties to be injured or the butt of the joke for long. This is the lighter side of the BLACK PANTHER (2018) thirty years prior to its release. In this case, we have an African Prince seeking to come of age without becoming involved in the thunderous geopolitics of power grabbing high tech nations or fighting to the death villainous super powered arch enemies. He comes to America seeking a Queen with an independent intelligence and a will of her own.Rather than the story of a martyr or a high principled leader of heroic sacrifice, we have here, awww, a love story. Prince Akeem as brilliantly played by Eddie Murphy, does exactly what Joseph Asagai proposed to do with Beneatha Younger in A RAISIN IN THE SUN (1961). He takes his beloved back with him to Africa. In between landing in Queens, New York, and taking his chosen spouse back to the wealthy African nation of Zamunda, complications develop that are all played for a chuckle and a laugh. The back home rather than down home naivety of Prince Akeem and Arsenio Hall as Semmi, is a delight to witness and experience. Theirs is a great pairing; a combination of Errol Flynn and Alan Hale spliced into Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. There is really nothing like them as a duo in this film.Thanks to the groundbreaking work of makeup artists Bernadine M. Anderson and Rick Baker, along with their very talented team, Eddie Murphy gets to express the full range of his Comic Genius in a host of roles. You can pick out when you see him and when you don't. There are sight gags aplenty and you get to see Erig La Salle, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Samuel L. Jackson before you knew them when. Even Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy show up as newly minted bums in a witty reference to an earlier Eddie Murphy vehicle entitled TRADING PLACES (1983). There is also plenty of African pageantry in the early scenes, thanks to Costume Designer Deborah Nadoolman, and this fashion sense extends even into McDowell's Restaurant, run and managed by John Amos as Cleo McDowell, and onto the mean streets of New York that Mortimer and Randolph Duke now call their home.Once again, this feels like a sketch from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, qualified and honed and rendered into the Blockbuster Movie it ultimately became. James Earl Jones as King Jaffe Joffer and Madge Sinclair as Queen Aoleon give particularly commanding and vivid performances. Calvin Lockhart serves with distinction as Colonel Izzi during the court sequence as he presents his daughter Imani Izzi, as played by Vanessa Bell Calloway, to the Prince as a prospective wife. There perhaps should have been more of a Cinderella transformation for Shari Headley, who as Lisa McDowell, becomes the future Queen-to-be of Zamunda. A shame we never get to see them actually wed in the manner of Grace Kelly and the Prince of Monaco, and indeed, this would have made suitable fodder for a sequel. Even the idea of them traveling the length and breath of the African continent on their honeymoon, seeing the sights as they reflect and enjoy their happiness, kindles the imagination.That aside, this movie is light enough to buoy the spirits of the most leaden hearted viewer. Louie Anderson as Maurice, one of the bus boys in McDowell's, and Vondie Curtis-Hall, as the Basketball Game Vendor, are representative of the quirky characters that come and go throughout the narrative. Nile Rodgers' music is on point and gives zest to the twists and turns of romantic fortune between Akeem and Lisa. The sparring between Akeem and Semmi in a Zamunda gym, along with their confrontation with the hold-up man in McDowell's Restaurant, played by Samuel L. Jackson with his usual scenery chewing menace, feels like a precursor to the adventures of the Black Panther. However, the dating scenes in New York bars and clubs are as wild and woolly as any set piece in a horror movie. So there's something for everyone in this well crafted comedy about trading places on the Black Hand side of the tracks.",Coming to America

He proved that he can be multiple people and do it well.  The movie follows Eddie Murphy who plays an African Prince who goes to New York with Arsenio Hall to find the woman he really loves.  James Earl Jones does good as the King and I enjoyed him.  Everybody else and I mean EVERYBODY else knew how to act and I enjoyed every character.

It deserves to be recognized as one of the best Eddie Murphy has ever done.In this film, We see Eddie Murphy playing a prince who comes to America and he does not quite fit in. The storyline is good and is portrayed quite well by all of the cast in this funny movie.The film can get stupid at times and quite predictable, the film can also get quite sappy but the approach to that is good and done better then in a lot of other films. But most of the time the film is exceptional and well worth a watch for fans of Eddie and comedy.Overall, you should watch the film whoever you are because it is funny and clever, Eddie absolutely shining through his role and makes the prince a character worth remembering in looking back on Eddie Murphys career.

105,quinimdb,Coming to America,4,28 September 2016,"""Coming to America"" is a movie made almost entirely of clichés and stereotypes. OK, I will admit the all out absurd extravagance of the first 30 minutes or so of this film did make me laugh, but beyond that it's incredibly predictable, and comedy is only funny when it's unpredictable. Think of a time when you heard the punchline of a joke you already knew and still laughed at it.Never?Exactly.Once Akeem comes to America, the film becomes much less funny for this reason. Let's see, an optimistic man in a culture clash scenario (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", ""Rush Hour"", every Sacha Baron Cohen film), check. This one is an easy laugh, that basically comes from ""ha ha, he is so ignorant"". The only film I have seen this done well in is ""Borat"" which subverts the idea of laughing at the foreign man for being ignorant and shows us how utterly ignorant some Americans still are. Then of course the culture clash resolution, where both characters realize they are no different after all, regardless of where they're from. Check. Then there's all of the romantic comedy clichés: the simple antagonists (King Jaffe, the father of Akeem, and Cleo McDowell, the father of Lisa. They both have their values skewed, the first valuing tradition over ""true love"" and the second valuing money over, you guessed it, ""true love""; also, Darryl Jenks, the narcissistic boyfriend that doesn't truly care), check; the simple protagonist (Akeem has literally no flaws) and his screwball sidekick who screws everything up (Semmi), check; and finally, the protagonist suddenly having a falling out with the romantic interest which is then resolved in a climactic deus ex machina moment where love prevails against all odds.It's a joke that started with a set up that sounded new, but by the time I was hit with the punchline, I realized I'd heard it all before.",Coming to America

The wedding ceremony alone was so funny, I almost fell out of my chair from laughing so hard. I thought this could be one of the funniest movies of all time. At about the halfway point, though, it stops being a laugh-a-minute riot, and kind of settles down into more of a quiet romance movie. The scene at the basketball game (with the man who worships Murphy) is the last really hilarious thing that happens. After that, it never again reaches the energy of the beginning. This is not really a bad thing, though: it is still enjoyable from start to finish, even during the quiet parts. It has good actors, and it is fun to watch, and that makes it a great movie.

I say that I'm half African because maybe That's why I relate to some parts and laughed. Like how many white people love The Office or arrested development, which both are very stale to me. I think certain ethnicities react more to certain comedies. Maybe that's a factor. Maybe not! This film wasn't directed by Spike Lee. It was John Landis! He's not black. I'm not sure my theory of ethnically relevant comedy always stands. Again, I don't laugh at arrested development nor The Office. I went on a date with a white girl and she was Talking about arrested development and I couldn't relate. With those two shows, maybe they land better with white people. I've never heard a black person talk about the office or arrested development. Never! I don't know any black people that want to go to Coachella, either. Lol. Race may not matter regarding how they react to certain styles of comedy. It's very interesting that Eddie Murphy was so successful in the 1980's as a leading man. Beverly Hills cop was supposed to cast Sylvester Stallone! Imagine that franchise with Sylvester Stallone! This film was Hilarious! And it had some cliche things, but surprisingly, they weren't cheesy. Eddie Murphy and John landis collaborated on other films. Maybe they really understood each other, maybe both were just very great at making films, and teaming up, they succeeded. I just think this film worked. I wasn't asking too many questions about realism because it could happen. The ending, I did wonder how that happened, but it can be explained if you think about the family and friends. I can't believe it took me this long to finally watch this movie. I had to debate with myself, whether Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy was funnier overall. I already know Eddie Murphy was more successful as an actor, but Eddie Murphy made Beverly Hills cop franchise into a very good franchise. If Stallone did that franchise as originally planned, it would've been very different. Maybe it's not fair comparing Murphy to Pryor, but they're very similar. Great film!",Coming to America

but I found that it's not as smooth as they said.There are very cringe absurd scenes that I disliked.
disliked the scene where akeem said to the girl every time you think of garbage think of meor when akeem was in a baseball game and heard someone shouting in your face and he said yes in the face.This scene completely annoyed me. Akeem was on a seat in a basketball court and bather put one of her hands into his lap touching his dick and he started shouting and jumping out of his seat.He said he will renounce his throne for Lisa that is One of the stupidest scenes. In real life this could never happen. it doesn't work that way. Because it is extremely stupid not logical and not normal. This scene could be exchanged by three scenes that I have in mind that could be better or more suited than this. if I had a better solution then of course the directors will have 100 more options but they chose this.I loved these scenes
The beginning were akeem was being bathed by sexy naked womenafter the basketball game in America. Akeem it out to the bathroom and on the way there he met someone from his City in Africa.

I remember there was some controversy to this movie due to the restaurant that Prince Akeem and Semmi worked in when they got to the US.  It was called ""McDowall's"", and that it represented African-American businessmen as not being innovators but copiers.  Obviously these people didn't understand that it was just a parody of ""McDonald's"", and that's it.  There is no social commentary in this movie, it's just a straight up comedy through and through.

119,Newsense,A trip down memory lane part 1,10,11 January 2009,"I remember when I got my first VCR. Coming To America, Married To The Mob and Grease where the first VHS tapes that I had. Me and my mother used to watch Coming To America like crazy before my mom made the big mistake of lending the tape to a friend we never saw again. Years later I'm finally reunited with this movie and decide to write this review.The story as you all know is about a Prince named Akeem(Eddie Murphy) that grows weary of being pampered and being given a bride chooses to flee to America to find a bride of his own. He moves to a slum in Queens, New York and lives in a rundown hotel and works at the local McDonald's knockoff called McDowell's owned by Cleo McDowell(John Amos). He ends up falling for Cleo's beautiful daughter Lisa(Shari Headley).The chemistry between Eddie Murphy and the rest of the cast is perfect. Arsenio Hall(who plays Semmi) as well as Eddie Murphy show you that they are experts at playing different characters in the movie. The barber shop scenes will always be the funniest scenes in the movie but the scene at the club when Akeem and Semmi are searching for that special lady is not far behind. Even most people will claim its kind of cheesy but I found the scenes with Prince Akeem and Lisa charming and they don't make a bad looking couple on screen. Movies like Coming To America are the reason why people are always going back to Eddie's early films as opposed to his films in the 2000s(with the exception of Dreamgirls of course). He looks like he wants to be in these movies and he puts his all into his roles in contrast to the movies that are terrible where he phones in his performance. Coming To America is a great film and is one of the best comedies to come out of Black cinema. Strongly recommended to anybody that likes blasts from the past.",Coming to America

The pace of the scenes is slow at times, but I would attribute that to how film has changed. The third act is good written, when everyone collides in the same house.

Especially when it's so well executed by a directing legend like John Landis.When Eddie Murphy is having fun, he is simply amazing and the role of the naive prince on a mission seems to fit him like a glove. Although it is usually him telling the jokes, this time the comedy derives from the situations, which the contrast of the protagonist versus his environment brings about. As such it requires a real actor and Eddie proves once again he's more than just a loudmouth entertainer.The rest of the cast is equally great and with a great screenplay it's just a joy to see Landis direct it all with such ease. Which makes this one of the greatest Eddie Murphy movies so far.",Coming to America
128,Jsimpson5,Very funny film,8,18 December 2006,"I'm an Eddie Murphy fan, well let me rephrase that, I'm an Eddie Murphy fan before he started doing family movies. At that I believe he is not as good now as he was then.Anyways, this is a very funny movie that I enjoy. The gist of the movie is that an African prince (Murphy) turns 21 and is to be married to a woman he has never meet before, and then when he does meet her, he doesn't want her. He makes a lie to his dad the King (James Earl Jones) saying that he wants soil his royal oats. So the prince and his best friend (Hall) go to Queens, New York and live life in America.While this is a comedy, it does have some more serious tones to it. The prince, while he could have stayed in a very nice part of New York, decided to live in a very poor part of Queens. Basically he is willing to give up his riches to find the one (his queen).If you like Eddie Murphy, or comedies in general, you will love this film.",Coming to America
129,donuthaters12,It Starts Dull But Picks Up Halfway Through,5,24 July 2013,"Coming To America is a film that I was hoping to like, but it's flaws prevent it from being at least decent.Coming To America's plot details the ambition of a man to find a wife that is more appropriate for him rather than someone picked out by his parents. So he comes to America to look for one. The film's plot is predictable as you can pretty much figure out who he ends up with. The film's dialogue though is at least not as cheesy as I thought it would be. There are characters in here that are written so horribly and unfunny that it brings the movie really down, the people at the barber shop were corny and very over the top, this was also due to the acting but the lines that were said wasn't funny at all. Stronger side of the film is the second half, when they find work and things starts rolling.This film doesn't feel like a John Landis film but rather an Eddie Murphy film. The film feels uneven, as the first quarter of the film is so boring and dull that none of it was funny and lowered my expectations on how the film would play out but surprisingly enough the second half wasn't too bad. The first few scenes play out a little too over the top, slapsticky and deals with clashing of cultures but when the tone of the film shifts to a romantic comedy, which I have a weakness for, it starts to become a little funny and the pace becomes a little faster. If the whole film was like this, I would have brought the rating up a notch.The film was photographed by Woody Omens, who did an awesome job in Mel Brooks' History of the World: Part I as in that film, he captured big beautiful shots while at the same time not distracting us from the comedy. This film was very close and focused on the characters. Omens could have captured maybe a little more of the palace just to get that sense of royalty and importance. Even in New York, i felt that an opportunity was missed because most of the time the film takes place in closed and small spaces.The film is more soundtrack driven and at times can get your head bobbing as it sounds fun and upbeat. The soundtrack keeps the tone of the film light and fun which is a big plus for me. Nile Rodgers was the composer for this film but he has done better individual soundtrack pieces for other films.The acting in this film is so-so, there are moments where it's over the top and at times simple which keeps the scene feeling familiar and light. The first half of the film is a little over the top as Eddie Murphy at times take different roles and those supporting roles at times don't deliver the comedy very well. I know Eddie Murphy can play characters that are a little bit sentimental like the protagonist in this film, and in particular the second half of the film. His servant, played by Arsenio Hall, is a little more funny and has great chemistry with Eddie Murphy but their relationship wasn't played out as much as I hoped. There are others in the supporting cast that were fine and were fun to watch like James Earl Jones, Shari Headley and Allison Dean.The film is a little bit sloppy in it's comedy and story but it picks up in the latter half, though predictable. The acting is a little too much at times but there are sentimental moments in there that are done well by Murphy and Headley. I wished the film spent a little more time on the chemistry between Murphy and Hall. Overall, it's OK but I won't be going back to it anytime soon.",Coming to America
130,Jack_Yan,'It was a most gripping victory',7,25 December 2005,"Coming to America is harmless funthough at the time of the release I remember some AfricanAmerican groups being less than delighted about it. I can't remember the reason, and being neither black nor white, I saw the film without any politicization surrounding race. And when viewed in that vein, this is a charming, traditional, popcorn love story, with the mainstream laughs you would expect from a 1980s Eddie Murphy film.It's the old tale of the prince in an arranged marriage who wishes to seek, instead, an independently minded woman. And he meets her on his first night in Queens, New York, the place that seems the farthest from the mythical Zamunda, a wealthy African nation where zebras and lions roam outside the royal palace and James Earl Jones is king. The courtship is fairly speedy as the movie has to finish within two hours; though I'll hold back on whether Prince Akeem gets the girl or not due to IMDb rules.However, this was produced by Eddie Murphy and he came up with the original story, so there are suitably naughty bitsin the day when Murph wasn't a Dad and wasn't making kid-friendly fare. The opening scenes of a pampered prince are enjoyable, not to mention an early appearance of Garcelle Beauvais; Madge Sinclair, as the queen of Zamunda, plays her role with such class she could pass for royalty. Murphy's and Arsenio Hall's multiple roles are memorable, including Murphy's (white) Jewish character, Saul, and singer Randy Watson. Eriq la Salle gives a convincing portrayal of a spoilt heir, in direct contrast to the conscientious princethere is meaning behind these roles.Despite these characterizations, Coming to America breaks little new ground, but it is largely satisfying. It is what it says it isa romantic comedyand succeeds on both those counts.",Coming to America
131,CWP-,"Occasionally funny, but a bit silly",7,19 September 1999,"My Age: 13Akeem, played by Eddie Murphy, is the Prince of Zamunga, in Africa.  He is waited on hand and foot all the time.

Akeem doesn't want this, he wants an intelligent woman who can think for herself as a wife, so he takes a trip to America to find her.  Travelling with him is his devoted servant, Semmi, played by Arsenio Hall. 
Coming to America has what I think is a silly premise but the movie it is made into is not too bad.  Eddie Murphy is good in his role, and there are quite a few laughs in it.  The romance in it isn't too bad either and most of the characters are well-conceived and enjoyable.

133,benjaminburt,Missed the Mark,4,22 August 2017,"Perhaps the worst thing that works against Eddie Murphy's ""Coming to America"" is that many of the jokes fall flat. Who knows, maybe this was funny back in 1988. But remember, that year also gave us Beetlejuice, Die Hard, and Big, all of which hold up a LOT better than Coming to America.Many of this film's jokes are rooted in stereotypes. There are scenes where a black barber excitably argues with his patients. This is a very long sequence. I thought to myself, ""Is this supposed to be funny? Why? Because he's black and he's got a funny voice?"" The fictional African country as well was almost uncomfortable to watch to think that Eddie Murphy actually thought that his portrayal could reflect any real culture.I will give the movie this: it has heart. The actors look like they're having a good time, and I like most of the performances, but they're left on a bland script, tired story, and unfunny jokes.

The absurdity of the movie stands the test of time!Unfortunately it becomes predictable, boring, and robotic as it moves towards attempting to be a romantic comedy. You can see where it's all going a mile away, yet the central romance of the movie never really blossoms for the audience. Each of the characters remains one-dimensional and thus the changes and motions necessary to make any meaningful pairing never take place.In some ways the movie feels half-baked, and it also probably could have been shorter than it is.

There Akeem meets Lisa McDowell who is sweet, caring and smart. What I love about this film is the humor and the characters such as King Jaffe and Mr McDowell. Also the funny concepts such as Soul Glo and of course McDowell's make the film memorable. I think the setting of Queens fit the movie perfect, I don't think if it was set in Los Angeles it would of had the same appeal.

The premise is cute and the movie seemed like it was going places but really goes nowhere new or exciting for that matter.  Too much spectacle and not enough substance.

There are some great pieces of observational comedy: you can always get a good laugh out of having a naif confront the idiocy of modern urban life.But they milk every sketch until it's dry.

146,TomC-5,Eddie Murphy's coming of age film is solidly funny,6,24 August 2000,"Eddie Murphy - along with Bill Murray, Dennis Miller, Mike Myers, and perhaps just a few other SNL alumni - is one of a small number of this group who have gone on to later, worthwhile projects. Along with Myers and Adam Sandler, Murphy is arguably the biggest star to emerge from the long running NBC television institution. And one can see, in a movie like COMING TO AMERICA, what the basis of this stardom is; Eddie Murphy is a natural. He's brilliantly funny, charming, and causes his fellow cast members to shine - never before and never since has Arsenio Hall seemed so talented; the now completely obscure Joe Piscapo must be kicking himself for having gone off on his own rather than, somehow, remaining Murphy's sidekick.
Still, Eddie Murphy, initially an obvious raw talent, needed to grow up a bit. Just a teenager when he became famous, his early comedy was a bit mean spirited, particularly toward women and gays. So what a better way to grow up than to play the completely likeable character he plays here. As Prince Akeem, he has the audience rooting for him to get the girl and to be his own man. It's nice to see him as a character who is not very cocky.My favorite scenes, however, both when I watched this movie the first time and when I watched it again very recently, were the barbershop scenes. The comedy of these scenes is just so pure, as Murphy, Hall, and another actor - made up to look like an assortment of old timers - engage in some brilliant sketch comedy (I loved the bit about Rocky Marciano vs. 137 year old Joe Louis). In fact, every scene with the old timers was a standout moment in this movie.While some of COMING TO AMERICA may be a bit dated (Jherri curl jokes, some cheesy 80s electro-funk, etc.), for the most part, the entertainment value holds up quite well. John Landis' solid directing no doubt helps quite a bit, too.",Coming to America

152,Gavin59,Great Supporting Characters - and some interesting twists along the way,9,10 September 2009,"""Coming to America"" is a 1988 movie that has become an extremely popular movie on the cable channel circuit. Much of the reason for this popularity is it marked somewhat of a turning point in star Eddie Murphy's career. The turning point was that this became a movie that would widen Eddie's appeal among different audiences. Although there still is some foul-language in this movie, it surprisingly isn't Eddie Murphy's character who is dishing it out. While I wouldn't put ""Coming to America"" in the category of Eddie's ""Family"" movies of recent years (i.e. ""The Nutty Professor"", ""Dr. Dolittle"", ""Daddy Day Care"" and ""The Haunted Mansion""), there still is less foul language than in previous Murphy movies. But overall, with a good cast of supporting characters, some nice spins, and an interesting setting for the story, this might be the best all-around movie that Eddie Murphy has done. The premise of the story is as follows (this might be a spoiler): Eddie Murphy plays Prince Akeem, the sole heir to the throne of the fictitious African nation of Zamunda. The movie opens with Akeem facing an arranged marriage to a woman he has never met. Akeem immediately has doubts about marrying someone he has never met and tries to get his father, King Jaffe Joffer (played terrifically by James Earl Jones) to let him find his own bride. The King is convinced that Akeem needs to ""Sow his wild oats"" and agrees to postpone the wedding. Akeem has other ideas - he wants to travel someplace to go find a bride of his choosing. With his royal servant, Semmi (another great performance, this time by Arsenio Hall), Akeem decides to go to the United States to find a bride. In order to get someone who will care for him as a person rather than a prince, Akeem decides that he and Semmi will live as commoners (even though Semmi is a Servant, he apparently is used to the good life) as the settle into their new residence in Queens, New York. After some rough bumps, Akeem finds a woman named Lisa McDowell (played by Shari Headley) whom he feels would be his perfect bride. In an effort to pursue Lisa, Akeem decides that he and Semmi will get jobs at Lisa's father's Fast Food restaurant - McDowells (a ""spin"" on McDonalds that is spun brilliantly by the writers) in the guise of African Exchange Students. In Akeem's quest to win over Lisa, he faces many hurdles: Lisa has a boyfriend named Darryl Jenks (in another brilliant performance by Eriq La Salle); Lisa's father Cleo (in yet another brilliant performance by John Amos) whom he wants to his daughter to marry Darryl; Semmi whom despite being a servant is not acclimating to life as a poor Fast Food worker in Queens; and eventually Akeem's own Father whom will eventually get wind of his son's scheme. There are also two interesting spins in this movie (and this may also be a spoiler). Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall are going to play several other minor characters throughout the film. These performances, while not central to most of the storyline are very entertaining. Even if these minor characters were not a part of the film - and even if they weren't played by Murphy and Hall, this would still be a good movie. The other spin comes from a cameo appearance by the ""Duke"" brothers from a previous Eddie Murphy film, ""Trading Spaces"" (played by Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy). There is a very interesting spin how the Duke brothers cameo is worked into the movie. You will need to have seen ""Trading Spaces"" to understand how they spin this into the movie. If you have seen ""Trading Spaces"", you will realize how brilliantly this was done. As mentioned above, there are some terrific supporting character performances. While Eddie is still brilliant in his role of Prince Akeem, the performances of Semmi (Arsenio Hall), King Jaffe Joffer (James Earl Jones), Darryl Jenks (Eriq La Salle) and Cleo McDowell (John Amos) really stand out. In particular, I think John Amos delivers one of his best performances as Cleo. He comes across very believable as the ""father"" of Lisa - much of this due to the charm that Amos delivers to the character. The same thing can hold true for James Earl Jones - he seems perfect to play the role of the King (much due to his trademark voice). There are also two outstanding minor character performances. We see Samuel L. Jackson in one of his earliest roles do a brilliant job playing a gunman who attempts a holdup of the McDowell's restaurant. In another minor role, Louie Anderson plays one of the workers at the Fast Food restaurant. While I'm not the biggest Louie Anderson fan, every time that Louie was in a scene in ""Coming to America"", it was funny. I kind of wish they gave Louie more dialogue and fit him into the storyline of the movie. Another note, a young Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a boy getting a haircut. Perhaps the only negative is the opening of the movie. I thought the first few minutes of the movie are drawn out. Once Akeem makes the decision to call off the wedding, that is where the action will pick up. I also enjoyed the New York City and Queens setting of the movie. I think it helped the storyline and was almost a perfect contrast to the African Country of Zamunda. Overall, this is a very good movie to see.

I must have seen it 20 times or more now and I still laugh every time. The plot line concerns Eddie Murphys principle character (he plays 3 other key roles) Prince Akeem of the fictional African Kingdom Zamunda, leaving his opulent lifestyle to find a bride who loves him for who he is and not for his riches. But that's irrelevant really, as its just a fantastic showcase for the comedy acting talents of Murphy and his sidekick, Arsenio Hall, who wisecrack their way through 8 combined roles in the funniest film outside of the Monthy Python collection. The barbers shop scenes are the stuff of comedy legend and this is something that never fails to bring a smile to my face.Don't just watch this film - BUY IT!!! Laughs are guaranteed.",Coming to America
155,TheEoghShowOld,Terribly Unfunny,2,31 October 2019,"I couldn't even finish watching this one. The plot for this movie has been rehashed about 100 billion times and I'm kind of sick of seeing it; there are far too many comedies about some fish-out-of-water character winding up in New York (not even in a large city in general, SPECIFICALLY New York). It also got annoying very quickly how on-the-nose the humour was; it seemed whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie somehow thought the very simple jokes might go over the audience's heads, so after every single joke some character had to explain it. A perfect example of that is in the very first scene of the movie; when the main character was getting bathed by some women, and one of them rises out of the water directly in front of him, and it's implied that she was washing his g------. That's not that great a joke, but it would have been fine if they'd just left it at that. However, rather than just moving on, they have the girl say ""The Royal P---- is clean, your highness"", removing all subtlety and what little humour the scene actually had. I don't find any of Eddie Murphy's comedies all that funny, but this is the only one I've seen that I think is straight up bad.",Coming to America

(In the famous person wants to be with someone who WON'T hitch with him 'cause of what he is phase, oh and the 'Soul Glo' product looks like it's inspired by MJ's hair too is another sign.)

164,billkincaid,"Tiresome, Eddie Murphy not at his best",2,20 May 2015,"Eddie Murphy was at the peak of his career when he made this movie. Which says a lot about it - the studio was looking for an Eddie Murphy vehicle to get him into the theaters, stat, and they threw this mess together as a result. One might question the fantastic castle the prince lived in during his years in Africa, as Africa is not known for castles. Rather, he more likely lived in a mud hut, but one larger than the other mud huts in his village. The vanity that an African prince somehow lived in the same sort of luxury enjoyed by royalty in western Europe is an insult to the intelligence of the audience, who surely must notice the lack of programs about ""The Great Castles of Africa"" on the AWE channel. Next, there is the Bruce Lee-esque fighting the prince engages in during the altercation at the restaurant. Again, Africa has no known martial arts tradition. Certainly, there is plenty of violence in Africa, but the brutality of child soldiers swinging machetes and inter-tribal limb-lopping is far from what Eddie portrayed in the fight scene.I think there's a lot of wishful thinking in this movie. Much of it centers around wishing the studio could throw a bunch of audience-pandering into a script, stick a star's name on the poster, and make a fortune. In at least the profitability sense, they succeeded, but this is not a good movie. Sad that it's one of the best Eddie managed to make.",Coming to America

James from Good Times - John Amos and Mister Soul Glow himself - Eric LaSalle put in excellent performances as well.  Unfortunately, the critics and The Academy didn't think much of this film.  I guess the ultra-rich African theme didn't appeal to some.  The fact this movie plays regularly on syndicated TV over 10 years later proves this film is a classic.

175,AlexandreaCassandra,Eddie Murphy in his finest hour!,9,20 September 2009,"Eddie Murphy continued a string of 1980s Hollywood blockbusters with his 1988 comedy Coming To America. As far comedies go, this is a must see film with witty, timeless hilarity on full display. When Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy), heir to the royal throne of Zumunda, reaches the age of marriage, he is introduced to the woman who has been bred from birth to be his wife. But when Prince Akeem raises objections about the marriage to his father, King Jaffe Joffer (James Earl Jones), King Joffer agrees to delay the marriage while Akeem takes a trip abroad to ""sow his wild oats"". Desperate to avoid an arranged marriage, and find a woman who he loves and who loves him for the right reasons, Prince Akeem reveals his plan to his servant, Semmi (Arsenio Hall). Semmi agrees to travel abroad and assist Akeem in finding a wife he can respect for her intelligence and will. Spinning a globe, Akeem's finger lands on the best place in the world to find a queen - Queens, New York. Arriving in the middle of Queens, Akeem and Semmi settle into a rundown apartment complex in the ghetto and set about meeting as many women as possible. When their search is fruitless, an older man suggests they go to church to meet some good girls. While at a church gathering, Akeem's eye falls on Lisa McDowell (Shari Headley), daughter of Cleo McDowell (John Amos), founder of the Queens fast food establishment McDowell's (which bares an uncanny resemblance to the fast food restaurant McDonald's). Unfortunately, Lisa is dating Darryl Jenks, heir to his father's hair supply business and the most eligible bachelor in town according to Lisa's father and sister Patrice (Allison Dean). To get closer to Lisa, Akeem takes on a job at McDowell's where fellow employee Maurice (Louie Anderson) fills him in on the bright future beheld by a McDowell's employee. Forcing Semmi to work alongside him at McDowell's, Akeem and Semmi help foil a gunman (Samuel L. Jackson) who attempts to hold up the store. As Lisa and Akeem develop a relationship, her father disapproves - seeing Akeem as a dead-end immigrant with no future. When Semmi makes yet another request for King Joffer to send money, the King and entourage personally travel to New York to hunt for Prince Akeem. Cleo McDowell does a complete 180 when he realizes the wealth and power in the hands of his soon-to-be-son-in-law, but a union between Lisa and Akeem is bitterly opposed by King Joffer. He remains committed to bringing Akeem home where he marry the woman arranged for him at birth. But in the end, only Akeem and Lisa will decide who gets married to whom... An ingenious and utterly entertaining comedy, Coming To America ranks highly as one of Eddie Murphy's best films (if not his best). Only Beverly Hills Cop and 48 Hours come close to dethroning Prince Akeem and his search for a worthy bride. This is essential viewing for any comedy lover... The DVD Report",Coming to America
176,jszwed,Murphy's funniest! An '80s classic!,8,2 August 2001,"""Coming To America"" is an '80s classic!  It is one of my favorite movies. I probably have watched it over 30 times, and every time I do, I notice another subtle crack in the dialogue that I hadn't before.  Just the brief glances at the camera given by Murphy and others are enough to leave me in stitches.  And the cameos are hilarious.  The barbershop sequences are my favorite.  Just think how many careers were started with this movie: Aresenio Hall, Eriq LaSalle, Cuba Gooding Jr. (I just found out about that one).

181,aaronclemens,Hilarious romantic-comedy-drama with a great ensemble cast,10,5 February 2005,"Coming to America centers on the story of young prince, set up for an arranged marriage. He leaves his home in Africa to find a woman that he can truly love. Like all good tales, this one has already been told many times. It covers how a newcomer must adjust to a new culture, including encountering difficulties in the romance department, and fathers who just don't understand. This is all done to comedic effect, but not without romantic and dramatic overtones, to the credit of all involved.I could watch this movie every week (actually, I have been lately, since it's on CINEMAX). The writing and direction was fantastic, the film is perfectly paced, with constant sight gags and witty repartee. The film works because actors selected have great timing.Eddie Murphy (Akeem, et al) is quite versatile as the lead. He's in his very best form, earnest when he needs to in this feel-good comedy, with on-point comic timing.Shari Headley (Lisa McDowell), she's level headed, perfect in delivering outrage and frustration as well as contentment and laughter.Allison Dean (Princess in ""Cool as Ice"") as Patricia is not only hot, I love her nappturality hair styles. (Shari's got some nice ones too). Allison ideally portrays the jilted, petulant, and gold-digging little sister.Eriq La Salle (Darryl) is the outlandish villain you can actually feel sorry for. His Jeri curl, damn, it's atrocious.Arsenio Hall (Semmi, et al) was a great, smarmy, sidekick.I could go on and on. The supporting cast, from James Earl Jones (King Jaffe Joffer) and Madge Sinclair (Queen Aoleon) to Frankie Faison (Landlord) and Samuel L.

184,bfauvelle,Eddie Murphy's Best R-rated Movie,10,4 February 2006,"This is by far my favorite Eddie Murphy movie, and in my top five movie of all time. I have not seen as many of his 90's kiddie movies, so I can't pass judgment on those works.Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall with the many characters that they play steal the movie. The various ""alternate"" character skits, such as the barbershop, the black awareness rally, and the nightclub are comedic genius. Who has never heard of ""Sexual Chocolate""? Another scene that comes to mind is the one with Hall playing a transvestite in the nightclub and making an advance on Hall's coy African character.I have often wondered why Arsenio Hall didn't show up in more comedies considering how funny this movie turned out. I would have figured that he and Murphy could have made several ""multiple character"" comedies, not necessarily Coming to America sequels, and have been very successful. For one reason or another, Eddie Murphy decided to ""clean it up"" for the nineties.The star cast, including James Earl Jones, Eric La Salle (letting his soul glow), John Amos, and Louie Anderson are great as well. There is a cool cameo of a very young looking Samuel L. Jackson who plays a foul mouthed would-be robber who eventually gets ""thrashed"" by Murphy and Hall.The ending ends up in bit of a cliché, but the viewer really doesn't expect anything but. The movie is more about the comedic situations, not a complex love story.This is a movie, similar to Dumb and Dumber, in that if it is on TBS or another cable channel, it makes for an easy watch. This is despite the editing that is done for cable TV. The jokes do not get old (at least for me).And finally....""Your royal penis is clean, your highness.""",Coming to America

190,angelos1974,A Classic Gem,9,3 May 2019,"Plot: Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) of the fictional African kingdom of Zamunda, has, in his father King Jaffe Joffer's opinion, (played by the excellent James Earl Jones) reached the appropriate age to take a wife, in preparation for when it is his turn to take the throne. However, the wife chosen for him, although easy on the eye, does not have too much going on with regards to intelligence. Akeem decides that he will travel to the USA, of course to Queens, New York, where he is sure to find HIS queen. Along for the ride is his faithful servant Semmi (Arsenio Hall).This fairly simple plot may not seem like it will pave the way for a comedy masterpiece, but trust me, if you are one of the few who haven't seen this movie, you're in for a treat! First there's the top-notch cast, Eddie Murphy was at his comedic peak in the 80's, and he is simply excellent in the multiple roles he takes on here, a particular favourite of mine is Z-List ""celebrity"" Randy Watson, who's only claim to fame is appearing as Joe the Policeman, in a single episode of ""That's My Momma."" This is one of many subtle humorous observations that may get lost amongst the more blatant humour, and in my opinion, makes this movie one to be viewed multiple times, as you are sure to spot another hilarious comedy moment you missed the first time round.
Arsenio Hall also takes on multiple roles, my favourite one is Reverend Brown, the hilarious Reverend who, perhaps inappropriately enjoys looking at scantily clad women, and who delivers his sermons enthusiastically, with lines such as 'Now, I love the lord, and if lovin' the lord is wrong, I don't wanna be right!'
Although I have probably seen this film at least 20 times over the years, I find that if I ever come across it on TV, I just can't stop myself watching it again! Sure the humour may not be sophisticated, but I believe this film was made with one goal in mind, and that was to make the audience laugh, and all I can say is that if you don't laugh while watching this movie, you must be dead. It's your classic 'fish out of water' story, but it's done well. One of my all time favourites, and if you watch it, I think it will become one of yours!9/10",Coming to America
191,MartnSelms,"Coming to America: A Good Comedy, A Mediocre Film.",6,25 July 2018,"Coming to America (1988) knows what it wants to be, but fails to accomplish that goal. A movie with a story that was predictable from the beginning, Coming to America is an enjoyable movie, but suffers from its many flaws.Prince Akeem of Zamunda (Eddie Murphy), has been living an easy life as the son of the King of the fictional African country ""Zamunda"". When his parents set him up for an arranged marriage with the daughter of a rich Zamundan, Akeem refuses to marry her. With his servant Semmi (Arsenio Hall), Akeem decides to head out on a journey to the USA to find himself a real bride. When arriving in Queens, New York City, Akeem and Semmi find themselves surrounded by new people, places and ways of life to discover. Coming to America seems to be a light-hearted movie that's focused on making the audience smile, instead of delivering a great and memorable movie. However, it's not clear if this is what director John Landis was intending to do, with the movie suffering from mediocre directing and writing. For a movie with poor acting from supporting actors and extras and a generic script, Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall stand out from the rest of the cast with their sharp delivery and great comedic timing. Eddie Murphy shows why he is easily one of the most well-known comedians in the world right now with his great character work, and enthousiastic line delivery. This movie often features predictable and boring dialogue, delivered by questionable supporting actors that make it hard to get invested in their characters. The first half hour of the movie is enjoyable and keeps you interested in the story, and even though the pacing is alright, the movie quickly slows down as more characters and settings get introduced. The costume design and music make it easy for the viewer to adapt to the setting, compensating for often boring set design and cinematography. With a story as predictable as that of Coming to America, it's sad to see that this movie doesn't really bring anything new to the table on other fronts. However, the funny main characters, sharp comedic timing and good acting from Arsenio Hall and Eddie Murphy keep this movie fun, and make it enjoyable to watch.I give this movie a 6/10 and would recommend it to those who are looking for a fun experience without much consequence or drama.",Coming to America

Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall are both great in this movie playing a wide variation of characters. you can even see an early appearance of Cuba Godding Jr. I recently bought the film on DVD and the magic was back in better sound and quality, in the 11 years that has past I must have seen it 50 times it that good !.so if you havent seen this movie yet, don't waste no time run to the video store and get it you will not regret it.",Coming to America
198,junket-42186,"Trite, thinly-disguised cultural racism for cheap laughs.",1,18 March 2021,"A poor film that apes and parodies the African continent. Afro-Americans are not Africans. This is not a film about actors making jokes about what they know, or the communities they live in. This is just crass stereotyping and uninformed, petty bigotry of the worst kind. How many in the cast and crew lived in Africa for any amount of time?It seems most people are appalled by blackface (rightly so) and it's implications but the same people don't think about the message portrayed in this film and its implications. I see little difference between this and the other xenophobic rubbish of yesteryear. Trite thinly-disguised cultural racism for cheap laughs.",Coming to America

204,undsosache@hotmail.com,Probably the funniest movie ever,10,27 January 2004,"I had to buy it on DVD... I saw this movie about 100 time on VHS and I felt this movie has to make part of my ""digital-collection"". I saw it first time in theatre in the out-coming-year and the gags influenced my whole youth. Even nowadays (I'm 27 years old) I often talk about this movie with my friends. I simply love it like all the Eddie-Movies till and including ""Boomerang"".Where's the spoon? Aha...........",Coming to America

207,sinintasekou,the best movie ever,10,9 April 2011,"the movie "" coming to America"" is my favorite movie for several reasons. first of all that movie's sequencing, and also the wonderful actors that are playing in it such as Eddie Murphy make it really exceptional. i have watched that movie more than 20 times, and it is a good interpretation of some people in the United states, who are big personalities in their countries, but they are like everybody else in the US. I am not a prince back home in my country, but was having a better life and did not have to worry about so many things like i do now. Another interesting part of this movie is the African's accent imitation by these American's actors, and as African i have really enjoyed that part, and discovered how talented they are.",Coming to America
208,Randy_Watson_n_Sexual_Chocolate,Best Comedy Ever Made,10,26 September 2004,"I'm 19 years old now and I have seen this movies over a hundred times since i was like 5 and i laugh every time. For those of you looking to take this whole movie seriously, this is the wrong movie for you. This movie is all about making fun of preconceived notions and changing them around. It's about making fun of what you don't know. Oh yeah and if you don't get any of the jokes, well then you never will. This is not a movie for someone who doesn't know what a Jheri curl is. Or, a person who has never been to a black awareness pageant...LOLOL! Or a person who has never been to a barber shop. Or a person who has never been to New York City's other boroughs..Manhattan does not count. With all of that having been said, I would like to say this is one of Eddie Murphy's best movies (besides Boomerang LOL) and I only wish that he would make another movie like this. Here's to hoping and Happy watching!",Coming to America
209,Skhematics,This movie is a Classic comedy.,10,10 April 2005,"In my point of view one of Eddie Murphy's best early pieces of work, I truly loved this movie. The comedic timing was perfect for me, and this is one of a few movies I can watch over and over again each time finding something new to laugh at. The cast choice was great, I never thought of Arsenio Hall as an actor but he was great in this movie, the make-up in the movie was truly ahead of their time to the point you couldn't even tell that they (Eddie and Arsenio) were in make-up. I wish there were more movies out now like this movie. If you didn't like this movie you don't know real comedy. This movie is a true comedic classic. In closing I leave you with.Just let your SOOOOOUUULLL GLLOO! Feel that oh so silky smooth. Just let it shine through. Just let your SOOOOOUUULLL GLLOO!",Coming to America
210,easong5289,Rave review to this movie,9,31 May 2014,"This movie is about a prince of one of the African kingdom who moved to America with his servant. They disguised as poor people and worked at the hamburger restaurant to find the prince's true love who likes him just the way he is and stated to proposal to a confident black woman. I originally like romantic comedies but this movie is different from others because all of the characters in the movie except only two are black. Eddie Murphy, the main character of this movie makes me have a similar feeling with Will Smith in the movie ""Mr. Hitch"". In addition, I was surprised at the fact that each 4 roles were acted by the prince and his servant. I thought the story was a little far-fetched but also realistic because of its concept of African prince which is unfamiliar to me. I would like to recommend you to watch this movie when you want to feel fun and impression at the same time.",Coming to America
211,LarryRothfork,A comedy with profound life messages,10,27 February 2020,"No use repeating everything others have already said about the stars and the movie...most of them see it as I do...great performances in a great movie, in so many respects. But the stunning star that seems to have gotten overlooked is Shari Headley. She easily transitions from subtle flirtiness, with those eyes, and that voice, to a molten, melting furnace of female sexuality..She is easily a 10 in every respect....Whoa!!",Coming to America
212,mattw-51167,Brilliant!,10,3 April 2015,"Very intelligent way to write a silly movie. Laughing all the way through. The quotable lines in this film are never ending. The James Earl Jones character was spot on. No one else could've pulled it off. Murphy is so versatile. He must've played 10 parts in this film. The storyline was interesting and the buildup was just the proper length. The scenery was beautiful even if cgi. The chemistry between murphy and hall is evident through the entirety of the film. The chemistry between murphy and his love interest is also evident even though I don't believe they ever worked together. For a comedy, there are twists, turns, and drama that kept me interested the whole movie. This is a must see!",Coming to America
213,kayco-51768,A romantic comedy,10,5 May 2016,"Coming to America is a romantic comedy starred by comedian Eddy Murphy, and starred by actress and actors Arsenio Hall, John Amos, James Earl Jones, and Shari Headley. Coming to America was produced by George Falsey Jr. and Robert D. Wachs on June 29, 1988. In the film Coming to America, Akeem Joffer, a royal prince has become tired of his daily life, so he wants to pursue the life of his own. Akeem plans to come to America to find a nice wife that he can both love and respect. Akeem and his best friend flip a coin and that decided the city which Akeem would go, which is New York City. Seeking for a wife, Akeem plans to meet a girl who loves him for who he is and not because he's rich and also because of his prince status. Will he find that ideal women? Coming to America's cinematography is outstanding from the sound, to the dialogue, to the visual effects, to the editing of plot. The dialogue was very comical. The visual effects were very clear and precise. The writers of Coming to America made a clear theme of the movie and the movie carried a very interesting plot. Coming to America have two major essential themes. The first theme of the movie is loving someone for who they are and not for their money and wealth. Akeem's appointed lover Imani was a big gold digger. She loved him for money and wealth. Akeem knew she wasn't a real woman. Another theme discussed in the movie is that money doesn't buy happiness. In the beginning of the movie, Akeem is fed up with the life of a prince and wants to enjoy a real life. He was in for a treat when he moved to America. I give this movie a 10/10! It is a very good movie filled with comedy and romantic scenes. Children ask parents before watching this movie.",Coming to America
214,music-61,Eddie Murphy's best movie and one of the best comedies in film,10,30 September 2006,"There is so much about this movie to love. Eddie's characters and the support of Arsenio Hall were magic. James Earl Jones was a perfect fit. I think I love this movie as much for it's reflection of the eighties as the seemingly innocent nature of Akeem.It's all so memorable that i find myself talking along with the movie. Eric Le Salle is his usual charming self, in character of course, and John Amos is just great. Overall it's a classic movie and fun for everybody and if you grew up in the time period, especially in the tri-state area, you will get flashbacks like crazy.",Coming to America
