0,TheLittleSongbird,Clashing matches,3,19 December 2019,"Despite its negative critical reception, that didn't stop me from seeing 'Gemini Man'. The idea was really interesting and with the right execution could have been thrilling, inventive, thoughtful and emotional. Ang Lee has done some great work, 'Brokeback Mountain', 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', 'The Ice Storm' and 'Sense and Sensibility' being favourites ('Life of Pi' needs a re-watch but remember liking that too). Also don't consider Will Smith a bad actor, quite a likeable one in the right roles.As much as it pains me to say it, 'Gemini Man' is as severely disappointing as has been said. Don't think it is that awful and there are far worse films out there, but it is a sad waste of a good idea and neither Lee or Smith are well served. Smith comes off better and compared to almost everything else he comes off reasonably well, he has been in and done worse than 'Gemini Man' ('After Earth' anyone?) but is a much better performer than this. This is a very strong contender for a career worst for Lee, actually found it more disappointing than 'Hulk' which left me in shock after watching that he was the one responsible for the four great (more than great actually) films cited.'Gemini Man' is beautifully and atmospherically photographed and similarly boasts production and set design that had more imagination than what was everywhere else. While not much may unforgettably stand out in the music score, it at least fitted with the atmosphere, didn't over-bear that it swamped everything and sounded appealing on the ears.Smith is a commanding and amiable presence and actually the cast did quite well with what they were given and considering what they were given, which would be beneath anybody. The ossuary brawl is spectacular.Lee however is completely out of his depth, he fails to bring any energy or freshness to material that was in dire need of both and material too that his directing style, which has too much of a heavy hand here, is not particularly well suited for. There is an overuse of special effects and it is sad to say that it is agreed that the effects are not very good. Actually thought that they looked like they were made in a rush and on the too cheap side, like they were going for quantity and not quality. So much so that they looked fake amongst everything else, Junior was very cheap looking, and it is such a shame because the rest of the production values looked great.David Benioff's script really sinks 'Gemini Man'. There is absolutely no substance to it, non-stop blandness more like, and quite a lot of it is very difficult to take seriously, so unnatural sounding and cheesy to the point of being juvenile. Instead of being deep in thought one is likely perhaps to be trying not to laugh, plus it can sound quite old-fashioned. The story had a cool idea but does nothing really new or imaginative with it, with some obvious and shoehorned in plot turns, only sporadically thrilling but mostly workmanlike at best (mostly lacking lustre) action (the ossuary brawl excepted) and the execution of an idea that sounded inventive on paper is too ordinary and familiar. The characters, despite the best efforts of the cast, are very sketchy in development and basically genre ciphers and not much more.In conclusion, great potential but misses it by a mile. 3/10",Gemini Man
1,SnoopyStyle,faking it,4,1 November 2020,"Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is a sniper assassin working for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). After his latest kill, he's starting to consider retirement. Private contractor mogul Clay Verris (Clive Owen) intends to kill him for a nefarious reason. Danny Zakarewski (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is an operative sent to monitor Brogan but ends up being a loose thread.There is a rushed exposition which is too simple and too convoluted. The CGI looks like a video game cut scene. The younger Will looks fine but it's a reminder of the fakeness of this movie. That's the keyword for this movie. It's fake. Everything feels a little fake. That's not fatal but it is detrimental. Winstead has a good turn as a side kick and I'm glad that she's not doing a romance. That would be even more fake. Even the science feels fake. This is not the worst movie but it's terribly flawed.",Gemini Man
2,Prismark10,Gemini Man,3,4 August 2020,"By the time the end credits rolled. I had to remind myself that this action movie was directed by a two time Best Director Oscar winner.Ang Lee must have thought that if Sam Mendes could slum it by directing a Bond movie then he could do the same.Well Ang Lee did make the Hulk back in 2003. A comic strip art movie, one of the more visually interesting early Marvel adaptations.Gemini Man is simply Ang Lee taking the money and running. It is a generic but dull action adventure with some pretty locations. Most of it was shot in central Europe.Will Smith plays hitman Henry Brogan who calls it a day as his skills are slipping due to him getting older.Brogan learns that the agency who sent him down for his final hit lied to him. His target was not a bio terrorist as they claimed. Soon Brogan finds himself being hunted by an assassin who looks like a younger version of himself. He has been cloned.With the help of a female rookie agent Danny Zakarweski (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who was meant to keep an eye on Brogan. Both go on the run knowing that their former bosses have turned on them.Despite a few good action scenes, a lot of it was a crashing bore. There was a scene with another clone but it was very much a tribute Terminator act.",Gemini Man

But soon he learns that he was lured by his governmental agency DIA and the victim was not a terrorist. Further, he finds that he is under surveillance of the rookie agent Danny Zakarweski (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) by his chiefs Janet Lassiter (Linda Emond) and Clay Verris (Clive Owen). When his friends are murdered, Henry concludes that Clay wants to kill him and flees with Danny to Colombia. But soon Henry is hunted down by a top assassin called Junior and when he sees his face, he has a great surprise.""Gemini Man"" is an entertaining action sci-fi directed by Ang Lee. The plot is predictable but enjoyable and the special effects are top-notch. The action scenes are excellent and Will Smith is excellent in a double-role. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Projeto Gemini (""Gemini Project"")",Gemini Man
4,nogodnomasters,"To the next war, which is no war",8,19 October 2019,"Plot spoiler.
Harry (Will Smith) is retiring as a sniper assassin who worked for the DIA. He discovers his last hit was not a terrorist but a good guy with a ""spiked file."" He, and everyone he comes in contact with, are now a target by the company ""Gemini"" who is a private firm special ops. They are also called Gemini (plot spoiler) because they made a clone of Harry who happens to be the kid assassin who is after him.
I first thought this was a miscast as a sniper assassin would have been better played by Denzel Washington. The film turned out to be less action and more drama/thriller. This was not the typical smart alec Will Smith role and thank you for keeping your son out of the feature.Guide: No sex. 1 F-words. Nudity (Theodora Miranne )",Gemini Man
5,kosmasp,Wanting too much,5,15 January 2020,"Apart from major failings of our main villain, there are also many other holes in the story. And while the movie tries to overshadow them by pacing and just hoping no one notices ... well most viewers will. Question is if they care or not. Do you? Only you can answer. Only you will be able to say if you mind Will Smith being unable to recognize ... Will Smith! And either you already know what I'm talking about or not, I won't spoil it.Technically it's really good, it's just the story that really should bother you. If you don't mind go ahead, this is quite mindless fun you can have. Just roll with it and never question anything.",Gemini Man
6,classicsoncall,"""Don't you think your country deserves a perfect version of you?""",7,22 October 2020,"The film starts out as an action/adventure movie and turns into a sci-fi flick. The sci-fi piece has to do with human cloning, and though it might be possible some day, it just didn't feel right in the story for me. What it leads to is actor Will Smith in a dual role, playing both a present day and a younger version of himself, done presumably with de-aging technology. In this case it worked pretty well, the young Will Smith looks how I remember him at least. Still, it felt like a gimmicky thing to do in a story where a couple of rogue government agents (Clive Owen, Linda Emond) select an assassination target for Henry Brogan (Smith), and then turn the tables on him because the target was a molecular biologist, and not a terrorist. The 'Gemini' piece of the title comes into play as the name of the cloning project undertaken by Clay Verris (Owen), otherwise it wouldn't make much sense, as you get the impression that Will Smith's character should be the Gemini Man. There's an incredible motorcycle chase that I thought was the highlight of the picture, even if some of it was CGI enhanced. And for assassination film junkies, there's a new term that enters the lexicon every time Brogan AMF's a bad guy - 'Adios, Mo' Fo', although the latter part of that gets the full treatment. Director Ang Lee borrows from his Marvel comic book adaptation of ""The Incredible Hulk"" in the final chapter of the story with an appearance by a character that looks like a meld between Spider-Man and Ghost Rider. Wouldn't you know it, it's yet another, but younger clone of Brogan and Junior. A series of sequels could keep this going forever.",Gemini Man
7,jboothmillard,Gemini Man,4,19 October 2019,"When I saw the trailer for this film, I must admit, I was amazed how technology made the leading actor look younger, but then I heard mixed opinions, especially about the lack of story, but I was prepared to give it a chance anyway, from director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Brokeback Mountain, Life of Pi). Basically, aging government assassin Henry Brogan (Will Smith) has become disillusioned with killing. This becomes clear during a mission to assassinate a terrorist on a moving train, he avoids killing a young girl, and shoots the man in the neck, but was aiming for his head. After retiring from service, Henry decides to rent a boat, and connects with rental manager Danny Zakarweski (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He also reconnects with an old friend, Jack Willis (Douglas Hodge) who tells him that the man he shot on the train was innocent. Jack was told this by informant Yuri Kovacs (Ilia Volok), Henry demands proof and asks Jack to arrange a meeting. With Henry aware of the deception, Clay Varris (Clive Owen), head of a top-secret black ops unit codenamed ""GEMINI"", is denied permission to kill Henry by agency director Janet Lassiter (Linda Emond). Henry realises that Danny is a fellow agent sent to monitor him, but they become friends. Government agents break into Henry's home, and his spotter, along Jack and his mistress are killed. Henry warns Danny and they evade an attack, killing the assassins sent after them, and learn that the agency wants them both dead. Henry and Danny escape to Colombia, meeting Henry's former colleague Baron (Benedict Wong), they plan to meet Yuri for further options. Meanwhile, Clay dispatches his top assassin to kill Henry. Fighting him off, Henry realises the assassin sent bears an uncanny resemblance to himself as a young man, with a similar skill set. Following a brutal chase, the injured assassin goes to a safehouse, he is revealed to be Clay's adopted ""son"" Junior (Smith, de-aged). Although he is curious about his similarities to Henry, Junior is ordered to finish the job. Henry is also troubled by his similarities to the assassin, he denies to Danny that he might be his biological child. Danny has DNA samples recovered from Junior tested and discovers that his and Henry's DNA are identical - Junior is Henry's younger clone. Henry is desperate for answers and meets with Yuri in Hungary, he tells him about the ""GEMINI"" cloning project and that the man he killed on the train was one of the its scientists. The scientist wanted to leave the project, after methods were designed to produce clones with no pain or emotion, he was killed after being discovered. Henry calls Lassiter, intending to try and get Junior to go against Clay. Lassiter agrees to send Junior to bring Danny safely back to the United States. Junior collects Danny, but sets a trap for Henry, but she manages to warn him using a hidden listening device. Henry ambushes Junior, and explains that he is a clone, convincing him by revealing their similar traits that no one else could know. Junior is heartbroken and returns to GEMINI, he confronts Clay, who claims that he must defeat Henry in order to surpass him. But Junior decides to ally with Henry to bring Clay down, and Henry urges him to quit and become someone better. Baron is killed in an ambush ordered by Clay, but Junior knocks out Clay in a fight, and many GEMINI operatives are defeated. Henry, Danny and Junior go against another clone with no pain or emotions but manage to kill him. Clay is defeated but tries to justify his actions towards Junior, who almost shoots him. Henry persuades Junior otherwise and kills Clay himself, having already lived with the heavy burden. Henry ensures that there are no more clones that were produced and that they are finally free from harm. Junior has been enrolled into college under the new identity of ""Jackson Brogan"", Henry and Danny help Jackson to plan his future. Also starring Ralph Brown as Del Patterson. Smith is only reasonable as the fifty-something professional killer, and equally in his Fresh Prince image, Winstead is okay, and Owen is a bit one-dimensional as the villain. The idea for this film had been in development since the 1990s, never going into proper development, with technology at the level it is now, there is no doubt that technical achievement is fantastic. There are some reasonable chases, guns blazing and explosions, but then it is taken up by an unconvincing script and plot, the chatty scenes definitely slow it down, the novelty of two versions of Smith onscreen wears thin, and it is just too much style over substance, a good idea not done very well, a disappointing action thriller. Okay!",Gemini Man
8,paul_haakonsen,Hardly an outstanding or memorable movie...,4,21 November 2019,"I skipped the first invitation to watch ""Gemini Man"" in the cinema, as I can't really claim to have much of any interest in the movie's concept, nor am I am big fan of Will Smith either. But eventually I found my way to the movie, as I was given another chance and I had the time.And I must say that I got through the movie, but I wasn't particularly entertained. Sure, the movie is watchable and does have some good enough action sequences, but the storyline was just too mundane for me. It wasn't riveting enough for me and the entire plot just felt mediocre.As for Will Smith, well this hardly was the pinnacle of his acting career, and the CGI enhanced younger version of himself in the movie was just not convincing. Some of the scenes looked good, whereas others it looked so abysmal and fake that even a blind person would stop and go ""aw come on, that was so fake"".What did work for the movie, however, was Clive Owen, just a shame that they didn't give him more screen time, because he would have been able to lift up the movie experience so much more.While ""Gemini Man"" certainly is watchable and provides pseudo-adequate entertainment, it was hardly an outstanding movie, much less a memorable movie. Is it a movie that has enough contents to warrant more than a single viewing? Hardly so. Definitely not for me, but perhaps for hardcore fans of Will Smith.My rating of ""Gemini Man"" is a less than mediocre four out ten stars.",Gemini Man
9,Quinoa1984,It's fine... and it could be more,5,11 October 2019,"So, at first, I was thinking while watching this ho-hum CIA betrayal script unfold with skillfull-but-soulless direction from Ang Lee and starring three actors - Will Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Clive Owen, who are in 'we'll do what we can with what we got, best we can, which may be variable depending on the scene', that this could've been ripe stuff that someone like Paul Verhoeven (in the 1990's especially) would have made into the stuff of iconic  weird-clone-action stuff of legend, that even if he took like 90% of the script and just shot it. But then it occurred to me, in particular in the last act, that what this most reminded me of - or what I wanted to be at home watching (again) instead - was The Boys, the new Amazon series that has some key elements that can't help but be comparable involving government-science experiments on Super-Killing-People, and then consequences when one person who looks as the ""Parent"" see their progenitor go a little... off.I may be off in that comparison, or I may be giving Gemini Man too much credit in even comparing the two. The fact is though, this movie has a lot going for it, or at least some semblance of potential, and it isn't all unrealized. The flow of this movie is that the first quarter to third, being the set-up, is largely flat and only somewhat interesting because Smith and Winstead have OK chemistry (not great, but OK, passable, a GED level - Good Enough Diploma level); then, once the two Will Smiths discover each other, as the younger Clone is sent to kill the older one (aka ""Clay Jr"", named after Owen's super-villain with his Gemini program), their scenes together - Smtih acting off Smith - is actually incredible and full of emotion that may/may not be earned but, who cares, Smith(s) sells it; and then the last act becomes... kind of just another crap action movie, with one particular twist that gives Ang Lee a few minutes to try and flex the old comic-book movie muscles, which feels just goofy and, frankly, if I want to see this, I can check out Winter Soldier again (or, for that matter, that wonderfully dopey five minutes of Avengers: Endgame where Cap fights himself).Anyway, what Gemini Man is, for all of its slick beats and a pretty cool motorcycle chase, something that just doesn't carry much life to it. It's not something that's so awful that one will go to social media and make it into a larger deal than it is (like a certain other movie out right now), nor does it feel fresh. It *should*, but I think a lot of that has to do with a perfectly serviceable, and at least half of the time unremarkable, screenplay that has David Benioff's strengths and weaknesses on full display. I wanted more of the HEART of this matter of what Jr was going through, and perhaps there could have been a whole other movie just set in the world of the Gemini program (a hint of it is seen when we get a glimpse at how the training program runs almost like, well, a giant darn Blockbuster movie production - though in this case to send off super-killers to other countries for ""bad"" deeds).At the end of the day, though, this is just... Fine. There. What it is. And, frankly, I expect more of everyone here; it sounds cruel to say that a filmmaker doesn't have his heart in it, a feat that takes years out of someone's life, but here we are. I miss the Ang Lee of The Ice Storm, Brokeback Mountain and Lust, Caution. Get back to drama, dude, it suits you like purple on Prince.",Gemini Man

11,hitchcockthelegend,"You made a person out of another person, then you sent me to kill him. You made a choice to do this to me.",6,10 July 2020,"Gemini Man is directed by Ang Lee and co-written by David Benioff and Darren Lemke. It stars Will Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Clive Owen and Benedict Wong. Music is by Lorne Balfe and cinematography by Dione Beebe.Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is an aging but elite assassin who's ready to call it quits. However, his plans are put on hold when he suddenly becomes the target of a mysterious operative who can seemingly predict his every move. The assassin who stalks him has a very familiar feel to him...Lets not beat around the bush, Smith and Winstead deserve a better screenplay than this. The writing is weak and lazy, Lee is clearly the wrong director for such a high concept action film, while the action scenes are shoddy in effects. In fact the storyline, as trite as it is, is unfairly in a constant battle against the CGI on show.However, film never sits still and refuses to let boredom take a hold. The lead actors are engaging enough to hold attention throughout, and even as the sugary coatings fill out the final throes, we at least can acknowledge there were earnest intentions to make an existential clone thriller here. But with Jerry Bruckheimer on production you can see there's a popcorn action film trying to break free of the literary treacle.Hardly the worst clone sci-fier that some have called it, but it's not memorable either. Think of it more as a time filler for the curious about the subject to hand. 6/10.",Gemini Man
12,CinemaSerf,Doesn't justify the panning....,5,17 October 2019,"Ok, so it isn't going to trouble any Oscar or BAFTA juries but it is quite a watchable 2 hours of special effects and fisticuffs in the same vein as ""The Mechanic"". Will Smith still has just enough charisma to carry this off. Sure, it is all predictable stuff and Clive Owen still performs with all the animation of the wooden horse in ""Troy"" but the precept is interesting nonetheless.",Gemini Man
13,zardoz-13,Day of the Evil Clone,5,20 October 2019,"If you missed the trailers for Will Smith's futuristic nail-biter ""Gemini Man,"" then the surprise about an hour into this globe-trotting, stunt-laden saga might surprise you. Had you seen the trailers, you'd know what was in store, so it isn't quite the revelation it might have been. You'd think Paramount Pictures would have been more circumspect about this grand slam of a spoiler. Whatever the case, either cease reading or forever grind your teeth. A heavy-handed, formulaic melodrama, ""Gemini Man"" concerns cloning and killing humans without scruples.Specifically, an older as well as a younger Will Smith dodge each other's bullets in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" director Ang Lee's fifteenth film. The CGI version of the younger Will Smith, appropriately christened Junior, is impeccable. Further, the ""Men in Black"" star betrays no signs of acting with a CGI double. According to the Internet Movie Database, ""Goosebumps'"" scribe Darren Lemke's clone versus human screenplay made the rounds about 20 years ago in Tinseltown before ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" writer David Benioff and ""Overlord's"" Billy Ray most recently rewrote it!Reportedly, over time, actors such as Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Sean Connery, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Brad Pitt, and Tom Cruise had been approached to star in this movie. Sadly, the CGI technology available then was not deemed practical. Meanwhile, you may have seen one, if not all three films about older men battling their younger clones. Among them was the 2001 Jean-Claude Van Damme thriller ""Replicant,"" the tenth Trek movie ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" (2002), and Hugh Jackson's final X-Men epic ""Logan"" (2017). Half of the problem with ""Gemini Man"" is it takes itself far too seriously when you consider all its bizarre elements.The best U.S. Government assassin decides to retire before he gets retired. No sooner has our patriotic protagonist, Henry Brogan (Will Smith of ""Suicide Squad""), stowed his hardware than he finds lead swarming around him like hornets Moreover, the guy ordered to ice Henry resembles him! In ""Gemini Man's"" only memorable scene, director Ang Lee orchestrates a swerving, adrenaline-laced motorcycle chase with the assailant in hot pursuit of the hero through traffic on a winding two-lane street. The younger Smith smacks around the older Smith with his stolen motorcycle's rear tire, as if he were smacking him with both sides of his hand back and forth in rapid succession. Afterward, the assailant propels the whole motorcycle at him, and the bike knocks Henry down!Meantime, everything else appears routine in their cat & mouse maneuvers when they tangle each other in various foreign locales. Perhaps the most unforgettable moment in ""Gemini Man"" is the groan-inducing final surprise near fade out. Clearly, Will Smith dreads the encroachment of middle age, but he should fear more the quality of his films. ""Gemini Man"" suffers by comparison with director Tony Scott's ""Enemy of the State"" (1998), an earlier exercise in espionage that Smith toplined.""Gemini Man"" opens with a suspenseful blast in sunny Belgium. Henry Brogan calculates the shot of a lifetime at a bullet train as it streaks through the countryside like a lightning-fast mechanical worm. The target on the train sitting next to the window is supposed to be a biochemist, Valery Dormov (Igor Szasz of ""Trezor""), who has turned terrorist. Brogan's spotter aboard the train, Marino (E.J. Bonilla of ""Mamitas""), provides Henry with all the statistics crucial to his shot. At the last moment, a child enters our hero's line of fire, and Henry waits patiently as the seconds elapse before the train streaks into a tunnel. Nevertheless, once the girl is clear, Henry nails the rogue biochemist with a spectacular shot. No, he doesn't obliterate his brains. Instead, his bullet skewers Dormov's neck and kills him!The experience leaves a bad taste in Henry's mouth, and he worries that his 73rd kill may be a hint for him to quit. Later, one of his old pals from his Marine Corps days, Jack Willis (Douglas Hodge of ""Red Sparrow""), invites him out to his yacht and reveals the biochemist's real identity to Henry. More to his surprise than our surprise, Henry discovers he had been duped about the identity of his target. Naturally, our hero hates it that his own people lied to him. Initially, he reprimands his go-between contact, Del Patterson (Ralph Brown of ""Amistad""), about the biochemist's falsified dossier. Patterson proclaims his innocence.Now, Henry ponders the possibility his superior, Janet Lassiter (Linda Emond of ""Across the Universe""), has double-crossed him. Now, he starts looking over his shoulder. What Henry doesn't know is he is in the crosshairs of a dastardly private contractor, Clay Varris (Clive Owen of ""Killer Elite""), who runs a top-secret black ops unit codenamed ""GEMINI."" Earlier, Varris killed Henry once when he drowned him, but he managed to revive Henry with a defibrillator.""Gemini Man"" amounts to just another paranoid assassin whose bosses refuses to let him quit without a frontal lobotomy with lead. Along the way, Henry picks up a friend and a cohort in the marina's boat rental manager. Danny Zakarweski (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"") poses as a college marine biology student. Actually, she is an undercover Defense Intelligence Agency operative who eventually breaks down under Henry's relentless interrogation. She is surprised when she finds herself tagged to be eliminated, too! Happily, Danny is one tough cookie, and she handles firearms as skillfully as a majorette twirls a baton. ""Gemini Man"" plunges down a predictable path from fade in to fade out. You can guess what's going to happen before it occurs. You know the hero is neither going to die, nor will he cap his clone with extreme prejudice. Apart from an abrasive motorcycle chase, the camaraderie between Henry and Danny keeps things energetic. They make a good team as they think their way into a predicament and then shoot their way out of it. Unfortunately, ""Gemini Man"" boils down to a conventional second-rate thriller with a contrived gimmick.",Gemini Man
14,oscaralbert,Most of America has been totally perplexed . . .,8,22 October 2019,". . . since Jan. 20, 2017, about how there can be more than nine million ""peace keepers,"" ""service people,"" and other government employees--ALL of them sponging off we taxpayers AFTER taking a sacred oath to ""Preserve and Protect the U.S. Constitution""--without ANY of them lifting a finger to stop ""Mad Dog"" Putin's Red Commie KGB puppet as he systematically destroys our American Homeland piece-by-piece under the insidious daily marching orders coming directly from the nefarious Kremlin. Well, the whistleblowers behind GEMINI MAN have FINALLY spilled the beans about this conundrum: Most if not all of those nine million malingering miscreants are ""Pod People,"" or soulless replacement clones emanating from a devilish KGB-controlled super top secret Pachyderm Party Program initiated in the 1900s. As GEMINI MAN documents, each clone's first order of business is to murder and vaporize their original. So the next time that YOU run across a local cop, alleged ""service person,"" or a corrupt Pachyderm Secretary of State (that is, vote rigging supervisor) in a state which has suddenly and inexplicably turned ""Purple"" (and whose leering teeth are now far too perfect, given all of the playground brawls that they were at the center of during their elementary school recesses), remember that it's NOT an actual human being ""person"" standing in front of you, but a totally amoral killer clone who'll get you--unless you have the courage to get them first!",Gemini Man
15,view_and_review,Cloning and Gov't Corruption,6,14 October 2019,"At its core, Gemini Man is about cloning and government corruption-two things that have been explore multiple times already in Hollywood. So the question is: how is Gemini Man better or more unique than those other movies?It really isn't with the exception of the young Will Smith. They did an excellent job with the 23-year-old version of Will Smith less some minor flaws (mainly the mouth). Unlike many actors we have an abundance of video footage of Will Smith from his younger days (we can watch reruns of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air almost anytime). Moving past the excellent visual graphics and the story is a run-of-the-mill story with some slightly above average action.Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is an elite sniper that can hit any target (much like the character Deadshot in Suicide Squad). He has done his last job for the U.S. government but due to some knowledge he came into the U.S. government (or at least a rogue part of it) cannot allow him to retire in peace. It will take more than the average elite kill teams to take care of Brogan and that's where the clone comes in.The action was mildly entertaining. It was a combination of acrobatics and intelligent moves but nothing to really distinguish itself. The story provided nothing thought provoking, eye opening, or surprising.

The action is OK if unexceptional.

And I spent some time thinking that the 20-something leading lady reminded me of Mary Elizabeth Winstead, only to discover that it was her!

17,ferguson-6,we still need actors,5,11 October 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Usually after watching a movie, I spend some time thinking about the story, the performances, the visual effects, the music, the sets, the costumes, and any other piece of the puzzle that makes up that particular movie going experience. However, Oscar winning director Ang Lee's (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, LIFE OF PI) new film creates a challenge. In addition to those previously mentioned factors, the ground-breaking new technology must also be addressed - both separately and in conjunction with how it works in the movie.If you've seen the trailer, or even the poster, you know that there is an ""old"" Will Smith and a ""young"" Will Smith. The basic story is that Henry Brogan (old Will Smith) is a retiring DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) assassin who is being hunted by his own government. The one doing the hunting is Junior, a ""young"" clone of Henry Brogan. What you may not know is that this is not accomplished through the typical de-aging process that has become so popular in Hollywood. Nope, this Junior is actually digital animation from Weta Digital in New Zealand. It's not even really Will Smith - it's a digital creation that looks almost identical to the Will Smith from ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" (1990-96), minus the wide grin and funky clothes. It's very impressive technology, but not yet to the point where it can replace living, breathing, emoting actors.
However, it's pretty obvious that day is coming.What's also obvious is that this script is a mess, and despite the new generation of technology, this film seems dated ... well at least the story seems that way. Darren Lemke (SHAZAM!) first published the screenplay in the mid-1990's and it has ""almost"" made it to production on a few occasions. Writers David Benioff (THE KITE RUNNER) and Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS) are credited on this final, mostly disappointing version. The dialogue is lame and character development is non-existent. We are never provided a reason to give a hoot about old Henry. Junior is never more than a video game creation. And DIA Agent Danny Zakarweski (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) seems to be an afterthought when someone realized the film needed a female presence. Clive Owen plays Clay Verris, the mastermind/mad scientist with little more than a scowl, though Benedict Wong brings a jolt of life to his Baron role as a pilot friend of Henry.We do get to see some of the world. The initial sequence takes us on Henry's final mission. It's his 72nd kill, and it occurs from a grassy knoll in Belgium through a window on a bullet train going 228 mph. Henry heads back to his isolated lake cabin in Buttermilk Sound, Georgia where his peaceful retirement lasts about 3 scenes. Soon, we are headed to Columbia for a crazy motorcycle chase, and then on to the catacombs in Budapest - an idea that provides a welcome dose of inspiration.High-speed parkour, blurry close-up fight scenes, rooftop shootouts, and a hyper motorcycle chase through town all have an air of familiarity, which is something this type of film should strive to avoid. Rian Johnson's LOOPER toyed with us using a young and old version of the same character, and though that was time travel and not cloning, the ideas are too similar for this one to come across as unique. Oscar winning cinematographer Dion Beebe (MEMORIES OF A GEISHA) delivers the shots - down to the crystal clear logos on beer and soda - but we never really experience the thrill that new technology should deliver. It should also be noted that no theatre in America is equipped to show this in the way Ang Lee filmed it: 4K 3D 120fps HFR format ... leaving us wondering, what's the point?",Gemini Man
18,phd_travel,Some good points but tedious at times,6,10 October 2019,"There is a some good and some bad in this movie about a hit man fighting his clone.
Some good points:
The effects / make up for Will Smith are very effective. Really made him look younger in a natural way.
Lots of Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She has an intelligent and believable look for the role.
Colombia and Budapest look very nice. The fight scene with MEW looked quite good. The chase through Cartajena was exciting.
Benedict Wong wasn't a goofy pidgin speaking Asian caricature.
Bad points:
Draggy moments in between the action.
After the initial novelty of him talking to and fighting his clone wore off, it got quite soppy and tedious towards the end. David Benioff tsk tsk tsk.
Some action especially the final fight scenes looked like they were from a Chinese kung fu movie. Ang Lee's touch.
I get why Clive Owen's character wanted to create clones. The reasons make some sense. But still didn't get why he wanted to kill the original Will Smith character so much. For a thinking action movie it doesn't succeed,
It's an okay watch but flawed.",Gemini Man
19,siderite,"Completely mediocre, but not bad",7,12 January 2020,"They must have seen the irony in making a movie about somebody being ""evil"" for cloning someone and using CGI to clone the star actor, right? I am gonna spare you the anguish and tell you right now that CGI is still creepy and I've seen deep fakes that were better, but they did a good job making a younger Will Smith. Does it mean he now lives forever regardless if the original actor dies? Who knows? But what we can be sure is that whatever incarnation will replace him, it will have no conscience, feel no fear, be the perfect actor.OK, enough with the shade. The action scenes are pretty good and the tension is maintained, even if the characters are cardboard. The cast is too good for this script, for sure - hey, maybe it wasn't them at all! da da daaam! - but the movie was entertaining. Nothing above average, though.",Gemini Man

21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Buy one get one free.,6,13 October 2019,"The visual effects in 'Gemini Man (2019)' are genuinely impressive, usually staying on the right side of the uncanny valley despite being completely digital. It's perhaps a weird choice not to use traditional 'de-ageing' technology to craft Smith's clone, as that would arguably allow for a more natural performance, but the complete recreation usually works surprisingly well. Of course, there are moments in which it feels decidedly unrealistic, especially when it's running around like a literal cartoon character or is attempting to heavily emote. It's worth noting that I viewed the movie in 2D, as '3D-plus' was unavailable. The 3D effects are still clearly visible, with shallow depth of field and plenty of foreground elements cropping up every couple of minutes. There's also a bizarre shot in which a fish-eye lens is used to bend the centre of frame, presumably to give the moment a 3D pop. The whole thing seems decidedly digital, too; there's no grain and most movements seem slightly too sharp. Some action scenes are peppered with full-on CG stuntmen, even for the old Smith, and some longer shots are quite clearly stitched together from a number of shorter takes. For the most part, the sound design is excellent. The gunshots, in particular, sound great. The score is uninspired and, sometimes, quite cheesy, though. It's a relatively poor effort from Balfe. The piece doesn't have a great story, either. The plot is ever-so-slightly convoluted but is also really basic. The affair doesn't have a distinct tone, flipping from flippant to self-serious in seconds, and the comedy rarely ever lands. Some characters are also introduced as if we're supposed to know who they are, popping in as old-friends whom we've never actually met. A lot of the narrative is told rather than shown, too. Thankfully, there's some decent emotion when it comes to the two-lead dynamic and the villain, despite being a proverbial moustache-twirler, has an understandable point of view. Most of the action sequences are quite fun, especially a cat-and-mouse chase/shootout and catacomb-based hand-to-hand fight. The CG sometimes gets in the way of believability, but there's also a nice focus on pain that's not always seen in this type of stuff. The flick is, I suppose, rather nineties. It has a fairly bad script and a silly central conceit, but it's entertaining enough to feel worth your time. It isn't particularly memorable, however. It almost goes in one ear and out the other. Still, a little bit of light entertainment isn't always a bad thing. It's not great, but it's decent enough. 6/10",Gemini Man
22,ThomasDrufke,"A Technical Marvel, But a Disaster on the Page",6,31 October 2019,"The film itself doesn't deserve the hate that it's getting, but it also doesn't deserve the incredible technical achievement that some of its action scenes present. Why use the technological advancements for a story that is so bland and unoriginal? Even more fascinating is the fact that the film has been in development hell for upwards of two decades and apparently right now was the best time to give it a release? You know, when Will Smith hasn't had a critically and audience hit in close to 10 years? At any rate, Gemini Man is a perfectly fine & serviceable action film, but not one that should cost any studio a few hundred million dollars. Unfortunately, that's what the movie is going to be remembered for. I'm telling you, there are a few of the best action sequences of the last decade in this movie, you just have to forget how poorly that final scene looks though...6.9/10",Gemini Man
23,Cineanalyst,Digital Doppelgängers,4,28 February 2020,"""Gemini Man"" is a disaster of an action movie, but it's conceptually interesting. Besides Will Smith playing dual roles, the narrative, as well as the dialogue, is entirely hackneyed. Much of the quick, CGI action moves--probably not done any favors by the unforgiving 120fps--look cartoonish. Generally, on the other hand, I thought the de-aging effects were passable, except for the last scene, as others mentioned, which stands out as especially horrendous for some reason. Movement seems a particular problem for this technology, though, even when it's based on motion capture and not computer graphics seemingly held over from the early 2000s (really, the way Smith's younger selves leap about sometimes looks no better than, say, the jumping around in ""Catwoman"" (2004) or ""Daredevil"" (2003)). Regardless, the notion of ""gemini,"" or twins, clones, doubles, doppelgängers, is cinematically, reflexively promising.Add the de-aging technology, motion capture, CGI, and you can have Will Smith fight himself in a knuckle-dragging, action-flick substitute metaphor for the cinematographic process. Indeed, when Smith is digitally recorded, he's, in effect, already doubled, as actors have been since the dawn of film. Lots of talk about the protagonist being haunted by ""ghosts"" in this one, which is apt. There's Smith the actor, and there's the ghost of him that is seen on the screen. In this case, that ghost is doubled, too, and then some. I wish they'd also made a digital pun regarding the shooter's trigger finger and digital cinema, but c'est la vie. There is, however, an appropriate mirror motif--another medium for doubled images.Another thing that is rather amusing is that this project went through development hell and was delayed because the de-aging technology didn't exist yet, taking some 20 years to be produced--about the same amount of time it could've taken to wait after filming young Smith to, then, film his older self. Back when ""Gemini Man"" was originally conceived, Smith, not entirely unlike the assassin he plays here, was just beginning his path as an action hero, with such fare as ""Bad Boys"" (1995), ""Independence Day"" (1996) and ""Men in Black"" (1997). Briefly, he tried his hand at supposedly more serious movies--maybe as a result of some mirror-like self examining. He got a couple Oscar nominations, but nonetheless soon fell back into old habits--not unlike his assassin here who is brought out of retirement by him becoming the target of the hit. So, now, Smith does superhero flicks, live-action remakes of Disney cartoons, and he's even done another ""Bad Boys"" movie. No wonder he pleads with his younger self to quit following in his footsteps.",Gemini Man
24,851222,Very disappointing movie considering talents involved,6,13 October 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Gemini Man"" (2019) is not going to be a movie that Ang Lee or Will Smith or anyone else associated with it will be remembered for. ""Gemini Man"" isn't terrible as many critics said, and if you are looking for a very simple escapism on some weekend evening, it might work for you, but expect nothing more. It kinda works as a B movie, but given talented involved - this is a very disappointing movie.The main problem with it lays in screenplay. The story itself isn't any better also, but its a poor screenplay that drowned this movie. I mean there are dialogs in this movie that i couldn't believe i really heard that. This movie tried to be a light, sometimes funny action movie with Will Smith, but at the same other part of it wanted to be this serious stuff (i won't spoil it), and in doing so the movie couldn't find its balance and in result its just kinda weird one, and in the moments even a bad one. And as an action flick this film has it, but its not that impressive or anything, although there is one pretty cool motorcycle chase scene in the middle, but that was pretty much it.Overall, ""Gemini Man"" unfortunately isn't a great or even good sci-fi action movie. Its an OK one on a bare minimum, but considering talents involved its a very disappointing and mediocre and quickly forgettable. You can safely skip it will it will be available on demand, which will happen very quickly.",Gemini Man
25,tabuno,Some of the Best 3-D Visuals along with a Strong Distinctive Storyline,9,13 October 2019,"Ang Lee has set a new bar for precision and life-like 3-D projection onto the movie screen. It's really difficult to review this movie as to determine whether or not the amazing clarity of the photography like Avatar (2009) a decade in the past allowed the backdrop of the movie to rival the actual performance and storyline of the movie itself and to impact the rating of this film. However, Will Smith's performance along with his CGI counterpart (that foretells a revolutionary transformation in how the role of movie stars are managed in the future) do offer some very emotive and relational elements that offer this movie a distinctive and compelling storyline. The humanity of the movie comes across as well as the action thrills making this movie a well-rounded and intriguing, engrossing experience. Ang Lee has brought elements of Kurt Russell's Soldier (1998) and Hitman: Agent 47 (2015), along with an amazing visual technology into a film that becomes a distinctive action thriller. The few weaknesses remain such as the idealistic 100% virtual movie experience of which Ang Lee has almost achieved, except for a few remaining near and far away focus issues, the lack of the ideal projection system now available in most movie theaters to take advantage Ang Lee's superior camera work, and some of the not quite so convincing action sequences on the motorcycle and later in the catacombs that almost seem more like videogames than movie production scenes. Overall, Ang Lee has brought a refreshing, very entertaining and quite improved dynamic to action thrillers.",Gemini Man
26,The-Sarkologist,A fun sci-fi/action flick,7,19 October 2019,"Well, this is certainly one of those films that I'll have to admit that I really do enjoy. In a way it sort of had the feel of those sci-fi movies like Demolition Man, and some of the other Will Smith enterprises that he has been involved in, and many of the ones that Arnie has also done. The reason being is that they tend not to be tied into a franchise, which in my mind gives it a lot more scope.Then again, there is also a lot of experimentation going on with this film. For instance, many of the films that deal with clones, have clones being the same age as the protagonist. Well, that isn't the case with this one because they have made the antagonist much younger, and through CGI, also make it appear that Will Smith is a lot younger. Mind you, there do happen to be quite a lot of people out there that simply hate CGI.Anyway, the film is about this hitman who has decided that he wants to retire. The problem is, and this is the case with many films in this category, is that it isn't really a job from which you retire. Yeah, the government agencies don't seem to particularly like that. However, the catch is that they decide to make a clone of him, and then send him out to kill him. Mind you, this is a lot more because they have also engineered the clone to get rid of all of the flaws that the original had.
Mind you, the other difference with this film is that where most of them basically have them battle each other out, and eventually have the protagonist win, this isn't the case here. In a way, he doesn't see the clone as some monster, but rather as him. Yeah, this is different, because while there are some action sequences, it ends up having more to do with trying to get the clone to get out of this scene as well. In a way it is his own flesh and blood, and he feels that he can't actually kill him.Then again, this is an Ang Lee film, and he does tend to do things a little differently. Not that I have actually seem all that many of his films mind you. As for this one, yeah, I liked, it was good, but I certainly wouldn't be putting it up there with many of the great movies that I have watched. It is more like, well, a little mindless action between some of the more serious films that I have seen of late.",Gemini Man

It reminded me of a 90's action movie. I was never bored once. Will Smith is an actor I like, and he is as watchable as ever here. Only some shockingly bad CGI on the young Will Smith at the end betrayed it was not real, as other than that, the de aging of Smith was flawless.Clive Owen is your one dimensional pantomime villain whilst Mary Elizabeth Winstead (as fine as she is) just seems to be there because some studio executive or producer decided ""He needs a woman partner"" her character brought nothing to it, except the possibility that young Will Smith would be attracted to her.The script had a few plot holes and problems, it actually felt like a first draft, and needed some serious polishing up, by someone who knew how lame some of the dialogue was.Oh and man, the amount of studio logos at the beginning of this thing!!

29,cruise01,Will Smith battling a younger version of Will is thrilling and exciting.,8,12 October 2019,"Gemini Man (4 out of 5 stars).Gemini Man is an action thriller that delivers some exciting action sequences, set pieces, and a decent plot. Ang Lee's direction delivered in setting up the action. I did not see the film in HFR 3D. Which I am not a fan of. Lee trying his third attempt with it after Life of Pie, and lackluster Billy Lynn movie. Lee does try to deliver a well shot cinematography work on this action thriller which may not be a perfect fit for this kind of movie. The set and production design from Columbia's or Budapest landmarks which the action folds looks fantastic. It is not well done shots with Imax like how Mission Impossible movies are made.The plot follows Henry (Will Smith) who is a government assassin and after his last target. He decides to retire. However, the government does not like the idea and has the Gemini organization led by Clay (Clive Owens). Who sends his team of elite soldiers to kill him. Henry easily escapes with his skills. He sends Junior (a younger version of Will Smith) who can match up to Henry with tactics skills.The plot is nothing worth noting. It may have been done before with other assassin like movies like Bourne series. With a bit of science fiction concept of cloning and engineering human beings to being an ultimate weapon. The script part of the movie with the government plot of trying to cover the tracks by eliminating their retired assassin is a bit forgettable.The movie delivers on the action sequences. They are thrilling and exciting. Will Smith takes up on handling the action was fun. There are a few exciting action sequences with Will escaping from a team of elite soldiers. Very thrilling when Will Smith comes across a younger version of him. Which there tactics are the same. They can fight the same. When Will is trying to escape from his young self. It can be a difficult match. The shoot out scenes and the motorcycle chase scene was exciting. There is one intense and exciting climax taking place in a small town with an elite soldiers and an engineered soldier fighting against Henry and Dani (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).Will Smith is good in the role. It is nice to see him playing an action star. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is good playing Dani, a character that is trying help Henry escape from the elite soldiers. Clive Owen plays a forgettable cliché villain.Overall, Gemini Man is a good action thriller. The plot and villain are forgettable. Ang Lee direction of an action flick is entertaining and exciting.",Gemini Man
30,eddie_baggins,Technical wizardry can't help this lifeless offering,3,14 October 2019,"Heralded as a new technological advancement for filmmaking thanks to its shooting in 4K, 3D and 120FPS and its de-aging effects works on its leading man Will Smith, Academy Award winning director Ang Lee's newest Hollywood film Gemini Man may be technically intriguing but that's where the buck stops with a film that had no chance of overcoming any of its narrative or delivery failures in what's a dull, badly written and downright dumb sci-fi thriller that will likely go down as one of 2019's greatest box office duds.Hovering around Hollywood in various forms since the 90's, with the likes of Nicolas Cage attached to star and Tony Scott and Curtis Hanson in talks to direct, Gemini Man quite clearly had some issues it needed to overcome before seeing the light of day, meaning it's quite sad that Lee, wonder producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the films writers David Benioff, Billy Ray and Darren Lemke didn't manage to overcome them in what is a final product that is barely deserving of public consumption, let alone a big cinematic release.With only a handful of cinemas around the world even capable of showcasing Gemini Man in its true format, there's wonder the much talked about wizardry of the film matters at all as when you strip this film back to the form and manner in which many (including myself) had and will see it, all that's left is a badly constructed sci-fi thriller that gives leading man Will Smith and his tired looking co-stars a plethora of bad dialogue and a bunch of generic characters that offer nothing to a story that doesn't even feel at all original or noteworthy.Everything in Lee's film feels stale and devoid of spark, there's some nice but fairly forgettable action sequences to be found, highlights of which is a motorbike chase that eventuates into a laughably bad CGI fest as two Will Smith's battle it out and start using their bikes as missiles but overall everything in Lee's film feels peculiar and unnatural, never more so evident than creepy young CGI Will Smith.In what's supposed to be the films big selling point as a spectacle, two Will Smith's for the price of one, the younger version of Smith's super-hitman Henry Brogan known as Junior is a creation that you can never warm to and despite the sprinkling's of moments that Junior comes off as a realistic creation, there are far too many occurrences where the films CGI wizardry on Junior takes you right out of the moment, more likely to induce laughter rather than awe-inspiring reactions.It's sad to see Smith continue to struggle in lead roles as he does here, a problem that has been more frequent than ever the last decade and while his not so much outright bad, he fails to get Gemini Man into any extra gear while Lee continues to be a baffling player behind the camera with his films genuine pot luck propositions as he struggles to reach the highs of his early to mid-2000's outputs.Another hugely detrimental aspect to Gemini Man's enjoyment levels is that once we become aware of what a cloned Brogan means and the reasoning behind why this dastardly creation exists, you wonder why we should be against it, making the whole point of Brogan's mission rather pointless as we end up curiously siding with Clive Owen's hammy ""bad guy"" Clay Verris who really truly does kind of have a point.Final Say -With all his focus on the technical that doesn't even end up being all that amazing, Lee has forgot to make a good film in the meantime. A film that is equal amounts dumb, bland and uninspired, Gemini Man is the very worst kind of Hollywood blockbuster that is more likely to encourage sleep rather than encourage viewers to have a fun time with an enjoyable piece of escapist entertainment.1 ½ perfectly placed piece of product placement out of 5",Gemini Man
31,leonblackwood,Great FX but the storyline is poor! 5/10,5,22 February 2020,"Review:
When I saw the certification for this movie, I was a bit sceptical about the outcome, and it's not very often that a Will Smith movie, just about makes a profit at the box office. Now that I've seen the film, I understand why I haven't heard a good word about it because it seems like the director concentrated on the visual effects more than the storyline. There are a couple of decent action scenes, like the bike chase and the dramatic ending, but the movie jumps in right at the deep end, so you don't get any type of character building. I was impressed with the look of the younger Will Smith, Junior, and the clever camera work, when they were both on-screen together, was unique but the predictable storyline and extremely average acting, let the movie down. The fact that Will Smith (Harry Brogan) cared more about Danny (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Junior than his long time friend, who put his life on the line for him, Baron (Benedict Wong), made the film unrealistic, and I couldn't understand why Clay Varris (Clive Owen) didn't kill him when he was in jail. There are a lot of sketchy moments in the plot that made it feel an average watch, but there is a sense of intensity which makes you stick with the film to the end. Once you know the outcome, I doubt that you will give it a second watch, and I personally couldn't remember any golden moments that stick out in my mind. In all, it's an average movie with some clever FX, but it has to go down as one of the weakest films starring Will Smith. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Ang Lee, who also brought you Pushing Hands in 1991, The Wedding Banquet, Eat Drink Man Woman, Sense and Sensibility, The Ice Storm, Ride with the Devil, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hulk, Brokeback Mountain, Lust, Caution, Taking Woodstock, Life of Pi and Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. He won the Best Achievement in Directing Oscar for Life of Pi, which was a visual extravaganza, and he's had quite a versatile career to date, so I doubt that this film will damage his reputation. I do think that the failure at the box office will hurt Will Smith, but with Bad Boys 4 in production, along with Bright 2, King Richard and the Council, he'll have to put this down as a bad day at the office.Budget: $138million

34,imseeg,Especially suited for those who know (and like) director Ang Lee from his arthouse movies. True to life characters are paramount. Action (however good) comes second. I like it,7,15 April 2020,"The good: the direction style by Ang Lee. I love it when a renowned (Oscar winning) arthouse movie director veers into action movie territory, because I get to see a more SUBTLE, refined, slowburning kind of action movie with REAL characters I can relate to, which I personally prefer above another superficial action movie (Marvel, Captain America etc).Any bad? Mind you, the masses did not like this movie, it was a flop at the boxoffice, therefore this movie is probably only suited for a smaller crowd, who appreciates acting skills and character details above the action.Because of director Ang Lee's respect for real life human movie characters, even adults could like this action movie. I wanna watch this movie again, because the action characters (even the robots) in this action movie are still resembling normal people with feelings, I can actually relate to. That's something I value very much in any movie, but also in this action movie...Hmm...there is a lot of criticism on Imdb towards the writing and towards the technique of filming (120 fps). I dont understand either of those critiques, because the writing is okay. Not superb, but it'll do for an action movie.

35,Vartiainen,Plot's basic but the action scenes are way above par,6,6 June 2021,"Ang Lee is pretty close to being a household name as a director, but there's no denying that he's something of a hit-n-miss as an artist. Some of his films (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - Lust, Caution - The Brokeback Mountain, to name a few) are revolutionary as far as plot and filming technique go. Some are... Hulk. Or this one.That being said, even his bad film are still thoroughly watchable. It's just that you can definitely see the cracks beneath the façade. Take this film for example. It's very well acted - Will Smith still very much having got it - and the action set pieces are innovative, well executed and memorable. Unfortunately the basic plot idea doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before. Gimmicky science fiction plots such as these usually benefit more than most from the film playing with your expectations, which unfortunately is pretty nonexistent here.On the technical side of things, the film is certainly trying things, but not quite hitting them out of the park. The de-aging of Will Smith and the vastly faster than normal frame rate (120 FPS) are both done well, but not well enough for them to blend in seamlessly and become invisible, which should be the case with these kinds of things.Still, I did enjoy myself. The film is nothing special, but the only real thing that can be held against it is the fact that its director has made much better films in the past.",Gemini Man

37,subxerogravity,Will Smith vs. the Fresh Prince makes for a bland movie.,6,11 October 2019,"The special effects were a bit creepy. Not really director, Ang Lee's fault. I'm sure it was the best money could buy, but whenever young Will Smith talked it just looked so weird and it puts me out of whatever they are trying to put me in.
Not enough action for my taste. It was interesting watching Will vs. Will but like I said, the visual effects seem not to be there enough to make it look like I'm not watching a cartoon. The story was kinda cool but two strange things are happening. One, not enough story is actually coming out of the screen. It feels like they are stretching the thin plot to its max. Two, the story was kinda borrowing (unfortunately, this has to be Ang Lee's fault cause he directed it). When the action was not happening I found it very uninteresting to sit through.
Too much of the movie counts on a connection Will is having with co-star, Mary Elisabeth Winstead. Will is good (even young Will is good) and Winstead is good, but together they are ok, and that's not enough. Not even with the charismatic Benedict Wong playing third wheel could change the chemistry. What's worse is Clive Owen was really uninteresting too.

38,jtindahouse,Not as fun of a premise as you might first think it to be,5,22 April 2020,"Will Smith vs. Will Smith. Sounds like a decent premise for a movie when you first hear about it, right? But when you delve a little deeper and think about it some more, it really isn't. See, the key to any good action movie is a titanic clash between hero and villain. They are usually polar opposites who bang heads in every imaginable way. Ideally an unstoppable force, meeting an immovable object. When the hero and the villain are the same person, it's actually very boring. Sure Clive Owen is also in the film as a villain, but he isn't nearly overpowering enough to have any impact.I remember back in the days when Smith was the man who couldn't make a bad film (well he had one, 'Wild Wild West' but it was still a pretty good success rate he had at one point). These days though he seems more miss than hit. Whether that's because he's picking bad scripts, or because his acting abilities aren't as fresh and dynamic as they used to be, I don't know. Probably a little bit of both. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also in the film and I can't help but feeling she was badly miscast. She had no charisma, no chemistry with smith, she wasn't a bad-ass and she wasn't funny. She was a severe drag on the film.The action sequences in the movie are pretty bland. There's one decent one on bikes early on, but aside from that it is the usual same old, same old. Considering the movie is about elite assassins it would have to be said everyone in this movie is pretty terrible at what they do. Also there isn't a lot of humour written into the script, which is a waste because Smith can be very funny when he's asked to be and given the right material. The little humour that there is almost never lands though, so maybe they were just trying to cut their loses on that front.The CGI used for the young version of Smith's character looks a little odd, particularly in the day scenes. I suspect for that reason this is a very dark movie. It can be quite hard to see what is even going on exactly at times. I suspect they were trying to hide the inadequacies in that respect. Based on the extremely bland trailers I had grave fears for the quality of this movie. Sadly, my suspicions turned out to be right. It isn't a terrible movie, but it is extremely forgettable.",Gemini Man

This is not a great film, but entertaining it is, does start out slow, but when it gets going it's awesome. Ang Lee shows his greatness has a director, in ways he films the action scenes. Will Smith does give a memorable performance as Henry, and has his younger double, sometimes you can the effects on him to make him look younger, other times not so much, he looks like he just came off the set of Fresh Prince of Bel Air to film this movie. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also good, does not have much chemistry with Will Smith, but does hold her own, and never gets overshadowed by Him. Benedict Wong and Clive Owen are also good. This for me is a film I can only see one time.",Gemini Man
40,kevin_robbins,I was hoping this would be better but it falls flat and is a below average addition to the action genre,3,2 September 2021,"Gemini Man (2019) is a movie we saw in theatres during the pandemic. The storyline follows a mercenary of sorts that has his DNA used to create a clone of him. The clone is then sent to kill him. He will need to fight off the clone while trying to figure out who did it and how he can bring them down. This movie is directed by Ang Lee (Life of Pi) and stars Will Smith (Men in Black), Clive Owen (Children of Men), Douglas Hodge (Joker) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (10 Cloverfield lane). The storyline for this was absolutely dreadful and uninteresting. The dialogue and script was also a bit cliche and stale. There was some excellent action scenes and a solid soundtrack, but the movie was fairly predictable and just okay. Overall I was hoping this would be better but it falls flat and is a below average addition to the action genre. I would score it a 3.5-4/10.",Gemini Man
41,stevendbeard,Very Good CGI,7,12 October 2019,"I saw ""Gemini Man"", starring Will Smith-Aladdin_2019, Suicide Squad; Mary Elizabeth Winstead-A Good Day to Die Hard, Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter; Benedict Wong-Deadly Class_tv, Doctor Strange and Clive Owen-The Informer, Shoot 'Em Up.
This is an action movie with a gimmick; the hero-in this case, Will-plays two roles. The big difference is the second role is about 28 years younger, so this is accomplished by using CGI-and very good CGI, I must say. Will plays a hitman that wants to retire-which never works out well for these people wanting to retire-but he ends up being hunted for termination by his own organization. Leading the hunt is Clive and he is sending his best guy after Will, which turns out to be the 23 year old version of Will-for less confusion, I will just call them 51 for older Will & 23 for younger Will. Mary is another agent that gets mixed up in the confrontations between 51 & 23. Benedict is an old friend of 51 that tries to help him while he is on the run. The fight scenes are pretty good. There is a motorcycle chase where 23 uses his motorcycle like a martial arts weapon, hitting 51 with it-and he hits him not just once, but several times. It's directed by Ang Lee, who also directed Life of Pi, Hulk and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes.

46,jimbo-53-186511,"Technically impressive, but the narrative leaves a lot to be desired",5,19 June 2020,"Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is one of the best operatives in the business, but at the age of 50 he's decided that he's had enough and wants to retire. However, Brogan soon becomes a target by his own agency when he is given information which could lead him to discover a 'secret government operation.' In order to prevent Brogan from discovering their secret, the agency who he works for sends in a super-assassin to take Brogan out who shares more in common with him than he could possibly imagine...One thing you can more-or-less guarantee with an Ang Lee film is that you're going to get something that looks great on the screen (of the films of his that I've seen they are always very well put together). Unfortunately, some of the times I find with his films that the narrative doesn't complement the pretty exterior and sadly Gemini Man is one such film...I found the set-up to the story to be little overlong and rambling - why the writers felt this was necessary when the actual plot is so simple is anyone's guess? The story is the type of thing we've seen a million times before which wouldn't be a problem if it would have at least had interesting characters or some cool plot twists to make it more palatable. Sadly, it has none of these things and it's only some of the half-decent action scenes that make this worth sitting through. As the villains of the piece Clive Owen and Linda Emond are not particularly compelling or intimidating which dramatically lessens the impact of their scenes with Smith. Lee's overly serious approach to the material does it no favours either and at close to 2 hours Gemini Man is a long and rather laborious film (aside from some of the action scenes).In fairness what the film does benefit from is a very good performance from Will Smith and whilst the idea of an older self sharing screen time with a computer-generated image of their younger self isn't that new (we saw it with Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Genisys) it is still a neat looking special effect. I think what makes it really good is this film is that Will Smith is able to sell the CGI Will Smith and the real Will Smith as 2 completely different characters (almost to the point where you could forget that they are played by the same person). Tom Hardy was also able to do this when he portrayed the Kray twins in Legend. The good action scenes and Smith's strong dual performance almost compensate for the mundane script.In some ways, Gemini Man reminded me of the Arnie film 6th Day and whilst Smith gives a stronger acting performance in this film than Arnie gave in 6th day the latter film was fun and didn't take itself seriously and is ultimately a much more satisfying film.",Gemini Man
47,sauravjoshi85,A disappointing movie. Much was expected from Ang Lee,3,19 January 2021,"Gemini Man is an action thriller movie directed by Ang Lee and stars Will Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Clive Owen and Benedict Wong.The main problem with this movie is it's half cooked plot and incomplete script. It seems that the makers rather then developing a plot or script developed an idea and made movie on it. Despite of some great actors and scope of becoming a great movie this movie disappoints on all most all the fronts.Apart from plot the acting in the movie is also average and as mentioned earlier that this movie had some great actors but still the acting department also disappoints and the biggest of them was Will Smith in both of his avatars.Screenplay of the movie is unevenly paced and gets either very fast or very slow and doesn't has the viewers with the story. Direction of the movie is average. Cinematography of the movie is good but VFX and CGIs are disappointing. Climax of the movie is predictable and doesn't excites much. A disappointing movie.",Gemini Man
48,kirbylee70-599-526179,DOUBLE THE TROUBLE,8,27 January 2020,"Wil Smith has now reached the age where he's actually considered an older star in the film business. While he should be settling down for softer roles in comedies instead he continues to put out action films and does a fine job of it. But are audiences still with him? Box office receipts for his latest effort GEMINI MAN would say no but now that it's on disc, should that have been the case?Smith stars as Henry Brogan, an ex-military sniper now working for the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). He continues to be their best assassin and shows why in the opening of the film when he takes out a target on a high speed train from 2 kilometers away. After this operation though he decides he wants to retire.After making this decision he is contacted by an old military friend named Jack (Douglas Hodge) who lives on a boat. Checking in at a boat rental spot he's used before he meets Dani (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who says she's a student working there for the summer. Jack tells him that he was given bogus information on his hit. The man he killed was not a terrorist but a scientist returning to Russia. Jack tells him if he wants more information to contact his informant, a man named Yuri in Europe. When Brogan returns his boat, he tells Dani that he knows she's been sent to follow him. Over dinner that night she is forced to admit it.That night Brogan finds out that leaving the DIA is not as easy as he anticipated. A team shows up at his home intent on taking him out, but he dispenses with them. He contacts the spotter he used on his last mission and listens as he is killed. And Jack and his mistress are killed aboard their boat. He shows up at Dani's to let her know she too is a loose end and the pair take out the team sent to kill her too. Brogan contacts an old friend and colleague named Baron (Benedict Wong) and they head to his place in Bogota.Another attempt is made on Brogan's life in a high speed chase that ends in a full throttle hand to hand combat but police arrive to stop the killer who escapes, a killer who looks much like Brogan but younger. With Baron's help, Brogan and Dani get to meet with Yuri and he's informed that the man behind it all is Clay Verris (Clive Owen), a former black ops agent and owner of his own paramilitary group who once commanded Brogan.Another attempt on his life is made and fails once more. But Dani has found something that Brogan needs to know. It seems a hat left in Bogota from the killer had enough DNA that she could have it checked. That DNA is an exact match for Brogan. The reason his killer looks like him is that he is a younger clone version of himself. Who better to kill him and someone who knows and thinks like him?The film moves from there with plenty of action that is a thrill ride from start to finish. The pace rarely lets up and when it does it takes the time to provide pertinent information rather than just filler to extend the length of the film. That's a sign of solid storytelling and something that director Ang Lee has been known for with all of his films.The action sequences of the film are top of the line with some amazing motorcycle stunts and hand to hand fight sequences that are stunning to view. There is little doubt that this movie kept stunt people working for months to achieve the series of events that take place on film here. Why they are still not recognized by the Oscar folks remains a mystery.The effects work is what most people have talked about with this film though and deservedly so. The new technique of ""de-aging"" actors is being used quite a bit. They did it with Kurt Russell in GUARIDANS OF THE GALAXY 2 and it's been the talk of Hollywood with Martin Scorsese's THE IRISHMAN. But this film not only uses the ""de-aging"" on Smith he also is pitted against himself in various fight scenes as well. That they can do that as seamlessly as they've done here is amazing. The only drawback is a fear of film makers overusing this new effect in the future.Why didn't this film do as well at the box office as expected? I couldn't give you a solid reason. It provides everything that previous efforts in the action genre Smith has given us in the past. Could it be that his fans have aged and don't expect to see him like this now? There's no telling but maybe we'll see with the release of the upcoming second sequel to BAD BOYS that's coming out soon. In the meantime for a fun night of action fueled entertainment I would highly recommend this movie. I found it to be better than I expected it to be.",Gemini Man
49,lukem-52760,Should Be Viewed As Instant Action CLASSIC!!! Extremely underrated but Excellent Movie From The Last Great Movie Star.,10,19 February 2020,"""Gemini Man"" blew me away!!!This fantastic action Thriller was expertly directed by Ang Lee, he made one of the best Marvel films ever in my opinion with his ""HULK"" & here he's crafted a super smart stylish & exciting Thriller with an incredible duel performance by Will Smith.This is definitely one of Smith's most underrated performances just like his incredible Hancock performance.I gotta say that Will Smith is something of an icon to me & has been my hero from a young teen, i basically grew up through the 90's obsessed with the Cool guy. I love all his Hip Hop Albums, especially his Debut solo Album ""Big Willie Style"" from 1997, that is my post played Cd of all time, a 90's Rap Classic. Now I'm not biased totally becomes I'm a long time Will Smith fan, as even i think a few of his films are pretty bad (Hitch, Focus,The Legend of Bagger Vance,Spies in Disguise) but mostly i love them & consider alot of his films extremely underrated Classic's. Will Smith is the last great movie star in my opinion. No other actor has had an impact on me Like Will Smith has. Smith is truly fantastic here in his dual role & i think probably his Gemini Man is his most underrated movie.Now yes i have always been a huge fan of the legendary Will Smith, since i was little & grew up watching his Fresh Prince of bel Air t.v show, then i followed his Awesome movie career & yes he's done a couple that are not very good like ""Hitch"" & ""Focus"" but i gotta admit I've pretty much loved nearly all his movies!!!The 90's was a great time to be into Will Smith with hits that came out like Bad Boys, Men In Black, ID4 & Wild Wild West (Which i loved) & into the 2000's he was on fire. I consider his sci-fi action Thriller ""I,Robot"" as one of his absolute best films along with ""I Am Legend"" & the extremely underrated but excellent ""Suicide Squad"" & his fantastic fantasy Netflix film ""Bright"" the man's been busy!!!Will Smith is a legend of cinema & even made a fantastic Genie in the instant classic ""Aladdin"" movie, genuinely he makes great films, i also liked his sci-fi survival Thriller ""After Earth"" which wasn't amazing but it was ridiculously hated on, but i like what i like & his ""Bright"" was another ridiculously underrated Smith movie.Now ""Gemini Man"" is a state of the art special effects sci-fi Thriller about an ageing Assassin who wants to retire, the guy is Harry Brogan (Will Smith) the absolute best of the best & his old corrupted boss (Clive Owen) wants to get rid of him & ""Tie up any lose ends"" which puts Harry on the run with an undercover Agent, Danny (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) & an old buddy of his, Baron (Benedict Wong) but as the three try to evade all the professional killers on their trail, one particular young, skilled & extremely dangerous hitman gets their attention, a twenty-something ""Harry Brogan"" lookalike named Junior.This action Thriller is about a young Clone sent to kill his older self & Will Smith plays both parts, it's a fantastic double role by Smith who gives us two incredible performances that show plenty of emotional impact.The c.g.i fx is outstanding & the first time i saw both Will Smith's was incredible & slightly emotional as I've grown up watching him & here i was watching the Smith from my past (Fresh Prince or even Bad Boys) & the Smith of today, it was an Awesome moment.The cast really are excellent especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Danny, she's a resourceful, smart & very tough character who helps Harry every step of the way, i loved her here. Clive Owen is the typical evil villain but in his own way has a reason for doing what he's doing even if it's morally wrong.Benedict Wong is great fun as the supporting player, who is there to give some laughs but is helpful & one of the only people Harry can truly trust.Another great thing about this movie was the beautiful locations of towns, beaches & seasides, everything looks gorgeous & the use of bright splashes of vivid colour is striking on screen, great sharp & slick cinematography.The music was suspenseful & exciting & the movie had an exciting ""Spy"" Thriller feel to it, there's nothing too violent or brutal so it's (12) rating was a nice change from all the violent flicks I've seen recently, this was simply a fantastic Action Thriller with abit of science fiction on the side & an excellent performance by Will Smith & some Amazing & spectacular action scenes, edge of the seat kind of action.""GEMINI MAN"" is a perfect Action Thriller that's also a great popcorn movie & that's just an engrossing & totally entertaining thrill ride.I had a blast of a good time!!!",Gemini Man

But discovering that the man he killed wasn't a terrorist sets Smith off on a dangrous path which will lead to his associates being murdered. When normal hitmen can't do the job he faces the ultimate opponent- his younger self.Some amazing chase scenes especially on motorbikes the younger Smith uses the bike as a weapon, has to be seen. Also the battles along rooftops, in water, even in the catacombs under Budapest. The fight ranges across the world from the US to Colombia to Hungary and back to the US again. Gemini doesn't just stand for Smith's clone, it is also a private security firm run by Smith;s former CO in the Marines. A company used when deniability is essential as well as proving contractors on the ground to supplement US troops.

51,masonfisk,CG IS A DANGEROUS THING IN THE WRONG HANDS...!,2,24 October 2019,"The latest Will Smith misfire about the trials & tribulations of a retired assassin being hunted by his younger self is all gimmick & no payoff. Feeling like a film better suited to the sensibilities of the late, great Tony Scott (the thinking man's Michael Bay) who could direct this material in his sleep (w/albeit results that could go either way), this outing, helmed by genre chameleon Ang Lee (Hulk/Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), seems to be afloat as to how to handle this material w/questionable action scenes staged clunkily (witness the dueling motorbikes) paired w/a script which had a attractive premise but through multiple drafts from high profile writers (David Benioff, Billy Ray plus five others) who couldn't come up w/a decent though-line w/an added sprinkle of Will Smith having his head up his own ass (& not his CG doppelganger) who seems to picking projects as if he was at the beginning of his career rather than in the twilight of one's perceived wisdom of picking quality projects (you decided not to do Django Unchained & the original Matrix to do dreck like this & Bright?) could be the ruination of just about anyone. Even the vaulted special effects are bad w/the de-aging aspect so apparently off-putting/ you could see it even when a character was at a distance to the action. Anyhoo, most of the principals will rebound in the future but as much as we've been inundated w/experts in certain walks of life (a dog whisperer, a horse whisperer) maybe Smith should find a decent movie part whisperer to conjure some better choices in the offing.",Gemini Man
52,s3276169,Not sure why this was made.....,5,1 November 2019,"I'll start by saying I like Will Smith. I fondly remember his films from the 90's. They really popped, with wit, humour and Smith's own personal brand of jokery energy.Its a shame then, to see Smith in a film like the Gemini Man. He seemed to spend a good portion of it apologising for being 51. As if age is some kind of a crime. I guess perhaps, in this brainless culture, that worships vapid youth and naivety, it is.Nonetheless, the character Smith plays comes across as so worn down by life and age, that he's robbed of any sense of energy and drive, in what is supposed to be an action film. To balance this out, we get a rehash of a younger Smith that simply falls flat and is for the most part, unconvincing.As indeed is this film, that's a bland, formulaic, action flick with no real build up and an truncated climax, that fizzles when it should burn.5/10.",Gemini Man
53,questl-18592,Gemini Men,4,17 September 2020,"So, getting right into it, we all know what this movie is. Old Smith vs Young Smith, Experience vs Youth, Old vs New, Physical Actors vs Hollywood's Desire to Digitize Everything. After watching this, I realized I need to hit up a thesaurus and see if there's a word for being both surprised and not surprised at the same time.Now, going into this, knowing that one Will Smith will be digitally de-aged, I'd assume that would look awful because... Well, if Star Wars can't get it right with an unlimited budget, why would this? Yet, I actually was pretty impressed with Fake Smith for a good 80% of the movie, and that's REALLY good in my opinion. Yes, a lot happens in low light environments and the character is moving and those things help the creators mask flaws, but if that's where the technology is, fine. There are a few off moments here and there but where it's really shocking is near the end where... Yikes.Ok, so the de-aging is actually not bad. This is an action movie though, with Will Smith, so that must be good. Eh, not really. The action is downright cartoony at times, very reminiscent of other great cinema classics such as Bruce Willis' RED or John Malcovich's RED 2. It just feels clunky and so silly sometimes. Now, there are moments where it works, and Old Smith has a presence on screen that works here but that's not enough to make up for some of the Loony Toons antics happening. It's an action movie that delivers underwhelming action.Then there's the performances. Honestly, I'm a bit over Will Smith, I feel he's reached that point where he's no longer acting, he's just playing himself wearing different hats. I'm sure plenty of people love it but I find it so tedious to watch this and get flashbacks of things like iRobot and Suicide Squad. That said, I think Winstead is amazing and needs to be in more, better stuff. That's especially true here because the script doesn't know how to treat her. She's spoken of in high regard by everyone, but when it actually comes time to do stuff, she's often shuffled to the side until things are done and people can explain things at her again. It felt like a misfire with a great actress. Nearly the same can be said of Owen, I think he's pretty solid in this and wish he was in more stuff. His gravitas allows him to take what could've been a mustache twirling villain and make him a legit character with a solid, twisted motivation. And then there's Wong playing Wong. Not much new there.Now, I'm lead to believe this movie actually did some pretty amazing things, technologically. Super high frame rates or some such. I always appreciate when people innovate but it's tough to really review a movie that I'm not capable of watching properly. Things just look off, pretty regularly and I have to wonder if that's part of me not watching it in the correct format. By that token though, I don't think there's a theater near me that would've played it in that format and I KNOW my home theater isn't pumping that out. So while I appreciate the effort to bump things along, that's a tough call when not everyone can enjoy it and as it's meant to be seen.In the end, this is pretty generic. The CG is actually better than expected but wow is the action underwhelming. The performances are solid but are also pretty spread apart and mixed with a heavy dose of exposition.The action is also pretty meh sometimes., a huge hit for an action movie. This just screams network TV movie, something you flip through, spot it and decide to give it a watch. Maybe when the tech comes along it'll be better but for now this is underwhelming and not worth any proper attention.",Gemini Man
54,truemythmedia,Boring Drivel,2,13 January 2020,"Whenever a large budget movie fails horribly I generally go out of my way to see it. I'm the kind of viewer that finds a lot of humor in watching the bigger bumbles in cinema (like Tom Hooper's ""Cats""- I suppose it's a year for former Best Directors to go astray), because usually when movies are misguided enough to earn reviews as bad as this one from critics and audiences alike (currently 26% on Rotten Tomatoes, 38% on Metacritic, and 5.7 on IMDb), they're filled with all sorts of flaws like hokey acting, ridiculous action, hilarious dialogue and incomprehensible plotting. My roommates and I all saw the trailer for this film a while back and thought it looked rather awful and actively anticipated watching this together; so on a cold rainy day in January we sat down and began our journey with Will Smith (""Bright"") and junior Will Smith (no, not Jaden). To all of our great disappointments, we found the film was not that funny, but instead was a mind-numbingly boring rehash of action clichés mixed with a half-baked sci-fi plot starring a lifeless aging actor who's just trying to stay relevant.",Gemini Man
55,AudioFileZ,Will Suffer From Overly High Expectations....Still Entertaining Though,6,21 October 2019,"I think there's a huge audience who have looked forward to this film. Often that means elevated expectations abound. Some will be very pleased and others will find flaws. It's probably safe the first group will have greater numbers. Then they'll be folks who just like to be taken on a good ride who care little about expectations. I am that kind of viewer. I was not aware of much about the movie prior to seeing it other than Any Lee was pushing digital cinema mostly with faster frame rates and the most elaborate creation of a totally CGI, 30-years younger, Will Smith. Interesting, perhaps groundbreaking, but when I watch a movie I don't want to be thinking of these things.Fortunately watching Gemini Man delivers a decent movie blending science fiction, hubris of man, and action. The story certainly doesn't break ground in the misdeeds of a evil man as he attempts to conquer the world on his terms. I'll be kind and say it's a bit rote. However, it uses the element of distrust ramping it up good effect using rogue cloning science. Still the story is not very compelling.This provides Will Smith the opportunity to carry the water. I'd say he pulls it off as he is a kind of elevated everyman character. He has charisma and enough emotional chops to win the viewer over. That's important as this is far out there stuff and needs a kind of grounding. The fight scenes work in spite of being between what we know is one man and a CGI character. The pinnacle of this is the well done motorcycle chase scene. You immediately want to see the movie again solely for this. Beyond that somehow the Jr. character gets more real as the movie progresses enhancing the story in unexpected ways. Clive Owen plays the cold detached character as expected making it easy to hate all he's about. The female co-star is kind of the odd woman out, but she ends up selling her role enough I'd say.So, for a casual viewer looking for an action movie with a character you can root for I'd say Gemini Man succeeds.

56,mrdonleone,Stupid Move Will,4,17 November 2019,Gemini men with such a stupid movie it was really disappointing because of course we expect the greatest things are finally do great director but then how about we can see the story was really weak and the special effects were supposed to fix it was just stupid and then just to fall asleep it was just a waste of time and it for the rest was just an ordinary James Bond action movie just be little bit of specialty music but it was all predictable and wall of the movie before I even saw the first image of it and that is very sad about it because of course all of these is not good to buy the movie movie should be renewing and Will Smith is an old guy know the younger energy to do it and all these things but then we don't know I don't know it's not good,Gemini Man
57,masonsaul,Flawed but fun action thriller,7,12 October 2019,"For the record, I didn't see Gemini Man in the high frame rate which critics said made the movie look cheap, which may affect why I liked it so much but Gemini Man is a flawed but fun action thriller. It's surprisingly funny in places and has some genuinely great action sequences and is more thought provoking than I expected. Will Smith gives two great performances. The supporting performances by Clive Owen, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Benedict Wong are all really good. Ang Lee's direction is fantastic and it's beautifully filmed. The music by Lorne Balfe is excellent. It's only brought down by a plot with subplots that are forgotten about and CG that dips in quality during the final 10 mins, despite being impressive up until that point.",Gemini Man

59,davidmvining,Blinded by the Tech,3,28 October 2020,"It's really unfortunate when you see quality directors go down holes they really shouldn't have gone down in the first place. Ang Lee decided that 120 frames per second was the wave of the future a while back, and he's not letting go. So, while he made it happen in Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, to a muted response, he decided to repackage the technique using the newest in digital cloning, one of the biggest movie stars in the world, and one of the lamest scripts that had been languishing around Hollywood for twenty years. Instead of seeing a dull, cliched script, Lee seemed to see it as a vehicle for his technological games. Everything that James Cameron has done wrong in the last couple of decades Ang Lee ended up doing worse, and it's unfortunate.Will Smith plays Henry, an assassin nearing the end of his useful time in the trade, and the movie introduces him in a rather unexciting action scene that opens the film. Starting a film with an action sequence is always a dicey move because the audience starts the action beats without any real investment in the action. So, when the movie decides that we need witty repartee between characters and a tense moment where things could go wrong, it tends to fall flat because we don't really know the characters and the stakes are ill-defined at best.Henry is so good, though, that shooting a man through the neck on a speeding train from two kilometers away is simply not good enough since he was aiming for the man's head. Time to retire. The way this all plays out, with Henry talking to his handler about putting up the gun to fish feels like this is the third or fourth entry in a franchise, not the first. There's so much implied history going back and forth, it really feels like the opening of a new adventure with someone we've known for a while. Think of Kirk in Star Trek II except we've never seen Henry before.Henry ends up meeting some other former assassin who tells him that the Russian Henry assassinated at the beginning of the movie was not who Henry thought he was, having been lied to by the agency that ran the op. This gets overheard through satellite surveillance, and Varris, Clive Owen, decides that the only recourse is to have Henry killed. But Henry is the best, so only the best can get sent. After Henry kills a few soldiers who sneak up to his coastal house and picks up Danielle, an agency asset sent to monitor Henry who is also on the kill list, Varris gets the green light and sends in the best to kill the best.This is all very standard double cross spy/assassination stuff told with little flair or energy by Lee. Everything gets telegraphed heavily beforehand, leaving no room for any kind of surprise. It doesn't help that the marketing is full of the only real surprise in the film, that Henry's incoming assassin is his younger clone. If the marketing hadn't given that away in literally every poster, it might have been a neat surprise because the movie, other than calling the secret program that birthed young Henry Gemini, gives no real indication up to that point that there's a Henry clone. It could have been a decent surprise if we didn't know going in and if the movie, well, if it was remotely interesting otherwise.The characters are so thin, the plot so meaningless, and the reasons behind everything so murky that it's really hard to engage with the material on any level. Having that surprise be an actual surprise would have been a nice jolt that could have introduced something to the proceedings. Instead, it becomes a waiting game for this reveal. Once there, the movie gives us a handful of rather accomplished if slightly plastic looking action scenes. The fist fight between the two Henry's in the catacombs is pretty solid, though. And that's really the extent of the movie's charms. It has some technical things to recommend it like the special effects that create young Henry and some of the action scenes, but nothing else beyond that is terribly fascinating.Henry's a generic action hero who's just too old for this stuff. Danielle is largely nothing. Henry Junior is barely a character. Varris is generic bad guy. As the plot moves from South America to Europe and back to America, it feels very paint by numbers and never leaps off the page.Just thinking back to Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a wonderful action spectacle that matched pleasing action aesthetics with a tender story, it's depressing to see Lee chasing projects for all the wrong reasons. This is James Cameron obsessed with 3D but worse because at least Avatar was able to deliver epic scope and a great action ending. Gemini Man can never move beyond its lackluster script, and it seems like no one even tried. A photorealistic looking young Will Smith will only get you so far in storytelling, and it's not very far at all.",Gemini Man

The VERDICT:In truth Gemini Man is not awful, but it certainly is not the spectacle that the trailers tried to build up, but in truth it does have some qualities I think that they wanted to achieve. Above all, the technology accomplished the goals set out by the project in terms of de-aging someone and making it look super believable. Throw in that most of the technology comes together to make for action scene spectaculars that will have fans dancing in their seats in excitement at this fast-paced feature. Sadly, the reviewers are right that the plot and characters are very simplistic, with a predictable and low developed plot shoved into the run time, where focus on action leads to hasty wrap ups and a sloppy finish for this reviewer. Perhaps if more time had been looked into the plot as the technology it would have pleased more, but for the wait, well it is not quite worth it for this guy. Therefore, my scores are:Action/Drama/Sci-fi: 6.0

She looks like she should be a cast member on Saturday Night Live.Nice to see one of the truck drivers from the Mad Max: Road Warrior show up.

63,Kamurai25,"""Double Your Action, Double Your Fun""",7,24 September 2020,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.If there is someone you want to put on the screen twice, then I understand it being Will Smith, and the rest of the cast is great. This might even have been the role that got Mary Elizabeth Winstead into the Huntress role later on.I think they specifically reference it a some point in the movie, but a lot of the story is Will Smith fighting himself. The action sequences are solid, the scary secret spy organization is scary and secretive, and there are even a few ""twists"" along the way.My biggest problem is that this entire movie is unnecessary. If Clive Owen's character wasn't basically a super villain, then he could have left old Will Smith retire and no one would be the wiser. That might have possibly been a better movie, though I think Star Wars might be a point against me there.Long short: it's good, it's great action, it's not world moving, but does include a touch of sci-fi (/sci-fact, we're on that border). It just has a bad clash of reality that people and organizations like that exist, and we pay for them.",Gemini Man

The de-aging technology is becoming as common as 4k tvs, and can be seen in a number of big projects, including the hotly anticipated 3 and a half hour Martin Scorsese film The Irishman, which will come out on Netflix and in limited theatrical release and is getting great buzz. I didn't see it in super fast 3d, just regular 24fps Dolby 4k 2d in Dolby Atmos sound with the rumbling seats. During the beginning of the movie, which a few minutes I've missed because of traffic, the image was cropped. Thanfkully I reported AMC on fb and they fixed the issue. This is a movie worthy of demo material for home theaters.",Gemini Man

66,moviexclusive,"Neither Ang Lee's innovative HFR technology or Will Smith's digital de-aging can save this lame, inert and frustratingly pointless thriller from being an utter high-concept mi",4,6 October 2019,"Not content for the high frame rate (HFR) stereoscopic technology which he first experimented with in 2016's 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk' to be a one-hit wonder, Ang Lee employs the same method in this science-fiction action thriller to give it the same pin-sharp clarity. The impact is plainly apparent right from the start if viewed in the HFR 3D format - not only are we led to observe an astonishing extent of visual minutiae in the opening scenes where Will Smith's special-forces assassin Henry Brogan positions himself atop a grassy knoll to assassinate his target on board an express train, the crispness and clarity of the images are startling to say the least, although some may not be quite so enamoured with the effect.Regardless, there will probably be no argument that the most stunning technological achievement here is the digital de-aging of Smith, which allows the 51-year-old actor to play a character 25 years younger than he is. Junior, as that character is named here, is a clone created by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) operative Clay Varris (Clive Owen) under the ethically suspect 'Gemini project', which aims to manufacture biotech warriors to fight our wars for us. Specifically for Junior though, Clay has been raising him as his adopted son, in the hopes that he may equal Brogan at his own game one day - and that game so happens to be the business of sharpshooting, which Brogan has demonstrated his prowess in through 72 unblemished kills for the DIA and is now more than ready to retire from.That, in essence, is the premise of 'Gemini Man', which has been languishing in development since the 1990s and passed through the likes of Harrison Ford, Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery before finding its lead in Smith. Thanks to the contributions of Weta Digital, Lee has accomplished what the late director Tony Scott never managed to, although we suspect that achievement will likely be lost on an audience who will wonder why all those years evolving the technology was not similarly spent on developing its undercooked script (credited to three distinguished Hollywood veterans no less, including 'Game of Thrones' creator David Benioff and 'The Hunger Games' co-writer Billy Ray).As appealing as the idea of an aging hitman who is targeted by a younger clone of himself may sound, the very concept itself is flawed - indeed, it doesn't take a genius to realise that just because two individuals have the same DNA means they will possess the same abilities. That logic gap would have been easier to ignore if the movie itself were simply a popcorn blockbuster; unfortunately, it also figures itself to be a thinking-man's thriller about the age-old debate between Nature and Nurture. Indeed, rather than kill each other outright, Brogan decides to engage in a cat-and-mouse game with Junior, believing that Junior could very well be a different person if he knew the truth about his origins.Why Brogan would hold a soft spot for his clone is never satisfactorily explained during the movie or even at the end, except to allow the storytelling to pit Smith against Smith and then to have two of them go up against Owen's resident villain. Yet because Owen is not an action star, the finale turns out underwhelming, leaving only the two set-pieces involving a battle of Wills to hold your attention. Thankfully, owing to Lee's deft staging, they are pretty amazing to watch - one of them takes place against the picturesque streets of Columbia, unfolding along its rooftops before culminating in a dizzying motorcycle chase; and the other happens in the underlit catacombs of Budapest, where both men engage in a furious exchange of kicks and punches before one of them almost drowns the other.Even so, these sequences are not enough to compensate for the sheer inertness of the rest of the movie, which comprises of weak banter and plenty of thudding exposition. Despite roping in Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a fellow rogue DIA agent and Benedict Wong as a wise-cracking pilot sidekick, there is hardly any fun to be had in their team dynamics (unlike say that between Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg in 'Mission Impossible - Fallout'), no thanks to the leaden dialogue. Not only is the science highly suspect, the whole narrative itself is frustratingly thin, with the barest of excuses why they have to go from Columbia to Hungary before heading back to Georgia, or even how they can somehow borrow a Gulfstream jet to fly them from country to country.In fact, we'd dare say you'll be bored stiff during the two-hour duration, because other than the action, there is little momentum to the storytelling at all. Lee's attempt at fleshing out Brogan and Junior's respective reckoning falls embarrassingly flat, not so much because Smith doesn't try his best to emote both ways (and we mean both here because he plays both characters), but rather because the character development here is so blunt it hardly even matters. Whether deliberate or otherwise, the fact that the movie pretty much revolves around these five roles (Smith, Smith Jr, Winstead, Wong and Owen) is even less excuse for the sheer laziness in the scripting, both in terms of plot and character.Much as we'd love to embrace Lee's techniques here, 'Gemini Man' is ultimately a high-concept misfire. Like we said, the very premise itself is flawed, and the rest of the movie does itself no favours by thinking itself smarter and more intelligent than it really is; worse still, it doesn't even much try to be credible, which neither Smith's charisma or Lee's filmmaking ingenuity can compensate for. Oh yes, the HFR realism and digital fakery are novel probably for the first 10 minutes, but soon wears off and reveals instead the artificiality and superficiality of the whole enterprise. It may sound appealing to have two Smiths in the same movie, but you'd wish they'd went right back to the genesis of this project and change up the whole DNA of this dull, almost lifeless, big-budget failure.",Gemini Man

68,nancyldraper,An interesting experiment,6,28 November 2019,"An interesting experiment, having one actor play two versions of themselves, but the CGI wasn't perfect. There were times it cracked. I was particularly distracted by the artificial movement of Junior's mouth. As an action movie, it had some really butt kicking sequences. Personally, I think it would have benefited by more women in the cast, although, Mary Elizabeth Winstead covered a lot of bases (combatant, friend, alternate viewpoint, and, eventually, parent). Will Smith carried a heavy load playing both parts, and I don't think the failures in the movie were due to his acting. The whole movie just felt a little off kilter. The story lacked depth or nuance. I give the film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {SciFi Action Adventure}",Gemini Man
69,krocheav,The Gemini Man - Couldn't Hold The Momentum,5,2 August 2020,"After an impressive opening and lead up to the initial storyline this action drama looked like it may have been heading towards being a throwback to the more believable thrillers of the seventies and eighties. Then enter the back-to-back over the top CGI 'super' action sequences - combined with this, a rather tired plotline of the super-performing secret service hit man who suddenly wants out (although his reasons are honourable). This sends him to the top of his boss's hunted list. Will Smith is above average for this sort of material and quite convincing as the 'best-of-his-game', now being set-up for elimination.The clever visual special effects of seeing his 'younger self'- now making attempts on his life, is a lot better than some hard to please critics would have you believe but perhaps, stretched out too much to maintain credible interest. Then they add to all this, yet another 'unstoppable' robotic clone to drag the story interest further in to that overused juvenile level. A good cast is left to do battle with an underperforming script. Nicely choreographed (but again over exaggerated) fights & stunts also get lost in the mix. Still, followers of Smith may not be overly disappointed.",Gemini Man
70,Abdulxoxo,Missed the mark,6,13 January 2021,"The direction of this film could have been better; particularly in the fight sequences. It surprises me how an experienced director like Ang Lee could allow such poor, sharply edited fight scenes to be left in this film. But some of them are well-staged and entertaining esp the bike chase. The actors deserve some praise for making the most out of the poor script. Will Smith, alongside the supporting Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Benedict Wong, all come across as likable characters, who could have worked well in a better film. Sadly, they aren't given the material worthy of their talents. The screenplay is so generic; and I don't appreciate the ridiculous amount of exposition just to make sure that the viewer is absolutely 100% clear that the person chasing Brogan is definitely his clone. There is no subtlety, no interesting character development, no surprises and simply nothing to invest in. Even if the writing is better, the story itself about a spy chasing down another spy has been told so many times before. I understand the clone angle is a slight twist, but not enough to justify this film's existence.Overall, Gemini Man is a tad entertaining but generic action flick. The special effects (the de-aging job perform on Smith) is wonderful, and the cast performance is competent.",Gemini Man

82,rockman182,Gemini Man (2019),5,12 October 2019,"I want to start off by saying I think that Ang Lee is a talented filmmaker. Life of Pi was a life changing movie experience for me and I loved everything from the visuals to the wonderful story of that film. He's had his misses as well for sure and from every angle of every trailer, Gemini Man looked like it was going to be a miss. I mean a plot about an assassin meeting a younger version of himself? It sounds like cookie cutter and unimaginative sci-fi. And that's exactly what this film was. It was a very boring time to be hand despite the effects and technical aspects and a hardworking cast.The film is about an assassin who is aging and contemplating retirement. While trying to put his mind at ease he finds out he is being gunned down by a dangerous assassin. Along with the help of a government agent he finds out that the man after him is a clone of himself and is a spitting image of his younger self. The assassin attempts to find answers as to how and why this clone is after him and how to put an end to the dangers that await him.Ang Lee has always tried to revolutionize cinema most recently through camera work. Ill let you read about that all yourself as the technical aspects of the film would be explained poorly by me. The de-aging technology is great for the most part, not a whole lot of shoddiness with that or the action scenes. Apart from all that the plot of this film over-complicates itself and is an absolute bore. There is just no enjoyment or excitement in a film that should really be able to engage the audience.Will Smith has been on a downward spiral for me in film. in recent years he's been in some really bad films and this is one of them. Its hard to really care about anything that goes on in this snoozefest. Good action and effects are completely lost in a film that is written poorly. You can tell this one has been in development hell, I just found myself struggling to care about a furiously bad script. One of Ang Lee's very worst.5/10",Gemini Man

O-Sensei Morihei Ueshiba said, ""True victory is victory over oneself."" Director Ang Lee literally and ambitiously navigates O-Sensei's Mastery journey in unexpected resolve. The distinct upsides: The entertaining screenplay by David Benioff, Billy Ray, and Darren Lemke and the strong compelling Will Smith on both sides of this existential conflict. Amen.As ""Gemini Man"" opens Will's Henry takes aim at his 'final' target from 2000 meters out. Henry is the operative for the DIA, a covert US Government Agency sanctioned to terminate terrorist threats. In theory, Henry takes out only bad guys with his sniper rifle or martial arts training. So basically, 51 year-old Henry is a walking weapon, who's sacrificed having a life, dedicated to serving his country. But is his retirement mission a set-up, a betrayal?Although, David, Billy and Darren's narrative premise is needlessly convoluted, we get that Henry is a good man, who's suffered because of his mastery. He wants out. Henry confesses to DIA's Del, ""My soul hurts... I want to find peace."" Henry's haunted by the 'ghosts' of his targets. Will's authentic remorseful tears land.Ang Lee's conspiracy narrative unveils as obsessed Clay Verris, played with duplicitous zeal by Clive Owen, emerges with his proposal to DIA Director Janet Lassiter, played by malleable Linda Emond. Clay operates the clandestine Gemini Project. He wants to use his asset to terminate Henry, who's become a circumstantial liability. He sends his charge Junior, also played by Will, to kill Henry. By design, Junior is Henry's younger version sans his past, without his suffering and pain. Thus, superior.Ang nuances ""Gemini Man""'s ambitious narrative premise: What makes a Good Man? In a flashback, Henry recalls his Dad, played by Diego Adonye, nearly drowning him as a boy to make him strong. Wise foreshadowing. Yet, Ang's storytelling bewilders: Henry and Junior don't do the math when they first battle each other. Junior tells Clay, ""It's like he (Henry) knew my every move..."" Well, yeah.The technology astounds when Will fights as both Henry and Junior on screen. Their motorcycle chase is spectacular. As Henry and Junior exchange spinning kicks, elbow strikes and joint locks, you feel the impact. CGI-ed Junior looks cool for the most part. Though near the end, it almost occurs as creepy.The other distinct upside of ""Gemini Man"" is strong, pretty, smart Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Danny, the DIA agent ordered to spy on Henry in his supposed retirement. Danny holds her own against anyone. Mary displays amazing Brazilian Jujitsu skills. Her eyes hint that she's way ahead of the game. Hence, she aligns herself with Henry. Predictably, she's also Henry's possible romantic interest.As Henry, Junior and Mary ride together in a truck, Henry confesses his life's regrets. Henry sacrificed falling in love, having a wife, having a family, because of the job. Although, Junior was designed as the perfect assassin, he ultimately has a choice. Henry tells his younger self, ""Everyone deserves a second chance."" Amen.Really, ""Gemini Man"" works, because of Will's authentic humanity. Yeah, Will is mature power and genuine swag. Yet, his vulnerability, his wisdom of being older resonate. We all deserve a second chance to be our greater than versions of ourselves. Just saying. Rather, I believe that's what ""Gemini Man"" is saying. ""Gemini Man"" isn't perfect. Yet, ""Gemini Man"" is something special.",Gemini Man
85,RforFilm,"Having 2 Will Smiths isn't going to save this boring, by-the-books thriller thats only selling itself off the gimmick",3,14 October 2019,"How many times have you told yourself, ""I wish I could told my younger version about ""blank""""? There's something about either revisiting your youth or even somehow getting something to the past, like a warning that could have avoided before. The idea is nothing new to the world of cinema as stories about people getting to their younger selves have been done before. Star Trek has done thing, video games like Metal Gear did it, and there was even an interesting movie called Looper that dealt with an assassin confronting himself. A part of it is a part of an idea of ""what if you could communicate with another you?"".The gimmick of Gemini Man is Will Smith going against a younger clone of him. To be fair, this isn't a bad idea, especially that Will Smith is one of the few actors whose managed to maintain his fame and popularity even after all these years. I've even joked that Smith seems like an immortal person, has his charisma and charm has remained as timeless as he was on Fresh Prince of Bel Air. It even had director Ang Lee taking a crack at the story and the complication of having a de-aged actor throughout the majority. Does Gemini Man work?An aging assassin Henry Brogan (played by Will Smith) makes a successful kill before declaring his retirement. Like a lot of action movies, he expects retirement to stick, but already grows suspicious of a young woman working at the docks. This woman Dani (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) claims that she's a grad student, but he suspects her as a set spy for the CIA. At the same time, an old friend comes to tell him that the man he killed had been innocent. Henry seeks proof, but finds him home ambushed by other agents.When he escapes with Dani to South America, he gets attacked again by an agent that seems to know all of his moves. He manages to get the would be attacker's motorcycle helmet off, revealing a face similar to his. Dani at first thinks that the other guy must be a son of Henry's, only to see through a DNA test that their identical; their the same man. It's revealed that the younger clone called Junior (also played by Will Smith) is the adopted son of Clay (played by Clive Owen) who runs Gemini, a black opts security company who've managed to make this human clone.Gemini Man suffers from a major problem; it's boring. For a movie that has the charm of Will Smith and even an occasional exciting action scene, it's a movie that only seems to have a gimmick, but is unsure with what to do with it. I've heard that the script for this has been going around from studio to studio for thirty years and it shows. What it does have (retiring agent, an agency getting him back in, attackers at night, goofy sidekicks, etc...) all seem tired and dated.Compare this to the more recent John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum which was light on story, but was still an entertaining movie. Unlike that one, Gemini Man happens to take too long to have the main character realize that he has a younger clone. Why? It was all over the trailers and advertising that this was going to be the full movie. In fact all this tactic does is slow everything way down for something the audience already knows. In fact, it's even frustrating that once things do come together and the characters figure things out, we have no idea what the endgame for the villain is. Is the clone for assassinations? Making their company bigger? Giving the villain more political power? None it of it ever answered.Another problem is that the movie can be impressive...but only when it wants to be. The special effects to give us a younger Will Smith do look cool and does showcase what this can do for a lot of older actors. But the movie has a dreary look that looks more boring that anything. There's even a scene where an obvious day-for-night is used. That's a trick that only make it look lazy.I'll give this three blood samples out of ten. Gemini Man feels like a movie that was made by committee, but scraped for being too obvious and hidden for twenty years until someone at Paramount thought they could still make a buck out of this. This is another Will Smith misfire that I can put alongside Collateral Beauty and After Earth. Even a hundred Will Smiths couldn't have saved this boring trash.",Gemini Man
86,bankofmarquis,The effects aren't quite there,7,17 October 2019,"Ang Lee is a visionary Director that loves to push the envelope of advances in movie-making technology, so the plot contrivance of GEMINI MAN (a Government Assassin is being chased by his much younger clone) was right up his alley - and he makes good (enough) work of the technology that ""de-ages"" Will Smith and puts the older and younger version of himself on screen at the same time. This was also his 2nd film (after BILLY FLYNN'S LONG HALFTIME WALK) that Lee shot in 4K 3D at 120 frames per second (the ""normal"" shooting speed is 24 FPS).He should have spent more of his time on the script..Based on a long gestating screenplay written in the 1990's by David Lemke (and re-written in the 2010's by Billy Ray - THE HUNGER GAMES - and Mr. GAME OF THRONES himself, David Benioff), GEMINI MAN follows a Government Contract Killer, Henry Brogan (Will Smtih) who does ""one last job"" and is looking forward to retirement. His agency (under the leadership of Clive Owen) decides to ""take him out"" and sends ""Gemini"" after him. Brogan tries to escape but his every move is anticipated by the Gemini - a younger clone of himself (this is not a spoiler, it's in the trailer and ON THE POSTER). He is joined by a pair of ""buddies"" (Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Benedict Wong) in plotting how to outsmart himself.This film had all the markings of a bad ""B"" film, but under the watchful eye of Lee and the charismatic performances of Winsted, Wong - and most especially - Smith, this film is actually quite watchable.What doesn't work - the plot. To say it is contrived is to do a disservice to the word ""contrived"". It really doesn't give us anything new, it just gives us a bridge from action scene to action. Also, the reasoning of the Government to get rid of Brogan doesn't really work and Clive Owen - as the head of the Gemini program - and the main ""suit"" that is chasing Smith looks like he is sleepwalking his way through this film.What works - the interplay and ""fun"" of Smith, Winsted and Wong as the 3 ""professionals"" on the run - and outsmarting - ""the Agency"". These 3 work really well off each other and I would love to have seen a ""Mission Impossible"" style film of these 3 doing some sort of impossible mission. Special note needs to be made of Smith's performance - as the older Brogan. He is world weary and heavy, but still has the twinkle in his eye and the physical acumen to be a top assassin. This is the type of role that Smith - especially at his age and experience - is ideal for. His charisma shines and he holds his own in the physical/fight scenes. Also, Ang Lee knows how to shoot an action sequence. True, there is nothing ""new"", revolutionary or evolutionary in any of the fight/chase scenes, but they are put together in a competent, professional manner and did a good enough job.And then there is the younger Brogan - ""Junior"" - played by a CGI ""de-aged"" Will Smith.We've seen the CGI ""de-aging"" effect before - most notably in some Marvel Movies like CAPTAIN MARVEL - and while it works well enough, I just don't think it is quite there yet. You can tell that something is just a little off - not enough for it to really bother you, but enough to know that something isn't quite right - especially when Junior spends most of this film on screen with his older self. You see the ""real"" Will Smith up against the ""copy"" and the ""copy"" looks like...a copy. Also, the ""de-aging"" of the voice didn't really work for me. It sounded ""off"" and at times it sounded like bad ADR.I was able to shrug off these slight technical anomalies and enjoy this film for what it is - a breezy action-er that certainly entertains for 2 hours. But it is no masterpiece and no ""major"" technological breakthrough. That will have to wait for another movie.Letter Grade: B (mostly for the fun interplay between older Smith, Winsted and Wong)7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Gemini Man

Problem is that this film was so underwhelming that it flew under the radar and most missed it.Personally I found it to be neither awfully bad but not awfully good either! Just not much of interest.This apparently has been a long time in coming to be made which is both surprising & not. Back when it was first touted maybe it would have made an impact (back in the 1990s?) but nowadays CGI, fantasy & sci-fi is so advanced across all media that this story & film is old hat.The story of a man hunted by his clone with conspiracy and backstabbing has been done before.

As for Will Smith, I've seen better films from him like Independence Day, Men In Black, The Pursuit of Happyness, I, Robot.The film deals with the subject of human cloning without the consent of the donor. Similar to the Arnold Schwarzenegger film The 6th Day directed by acclaimed director Roger Spottiswoode. But that film was very enjoyable to watch.However this film had my mind drifting... Once the plot is uncovered there is little to see. You will definitely see the end coming. Photography and music in the movie is okay as with movies these days. But the real let-down are the actors. None of them stands out. We had great actors in the past Sean Connery, Paul Newman, Charles Bronson, Roger Moore, Kirk Douglas, Charlton Heston, Burt Lancaster, Steve Mcqueen and many more...The mere presence of these actors raised the bar of the film.
Back to the film: Henry Brogan is an elite 51-year-old assassin who's ready to call it quits after completing his 72nd job. His plans get turned upside down when he becomes the target of a mysterious operative who can seemingly predict his every move. To his horror, Brogan soon learns that the man who's trying to kill him is a younger, faster, cloned version of himself.Verdict: action scenes are not good enough by any standards. Movie lacks intensity and the actors are too money-minded to actually put anything into the film compared to the underpaid actors of yore who, while paid little, gave their all to the film.I never want to see this film again and I regret wasting my time on it.",Gemini Man

90,bob-the-movie-man,Taking a polished turd for a trip down uncanny valley.,3,18 October 2019,"Will Smith plays top US hit-man Henry Brogan who is making the world ""safer"" one bullet at a time! With the mirror telling him his age, Henry hands in his firearm (not withstanding the arsenal under his stairs) to spend more time going fishing and doing the crossword.But all is not well when Henry's 'one for the road' hit turns out to not be quite what it seems.Teaming up with marina manager Danny (Danny??) Zakarweski (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), the pair go on the run from operatives of a government-funded black-ops organization called Gemini. Gemini is a private semi-military organization (didn't we just go here with ""Angel Has Fallen""?!). These 'baddie goodies' would rather see Henry - and all who know him - fed to the fishes rather than have him catching them.But one of these guys, under the direct command of Gemini-boss Clay Verris (Clive Owen), looks kinda familiar...Let's focus on the positives for a minute. This is a spy movie that has all of the polish that the recent ""Angel has Fallen"" didn't have. Some nice photogenic locations fly in and out again (Georgia, Budapest and Colombia: the latter for no obvious reason I can remember!). It occasionally reminded me of a glossy Bond film, but without Bond.There are also some high-class special effects (the special effects coordinator is Mark Hawker). A moonlit CGI Gulfstream with a zoom into the cockpit is particularly impressive.Some of the action set pieces also entertain. A Will-on-Will bike chase is well done, and I've not seen a bike used as a hand-to-hand weapon in this way before!And Will Smith is no doubt a class act, with his 'youngification' (I'm not sure what the official word is) also being effectively done. I also enjoyed Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who was great in ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". The lady has real screen presence.But man oh man, that script. Let's name the guilty parties in this film: the scriptwriters David Benioff (Game of Thrones), Darren Lemke and Billy Ray. (I'll put Ray last in the list, since the story was by Benioff and Lemke and this has the smell to me of Ray - who has a history of some great scripts like Captain Phillips under his name - being drafted in to steady a listing ship).Some of the dialogue in this film is not just a bit dodgy. It's head in the hands groan-worthy (and I actually did at times: fortunately the cinema was barely half full and I was on my own in the whole row). And some of it is just plain offensive. Henry meets his old pal Jack Willis (Douglas Hodge) on his yacht where he explains his wife is on a trip to Paris as a scantily clad dolly-bird wanders past. Henry comically rolls his eyes at this adulterous behaviour, with some sort of ""Jack, what are you loike!"" comment. Cringe-worthy.Will Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Benedict Wong (their ally, adding some comic relief) are clearly good actors. But the script often makes them look utterly vacuous and stupid. And Lee seems to have a ""good enough, move on"" approach to the filming. One jaw-dropping moment has Will Smith telling the others that they are going to Budapest. ""Budapest?"" Winstead and Wong are supposed to say in union, but mistime it. ""Can we do that again?"". Nope. It's on the screen.As for Clive Owen... sorry, he's really not in the same acting league, and the script does him even fewer favours. As he says at one point ""It's like the Hindenburg crashing into the Titanic"". I couldn't have put it better myself.""Uncanny Valley"". You know this phrase. The Princess Leia and Moff Tarkin scenes in ""Rogue One"" is the classic example. Effects that don't quite work on the big screen. ""But"" - you say to yourself - ""Dr Bob just said that the 'youngification' of Will Smith was done really well?"". And I'll repeat again that it was. It's on a par with Samuel L. Jackson's 'youngification' in ""Captain Marvel"". Where something strange happens is in the film's overall projection. Ang Lee has tried again with his experiment of filming at a massive 120 frames per second..... five times the normal movie frame rate of 24 fps. And the quality of the picture - particularly during high-speed action scenes - becomes outstandingly good! But equally it just doesn't 'look right'.When the human eye presumably works at an equivalent ""fps"" of thousands of 'frames per second' you'd think that it should all be fine. But for some reason I just found it distracting. Presumably the audiences for ""The Jazz Singer"" thought the same about sound; and those for ""Gone with the Wind"" and the ""Wizard of Oz"" about colour. Maybe we've seen the future, and its the new norm that we just need to get used to. We'll see.Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" was extraordinary. His ""Hulk"" was one of the poorest of the Marvel canon. Unfortunately, this movie is at the ""Hulk"" end of the spectrum. Which is a real shame. The duo of the 51 year old Smith and the 35 year old Winstead work really well together. They have great chemistry, but, you'll be relieved to hear, avoid any icky love interest.What a shame. With a different script, and some good production values, this could have been a very different story.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the interweb and Facebook.

92,kjproulx,"Sadly, a Misfire that Visually Looks Great",3,11 October 2019,"I will always admire films that take chances or try to push the boundaries of cinema. Whether or not you enjoyed Avatar or not, it's without question that it was an exceptional achievement, visually. More recently, movies like Gravity or Life of Pi have also pushed the boundaries of the technical side of filmmaking and both accomplished wonders. Director Ang Lee, who also directed Life of Pi, is at the helm here for Gemini Man, and while it may look fantastic in terms of cinematography, this movie is a misfire. Here's why I believe Gemini Man isn't worth your time.Following a hitman in Henry Brogan (Will Smith) as he's on the verge of retirement, this film kicks into gear when he discovers that a younger version of himself was cloned and sent to kill him. That's pretty much the premise of the movie, so if you were hoping to dive deeper than that, then you're going to be disappointed. Honestly, if you've seen the trailer for this movie, you've seen all the major story beats it hits. Gemini Man does nothing to wow or surprises its audience, which is a surprise in itself, given the director at hand.From Brokeback Mountain to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee has directed a few of the most celebrated movies over the last 20 years. I haven't seen the majority of his filmography, but of the films I have seen, this is easily his weakest effort yet. Not to say he wasn't trying, because the effort is clearly on display, but it just doesn't work overall. The most notable aspect of this movie is the cinematography by Dion Beebe. This man has been in the business for over 27 years and his talents have yet to waiver. From the very opening shot, my eyes were glued to the screen. Sadly, the pacing and overall story ended up taking away from this, and not very subtly either.Now for the most distracting and frustrating portion of the movie. The premise and the way it's executed are already off-putting enough, but the big selling point about this film is the fact that Will Smith gives two separate performances, both as himself and a younger version. He actually gives a far better performance than this film deserves, but even I (who is usually fairly forgiving about things like this) have to admit that the facial work on his younger version stood out like a sore thumb. Even down to the hand-to-hand combat scenes. It was clear that the person he was fighting had CGI work done to him. This idea is neat in concept, but it really didn't work here.In the end, Gemini Man surely started as a concept that had director Ang Lee very eager to bring to life, and although his vision and Beebe's framing truly do stand out as positives, this is a film that had too many conflicted writers working on it, and it shows big time. Smith puts his all into this performance and his back and forth with Mary Elizabeth Winstead was even nice at times, but this movie extraordinarily suffers from a bad screenplay and distracting visuals. I really wanted to like this movie and even chose to ignore the audience and critic reactions, but I'm with the majority on this one. It's quite a bad film as a final product.",Gemini Man
93,kuarinofu,Weird choices,6,5 December 2019,"Gemini Man is not a bad movie but it sort of tries to kill itself taking very bizarre choices in some places.The movie had an interesting enough start even though the trailer and all the promotional materials already spoiled it for you. I understand that having two Smiths as a novelty probably got more people into theaters but the story really didn't have to be that flat.The action was mostly great, the movie looked bright and colorful, and it had a couple of good jokes. The story was dull and boring, it had nothing new to offer, and the ending twist was lackluster. I just didn't buy Smith's character, he didn't work for me as an elite assassin that grew a conscience.They younger Smith looked like he was in his mid-20ties but acted like he was a teenager. His face, while done really well, was still quite distracting, and projected that uncanny valley effect when he was almost a real human but the details were just not there.I'd love to rate this movie higher, but the lack of good resolution (the weak and super unrealistic ending) and somewhat spotable heavy CGI in the action scenes just kills the fun for me.",Gemini Man

It just screams Hollywood action blockbuster from its big cast to its cliched dramatic moments, and its huge CGI filled action scenes to its international locations.While not completely flawless, the CGI is very impressive and equals that seen in most Marvel movies today from its de-aging process to its intense fights and action sequences. That said, in the final scene I'm sure I saw young Will Smith's change about 3 or 4 times - but a minor gripe.The action is huge of course in the scale of a Mission Impossible film, with plenty of one-shot scenes that make it all the more impressive! From motorbike chases to gun-play and plenty of hand-to-hand combat, any action fan should come away feeling more than pleased.While note a masterpiece, Gemini Man is pretty damn good fun and a welcome return to form for Smith at this stage!",Gemini Man

I like Ang Lee movies and Will Smith movies but I didn't like Gemini Man.Maybe it's a generation gap thing after all I've never played a video board ( in this case bored) game in my life and this movie to me is what I'd imagine a 2 hour video board game might be.
With that in mind I found something very interesting in this movie and I'm glad I've seen the new technology of Will Smith meeting his 30 year younger self .It's amazing for a moment I thought it has to be his son Jaden who is 21 but it's actually Will Smith in both roles as Henry Brogan and Junior.'Gemini Man': Will Smith's Younger Clone Is a Major Advance in VFX Tech and it is amazing technology not just in physical appearance but voice he not only looks 20 but sounds like a 20 year old.This new technically brilliant process is the most interesting part of this film for me thats why I rate it a 6 not a five.It does raise a concern for me though as studios now only have to make a 3D model of an actor and they can basically raise actors from the dead as well as age or de age them.
This of course will save the big studios millions in salaries for actors because you only need pay one actor for 2 roles.
There's no longer a need to engage actors to play another timeline role for a character in a movie (eg Barack Obama could be played by the same actor from teenager to old man)The acting is good in this movie the CGI seems very good the movie I'd sum up in 4

100,msbreviews,Rating: C-,4,10 October 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Usually, I leave the technical aspects to the end of my reviews since story, characters, and the critical element of each genre (action in action flicks, comedy in comedies, and so on) are way more important. However, having in mind the whole marketing campaign surrounding Gemini Man's ""groundbreaking innovations"", I'll address them now. Even after sleeping on it, my experience in high frame rate still feels very ... weird. In case you need some explaining, HFR adds a lot more detail to the image since it captures more frames per second hence making the image smoother, which can be extremely distracting. I always disable motion smoothing on my TV since I hate that feeling of knowing that ""something's not right"".It doesn't have to do with speed, which is something people are going to wrongly state regarding this film. The action isn't faster, don't make the mistake of saying this. Since there's 2.5x more detail (24 FPS is the standard frame rate), movements become easier to follow, so there's the illusion of watching something faster than normal. Truth is, it just FEELS like it. When characters are just talking, and there's no action involved, it works because it simply looks better. However, the action sequences are very hit-and-miss. Some pieces look absolutely amazing, but it's clear this technology needs a few more years of experience to reach its full potential.Scenes featuring car/motorbike chases, running, or shootings are stunningly filmed, but any hand-to-hand combat is frustratingly off-putting. Additionally, Ang Lee applies an excessive use of CGI to a lot of these moments, which makes some fights look incredibly absurd. HFR is not the only technical attribute people are going to discuss. That young version of Will Smith ... Honestly, it doesn't really work for me. People who complained about The Lion King (2019) not being able to show animals emoting will surely hate this attempt of replicating a young Will Smith (if they don't, then Joker was right, society is indeed extremely hypocritical).It's just like the action sequences with HFR: hit-and-miss. There are some genuinely mind-blowing scenes with medium shots of young Will Smith, and he looks 99.9% real. In these specific shots, it's impossible to tell the difference between the clone and a real version. However, it still fails to deliver this realism throughout the entire runtime. First of all, young Henry barely shows any emotions (except a brilliant crying moment), which is obviously meant to facilitate the VFX team's work. But even with his face completely still and empty of emotions, the eyes just look too doll-like. The eyebrows move strangely, and the forehead seems odd.In the end, it all comes down to forgetting that it's a digital character and that almost never happens. I always felt like I was watching a blend of CGI, motion-capture, and whatever other technology they used to try to pull this off. In a few years from now, if Gemini Man gets a remake or some other movie tries to do something similar, I bet it will look near-perfect. Right now, it's more of a disturbance than an achievement. Put this together with the already not-that-good HFR, and we get a visually striking yet distracting film.And if you thought the story would save it... It's pretty bad. Generic, predictable, and filled with almost offensive exposition. I would have to go through my reviews, but this is definitely one of the most exposition-heavy screenplays of the year. I lost count of the number of times a character starts ranting with the purpose of explaining something evident to another character. The worst thing a screenplay can do is treat the audience like they are 5-year-old children. The whole plot revolves around people asking someone else what happened, what's happening, and what's next. We already know from the trailer Will Smith is being hunted by a young version of himself, a clone.Try to imagine how many ways you can tell someone there's an individual exactly like that person. Now, just lazily insert all of those sentences on a character's script and make it say them in a single scene. I'm sorry, but it's laughably bad. There are no surprises! It ends abruptly, utterly disregarding the only interesting plot point (still very predictable), by not developing it any further than one sequence. If it wasn't for the truly fantastic cast (Will Smith is always impeccable, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Benedict Wong deliver great performances), Gemini Man would easily be one of the absolute worst movies of the year. Shoutout to Lorne Balfe's score, which is by far the technical aspect worthy of only compliments.All in all, Ang Lee's attempt to deliver a groundbreaking film doesn't quite hit the mark. Honestly, it's still far from it. The 60 FPS HFR and the young version of Will Smith are occasionally jaw-dropping, but both technical aspects need years of improvement to be able to work seamlessly. As of now, these only serve as a frustrating distraction. However, the biggest problem with Gemini Man is its exposition-heavy screenplay, which besides treating the audience like dumb people, doesn't carry any sort of surprise or novelty. As generic and predictable as it could be. The unbelievably talented cast, a spectacular score from Lorne Balfe, and a few notable action sequences save this technological hit-and-miss from missing its target entirely.",Gemini Man

I still wonder why and how! The premise was interesting, with someone like Will Smith who has such a charismatic presence; it surely gave us all a lot of hope. And then all the things just gone downwards! The script, the screenplay is horrendous. The character build ups are next to nothing! Someone like Mary who has done some tremendous work in the past has been totally wasted here. All the actors seemed like clueless on what should they do. The emotions aren't really there. Every action on their parts lacked the integrity. If I exclude the action scenes and a chasing sequence that lasted only couple of minutes; the entire movie is utter garbage. An epitome of failed execution that is! Sad to see such a promising plot failed to deliver even in the hands of a well known director! Will Smith definitely deserves better.",Gemini Man

105,MrDHWong,"A standard, run-of-the-mill action flick with occasional flashes of innovation",6,10 October 2019,"Gemini Man is an action thriller starring Will Smith and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Directed by Ang Lee (Life of Pi Movie, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), it is a standard, run-of-the-mill action flick with occasional flashes of innovation.Henry Brogan (Will Smith), a legendary assassin with over 25 years of experience, one day decides to retire from his job after a hit does not go according to plan. However, Henry's retirement is cut short when he discovers that his former employer has decided to have him killed. While taking every course of action to avoid death, Henry discovers that the main person hunting him down is in fact a younger clone of himself, who can predict his every move.While it doesn't disappoint in the action department, Gemini Man often falls flat with its mediocre script. There were often times where I felt like this film was written for 90s action audiences, and upon some research, I discovered that the story was actually conceived as far back as 1997 with several actors and directors attached to the project. This may entertain people from that era but it feels noticeably dated more than 20 years later.With all of that said, Will Smith does his usual best to ensure the film is watchable even during its blandest moments, and his interactions with co-star Mary Elizabeth Winstead were pleasant enough to sit through. What truly shines the most in this film is the convincing special effects used to de-age Will Smith by a couple of decades, taking a leaf out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's book. It was quite fascinating seeing the older and younger Will Smiths playing off each other during several key scenes, as the latter questions the meaning of his existence. Even though I feel modern audiences might not care much for it, this film should at least satisfy any fans of 90s popcorn action thrillers.I rate it 6/10",Gemini Man
106,TheTruthofItIs,Serviceable Actioner,7,8 January 2020,"""Gemini"" is a serviceable action-thriller. Will is decent enough but looks 25lbs hvy. Mary Winstead isn't cast well in this one, the part is a bit beyond her. But this film is about the younger clone adversary of ""Henry"" done through the magic of nextgen CGI. It's interesting though the plausibility of many action sequences is questionable. The Resolution of the film is fairly decent though its Denouement is blatantly contrived, so ""Hollywood"".",Gemini Man
107,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,26 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...So we've seen some movies similar to this one throughout the years. ""Looper"" (2012) where our main character meets a younger version of himself, and ""Replicant"" (2001) where a clone is made from the DNA of a serial killer in hopes that it will lead them to him - to name a couple. In this action film, our main character is pitted against a clone that is a younger version of himself.After completing what is to be his very last job, an agency assassin, Henry Brogan (Will Smith), is ready to hang it up and retire for good. Unfortunately, that is not in the cards when a hit team is sent to take him out. When they fail to do so, he is aided by another agent to find out why they were sent and who sent them. Hot on their trail is another assassin. A good one - who's style, mannerisms and moves reminds Henry of someone - himself. With everything on the line, he confronts his new nemesis face-to-face and endures a shock when he finds the face he is looking into is his own.So ... the strong points. I thought the action sequences were well done. The highlight of the movie, to me, was the motorcycle chase. The camera work was pretty good and Will Smith proves he can still get it done in an action role. But ... the script was a bit lame to me. The CG was noticeably overused and the motion of the younger Will Smith was wonky in parts. They got the facial features really good, but the CG was distracting. The pacing was good, and the ending satisfactory.All in all, I felt this wasn't a bad movie, and I did enjoy it. However, I wouldn't feel justified in recommending it. It does fall a little short. I can't blame Will Smith as I felt he did a good job in both roles. The supporting cast was solid as well. It just didn't come together right.

It doesn't look like a film from the director of the great film ""The Life of Pie"".
So much could've been done with Will Smith but he seems to have been wasted although displaying the younger version of him was nicely done but looks like it ended up with all for nothing, as it is the content that keeps these makeovers look great and it looks obvious that no care was given for the writing department.

But oh boy, the movie is kinda hard to enjoy. The characters have no depth, the story is totaly bland and the action in it's best moments is super average.I was right on both my predictions. The trailer already tells you the whole story and it does feel like you've already seen it before. And also, the creation of a young Will Smith totaly worked.The script is horrible and you can easily notice the flaws. There are some super obvious setups that are so randomly thrown in that you know it's gotta be important later, just to then be disappointed that the payoff is even worse. Speaking of ""Bees"".Sometimes it feels like scenes are missing. Some actually important stuff just happens off-screen.The finale is disappointing and unspectacular and also the special effects are super whacky.

113,danielmanson,Not a bad action film,7,9 October 2021,"I held off watching this because the majority seemed to hate it. And I'll be honest I didn't mind this at all. Sure, it's not Oscar worthy or anything, but you get what you expect in an action movie.I'll run down my issues with the film. So the plot itself, it's average. Nothing tests you or anything, it sort of just plods along. There's some amazing action scenes and it keeps you interested, but there's no plot twist or that wow factor that I believe a good plot needs.The CGI in one fighting scene in particular wasn't very good. It was far too obvious that it was heavily green screened etc. I saw some people complain about the young Will Smith character CGI and I will say I didn't actually have an issue with it. I actually thought it was done pretty well.My big issue was the character depth, mainly with the ""villain"" character. What I mean by big I ssue is that there is no depth. Tell me more about him?? He was barely in it and when he was it was all so vague. It's a 2 hour film, more than enough time to tell me about the character!Beyond all that though I still think it's a good watch. There's some really good action scenes and the camera work is also decent. Acting is also pretty good! Listen, what do you want in an action film?

Instead, there's regular Will, and faux young Will. We all knew what the movie was about, and the great effects that were done, but it really doesn't look any more amazing then any other action movie with a stunt double. I do however really like Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and haven't seen Clive Owen in quite some time, so those additions helped, as well as Benedict Wong. But overall, this movie is predictable and not even super great in the action department. Luckily, it was a free watch on Amazon.",Gemini Man
118,Offworld_Colony,Call of Duty: Clone Wars,4,6 February 2020,"Gemini Man is, in the words of Clive Owen's terrible American accent; like the Hindenburg crashing into the Titanic; Technical marvels of such fiery tenacity and dedication that are bound to crash due to oversight and hubris into a legendary wreck.I'll address the technical and the storytelling separately and despite the internet's furore, I'll deal with the worst first: The dialogue is appalling, like a vomit draft, even the films from the 90's that it apes so painfully had some spark or something going for it. Poor Will Smiths try their best to inject a requisite charm to every ham-fisted dud. If I had watched it with someone else I would have turned to them with a cruel laughter every ten minutes. A barely paraphrased example: ""I can't catch him, he's like a Ghost."" ""A Ghost with a gun."" Retorts a happy-to-be-there Mary Elizabeth Winstead who, if nothing else, injects a nice balance of strength and vulnerability and dedication to the senseless plot. A plot that jumps around the globe on an attempt to feel exciting but does so for no reason and is so obviously shoehorned in. Gemini man has a tremendously bad plot, it's shockingly unfinished for a film in Development Hell for so long. There's even a monologue where Old Smith regales Young Smith about their shared past where Old Smith reveals what it's like to grow up as Clive Owen's son WHEN BE NEVER DID! They didn't even bother to Ctrl+X the old drafts! And don't even get me started on the Bee Venom...So, aside from a shoddy script, visually how is Gemini Man? Well it's mixed bag. It's clear after several of Ang Lee's films that he favours stark realistically lit sunny exteriors if we remember back to parts of Hulk for example, and I'm not sure whether that's the right effect for this kind of movie. Yes it shows off the HFR and the 3D, and in particular, the VFX without resorting to hiding it all in the dark like most blockbusters, which is a real treat. You do end up seeing the seams in the VFX, particularly in the motion of fully CGI characters, but there are a million other seams you don't see and it's really brazen. So what sort of material would work best? Something stiller? More intimate? Street shots of Columbia and some of the vistas are shockingly pin sharp. However, this look and style doesn't really suit a moody spy-like sci-fi thriller; A Linklater film or a Winterbottom maybe would benefit from this truly stunning use of 3D, giving a depth I haven't seen in an image since Avatar in the IMAX, and not a messy sense of 3D either, not a single frame of ghosting or anything showy, just clean and crisp 4K backgrounds (sometimes full yin focus) and incredible cut-outs of close ups of actor's faces. It reminded me in places of the wow and balls of Dion Bebe's Miami Vice photography, and this tech in the hands of someone on the cutting edge of directing like Michael Mann or with the love of classics like Chris Nolan, would both be able to take this medium to new heights in diametrically opposed ways. Using this fidelity and technology combination of 3D, HFR and 4K reminds me of a painting, you read the image differently, you take in little moments, little pops of colour, your eye drifts around the frame instead of with a standard 24FPS movie where you're coded to follow faces only and allow the filmmaker to present you with cuts to focus you and draw attention, instead Ang Lee has portrayed a tableau and allows you rove around finding little joys of information. all within one frame. One wonders whether a story befitting this new way of appreciating film would help the technology better. Which is a moving window into another world.So here's the thing about HFR. It is the future. When TV and Videogames and Movies have merged (more than they already have) and share their technology and their audiences and influences, it stands to reason and people will accept the norm and stop complaining. When nostalgia for 'film' dies along with its filmmakers and technology manages to recapture that magic for a new generation in a more inclusive, less jarring, and more widespread and cheaper way, no one will look backwards and People will stop complaining about inevitable change. Until the next 'leap' in technology. Film doesn't have to be 'Film', it can be whatever it needs to be. Regarding HFR's use in Gemini Man, again, it's mixed bag: The motion of the action, the way people move, it's all genuinely spectacular, it's the best I've ever seen, it's delicious, and lights from muzzle flashes and tracer rounds, and just the movement of everything within the frame is breathtaking. However, every time the camera pans, or pivots, everything looks the kind of 'fake' that people complain about. I've thought about this and maybe Films need to add motion blur to camera movement the way videogames do, not to character movement or anything in the frame, but just to smooth the panning, the 'looking' effect. The eye tends to snap from place to place when it looks, not drift, if it did, it feels like it may blur like vision in a videogame. So if the camera emulated by either snapping, as it does with a 'cut' or blurring as it does in most videogames, it could help contribute to the effect of making HFR feeling more natural and realistic and not 'fake'. More information is always better for creating, but not always for presenting.In terms of action, despite a couple of shaky scenes (Winstead's fight for example), on the whole it's impressive, the fidelity draws you in, the HFR keeps it fluid and the VFX makes it pop in an exciting way. The crypt hand to hand fight and the motorcycle chase dares you to try and find the flaws in the VFX and mostly it leaves you disappointed in that regard. When the muzzles pop I found it really startling in a good way and the chases I found genuinely toe-curling and tense, the 3D layering it front and centre; This is all compounded by Lee's exciting first person shots and creative action shooting; Junior's dynamism and little stings of dispatching armoured guards or Smith dragging an injured Winstead as she continues to shoot.Ang Lee has some great ideas here and he does so with zeal but he's repeated a strange trend shared with Avatar, with leading the way with all of this tech, he's not been able to make the content emotional or engaging or interesting, unique or clever. The film, as a story has no reason to exits. It's safe and boring while the HFR, VFX and 3D is groundbreaking and pioneering. But he loves the tech and that's nice to see, especially since Cameron is wheedling out of the conversation and backpeddling on HFR with the Avatar sequels, and his lingering love shows.But why watch this when you can watch the equally technically savvy and much more simple, sensitive and well crafted Living With Yourself on Netflix with Paul Rudd? Well, that leaves you with the technical. So leaving HFR aside and the 3D which works well but may not be the most important technology here, which holds up the much discussed and maturing face replacement VFX here. And it's only janky once at the end. And occasionally some issues with the top lip thing which I can't unsee once YouTube's Corridor Crew pointed it out (where a person's top lips doesn't have any contracting muscles in it and yet CGI faces continuously emote by pulling the top lip up unaided). The rest of the VFX speaks for itself, where it does dip in to the uncanny valley you kind of give it a pass due to the sheer quality of it, the sedate, understated performance and the power of the teams putting both characters together in one scene.Gemini Man is a film that is both dated and ahead of its time at time of release. It's an oxymoron. It's rubbish and I loved it, I appreciated it and I'll never watch it again. It's a bad movie, but an important experiment and powerful experience.",Gemini Man
119,ethanbresnett,Nothing special but entertaining enough,7,28 June 2020,"Gemini Man is a bang average action film, nothing more, nothing less. I'm not quite sure why it received so much hate upon release as there's nothing inherently wrong with it. It did felt like it was going through the motions for large portions of the film, surrendering to action film clichés and tropes in many areas, but that doesn't mean it wasn't entertaining.The plot wasn't awful at all. Essentially Will Smith is an ageing assassin who needs to be taken out of commission by a covert agency, so they send Smith's young clone to do the job. There isn't too much mystery or many twists or turns to Gemini Man, its pretty upfront about what it is and focuses on the action as opposed to plot.Speaking of the action, I liked it for the most part. It was pretty slick in some sections, with several gritty set pieces and inventive stunt work. It really wasn't anything too revolutionary though. Its the sort of action you'll have seen if you've watched any other Will Smith or Mark Wahlberg film. There were a few set pieces which were ludicrous, like a motorcycle fight scene, but mostly the action was realistic (to a degree). Unfortunately there some action sequences where the fights looked heavily animated, perhaps due to the limitations of integrating the de-ageing technology with stunt work. One sequence that springs to mind is a fight scene within the catacombs. Despite it being 20 years later, the swinging and punching arms of the de-aged Smith reminded me of the CG multiple Agent Smiths fighting Neo in Matrix Reloaded. I'm not quite sure what was going on but it broke the illusion a fair bit.Aside from this the de-ageing technology was mostly effective. It was good enough that you stopped noticing it, and there were some great scenes highlighting this extraordinary technology. It didn't feel purely like a gimmick which I had feared going into this film, and the whole clone thing made sense within the world that Gemini Man created.This film isn't going to set your world alight, but it will keep you happy enough for two hours.

I wasn't expecting much, just to be entertained. The soundtrack wasn't great in fact there were times when there was no music at all. It was shot was a bit soap opera-esque imo ,meaning not a lot of extras in the film: empty streets and clear images etc. the animation was cool but not mind blowing( in that will smith was both older and younger. There was action but it wasn't constant. There were a couple of well done scenes. More of a 'family' action movie in that it wasn't gory or gratuitous with the violence and the characters had conscience and related well to each other. It could have been off the chain but they kept it simple and screen-legible. I struggled with rating this a 6 vs 7 since it doesn't really hold up against other shows I have rated a 7, however, it was nice departure from the plot twisting -rock 'em sock 'em movies I have grow' accustomed to.

The film never progressed at Disney, though, as the technology was not developed enough at that time for the film to be produced witch is sad but how in earth 6th day film with Arnold got that technology to make his character like clone witch i thought to myself they made this movie back in 2000's like 6th day did. but anyway now since past this film got made starting will smith as lead role witch i like will smith as actor Bad boys 1&2 films, Independence day, enemy of state, Ali, I, Robot, Hitch, I Am Legend, Hancock, Suicide Squad, Bright now tothis film witch i did enjoy and seeing this in 3D wasn't bad experience but 3D isn't that special, to this film it's pretty enjoyable the story and script was good, Clive Owen was good in this film as well as villain. i thought Ang lee is good director but i wanted to see Ridley scott to direct this movie someone but if tony scott was alive i recokin it would been a much better who know's how he is going to write this movie. But the real star of the film is the 3d extra high frame rate of 120fps. Unfortunately it gives the film a documentary-style look witch it looks odd because i wanted cinematography to be like actually movie but i have no clue why Ang Lee made it look like documenty but still well shot film. i was glad to ignore reviews because reviews most of times 10 out 10 times wrong for films because i avoid joker never seen it but i wanted to put my money in this movie i thought this looked like more movie for me to see rather then seeing joker. every time i judge movie i judge it myself whatever i like movie or not but i ended liking this until this day i don't understand how reviews hate this film ? Watch it before reading the critics if you do you will end missing out this great fun popcorn will smith film witch had great action scenes, great CGI of clone smith, i never understand the low scores here if you do avoid this and thinking this is bad because of reviews go ahead because your missing out this intersing film, avoid joker start going your own way. WillSmith does it again. Awesome storyline with a lot of action and stuff blowing up! This movie offers something different then the typical Government conspiracy, and the way Will acts from the way he use to act in his Fresh Prince days to the way he acts in Movies now. This movie doesn't have a dull moment i never understand the hates. the story follows will smith (Henry Brogan) an aging government assassin regarded as the best killer of his generation he has been doing it for his all life he wants to retire as a assassin. Clay Varris (Clive Owen) witch he does good script he has been given is good he request's aGemini man he is a head of a top-secret black ops unit codenamed ""GEMINI"", wants to go after Henry but is denied the request. because he wants a younger clone because when people's in their 20's they do mistakes they listen to older people, so he wants a younger clone so he can have his own assassin and kill older Henry. (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) Dani Zakarweski, a hitwoman and ally of Henry who remains loyal to him after he is targeted for death, she helps him and follows him to get to clone. another character Baron (Benedict Wong) who is a colleague of Henry and Dani. action scenes with will smith and clone version of him had a fight scene but i wish their could been much better like have more of showdown together a lot more fight scene together, action scenes are well done can't say much of it nothing to companying about.rest of movie is really good end of day you like it but it's not best film ever but i thought this is really underrated film people wanna worser movie then this watch After Earth (2013) that is much, much worser movie then to this movie much worse specially his son jarden smith worser actor ever to be in this movie ever this is kinda movie that is watchable not a mediocre i call it but it's enjoyable and watchable film it's bad film as what you think it is from reviews give it a look, give this a try save joker or any another movies is theater give this a shot it's worth it 8.10 i am waiting for Bad Boys III aka Bad boys for life.",Gemini Man

125,akcenat,Visually impressive action thriller that doesn't quite live up to it's intriguing premise,7,17 December 2019,"""Gemini Man"" revolves around the idea of old vs young, experience vs ambition and which is better. The film, also, gives a look into the future of the tech behind how we consume movies, but not much of anything else. It feels like sort of multiple films that quickly devolves into something that resembles the parts of the recent Jason Bourne mixed with pieces of ""Minority Report"" and "" Looper"" that doesn't quite succeed as a whole. Also, for all of movie's technical prowess, seeing Will Smith fight a (digitized) version of himself does looks like as if it should be the next video game coming out for PS4's because the differences in life versus CGI are glaring. Saying that, it feels also particularly disappointing that a technological showcase exists in a film that's so mediocre. Ultimately, the film makes for an OK coming-out party for an exciting piece of tech, one that could have fascinating applications in the coming years, but offers precious little else. Smith's usual charm feels neither authentic nor genuine, actually it's a poor match for cold-looking Clive Owen's performance. Female characters doesn't have a ton to do, mostly filling the expository sidekick roles. In general, ""Gemini Man"" offers some decent action, particularly a motorcycle chase scene, but some of the film's other action scenes are dark and murky, while the fight choreography so rapid that you will had trouble following what is happening. At the end, movie is watchable - and isn't all that good, but it isn't the worst movie - and easily forgettable, especially if you think about it two months after you saw it. Will Smith fans will be pleased, but for all of us other, you're not really missing anything.Rating: 6/7- just because of big production",Gemini Man
126,stevenrotherforth,De-ageing software is a bit bargain basement,6,11 April 2020,"Gemini ManNot nearly as awful as some reviews suggest.
'Gemini Man ' is just another watchable run of the mill action movie.
That said it is carried by Will Smith's charisma and ultimately it is an enjoyable experience in a throwaway sense.'Gemini Man's' unique selling point is that we get double the Will Smith for our money.
Smith plays an aging assassin who is hunted by a younger version of himself.
What will draw in the crowds is the chance to see a fresh faced fresh prince once again as de-ageing software make Smith look like he's in his twenties again.
The problem is that the software in use isn't all that good.
Marvel have cracked it with their own use of the technology.
Anyone who has seen a young Michael Douglas or Kurt Russell in the MCU will understand where I'm coming from in regards to this.
'Gemini Man' can look like a cut price version.
Some close up shots of Smith look rather suspect.
Darker scenes fair better.
A particular fight scene in a darkened room was rather good.
Fast moving scenes work well too but close ups reveal the techs inadequacies.
Director Ang Lee has chosen to shoot his picture at 60fps once again.
The enhanced frame rate gives the movie a hyper sense of realism but does accentuate some of the CGI's flaws.
Anyone with a 4K HDR Blu-ray player is in for a real treat. This Blu-ray offers some of the best picture quality the format has to offer.
It sounds pretty good too.I would purchase this movie for the picture quality alone.
The film itself is OK but even with several Will Smith's, it's nowhere near his best.",Gemini Man

Will Smith's duel performance is interesting enough to keep this movie going, and the de-aging works well. It's just frustrating that a filmmaker like Ang Lee (""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"", ""Life Of Pi"") would settle for a mediocre plot.

And I could not recommend this to anyone ever.",Gemini Man
132,Med-Jasta,Well executed movie!,10,23 September 2020,"This felt like a 90s action movie in the best way possible. The scope of the movie really wasn't that big. The concept was but there weren't that many people in it. And the action scenes were very small but detailed. No huge explosions with an endless army coming after them for a mini war. This kinda felt like a rarely seen midbudget movie.Will Smith was a great advantage to the plot because we've seen young Will. We know what he looks like so it helps sell Junior. I think with a more unknown actor you might second guess the young version as looking fake. Remember no one thought the Clones in Attack of the Clones looked fake until the ""making of"" told us they were digital.The CG isn't perfect but it's close. The only issues are during the fight scenes when CG Will moved quickly there was some strobing. The CG was perfect where it counted though, during the emotional scenes.I really liked that as a sci-fi movie they didn't focus on the sci-fi. They are told that cloning happens and accept it. Instead they focus on the emotional aspects of the science. It's harder for Junior to accept this because when you're a youth you don't want to think you're like anyone. And the 3rd Will (which we all see coming) was a good emotional hook because he was younger/more innocent. And you knew then that Clive Owen was just going to keep cloning and cloning Will. Putting more people through what Junior went through.Clive was a good bad guy because you understood where he was coming from. He was trying to do a good thing but just went too far. I liked that both Will's problem was Clive.Also for me his death was amazing. So many times in movies the good guy won't kill the unarmed bad guy. Even though they've killed a million people already. I was hoping Will was going to do it because he already had those shadows. And he did!Benedict Wong a good, grounded comic relief. He didn't do jokes it was mostly just situational. Not all his humor is funny but that's fine. He had a good rapport with Will.I really liked that Mary Elizabeth didn't get with Will. Nothing like a forced romance. She was very good too.Another good thing about Will was that he wasn't just good as a assassin he was insanely good and they always brought it up. Helped sell some of the crazy stuff he did. You saw that he was worth cloning.The motorcycle scene was crazy cool. And the CG was used to help set the reality of the movie. Face replacement and things like that. It was nice to see the CG utilized for it's subtle advantages.I was nervous with this movie because Will, while great, usually makes Will Smith movies. They tend to have similar qualities. You know what I'm talking about. But it seems like he's been breaking out of that lately. He doesn't have to be the funny guy or saving the world.And Ang Lee, is hit and miss. But in the greatest way because he always goes for it. I like that. But you never know what he's give you. But I was pleasantly surprised.",Gemini Man
133,DeBBss,I Surprisingly Liked It,6,3 October 2020,"When I originally saw the ratings and reviews for Gemini Man, I thought that this movie was going to be a complete and utter mess when going into it. After watching the movie, it now puzzles me as to why Gemini Man has a 38 on metacritic. Gemini Man isn't a movie that deserves 80s and 90s, but it definitely doesn't deserve a 38.Gemini Man is a typical product that you get from Hollywood nowadays. An subpar plot that offers no intelligence and has mediocre entertaining action scenes. People didn't come to watch a Stanley Kubrik film, they came to watch a Michael Bay film; and Gemini Man offers exactly what the audience wants. I would say Gemini Man's action scenes are very decent, but what makes Gemini Man so entertaining was the cinematography. I have never seen an action movie filmed the same way as Gemini Man, and it's truly entertaining to watch. Granted, there are times where the movement of the characters are very CGI looking, and it can be distracting at times; but overall, the action was great.The CGI younger version of Will Smith is very impressive in my opinion. He really does look younger, and fortunately, it's very believable. And for some odd reason, I really cared about this character. You never hated him throughout the movie, you actually empathize with him. You can see how he's been brainwashed and you want him to understand and be self aware.I think that Gemini Man is a very passable action movie of the 21st century. It's consistently entertaining and it has likable characters. It does struggles with the cliches and tropes that almost every movie suffers from nowadays. But overall, it's a definite 6/10, and definitely not a 38/100.",Gemini Man

director: Ang Lee
starring: Will Smith,Mary Elizabeth Winstead,Clive owen,Benedict Wong,overall rating. 77/100A retiring hitman ( Will smith) gets framed by his own government and he must battle a faster stronger and younger cloned version of himself in order to survive but everything is not as it seems. Gemini was a pretty solid action movie. It definitely doesn't deserve the negative response its been getting. Although i did still have a few problems with the movie lets get into why this is.First of all the visuals were actually fantastic. The film was surprisingly beautiful to look at which is rare for a action movie. The cinematography and colour palette was pleasing to the eye. And the set locations were beautiful and inventive to create action sequences.Next i thought will smith bought his A game in terms of the standard of his acting in Gemini man. His performance was fantastic authentic and believable. They really went deep into his character and the flaws he admits to himself and portrays and has with his clone. And you believed every word he says the script for Will was largely good as well not for the entire movie which i will get onto later. But some of his heart to hearts with other characters within the film was very impactful. And his chemistry with mary Winstead was great as well. Her character was also very likeable and had great comedic and romantic chemistry with will. They were both a delightful in there interactions with each other and them gelling well was one of the best parts of the film for me. And Benedict Wong also bought a lot of humour to the film so he was a great addition to Gemini man as well.However adding onto my previous point the script for the large majority of the film was poor. A lot of lines that all the characters had to say was incredibly cheesy in places. And the script bought the film down largely due to how old fashioned it felt. Which just doesn't go with what the film wants with its visuals and premise.But adding onto the previous point i thought the film itself was an interesting idea and concept. The whole idea of multiple clones of will smith is an interesting one. And the plot has not been used much before so it felt mostly fresh and done well despite not fully landing with the execution of the idea in places.Next i thought what the film managed to accomplish with the de aging of will smith was impressive. the way they managed to create a believable character out of the same person was impressive. However i do have to say it was very noticeable and distracting at times as his face just looked so heavily edited.Next the villain ( clive owen) was really good. His whole father/son relationship that he tried to form with junior despite knowing he was only using him for a weapon was really interesting and made his character very unlikeable which is great. He tried everything to manipulate junior and it really was great when he did not succeed. The plot twist of junior only being a pawn for him due to him having another better clone was well executed as well.Now for my final positive and negative. First of all i thought the film had a lot of pacing inconsistencies. The film really didn't know whether it wanted to be a slow burner or a fast paced action movie and i feel like the film got stuck in between these two which can be a turn off for some audience members and critics. But i have to say the films action sequences were fantastic. They were seriously some of the most entertaining and inventive action i have seen in a long time. Will smith still proves he can hold his own and there was a lot of tension and fast paced action which was great as well.Overall gemini man is a very good and entertaining action. But is held back by its script and pacing issues therefore is not able to fully convey the message and legacy it perhaps wanted.",Gemini Man

140,ginocox-206-336968,"Entertaining action scenes, implausible plot",5,24 November 2019,"Gemini Man opens with a sniper shot that is so ridiculously improbable that it makes it difficult to take the rest of the movie at all seriously.The target is a mile and a half away, which would rank it with the longest sniper kill in history, most of which were made with much larger .50 caliber weapons. But this shot is made with a .308 caliber Remington 700PSS which has a much lower muzzle velocity. The target is not stationary, but travelling on a bullet train at 238 km/hr, or 217 ft/sec, so if the sniper pulls the trigger a hundredth of a second too early or too late, he'll miss by two feet. The sniper can't see into the train, so has a cohort stationed near the target to tell him where the target is seated and to verify the kill. How do you persuade somebody to do that? ""A sniper will fire blindly into this car. If he's off by a tenth of a second, he'll miss by twenty feet. Your job is to stand five feet away from the target and tell him to fire again, if he misses."" The premise is even more implausible than some of the shots in Wanted, but is presented without the tongue-in-cheek element.The plot doesn't make a lot of sense and is merely a threadbare excuse for action scenes, which are well choreographed and entertaining. One character must have at least three stunt doubles to handle the parkour, motorcycle stunts, and martial arts. The female lead isn't really a love interest, as it's more of a buddy-love film, and alternates between fragile victim and empowered woman fully capable of competing with highly-trained men with more years of experience than she's been alive.If one can turn their intellect down to simmer, crank their willful suspension of disbelief up to redline, and find sufficient charity to overlook the mishmash of tired tropes masquerading as a plot, the film is reasonably entertaining. The production is slick and avoids annoying jiggly-cam shots. While the audience may have trouble taking the film seriously, the actors seem invested in their roles.",Gemini Man

Clay Verris (Clive Owen) a corrupt man who works for the government, follows Henry and tries to eliminate him with the help of a new mysterious assassin, who strangely knows how to predict what his pans and fighting techniques will be like.
Together with the help of friends, Henry tries to unmask his competitor and then eliminate him, but when Henry manages to unmask him, he learns that it has to do with a younger version of himself.Ang Lee tries to present this film in a unique way. He has recorded this film again with a higher frame rate. He also did this in 2016 with the film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. This time he tries to further develop the film and himself with this technique. This technique sometimes makes it appear as if the images are being played back more quickly. Ang Lee has said that he has chosen this speed, so that the viewers get the feeling that they are really present in the film and experience the events in a more realistic way. For this he also chose to make the film in 3D. They have also put the younger version of Will Smith into the film well with rejuvenating effects, making it look like you're watching a Will Smith movie or TV series from the nineties. On the other hand, if the younger Will Smith character is in an exposed scene, the CGI that they used to rejuvenate him can be seen again, so that sometimes there is a distinct glow around the character.Apart from the effects, the film is unfortunately also a standard action film where the main characters have to compete against a younger or better competitor. Such storylines have been featured in other films before. This way the film loses its uniqueness after the special effects. The film also contains too many scenes in which certain things are explained. All these explanation scenes ensure that the film quickly becomes long-winded.Will Smith does his best to carry the film with his dual role in the film, but does not get that far thanks to the standard script. The others in the cast serve more as extra characters that give Will Smith the necessary information. Benedict Wong knows how to provide a few comic moments in the film, but unfortunately not enough to really entertain the film.",Gemini Man

The tone of Gemini Man is somewhat acceptable but ultimately it falls over its own foundations, which of course are weak to begin with. What probably interested viewers the most about watching this film (and to some the only part that interested them) is the de-aging technology that was to be used on Will Smith, and how was that going to look on screen. While it wasn't disappointing, it is evident that the people working on this still have a way to go to make their work look flawless. The main problem lies in the writing, which is far away from being firmly good, even though the film does contain some entertaining action sequences such as the motorcycle chase and Will Smith going toe-to-toe with his younger self.Other than that, you won't get much satisfaction from a script/story that fails to offer a proper execution of the premise that at first glance seemed somewhat interesting.

Will Smith seems to play a somewhat in between of I am legend and I, robot character of his and I get it, that's the screen person he's most comfortable with but we've seen it all too many times to care for another shot. Overall movie feels flat, one-dimensional, uninspiring with at times very visible bad SGI and green screen backgrounds. Had it come out fifteen years ago it would have been another smash hit of Smith's and Lee's but by today's standards it's a low quality carbon copy of Sixth Day, Looper and so many far better movies on this topic. The only reason I'm giving this one a five out of ten is because of Will (who's despite all I've said is still pretty damn good), wonderful score, fine cinematography (but not great), beautiful landscapes and a villain you don't want to immediately facepalm after you realize his motifs but other than that it's a throw in a basket motion picture.",Gemini Man

Junior is under the control and supervision of Gemini Director Clay Verris (Clive Owen) who has dreams of an army of Juniors (clones) to save American families the heartbreak of losing sons in war.The motorcycle chase is one of the best I have ever seen. We see Junior on his motorcycle shooting constantly at Henry also on a motorcycle and this is most exciting.The heart stopping music is spot on. The editing for this movie is fantastic. Kudos.

Lacklustre story that literally has nothing of a plot other than to pit 2 will smiths against each other using preety subpar ( in places) cgi, I can only assume this was originally meant for a straight to DVD release but then someone had a change of heart and decided on a cinema release instead, it's not that it's bad it's just not good, the plot is boring with a bland story line,the action scenes are mostly MEH! the motorcycle chase was over long & unrealistic with poor cgi effects for the most part & the fight scene between will Smith & his younger self was also unbelievable marred by subpar cgi.
So let's get this straight because a lot of these reviews are giving cudos to the digital de-aging & the 2 roles will Smith plays, ok so will Smith plays one role, his character, no digital de-aging or make up de-aging was used, some scenes a younger slimmer actor than will Smith( Victor Hugo) was probably used for the younger will Smith but the face was nothing more than cgi and it wasn't very good for the most part, but a lot of the scenes the entire character of the younger will smith was completely cgi, now all this may sound mean after all the cgi was by WETA, the cgi for smiths younger self was made up purely from data, in some scenes it looks really good for a second or 2 but thats all, it was far too ambitious especially on a movie with a budget of 138 million & as good as the people at WETA are, full realistic cgi face recreation is still not possible especially on that budget, just ask James Cameron, but all said & done it was an OK movie just a bit pointless",Gemini Man

It did get a little slow once the clone started wanting answers for his being created. The action scenes were ok. Will has done better ones in better movies, but these weren't horrible.

This was more tedious than anything else this year other than 'Cats'. It is unbearable.The budget must have been massive; but rather similarly to the 'Game of Thrones' final season without good writing that makes sense, you end up with something dull and uninspiring.The trailer pretty much covers everything from the plot, the rest of the film is padded out with trite dialogue and nonsensical action.1/10 Mr Benioff please stop writing.",Gemini Man
158,Lewis_Heather787,Amazingly Boring !,4,11 October 2019,"My god is this film a mess !!! Straight up that is the first thing that jumped out at me once seeing it. It is no wonder why the idea for this film has been hanging around studios for years because there is somewhere within the ruins of this film a decent story. Unfortunately for everyone in 2019 we didn't get that, instead we were given a film that is mind numbingly boring with some of the worst CGI I've seen in a long while.Now I completely understand that this ""de-aging"" technology is still in its infancy, so there are going to be a few hurdles for it to overcome. Although the fantastic artists and people behind the film tried there best at making the effects looking jaw dropping..........in a way they did but for all the wrong reasons. There is no getting round it the effects of ""Young Will Smith"" just look so out of place, especially in some of the action scenes it looks almost video game like. Maybe that was the direction they were going for or it was bad effects, either way it doesn't look good.Unfortunately its hard to focus on anything else in the film because it takes your attention way so much...............and also the bigger problem that there was nothing else to take your attention away. Don't get me wrong Will Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Clive Owen all looking like there at least trying to do something. However the script their given is incredibly boring and unfortunately very cliche.........everything about the film is almost a cliche of a bad 80's or 90's action film with really bad CGI.Overall its pretty poor 45% out of 100 or 4.5 out of 10, I am sure that there is a story here to be told but it has to be put into better hands in terms of writing and directing............and to wait for the technology to develop, so its at a stage where it can be used properly. Yeah give this a miss if I were you !",Gemini Man
159,Eli_Elvis,"Damn, too bad.",6,20 November 2019,"It's actually a pretty solid film. Could have used a better scriptwriter(of its benieoff, fking hack), and they should have nailed the de-aging before releasing or not used it at all. It was way too distracting. Ang Lee should stop the bull and concentrate on good stories, he's a master storyteller but he gets sidetracked by his computer toys. I started the rating at an 8, but with each obvious mistake I had to drop it to a 5, but for good faith, good actors and characters, and an original story I bump it back to a 6. Sadly. Wish I could give it more. Love you Will, Love you Ang. Hope you 2 work together again and I kinda wish they make a sequel.",Gemini Man

162,peeedeee-94281,I Have Hope That Ang Lee Will Do Another Good Movie,1,16 October 2020,"Sadly, this is not the movie Ang Lee would want to highlight in his filmography. It has a very generic and cliched plot of a former killer/sniper who decides he wants to retire, and then the people who he worked for are after him. Hmmm...where have we heard that before.
But that's just the beginning of the flaws. The chemistry between Will Smith and the actress playing the Agent he's trying to save, is non-existent. It makes you wonder why he is even bothering. But then she's not the target, he is, or are they both? It gets confusing after a while.
The worst angle, though, is this clone Smith, named 'Junior'. Come on, how would this have even been possible to hide, considering the guy running the Gemini program (not a secret organization, if they have a building with a giant sign on the side of it saying 'Gemini'), played by a very aged Clive Owen, has a kid that looks EXACTLY like the guy he trained, and is raising him as his son. Nobody around him thought that it was weird?
And the reason for Clive Owen's character wanting him to take out Will Smith are convoluted. Is it because he's afraid he discovered the cloning program existed? Why wouldn't Will Smith have heard of that anyway, considering he has friends everywhere. Why does it matter if Will Smith's clone is running around assassinating people if he was already around for the last 20 or so years as his kid? Made zero sense.
Then the dumbest twist of all towards the end, a second clone. No explanation how that one was raised. Just that he had more genetic modifications. Yeah, right. And lots of armor.
So this movie ultimately is unsatisfying viewing. The reasons for why the characters behave the way they do are unclear, and almost pointless. The happy ending is really lame as well. This movie was a disaster for Ang Lee, considering his earlier accomplishments. I hope he can come up with another movie that puts this one away permanently.",Gemini Man

164,coasterdude44,"Well the action was good, Will Smith great as always",6,13 October 2019,"Overall good action and great cinematography aswell as some great acting from Will Smith, but overall fairly lacking in most respects. The clones were entertaining and you could really sympathise with them since how they felt so different and really Aspergian and that they couldn't understand what it was really like to be human and they felt created to carry out a single task. I did find the character of Will Smith's Gemini to be compelling and is what I found to be the best part of the movie. The action was solid and was directed wellOverall an entertaining action movie with some good performances with Will Smith being great as always, but overall pretty forgettable action movie with some great moments of acting but overall nothing much else standing out to be overly captivating, memorable or engaging. See it if you want, it is entertaining and a fun ride, but there's nothing much that's engaging about it either, though watching Will Smith fight himself was pretty coolThis movie was also shot in High Frame Rate 4K but unfortunately hardly any movie theaters around the world can play it, but I applaud Ang Lee for giving the new technology a shot anyways. Theaters will start using the technology sometime soon and it should become more common. I guess it'll look good on the Blu-Ray",Gemini Man

169,shoobe01-1,A top-tier 70s spy thriller until it became a 2000s CGI-crapfest,6,24 July 2020,"Partly a rather to very good classic old spy thriller with bits of really good and appropriate action. Will Smith does some of his best acting, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is delightfully written and a very good actor, believable fighter and they do not hook up because that would be stupid! Even has the standard slightly wisecracking old friend who arranges everything, and who doesn't love Benedict Wong in any role really?Really well filmed. On that alone, sorta worth a watch. Much of the action is very well done. The motorcycle chase is top-10 of those, and just the way the alley escape was filmed also is worth study. Sadly, the motorcycle as fighting implement right after is dumb and not believable.Which leads to the big problem. The central conceit rather fails. The CGI or de-aged (I see different opinions of which is happening) Will Smith is... not good. It would be weird and not good if it was just a nameless automaton fighting, but they have the clearly-fake robot try to act and emote. It doesn't work.The tacked-on supersoldier at the end was super, super awful. I never like nearly-indestructible monsters, as they tend to break the laws of physics, and here they did it again by just minutes before talking about how to take out the over-armored baddies. Then this guy can't be shot anywhere? Weak. Also hate - and found needless - that the Big Bad is the head of an unchecked mercenary program, has sway over the government, they all wear black. Just little things that didn't have to happen and could have let the good bits of the movie stand on their own better.Clive Owen was also very odd. I can't decide if he has had work done or was also digitally modified, or is just weird looking, but he looked weird. I also can't decide how is acting was as he was written so oddly, with severe tonal shifts through the movie.",Gemini Man
170,Zedyeti,Another bad will smith movie,3,2 September 2020,I did not expect much since will smith hasn't made a good movie since last century but I tried. It starts out ok but lost interest and got boring around the time of the dumb motorcycle fight. I watched it it with multiple people and around that time I noticed people I was watching it with and myself started doing other things than watch it. It's pretty lame. Now if you wanna talk cgi it's probably really good looking to some people but if your use to technology like video games or watch a lot of movies it's going to look bad. Either way this movie is very forgettable.,Gemini Man
171,arabnikita,Wasted potential...,4,9 October 2019,"I had zero expectations for Gemini Man and the movie delivered just that because unfortunately, having two Will Smiths doesnt mean that the film will be twice as exciting. Its not all bad but neither is it particularly good which makes it seem like a Netflix movie where the creators have big ambitions but end up with a bland plot and half way execution.There are some good points like the CGI that was used to make Will Smith look younger and he did a decent job acting a 50 and a 20 year old in the same film. There were good moments of action with good choreography and camera work but sadly most of the film is so dark that I had to strain my eyes to discern what was happening. A predictable narrative with some out of place jokes and some real head-scratching moments that nearly turned the film into a parody.All in all, Gemini man felt like a poor man's Jason Bourne movie which lost its momentum too soon due to poor pacing, flat dialogue and weak storyline. Nevertheless, some good parts are there and they kind of balanced out the entire experience. I would not recommend wathcing it in the cinema, unless you are a Will Smith fan, but if you do, take into account that David Benioff wrote this.",Gemini Man
172,hunter-friesen,"Double Will Smith can't save ""Gemini Man""",5,25 October 2019,"Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the most elite assassin the U.S. government has ever had. He has 72 confirmed kills and is even able to hit a target on a moving train from over two kilometers away. Disillusioned and fatigues from years of killing, Henry decides to put it all away for a quiet retirement.Unfortunately for him, the life he's lived the past few decades doesn't just go away. After figuring out some dark secrets about his last job, Henry is betrayed by his government and made an enemy of the state.Knowing that Brogan is the best there ever was, the government decides to send their most valuable asset, Gemini; a direct clone of Brogan that ""possesses all his strengths without his pain.""Pitted against a seemingly perfect version of himself, Henry must go on the run and fight to clear his name.Directed by two-time Academy Award winner Ang Lee, ""Gemini Man"" is both a marvel and a tragedy on a technical level.Repeating the technique he used in his previous feature ""Billy Lyn's Long Halftime Walk"", Lee uses a frame rate of 120 frames per second, five times more than the traditional 24. This results in a give and take situation where the technology grants unparalleled picture quality at the expense of your eyeballs. The glorious images become physically hard to watch and induce headaches, especially when paired with 3D.Another technical innovation that Lee incorporates is the use of de-aging on 51-year old Will Smith to allow him to play the 23-year old clone. Just like the frame rate, this technique has its ups and downs.During the early and darker lit scenes, the effects look great and don't cause any distraction. Near the end of the film is when things start to slide downhill. Scenes taking place in the daylight show off the imperfections in facial movements. The final scene is the most guilty as the effects are laughably atrocious and make the clone look more like a character from ""The Polar Express"" than an actual living human.And even with these technical innovations, Lee still isn't able to make full use of them in the action set pieces.The larger shootouts are handled pretty well as they flow together with steady camerawork and tight blocking. The hand-to-hand combat sequences are when Lee loses focus, leaning heavily on the ""Jason Bourne"" style of choppy editing and shaky cam. It becomes hard to tell what's going and who's winning a fight, especially since the two Will Smith characters look and dress exactly alike.With three credited screenwriters and countless that have come and gone over the years, the script for ""Gemini Man"" is a mess that feels like it was ripped straight from the 1990s. That feeling is fitting since the screenplay was first written in 1997 and seems to have never been updated. It is heavily laden with cliches and hammy dialogue that are impossible to recover from despite the cast's best efforts.The plot for ""Gemini Man"" is pretty simple on paper, but on film, it's a confusing mess. It's a strain to keep all the facts straight and follow the reasoning for anything to happen.There's also a lack of humanity and character development. Will Smith does his best in his dual roles, but the writing gives him nothing to work with. By the end, most characters are just shells of a person.As noted before, Will Smith turns in one of his better performances and does a great job in his dueling roles. As Henry, Smith is closed off and mature. When playing the clone, he's more vulnerable. Even with writing's severe limitations on what he can do, Smith can sell you on the idea that these are two separate characters.Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars as Dani, Henry's sidekick who's forced to join him on the run. Winstead does a nice job as a companion to Smith. Unfortunately, she also falls prey to the writing and gets saddled with a cliched backstory and overly expository dialogue.Lastly, Clive Owen plays Verris, the leader of the Gemini project and the supposed villain of the film. I say supposed because the film never really figured out if he is a bad guy or not. Owen does fine, but mostly because its a role he's been playing the last decade in subsequently worse films.""Gemini Man"" is neither a good nor a bad film. Mainly it's a tech demo that may lead to better films using these innovations in the future. ""Gemini Man"" also teaches a valuable filmmaking lesson: all the bells and whistles money can afford are no match for a good story, which is something this film sorely lacks.",Gemini Man

The kind you can feel good about and not have witnessed unnecessary sex, gore and guts. But Smith has this long list of great films and is well rounded in his career. One could say he is head and shoulders above most actors. But Gemini Man was mediocre and disappointing if only because we expect so much more from Will. It started out as an action film and ended as a relationship film. But I suppose this is every aging actor's dream -- to become young again if only by the magic of animation and illusion. There is a message in here somewhere, though: You can't create an army of humans and claim they are property just because they were grown instead of born. In fact, it's actually an existing US law, the one that prevents scientist from cloning humans. It's one of the required arguments any law student must present (pro or con is their choice): Should man be allowed to create a race in order to enslave it? The answer is always ""no.""",Gemini Man

Often in films you see known sights in the background like Tate Modern, but you have no real feel of what it is like to be there.

184,nebk,Should Have Cloned a Better Script,4,11 January 2020,"The best parts of this movie are the first twenty minutes or so, just before Will Smith's character meets errrrrm a younger CGI version of Will Smith's character. Think of it as Big Willy Meeting Little Willy or Old Willy meeting Young Willy. From then on the film becomes a boring and prefictable action flick where a character survives flying off a speeding bike and then being slammed in the face by the back wheel off another bike and he has some minor scratches and bruising. The main protagonists also go continent hopping so easily you might think that USA, Colombia and Hungary are but an hour away if you can find an old buddy to borrow a private plane fron somewhere and fly you around. Unfortunately most old friends are expendable in the movie and will be collateral...at well at least they won't have to pay the rental fees for the plane, fuel etc etc. A silver lining in every cloud that.The cast is fine overall but the script is dumb and for supposedly top notch assassins most of them miss a lot unless it's plot convenient for them to be deadly accurate. The dialogue and jokes feel weak and don't have much place in a movie which starts off with a an aged assassin questioning his life, morality and whether he can look himself in the mirror and then having to battle a younger stronger and better trained clone of himself. The action is too mingled up with unfunny comedy and the ending is predictable. And the the last few scenes are so saccharine sweet you almost expect the aged Will Smith and the younger clone to end the movie with the lines "" I love you dad, i love you too son, enjoy your college experience.""

As for Linda Emond, what sort of character was that? Don't get me wrong, seeing a female who is flawed is almost unheard of in post 2000 Hollywood. Emond's role was appalling. Clive Owen was totally forgettable, especially compared to his performance in gems like Children of Men.If you're bored and want some mindless action, this flick may satisfy your itch.

The visual effects were great!",Gemini Man
200,stevojaxon,Grrrrrreeeeaaat mate,9,30 December 2019,"Riveting action scenes; developed unusual story line; excellent performance by Will Smith. I was prepared for a disappointment as I saw how low this movie has been rated by others. I didn't read reviews, I just notice that it wasn't getting many stars. I kept passing it by until one day I thought, ""what the heck"" and I watched it. This is a good lesson for me. I've enjoyed many Will Smith movies in the past and I should have just trusted that instead of looking for stars. After all, Will Smith is accomplished, picks his roles well and elevates the status of movies that he performs in. I guess that's why they pay him the big bucks. So I guess the moral of the story is that if you have been avoiding this flick but are a secret fan of Will Smith, then trust that and throw caution to the wind ... and you'll probably enjoy it just like I did.",Gemini Man
201,BlueSkies765,Popcorn movie,7,20 November 2019,Is Gemini Man worth it in the sea of movies and series available? It all depends on your expectations. If you're a seasoned moviegoer this movie will not feel like a magical experience one hopes for when going to the movies as a lot of the movie feels like something you've seen before. It will for a new generation of moviegoers who haven't seen these fairly standard 90s type of action movies. The technical achievement of this film is certainly the talk of the town. However deep down for me it's not enough to say that I would rewatch this movie. It was a one time ride with some fun action scenes. Nothing more nothing less.,Gemini Man
202,trevorwomble,Tries hard but let down by obvious script,6,17 October 2019,"I really wanted to like this film. Will Smith does action movies really well and he's fine here as well, but this film is very derivative in places, with touches of both the Schwarzenegger film The Sixth Day and the Bruce Willis film Looper stirred in.The scenes of the 23 year old Will Smith vary from very good to very bad (his face looks very fake in scenes of low lighting) and whilst Ang Lee is technically a very good director this is not one of his better efforts, as here he forsakes story credibility for technical wizardry.This film is also part financed by Chinese production money and the script smacks of compromise because of it. It is too uerile for an adult audience and too boring for a younger one. There is also some very badly written dialogue that you can almost guess what is going to be said.In essence I found this film watchable but with no great surprises.",Gemini Man

206,bluepink,"Good movie, but some issues with the characters & pacing",5,28 October 2019,"Pros:
+ Will Smith is an amazing actor; and he gave us so many emotions
+ I like the concept and the storyline
+ Strong opening
+ The sequences were well structured; and there was a clear 3-act structure.Cons:
The casting was off. Throughout the movie, I couldn't help but feel that everyone was placed together as part of a contractual agreement; and never really gelled. It's like when you're with colleagues but not friends. I have some more specific comments:Danny - From the offset, the relationship between Will (as Henry) and Danny was strange. I couldn't figure out if their relationship was on the basis of a love interest / just friends / dad and daughter type friendship; and it was a little bit confusing. Perhaps if they made her character older; and as a love interest - this could have helped to eleviate that element of awkwardness and uncertainty about their relationship.Clay (Juniors Dad) - I felt that he was generally emotionless throughout; but not in a good way. I understand that was his role, but it's possible to be emotionless yet still give something. e.g. The scene when Junior was crying on his shoulder, although he was there physically... emotionally he was somewhere else.The pacing was really off, and this was a problem. It had a strong opening, but then it went slow very quickly. It's okay to do that; but they spent too long on scenes that I felt could have been reduced / cut out / summarised. It would go between fast to slow very dramatically; and erratically.(Just as a final note - the CGI wasn't great, but it didn't bother me)To summarise - there were some amazing scenes, but as a whole it didn't all come together for me.",Gemini Man
207,alon-dar1,Worst directing,4,21 November 2019,"Ever. Terrible perfor6by all actors, horrible actually. The 2 main actors seem to be in a state of panic most of the time, will looks so old and tired as if he was forced to make the movie, the motorcycle fight at the square is so poorly made that the editor cut it to seconds, trying to avoid the embarrassment.

209,Derache,A entertaining action film,8,28 October 2019,"This film's weakest elements were the story, however the action, acting, and imagery made up for this film so much, that all of my friends that I went with, and myself enjoyed ourselves at this film. The action was not perfect, it often did not follow physics leading to just funny scenes to laugh at, but they take you out of your immersion. However, the action was very entertaining in majority of the cases and even saved the film, probably due to its unreal physics. The acting from will smith, as almost always, was very good and helped carry the terrible scriptwriting and story that he was forced to work with. The imagery, as in camera work and locations, were amazing, in fact, I would say it was my favorite part of the album. The camera work and elements they used were genius and masterpiece worthy, they definitely helped carry this film to be the good and entertaining film it was. I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking to be entertained by a solid action movie, but be warned, the story might ruin it for you.",Gemini Man

His time was over long ago and now he is worse than ever. This man has a great business mind but NO acting talent at all. None. In any of his roles beside fresh Prince any black actor could of done his job at least the same if not far better.Time for movie companies to stop wasting .obey on supporting him as they are just chucking .obey down the drain.

The gimmick of two CGI Will Smith's can only carry the film so far when there isn't an interesting plot to back it up. I ended up being bored halfway through the movie because there is no real point to it other than the relentless fighting.",Gemini Man
215,El-Ak,Just for fun!,4,2 February 2020,"Gemini Man is surely a disaster from the first sight of the film. The story is very rich but yet didn't go the right way. The film concentrated on the ""Will faces Will"" scenes thinking it's the only way the story could impress but it didn't turn out well in some scenes where you could feel that Will's younger face is completely wrong or placed in a wrong way especially at the end which I think the movie was trying to avoid most of the film at which both Wills were in daylight so, you could finally rate how much is it good and correct as most of the film younger Will was (even in the chase scene in the trailer) almost covered with things that he wore and was in all the scenes in a dark place where you couldn't see his face clearly which made me feel how week the makers are and how wrong they are to take a challenge that they couldn't complete or execute well. About the acting, the characters are so so poor that you could have replaced them by anyone and would have done the same performance. Will's performance is zero as the bigger version and he was himself all the time and concentrated as the film on the younger version in which he did a good job but the Deaging CGI just covered it. The film is only entertaining for the action scenes which was really surprising and was pretty cool with a score that made it more exciting. Just for fun and entertainment and don't expect more and it will entertain you. 4/10",Gemini Man

Some wicked bad CGI for the clone face guy will show in the clear, sunny scenes, I guess that's why so many of the scenes with the clone are in the dark.

The CGI was distracting because the face of ""young will"" was obviously computer generated so it was hard to see him as a real person. They should have just found a younger actor that resembled Will Smith like Ice Cube did in Straight Out of Compton.

227,WooderIce64,"Decent Action, Missed Potential",6,1 July 2020,"From acclaimed director Ang Lee comes Gemini Man, an action movie about Henry Brogan, a retiring hitman who learns he is being replaced by a clone half his age. The film is noted for its use of de-aging technology, of which this is one of the best uses thus far, and its very high 120 frames per second. Both of these aspects, alongside intense and exciting action scenes, make it a good action movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't do much else to rise above being another generic globetrotting action movie. The idea of cloning someone and expecting them to be like the one they're based on and the idea of a protagonist fighting his clone are both interesting ideas, but neither of them are given much thought, which is a pity given the amount of potential they have.Will Smith plays both Henry and his clone, Junior. De-aging technology is used very well here, better than its uses in other movies, including The Irishman. Junior looks exactly like Fresh Prince era Will Smith, making it interesting to see the two of them side by side. The rest of the cast isn't much to write home about. The sets and locations are also very good. The film is set in Cartagena, Budapest, and a sleepy coastal town in Georgia. Compared to the heights of Ang Lee's career - Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Life of Pi, Brokeback Mountain, to name a few, Gemini Man falls immensely short. As an action movie, one that doesn't require much thought, it's okay.",Gemini Man

231,vinsond21,Nifty action flick ruined by vain attempts at moralizing,6,14 October 2019,"I am a great admirer of director Ang Lee, and i love Will Smith as an actor. This movie looked very promising and i could not wait to see it. On the whole, there is little not to like about Gemini Man. The cast is excellent, especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead who nicely balances being gentle and tough. Even Clive Owen, normally a dull actor to me, comes deliciously alive here. And then there is the always-impressive Will Smith in dual roles. The action is nifty enough, and the pacing is just right. Sadly, all that is good or great about this movie is let down by a script that tries to be too clever for its own good. Can we not just have a fantasy flick to enjoy without real-world situations being injected in? What's worse, the real-world references are biased and inaccurate, and so totally sours any goodwill one may otherwise have towards the movie.

It's weird to think that it was originally meant to be released by Walt Disney Pictures. Ang Lee tried his best to make the movie good, but the mediocre screenplay overthrown him super quickly. The only redeeming qualities of the movie are the sound, Will Smith's performance, the visual effects (particularly the de-aging effects, however there are moments that doesn't look all that convincing) and the action sequences do have some good cinematography here and there, while everything else like the story, characters, dialogue, music, 70% of the cinematography, the acting from the rest of the cast and the rest of the visual effects that didn't involve the de-aging effects wasn't good to begin with, but i still somehow enjoyed it and i wasn't bored throughout the whole movie, even though it was 1 hour and 57 minutes long.

234,RoboRabbit89,Very good movie. Hugely underrated.,8,17 October 2019,"The following is a positive review.Will Smith is back as a government assassin,
he plays Henry Brogan an aging contract killer who seeks
to exit his career after his last hit, which goes well enough. But Henry feels it's time
to give it up and to live a quiet life.
On the day of his retirement he is tracked down by assassins,
and goes on the run, he is relentlessly pursued by one assassin
which he makes a shocking discovery that it's a younger clone of himself;
who can predict his every move!This movie was fantastic, Will Smith is great in a dual roll playing both Henry
and his clone counterpart Junior. The visual effects are the selling point
and they work incredibly well.Now I know this film is getting a lot of flak but most people are over
looking the whole point, it's an emotional journey for both characters Henry
and his clone Junior. For his clone, he's learning how to cope with being a 23 year old child soldier, and an emotional struggle learning he's a copy of the man he's trying to kill. For Henry who's 51 years old, is trying to cope with middle age,
retirement, and battling the copy of his younger self, that's heavy stuff to think about.
Now everybody has the right to their own opinion, but what most do, is just want to complain about it, and not give it a fair chance, which is so aggravating.
Pius the ones that do review it just seem to want to compare it to Looper,
which is completely stupid! This film has absolutely has nothing to do with
time travel, like at all! Plus Looper was a mediocre mass and it sucked! I hate
that movie!
(Moving on).
The supporting cast was good as well, Clive Owen was good as the main villain,
even though he doesn't get to do much but he leaves an impression.
Mary Elizabeth Windsted is good as a rookie assassin partner to Henry,
her part small but she get to kick ass here and there which is fun.Overall I give it a 8/10. Don't listen to the haters this movie is an underrated gem.Plus this movie was in development hell for 20 years! with many actors and directors attached at one point, director Tony Scott as for as i remember and
for actors Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, Sean Connery and Arnold Schwarzenegger just to name a few.The movie was mostly halted because
the technology wasn't quiet right. Anyway I hope you enjoy it, it's fun!",Gemini Man

236,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Gemini Man will make you double take,7,7 January 2020,"The Stream: The CGI, at times, is atrocious and at times the movie feels all too familiar.The Big Screen: Double Will Smith with tons of action to keep you entertained until the end.The Final Bill: Entertaining movie that will keep you on edge with classic Will Smith moments.-S2SWelcome back to Stream to Big Screen! This week we are reviewing movies and giving out horoscope advice. Gemini: the astrological sign known for its twins symbol and for producing individuals who often show the dual nature of life along with their ability to view life from different angles. Enough of that, this brings us to Gemini Man, the movie for the week.Gemini Man, stars Will Smith as Henry a hitman ready to retire and actually experience life. Unfortunately for Henry, a younger version of himself (Junior/Jr.) is sent after himself to do what he does best, eliminate the target. Shots fired, pick up some crucial sidekicks along the way, pandemonium ensues and we follow the Wills down the rabbit hole while realizing why the movie is titled Gemini Man.Needless to say after that synopsis, the storyline isn't too much different from other movies like this. Think of Red or Red2.... except Bruce Willis has a clone chasing him instead of some random other hitman and not as campy. Yes, we've seen this movie before, if you look at it like that BUT we didn't come to the theater for that. DID YOU NOT COME TO BE ENTERTAINED?! And entertained you shall be. Ang Lee shot this movie in 4K 3D at a high frame rate of 120fps (frames per second), which is supposed to make the movie more natural, smooth and immersive in the 3D and IMAX realms. I will say the movie did feel very smooth almost like a video game. UNFORTUNATELY, Jr. also looked exactly like a video game character for many action scenes in the movie. It was hard to not notice how poorly the CGI blended in for certain parts. But that didn't spoil the whole movie for me, even though it was quite noticeable.The action in this movie is very good. Lee definitely struck a great balance between storyline and John Wick fight fest. The movie has a ton of action to keep you entertained throughout without it feeling like one constant fight sequence. The Will on Will action was worth the admission alone but on top of that we got the classic Will moments. Picture your favorite moments in I am Legend, Suicide Squad, Men in Black, Pursuit of Happiness and I, Robot (and etc.) all wrapped into one movie. HOW CAN YOU BEAT THAT? No, seriously, Will definitely pulled aspects of previous characters to make Henry feel believable and natural. Even his CGI younger self, while at times hard to look at, Will was able to convey the emotion of the scene. His acting actually was quite important to the moral and themes of the movie. Had his performance been lacking, then the movie would've floundered.At the end of the day, this won't go down as one of Will's best movies, but action-wise, it may be one of his most entertaining. This movie gives you vintage Will Smith. He gives you his full acting range and shoots people along the way. This is a good movie to watch on a big screen. Smith and general action fans, definitely go see it. Everyone else, catch the matinee or a RedBox rental.",Gemini Man

But there is a good amount of people who enjoyed the CGI and some hated it. And I think the reason is where you watch this movie. If you cinema is highest technical standard and they can handle all the technical gimmicks, it might look amazing, but I need to be honest with you: If you watch it at home it will pull you out of immersion, yes, the VFX are THAT bad. And all action scenes look very unrealistic and I wonder if my technical equipment is at fault here.I would not watch a movie like this at a theatre, but because of my findings about CGI, I would love to and find out, if it is different than looking it at home.",Gemini Man

245,Exiled_Universe,Just a weird film but in a good way!,7,9 January 2020,"So i have a lot to say about this movie and yes there is some problems that isn't the movies problem but my personal preference. First off before i even saw it in noticed that it was a p3-13 movie and you know i dont like those kind of movies, i like blood and bad words and everything like that, lots of kills, but i saw the trailer so i guess it was OK for me to see. So after seeing it, believe it or not it actually wasn't as good as the trailer for many reasons. There were only about 2 or 3 parts of the movie worth watching and those were only the parts in the trailer i mean there were also some other good parts that weren't in the trailer that were good too, other than that all of the movie was super boring and it felt like it was for kids which is why i guess it was p3=13, i wish it was rated r because if it was then it would have been better, the whole idea of the clone is brilliant and i saw the video on how hard it was to make a clone for the movie and all the effects that were used and it felt like terminator a little bit. Anyway, this movie could have took that idea and could have done something so much better with that idea and a lot of movies go through this same problem. Another problem i have is the clone at the end became friends with will smith, i wanted the clone to be a killing machine that would not stop until it was killed at the end or maybe an army of will smiths (but that would be a whole nother movie), but it just wasn't enough to make me like it that much so it could have been way better than this. So about the good parts, now the cgi is not good, at all for that matter, but it works and its acceptable, i mean you can tell that its not the best but like i said it all works in the end and its all still cool. Now another thing is in some scenes the clones do parkour with some bad cgi but it actually looks really cool like an action video game or a modern assassins creed and especially at the end when the second clone comes and runs at super speed and runs in the streets, the CGI was bad but it was super cool. All the fight scenes were super cool and i loved them all, they were rare but when they happened they were super cool. The best parts were probably the motorcycle chase or the end fight. The motorcycle chase was cool at the end when the clone tried to fight will with a motorcycle and that parts did not disappoint. The end fight had more than 1 part to it and the part at the end with the mini gun on the car and the second clone fight all looked cool and futuristic and super cool. The characters were alright but they were all funny and goofy at times and it ruined the whole dark mood that it was and that i love. Also the locations was cool and i lied them when it was at night and the end fight scenes location was cool, also i liked how at one part of the end scene there was a where there were two fights at one time which was cool and super cool. Anyway could have been way better but i can see what they were going for in the end!!!",Gemini Man
246,ScottDWhalen,PLEASE BE A PART 2!,10,17 November 2019,"Ok, that was one hell of a movie the fight scene in the Melník Chapel of Bones which was BADASS & looked more like a real fight than really any other fight scene I've seen outside of real-life or any other movie I've seen in my life. I say this cause well just watch!
Yet honestly, I really don't think this is over. There is a metaphor to this movie which I think should continue however, it kind of hit the spot with me because of the metaphor. Best of all the CGI holy I feel like we r back in Fresh Prince of Bel Air era.
Please PLEASE tell me there will be a part 2 to this.",Gemini Man
247,James_Denton,As Will Smith films go this was a disappointment - One to avoid,3,19 September 2021,"Currently available on Netflix, not even watching it 'free' can be recommended.What a disappointment this film turned out to be. Predictable, corny and ultimately boring, why Will Smith agreed to this film is the most baffling part.For myself it went down the drain the moment Danny Zakarewski - played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead - took on a highly trained armed assassin predictably using a corny line which had been used by the assassin himself. From here it was the point of no return.Made in 2019, Gemini Man (2019) is an absolute porridge, where, for example The Bourne Identity (2002), a film not too dissimilar than this but made 17 years earlier is far superior.The lines, story and overall acting are not only predictable but also very corny.One to avoid.",Gemini Man
248,rockingruby,What happened?,5,13 October 2019,This movie is a mess. The script is lazy and the cgi at times terrible. I'm a huge Ang Lee fan but I left the cinema very disappointed. That being said though there is a motor bike chase scene that is terrific but this film could of been a lot better. 5/10.,Gemini Man
249,FixedYourEnding,Not so bad as some reviews,6,30 January 2020,"Alibaba films? Ang Lee as director and story by David Benioff produced an enjoyable movie even though characters are a little flat and the story is not ground-breaking or life-changing it is not anything near an Oscar performance. However this movie received some flow of bad luck, being released alongside very worthy movies (such as Maleficent and Joker) and getting very bad reviews from critics.
Regarding CGI of the movie, it is of course one of the attractions to seeing the ""de-aging"" of will smith. I'd say it's not perfect and the CGI is definitely apparent at times, both in Junior's face and some of the scenery, however it is still a good 2hr ride.If you are interested in some action and maybe technically want to see the young Will Smith I can recommend giving this movie a go. btw very small spoiler- in my opinion they did not manage to get the ""fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" look to Junior which some people may have expected to see.
Overall score: 64 / 100",Gemini Man
250,Hazu29,I will give you guys a golden tip,2,23 November 2019,"Before choosing a movie to watch, check the ""country of origin"". If after US there's a ""China"" there, the movie will disappoint you. That means the movie was made basically for the purpose of making money. Examples: Gemini man, Ad Astra, Midway, Glass, latest Fast & Furious, latest Pacific Rim, latest Transformers, etc. They might have great cast, but the quality is super low, they had no intent of creating a quality picture. Those movies were made in a rush with chinese money. This is the truth, at the moment. Hope in the future they change the way they do business.",Gemini Man
251,Marc_Action,Could There Be a More Forgettable Action-Thriller?,4,10 January 2021,"Smith plays an aging government assassin and marksman, Henry Brogan, who's considered the absolute best. However, once Brogan decides to retire, the government attempts to take him out using an assassin that's basically a secret, younger clone of Brogan. At least, that's what I believe the overarching plot is all about in this snoozefest of an action/thriller.It's hard to really care, though, because Gemini Man's biggest problem is that it's just too darn boring... And predictable. You can blame the bland script mostly, but the characters here just aren't very interesting. For instance, right from the start you just know neither version of Brogan are going to successfully take the other one out. You can also gather that these two will eventually end up friends in the end--and this is exactly what happens. So, it's hard to get invested when you already know the end result, to include the anticlimactic plot twist.As for other characters in the film, Brogan does pick up a pair of mostly useless sidekicks along the way--his longtime comrade, Baron (Benedict Wong) and somewhat of a love interest, I guess, in a fellow government operative sent to spy on him-turned ally, Danny (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).However, the Baron character just seems like dead weight. He has no purpose whatsoever. Even when he's killed off, it seems like an afterthought to the filmmakers. The Danny character, like the boring plot, is just confusing. Is she his love interest? Is she just an equally-intelligent tagalong operative that's only here because Brogan feels guilting for getting her involved? Will she be an eventual mother figure to the clone? Who knows?Moving along: The script is very sloppy and as a result the movie just drags along with the whole cloning aspect glossed over--as if it's just a subplot to the main plot of the government trying to take out a retired assassin. I mean, have we not seen this similar plot many many times before? Plus, the motive for why they want him dead is not even strong enough, clear enough, nor interesting enough.If you thought the action or de-aging Will Smith special effects for his younger clone would make up for it, well it doesn't. While I admit Smith's younger clone does look convincing, the action and other special effects are just awful. Most of the fight scenes are in the dark with camera work too close up to really know what's going on. On top of that, the action sequences are mostly CGI. Why? The only scene that was done well was when the younger, cloned assassin first encountered Brogan in the colorful corridors of Cartagena, Columbia. (Yes, this scene was really filmed there.)All in all, as an action/thriller, Gemini Man fails big time. Unlike I Robot or I Am Legend, this film will definitely not be among Smith's classics. I feel it would have been much more successful as a horror/thriller or even a drama/thriller where the focus is more on the implications of having and meeting your younger self in the form of a clone. So much potential lost.",Gemini Man
252,diescobarmdq,Bad,3,22 August 2021,The story seems interesting but I really didn't care for it. I didn't finish it. After the whole Colombia chase scene it got really boring and I didn't feel interested to keep watching.,Gemini Man
253,jdiz115,Will Smith Career Summary,3,20 October 2019,Will Smith has made a career out of playing will smith. Don't get me wrong he's a decent actor but all of his characters are essentially exactly same. Lol.,Gemini Man
254,dan_slentz,Decent Action Movie... CGI'd stuff LOOKS CGI'd!,6,20 October 2019,"FIrst.. gotta say I'm a fan of Will Smith. He's a very talented individual. His co-star was Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and she was great as well. The plot of the story is a government assassin gets cloned and has to face his younger self. Pretty good idea for a story and it was well written with lots of action. BUT one aspect of the movie really distracted me. The young CGI'd Smith really looked a lot more like a Polar Express character than a human. I mean, the CGI work is getting better and better, but we see movies to fall into the story and believe-ability for two hours. If we see a mic in a shot, a light, a camera reflection, or a crew member, it's sloppy work and takes us OUT of this illusion. When a primary character LOOKS computer generated, it's distracting (AND creepy!) Someday I suspect the CGI'd humans (unlike the Genie in the new Aladdin or the Avatar character who are convincing today) will present themselves like living people acting the role, but not yet. I really can't say exactly what it is, but I suspect it's in the eyes of the CGI. Look at the eye movement. Just weird. I wish IMDB have half star ratings because so much falls unto the 6 star and 7 star ratings.. but there is a difference. I gave this 6 stars for the story and acting, but would have given it an overall 5.5. I wouldn't see it at the theater again. Maybe being on the small screen might make the CGI more convincing? (Certainly if it were on an old CRT TV set in standard def, the fuzziness of SD might make it more convincing)",Gemini Man

Smith is very good in the older role, and the film is carried by Winstead. She's the glue that holds it together and she channels an Aliens era Sigourney Weaver in a good way. Owen is always better as a good guy, his bad guys are always a little over the top. The gun work at the beginning is poorly done and will make capable shooters wince, but the remainder of the audience won't know.",Gemini Man
259,NavyOrion,"Not as bad as you've heard, but nothing special",7,24 October 2019,"First: the technological achievement of the CGI younger version of Will Smith is impressive. This movie is forgettable in terms of cinematic appeal, but will be remembered for being the first truly effective use of a computer-generated actor. Certainly, the limits of casting old, retired, or even deceased actors kin new roles will now be more legal than technical.(That said, the final scene must have been a complete afterthought: the CGI Smith in that scene was no better (possibly even worse) than the young Arnold Shwarzenegger terminator that appeared briefly in ""Terminator: Salvation"" ten years ago.)Otherwise, this is a competent but completely spay movie, with a plot you've seen 50 times: jaded and retired government agent wants out of the business, but knows too much and must be eliminated. The only hook is that they're sending his clone to do it.I imagine it was the novelty of playing against his younger self that attracted Smith to this project, because he is definitely capable of more, and this film has little else to offer. Maybe, like the character he plays here, he's beginning to to feel his age, and, like his fans, just wishes he could see the young Will Smith back in action one more time.",Gemini Man
260,MplusA92,An enjoyable movie although the huge missed chances to make it a great one.,6,12 October 2019,"You may ask yourself, Is It a worthwhile to watch movie that is independent or Is It fully dependent on Will Smith only ?!Well, the proper question here should be, Would the movie be watchable without Will Smith?! Yes it has some good elements but Will Smith adds a lot to it with his character, acting, and voice.Starting from the story, it's quite explained from the trailer, but you have to wait till the end for the justification of each character motive.The movie has great chase, gun shooting and nature scenes. But you may feel sorry to see how slow and heavy Will Smith became, and what made that worse is the computerized accelerated scenes for the younger Will Smith while the old Will Smith is in so the difference is noticeable.The movie tried to make everything, but the problem that they put too much elements while not focusing on one and make it superior. For example, the character of ""Benedict Wong"" who is supposed to be the comedian companion who says some jokes to release the stress in the scene, you will feel that his lines are forcefully put without caring about the quality of the jokes.All of this happened due to script problems, which didn't give enough space to introduce each character with their motives and drawbacks in the two hours of the movie.By the way, it's not a boring two hours movie, your eyes will not look away from the screen, all the events are sequential and there is always unanswered question that makes you want to watch it till the end.Will Smith did a great role here as a guy in his age, all other actors didn't make any noticeable effortful acting.Finally, it's a watchable action movie that has a lot of elements of Netflix production, which means everything is average but enjoyable to watch in home with your family or friends with a bucket of popcorn.",Gemini Man

267,Eric266,"A Fun Ride, but Misses so Much of its Potential",6,5 November 2020,"Its so hard for Hollywood to make anything original anymore. The big studios just want to rehash and reboot ideas. Gemini Man had a chance to be something different, but went for the lowest common denominator. Will Smith is Henry Brogan, an aging, elite government sniper who wants to retire. Suddenly, people are trying to kill him. When his friends start getting whacked, too, he goes on the run. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Danny, a would-be handler who become expendable and goes on the run with Smith's Henry (and is quite the bad ass herself). Clive Owen (what has happened to his career!!?) is a one-dimensional bad guy, Verris. An assassin starts tailing Henry and Danny and seems to be just as good as Henry...and looks like him. The young man is Henry's clone and has been raised by Verris as his adopted son and is never given a real name, other than ""Junior"".Gemini Man had an original idea (kind of in the mold of Looper) where Henry is being pursued by a younger version of himself. The overall arcing plot is kind of lame, but the action is fierce, and fast paced. They travel all over the world and the locales are beautiful. The de-aging effects on Will Smith were well done and you can hardly tell its just his face CGI'd onto a stand-in. The action sequences are handled perfectly and some of the stunts are pretty intense (the motorcycle chase/fight sequence is a highlight!)Where the movie fails is in the third act. Much like Smith's Netflix bomb, Bright, Gemini Man drops any pretense of character/plot development or originality to focus on one action sequence after another. Again, they are handled well, but there was some serious gold to be mined by focusing on a taut spy plot (ala Jason Bourne) and the relationship triangle between Henry, Verris and Junior. Junior has been lied to all his life, but Verris is the only father he's known. It took Henry, a man Junior just met and has been trying to kill, about 5 minutes to convince Junior to turn on his father. It would have been much better to have allowed Junior to find out things on his own and slowly come to the devestating conclusions at a slower pace. Or even make Verris a three-dimensional man who isn't just an arch villain. Let the audience identify with him as a father who is trying to protect his son while also trying to incorporate him into the business. When is Hollywood going to realize that the best movies have the best written villains? Then the audience could have felt his pain and sympathized with him. I felt zero connection with the kid or sympathy for Verris (who does love Junior, but is too power mad to realize he has crushed his son).Some movies are meant to be mindless two hours of loud noises and explosions (think the Fast & Furious franchise, which i love because it knows what it is). Gemini Man could have been a really original movie by mixing a spy thriller with a relationship study. Instead the mindless part took over in the last half of the movie. Its still a good flick, but I grade it lower because it wasted such a great premise.",Gemini Man

It's not awful nor overly obvious. It's decent work.There are bits in this that are very good (the Cubs scenes), some that are very dates (possibly a legacy of the many variants of the scripts) such as a female character asked to undress so she can be checked for anything hidden and some plain cliche (well the generic structure of the plot for one).It's all fine but nothing particularly original which is odd thing to say seeing as this is Will mk1 versus Will mk2 plus ultra. But it is. It's a plot you've seen a thousand times.If you are feeling engaging your brain, look elsewhere (Mission Impossible Rogue Nation maybe).

(+) At least the woman character ain't an over sexualized one, she was fine, but couldn't give anything to the film, literally anything in the third act.
(+) Acting ain't bad
(+) At least the final scene with them at the University was funny, the de-aging CGI was so terrible here that it gave some good laughs.Cons:
(-) Everything else; The plot was utterly boring, and dragged like hell, it basicly builds on one sentence premise. There is no story to tell at all, it was totally structured for action scenes, but they kinda forgot to bring the action on the table... like seriously...
(-) For an action movie this is the most un-actiony, static movie I have seen so far for a blockbuster oriented one.
(-) Random, Tourguide-like scenes that didn't add anything to the story, they were just an excuse to drag the whole cast to some exotic places to blow off steam.
(-) CGI is totally out of date, some closeups of the de-aged character are ""decent"" as a whole, but for a blockbuster movie even the ""decent"" scenes are below average... even movies from late 2000's had better CGI.
(-) Environment as a whole is uninspired, there was no concept the whole worldbuilding was built around, the whole visual narrative is just a consequence of cheap, expense-evasive moviemaking.
(-) This movie should have been only 1 hour with all these elements it has currently, and even then it would only go for TV not on BIG SCREEN.Overall: It's an utter garbage that is uninteresting, and nor even good or bad dumb action movie, this movie is the definition of ""Nothing""",Gemini Man

279,lumieretrain,Gemini Man by Ang Lee,7,10 October 2019,"The stories about the main characters who face their clones, are one of the most thrilling stories to explore in the books, television series, comic books, movies and video games. Especially to see how the conflict between the main characters and their clones, would keep going on until they both arrive to an unexpected conclusion. Some of these stories would conclude, with the sacrifice of the main characters and their clones, where then the supporting characters are going to take an important decision for their future. Other stories would conclude, with the main characters and their clones who help each other, to finish what has been started. There was a project with this theme, which has been in development for years. As it seems no one is going to make this project, after some filmmakers have been initially involved to then leave it with no conclusion. Until the auteur visionary filmmaker Ang Lee seems interested to explore this theme, to then have Jerry Bruckheimer as one of the co-producers of the movie. After a long time of work, in 2019 came out Gemini Man by Ang Lee with Will Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Clive Owen and Benedict Wong. The movie's plot: Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is an aging hitman, who is suddenly pursued and targeted by a younger clone of himself called Junior (Will Smith). As the premise of the movie immediately captured the audience attention, there were more or less expectations about how the movie would come out. The audience got immediately interested as it was announced, the movie is going to be an innovation for the future of the cinema. Indeed from the beginning to the end the movie captures the audience attention, especially to see how the main characters are going to take important decisions when they face the danger. The story gets intriguingly visceral by shooting the movie in 3D, which makes every single angle shots captivating for the audience eyes. The 3D has been used without being irritating for the audience eyes, but it has been used by creating perspectives to be unforgettable. The movie gets also innovative by using the 120 fps (frames per second), which makes the story, especially in the action scenes, smooth and realistic in every single movements of the main characters. Including by creating incredible details of the objects, which is not often seen as it usually requires a long time of work, to be as much detailed as possible until it would be then considered workable. The lightings and the specific colors of the story create as well unforgettable visceral scenes, for the audience eyes, by making the movie emotionally epic from the beginning to the end. The editing narrates the story by creating a rhythm, which makes clear how the main characters move from the beginning to the end. Will Smith was extraordinary as Henry Brogan, an aging hitman who would do anything to survive the danger and try to understand why he have been targeted by his clone. Will Smith was extraordinary also as Junior, a younger clone of Henry Brogan who in the course of the story would learn something important, from the hitman which he never knew about. Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a well done performance as Danny Zakarweski, a strong hitman who would help Henry to get through the danger, based on the unexpected trust between them. Clive Owen did an excellent job as Clayton Varris, a ruthless chief of the company GEMINI and he is the reason, who wants to stop Henry Brogan with no mercy. Benedict Wong was really good as Baron, a friend and colleague of Henry who is involved as well with what Henry and Danny are facing to. The score by Lorne Balfe creates the emotions of the story's atmosphere, which makes the movie captivating in every single musical notes. Gemini Man is one of the most unique and innovative movies of all time, filled with emotional and thrilling scenes to be unforgettable.",Gemini Man

287,KaZenPhi,Almost comically bad,3,27 February 2020,"Is Ang Lee doing ok? Has he recently sustained any head injuries that doctors should be looking at?I watch a lot of b-movies and trash movies for entertainment because they tend to succeed in being unpredictable, unintentionally hilarious and even unintentionally arty. It's rare that a major studio release comes along that is as baffling as low-budget z-grade cinema.Enter Gemini Man.
The premise is pretty laughable in itself, I can't be the only one who thought the trailer was a joke when they first saw it. The storyline is what you get when Looper lets the lazy stoner kid sitting next to him copy his homework. But make sure it's not too obvious. Sure, dude, will do!
Some stock storebrand spy cliches sprinkled on top and you're good to go.
Still, it might have made for an ok sunday afternoon flick for while you're trying to get the cat to eat her medicine.What went wrong then? The shorter list is what went right, which is...um...Mary Elizabeth Winstead doesn't phone it in too much.
Gemini Man feels like a combination of Ang Lee's and M. Night Shyamalan's worst qualities. The slightly off, almost alien nature of character interaction of the Happening mixed with the confused awkward action of Hulk, you get the idea.First and foremost we must talk about the elephant in the room and most likely the only reason this movie exists: digital de-aging. We all know actors are crazy and they love themselves so it's only going to get worse from now on.
The effect itself is rather impressive although it still falls into the uncanny valley whenever young Will Smith is talking. It jumps straight out of that valley though during the action scenes and lands safely between the Incredibles and Ren & Stimpy. All the movements are obviously unnatural and comically off it has to be seen to be believed. I can't even begin to imagine the series of events that must happen for such an expensive big movie to be this shoddily put together. Was it gross incompetence or did someone want it that way?Similar criticism can be levelled at every aspect of the movie. It's unengaging, the actors themselves seem bored, it looks super cheap and there is no style or flair to any part of the filmmaking. The movie just is. It exists but it doesn't live.",Gemini Man

It's mind blowing knowing that these super spies, clones, actually exist and you may past by them in the street or supermarket. It's compelling. Many questions were left unanswered. What is the cloning process like? How much does it cost to create a clone? Have there been any defects like in Alien 3? Can you educate a clone in an expedient fashion Matrix style? These are some major plot issues I wish would not have been glazed over to make a shorter run time. Will Smith brings the emotion as an older and younger men.

300,jadediamond,A Step in the Right Direction,7,12 October 2019,"This movie is a step in the right direction for Big Willie prior to the disaster which was After Earth. I think people are being way too harsh on this film because it's a Will Smith film. It almost like they wanted this movie to flop compared to the overrated Joker movie. When these same critics praised Rambo: The Last Blood which I enjoyed but it was also a standard action flick. What I loved about this film was the all star cast with Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Toast, Benedict Wong as the pilot friend Baron, and Will Smith as Henry (older Will Smith)/ Junior (clone Will Smith). Also Clive Owen as the bad guy Clay. I also liked we got some classic Will Smith and I found myself laughing a different moments throughout the film. The cast had pretty good chemistry and the character of Junior had some depth in discovering who he really was and what he was designed to be by his father Clay. This movie was like an inferior version of I Am Legend and The 6th Day. So, I hope this movie first week failure which will be recouped once the film goes overseas will not hinder Will Smith from returning to his glory days as the twenty million dollar man, the box office king, the leading man A-list actor, and the number one movie at the box office. He's heading back in the right direction, but has to pick better directors with better scripts and better writing. Regardless of how good he is as an actor, he can only carry a film so much. I hope the billion Aladdin made earlier this year is enough of a cushion.Now, onto the bad parts. The CGI was overhyped. Will Smith kept talking about how the character of Junior was the first 100% CGI character,, while everyone else was thinking, ""Oh, they shaved his beard."" Will Smith has aged well, used some Photoshop to smooth out the wrinkles here and there, add a flat top, and you have a 20 year old Will Smith without the high cost of CGI. The CGI looks unspectacular. The night scenes were better, but in this day scenes, you can see it's a CGI character, equivalent to a video game character. We checked out the movie because it was Will Smith. It probably would have been better if Will Smith just played a double of himself like Arnie did in the 6th day. The CGI was an unnecessary gimmick.Nothing is wrong with the script, but it was too generic for an overhyped movie. This movie script went through production hell, rewrites, and multiple actors being linked to the role for years. To get this script greenlit, the producers banked on Will Smith's star power. Yet, even with Will's charisma and acting his butt off, even the best of actors can't save a mediocre script and chunky dialogue. This goes the same for the rest of the cast. Clive Owen's talent is wasted here as a generic villain. The characters aren't given much to do and the script became confused with its message it was trying to convey and contradicted itself sometimes.Yet. it wasn't a bad movie. Just mediocre and a movie you have seen a doesn't time. It had the potential to be above average if it focused less on the gimmicks and more on the story. The action scenes, the cast, and the cinematography were fine. Yet, the script could have been so much better. If this script was as strong as the cast, then it would have been a better, deeper movie.",Gemini Man

And in this movie he does his thing, but the movie just didn't do it for me.Visually it's stunning, it has a nice pace, but the story and the plot weren't all there and I lost interest around half an hour before it ended. But, maybe I'm not someone the movie is targeted at.But my greatest turn-off is the CGI for his clone. Which raises the question: is the movie made because the CGI has to be introduced? And if so, is Smith chosen because of his ""easy to create"" facial expressions? But besides that, I get distracted by a the CGI in such a way, that it spoils the enjoyment of the movie. Which wasn't too good to begin with.",Gemini Man
304,michaeldoud,"First Hit: Entertaining story, but it was the special effects of a young Henry Brogan (a young Will Smith) that was the star.",7,14 October 2019,"First Hit: Entertaining story, but it was the special effects of a young Henry Brogan (a young Will Smith) that was the star.Ang Lee spent time and money using CGI to make Henry (Will Smith) have a Junior, and it worked.Brogan is the most perfect and lethal sniper the US Government has ever had. To prove the point, we see him in the first scenes preparing to kill a man moving on a train traveling at 248 kilometers per hour (154 mph) while lying on a hillside some 200 meters (~650 ft) away from the tracks. He nails it.
But Brogan is done with killing after he's shot more than seventy people. He's tired, 51-years-old and all the deaths are eating away at him. At one point, he says, ""I can't even look at myself in the mirror.""However, the powers that be, including CIA director Janet Lassiter (Linda Emond), want Brogan dead, and the funny thing is that the reason for this is poorly explained and developed in this story. This was the weakest part of the plot, but if you buy their explanation, it works well enough to enjoy the rest of the film.Arriving back home after the initial assassination scene, ready to enter retirement, he heads to the harbor where he has a boat. Going to pay for gas, he finds a new person named Danny Zakarweski (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) in the dock shed. She gives him a story that the previous guy retired and that she's studying marine biology at the nearby University of Georgia.Taking his boat to meet with a secret contact, he finds a directional bug under the dashboard. Arriving back at the dock, he storms into the shed where Danny is seated and accuses her of being an agent operative for the government. She denies and denies his allegations. Apologizing he asks her out to eat as a way to make up for his rudeness and accusations. When he meets her for dinner, she shows her his research proving she's an agent.This scene gives the audience supporting information that Brogan is smart and knows what he's doing, not only with a rifle, but he's made it this far because he's smart. Secondly, being found out implicates Danny in a larger scheme, and now she must support Brogan because she becomes an assassination target as well.He awakes when assassins come to his home. He takes care of them as only an assassin would and rushes to Danny's house to tell her she's surly a target for assassination now and to go with him.This is the setup. Lassiter is under threat by Clay Verris (Clive Owen), who owns a gun for hire company, Gemini, that if Lassiter cannot finish the job by getting rid of Brogan, he will. Her ego won't let him take over yet. She wants to prove she can finish the job.After multiple failures by Lassiter's team, Verris uses his squad of assassins, including a 23-year-old-clone version of Brogan, to kill Brogan, Zakarweski, and Brogan's close pilot friend Baron (Benedict Wong).The rest of the film is about the battle between the clone and Brogan, along with understanding why a clone of Brogan was created.The action was excellent, although at times it seemed as if the fight scenes were too long. The realism of the younger clone put together by the CGI team was terrific. I loved having Danny as part of the plot because her rationality and the way she added to the story, grounded the film.Smith was strong as Brogan, the supreme assassin and weapon of the United States. He outwardly carried enough of the internal pain of his upbringing to make his character seem real and whole. Winstead was excellent as the agent sent to track Brogan and ends up partnering with him as he gets to the root of the issue at hand. Owen is outstanding and always makes a great evil foil. His voice and attitude are perfect as the antagonist. Emond was good as the CIA director trying to clean up the mess she's created by losing so many men to Brogan's skills. Wong was the perfect long-time associate to Brogan. They had great chemistry together. David Benioff and Billy Ray wrote an entertaining screenplay. Lee knows how to create action, and he does here as well. I think they might have gotten more impact with shortened fighting scenes as they felt long. He didn't settle for less with the CGI of the Will Smith (Brogan) clone. It was amazingly done and didn't seem like it wasn't a person Brogan was fighting.Overall: Entertaining enough and at the end with Brogan is telling his clone about his prowess it felt typical good time Will Smith.",Gemini Man

The first 3 acts of the movie were so badly written and badly executed it made me bummed out because it was so disappointing, the cgi was good throughout the film but the fight scenes were so fake looking it's unreal. And the fact that the movie was thought of 20 years ago and it wasn't made back in 1997 is because the world wasn't ready for a film based around de aging. The last probably 8 minutes of the movie you can see Henry's clone going to college and he comes up to greet the ""real"" Henry, and oh my god he looked like a character from ""The Polar Express"" , it was so bad. Like how can they go from good de aging to very bad bad bad de aging, it just doesn't make since. The only good things from the movie was the fourth act and some of the fight scenes.

308,northernpaladin,Bored,4,27 September 2021,"The over the hill hitman is a tried and trusted trope and like all tropes needs something to spice it up but a perfect clone? Really?Not only is it a ridiculous idea but it is placed in our reality and against all the science we are expected to believe it!From the off we are in the land of super soldier where our assassin (Smith) takes out a target on a 230km/hr train from about half a mile away - why make it so stupid? All this does is tell the audience they are idiots and that they will be treated as such for the rest of the film. Interestingly, in this opening 10 minutes or so Will Smiths crewcut goes from black to grey to somewhere in between as the film trys to emphasise the age thing.From then on it's the familiar pattern of best friend trying to warn our hero danger is afoot, boss betrays the hero, suits in offices issue kil orders, body count multiplies.Unlike some of its genre (Equaliser 2) the death of the friend barely registers and no real justice/vengeance exacted, in fact Smith seems to have forgotten how to emote.There are some pretty decent shoot outs, but that doesn't say much really, but the physical fight scenes are straight out of Crouching Tiger territory and are just embarrassingly unbelievable.The plot is negligible, just a series of set pieces strung together on the thinnest of thread - our hero flys back and forth on a stolen Gulf Stream but at no time is the aircraft challenged even though it enters US airspace twice!The supporting cast do what they can for as long as they last, Clive Owen walks through the villain role and Ms Winstead gives a pretty credible performance given the awful dialogue she's stuck with.The de aging effects to create the young clone of Smith are ok, but given that the idea is so bad this starts to inform your opinion of the effects themselves.The denouement and shoot out is pretty lame, moving us towards happy ever after and all is forgiven land; the small town that gets shot to pieces seems to be devoid of people and of course there is no blowback from the mayhem.Like all of these black ops, deniable operatives movies that film makers seems obsessed with there is a disturbing message of it all being necessary and 'for the greater good' No matter the cost and with no counter argument presented. In this version the justification speech is given to Owen who amplifies it with a justification of how emotionless clone soldiers are a good thing and prevent american soldiers from dying - note how it's good that americans don't die, those being killed of course deserve to die.For an action movie this was pretty boring and yet another poor choice by Smith, quite why Ang Lee was directing was mystifying, this is a director of vision and a creator of human narrative, I can only assume he needed the money.",Gemini Man
309,wingthwong,The Fresh Prince ain't so fresh anymore.,1,2 October 2020,"Will Smith had it back in the 80s. He even had it in the 90s. It came out that he was a horrible human being to work with, he hooked up with another horrible human in Jada, and all that shiny awesomeness eroded away really quick. Yes, I watched this stale and very predictable waste. Sorry Will, your mock intensity and boorish elitism fools no one. And, I'm quite impressed that critics even gave you the lip service it did. From the beginning, even with the best robotics and even with the best computer calculations, that technology would be hard pressed to even hit a stationary target 3 feet square, let alone a neck, at that distance with that silly mockup Will Smith was using as a sniper rifle. That silly fake ""suppressor"", with a $50 ebay scope, on a boutique garbage rifle, with a fanboy cartridge, then you slap both elevation and windage settings down and flip up the cheap plastic lens cover, in the middle of a country setting on a hill with no one around at a train running at 147.886 mph, with windows made of somewhat bullet resistant carbonate that are close to an inch thick (in real life), and hit someone in the neck. That distance with that caliber would have required such a steep holdover, a longer delay, and still if it had even come close to hitting the train, would have impacted the glass as a very discernable angle and let's just say it had some magical mystery boost to penetrate the glass, would have been diverted by the force of that window moving at close to 150 mph perpendicular to that less than 150 grain bullet that somehow hit a man's neck with no keyhole effect. Come on. That's like a five year old saying he can shoot the moon with his daisy red rider. Not gonna happen. Then, as if that wasn't bad enough, everything went downhill from there. Smith went against even the worst scifi physics and actually went lower than low. The only other recognizable name was Clive Owen, who has never had much past B actor status, and he played his usual morose character actor part. Then there is this no name actress (Winstead) playing a rookie agent (with a background that would put her well above the class of an assassi,, no matter how good he was) that just happens to fall under Will Smith's entrancing macho fake DonJuan PHILLY THUG charms. Next, you have an Annette Benning wannabe no name actress (Emond) with all her New Jersey charm trying to play an unimpressive hardboiled ivy league secret agency boss. And then a poorly CGI younger version of Will Smith that's even more laughable. Will Smith, as usual, acts like he is the god of whatever craft he is involved in. Winstead is even more unconvincing as a sometimes innocent sometimes hard nosed agent. Wong, who was born in England, actually plays the only credible character or an ex Marine friend of Smith's character. The movie is so bad, that the names of the characters aren't even memorable. The name Peterson is thrown around a lot. Honestly, I don't know how any cameraman could keep a straight face while Will Smith monologued his unconvincing lines. Even if a robot was the cameraman, it would break down under some b.s. detecting code built in. Really, and then you have 100s of agents and a clone of yourself all with the same skills that cannot hit you while you are running or walking, yet you have an Academy Sports 9MM with a fake suppressor that can kill everyone. Come on. That's like a superhero movie where there are no bad guys that have the capability to take you down. Sorry, if the government wants you dead, no matter where you are in the world,you aren't getting away on a dirt bike and then get slapped by another dirt bike back tire, hit by a dirt bike and then still stand back up. That I've wasted this much time on a review is bad, so I stop here. I would be here all day typing out every bad part of this movie. Even my 16 year old son had enough with the Hungarian deadpan in the Gulfwing. Smith talks to people like he's still a wannabe thug from Philly sitting on his mom's porch drinking 40s, smoking blunts, waiving a cheap Glock at passing rival gang members, yet he thinks he's the most gifted story teller and orator of his time. That this movie got more than 0% on Rotten Tomatoes is a testament to Ang and a $138 budget.",Gemini Man

In this story the retiree is attacked by a younger version of himself. The premise is good, but throw in the sappy dialogue, the high octane action, and characters with poor decision-making skills, we end up with a semi-committed project. What can I say?

The obvious twist is Smith hunting Smith, but without this the movie is an average ""good guy runs from bad guy, turns it around and wins eventually against bad guy"" sort of plot. I think they didn't know what to do with the core of the story. It's wasn't really needed. This could have been a rogue agent movie just as well without the cloning twist. They went for the hook of sci-fi and it got me in. There are some good scenes, I liked the motorbike chase. I liked some of the locations like the catacombs. Some of the fight scenes were interesting. There are some gripes. Bullet damage. Entire cars are bulletproof and make good cover, dodging a mini-gun behind a wooden wall, vanishing wounds, like when young will is shot, he's up and about next scene. Some plot conveniences, like a jet that comes from nowhere and never needs fuel or clearance to land or take off. Minor picks that a lot of other movies do as well. Overall, well done middle of the ground stuff without a lot of re-watch value. It's a good 5/10 from me and that means you can watch this for some action or skip this and not miss out on much. Not a bad film, it's just missing something.... More could have been done with the core of the story perhaps, which is the cloning thing. Instead, it's an entertaining enough action flick with a wasted sci-fi hook.",Gemini Man
315,theprogs,A not bad movie,6,6 January 2021,"It is almost a B Movie, but it is fun to watch though. If they just have changed the voice of young Will Smith a bit to fit a boy in his 20's, because his voice pitch suits more an older man.
The scenario is a bit soggy, especially after he met his clone, events went from bad to worse after that, but it is still watchable if you like this type of movies.
In my opinion, it deserves 6 out of 10.",Gemini Man
316,aew-10,"Could have been good, but a missed opportunity",5,12 January 2020,"The film starts off okay, even if the opening sniper scene stretches credulity a bit - hitting a target in a TGV at full speed from two kilometers away. The film's main idea is novel - having a younger clone of yourself hunt you down.The early action sequences are good; there were some fresh ideas especially the motor bikes.However, the feeling soon becomes apparent that the plot is rather familiar; one that we have seen many times - rogue operatives in the secret service, hero betrayed and falsely accused of something and the hunt is on.About halfway through (the fight in the catacombs) the film runs out of steam and becomes a talk-fest and then turns melodramatic with violins and much hand wringing, tears and soul searching, concluding with a soppy feel-good ending.Much of the action takes place in the dark. The final shoot-em-up is over the top. The bad guys have heavy armour with two minor weak points yet are easy to put down, while the protagonists get like one scratch between them. The bad guys have a rotary cannon with building-piercing bullets; again, not a scratch on the protagonists who are hiding behind wooden planks. Then we have the ""only two bullets left"" cliché.Then in comes a second even younger clone of Will Smith. He also has armour, but gets himself stupidly fried in a solvent/paint fire. He does not have the brains to move away from the fire, even though he is supposed to be a super-soldier. In all he lasts less than five minutes before he is cooked.In summary - could have been good, but a missed opportunity.",Gemini Man

320,Elijah_T,A Technical Feat Shrouding Interesting Subject Matters (3D 120fps 2K),9,27 December 2019,"Mini Review:
The plot touched (and sometimes dwelled) on very interesting subjects and really could have made it a better film if they gave a damn more about it{1}, but it worked just fine as an action film with impressive technical work and an interesting plot. As a story with an understandable main character, it gets a 3.75/5. As an action film in which one dude must go up against his younger self, it gets a 4.5/5. Can you imagine going in not knowing who the assassin was, though?
Side Notes:1) The first half of the first boss fight and almost the entirety of the second were great to watch. The third was great for the first two-thirds and good for the last.2) There were atleast two revelations/twists that I didn't exactly see coming.3) Some of the dialogue scenes were solid, especially in the first half.4) Looking back, the first shootout was like someone saw the one for John Wick: Chapter 1 (2014) and thought ""...he can be better.""5) Clay gave me some Darth Bane / Palpatine vibes in certain scenes. Not saying he was evil for evil's sake, though, just clearly the pragmatically dark side of equation.6) There are three female characters in this movie. Two are named. Though I find it somewhat unfortunate that it fails the Bechdel Test, I can see how passing it would change the flow of the smoothly point-to-point action movie that this is. If it focused more on the plot like I mentioned earlier, then it totally could have passed.Favorite Scene:
The ""old man"" interrogation. It was so realistic and well acted (or maybe I'm a bit prejudiced) that I felt for the other character the whole time while also knowing why the interrogation needed to happen in the first place. Didn't expect to feel so torn in that moment or wanting it to just end (in a good way).
Implied Minor Spoilers:1) I appreciate the way the movie didn't go the obvious romantic route even though it left me with questions as to the future of its characters.2) While I have personal problems with the typical portrayal of males giving into societal norms and embracing fatherhood when they either aren't ready or don't want it (I'm looking at you, Spider Man: Into the Spider Verse), I felt for this one. It was just done in a realistic and understandable way.Technical Review:The higher frame rate wasn't noticed much at first (other than in the first two minutes). Things just seemed naturally smoother in a way. It was more noticeable when Junior came into play, especially when the shooting started. It became appreciated during the CQC fight between Henry and Junior.That being said, the high frame rate only looked bad during the ""bike race"". It looked like jittery graphics from a video game with the way Henry's jacket flopped in the wind. I'm assuming they didn't manage to make the high frame rate look good at high speeds. The only other problem with the scene was the way Junior's movements (along with his bike) looked a bit... off. Not quite jittery like the jacket. Just lacking a natural flow.I'm keeping in mind that Junior was always a stunt double anytime he and Henry were in the same scene/shot because I presume that had something to do with it. Meh.Overall, the high frame rate was great. Just not something that a regular drama or non-visual documentary would need. Worth an extra $5? For this movie, yeah.As for the 3D? I either didn't notice it or enjoyed the way it enhanced certain scenes. Namely, the opening shot, first underwater scene, and car ride scene.As for Junior's CGI? There are two scenes that it looks very noticeable in. The first was a short ""wtf, guys?"", but the second was a long ""damn, y'all, fix this ****"" moment.As much as I'd like to get a comparison, I never got a round to watching it in 2D 24fps. Partially because of time and budget, but mostly because the plot wasn't consistently interesting enough for me to watch it again without wanting to just jump to the action and certain dialogue scenes.
Disclosure:
I saw and discussed the film with a group of males who definitely had a moderate affect on my opinion of the movie. That being said, I'm pretty sure I like it more than most of them.{1} See 10/25th comment on my Letterboxd review.",Gemini Man
321,Elijah_T,Catching the Apple,9,27 December 2019,"Plot Review:The plot touched (and sometimes dwelled) on very interesting subjects (e.g.: the morality of sending people to war, moral responsibility, knowing when to quit, getting a second chance, fatherhood, etc.). While some would complain about the lack of a detailed or expanded focus on its themes, I'm mostly satisfied with the degree to which the movie explored them. Yes, it could have been better plot-wise. To me, those themes weren't its focus. Hence the way it doesn't drift in the plot for too long. Gemini Man only stays in full-on ""plot mode"" long enough to make it more than just an action film. Now that I think about it, it juggles the plot and action pretty well. Never quite leaving one in the gutter in order to continue on with the other. It's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in that regard. Almost perfectly balanced, but handled by people who kept biting a bit more than they could chew.All of that being said, I suspect that the writers and director did their best with what they were allowed and ""capable"" of. It's clear in the first half that they had something interesting going on within the plot. It's unfortunate (and somewhat disappointing) that all of the themes weren't fully baked. Regardless, it's still very much enjoyable in terms of both plot and action.

322,prberg2,Disappointing on all levels,2,11 October 2019,Really did NOT enjoy Gemini Man. So many things just didn't work with this film.Let me start with the story and script... which I think are the most important. Story was not interesting at all and just super boring. Why can they not come up with a better and more interesting story? Dialogue was super cheesy and just painful in some places.Actors were trying... but even Will Smith could not save this movie!The action even felt boring and predicable.Visually I really did not like this film. Everything felt so fake. For me.. I can't get into a movie if things just all feel so fake. All done on a greenscreen... etc.The high frame rate stuff just felt like a bad Soap Opera or straight to video TV movie. I think it added to the fake feeling.. for me at least. I also could see some places where Will's stunt double was driving the motorcycle. That took me out of it too.Also so much product placement. Just seeing the Coke cans everywhere.. it's sort of distracting. Like an Ad... and less of a movie.Just a bad movie on so many levels... disappointing.,Gemini Man

Not So Great,5,17 October 2019,"Before i start i was going to watch this film in HDR+ but in the end decided not to but my local iMAX screen (Stevenage) was not showing it, the nearest one from that was ages away.So yea the whole cloning thing was cool, it was very well done with Will Smiths face on the younger version of him self, but i really could notice just how bad the action scenes were, I'm sitting there actually questioning why it looks like some mid 2000's movie, honestly, when there moving it looks so fake, even the bike scenes were so fake, i was actually laughing at how bad that looked, they seriously messed up the CGi in that sense, i wonder if it would of looked any different in HDR+? But still, even my friends said it looked whack. But the actual action scenes them selves, not to bad tbh, nothing incredible.The story was kinda predictable though, bad company / person makes something good go bad, tries to kill the good guy & in the end the bad guy dies so it does not grip you in that sense. Good idea for the film, but could have been done better, they concentrated on the visuals to much and not the story. As they say with video games, great visuals don't always mean it has a great story.Overall its a popcorn movie to take your dad to see on a Sunday or something, for hardcore film fans like me, we won't remember it for long.Age - 25

Suddenly every named character is an invincible super soldier, all the enemy professional soldiers are useless, incompetent, and their armor does nothing to stop bullets, but every other flimsy object in existence does stop bullets if the heroes hide behind it. Oh, and the main bad guy is so poorly written at the end it is horrifying.On the other hand, the de-aged Will Smith was actually amazing. Having seen terrible de-aging in other films like The Irishman, I'm absolutely blown-away by how well the did it in this one. I kept having to reconfirm for myself that it was done digitally with Will Smith himself and not his son made up to look like him. Really, really impressive.",Gemini Man
331,slideshowp2,"Just for the record, I've only seen the 60-frame version",7,7 December 2019,"Ang lee's ""the twin killers"" has just been released, and the movie's reputation is finally turning around in mainland China.""The twin killers"" received a very bad rating from overseas rating sites rotten tomatoes and META, while our Chinese rating from douban was 7.1.That's not a satisfying achievement for ang lee's work, but at least it means ""the twin killers"" isn't a bad movie -- but it's far from great, especially for the ang lee brand.The controversy over the film is nothing more than the ""technological innovation"" and ""cliches"", and the pros and cons of the dispute, to a large extent, is not about the film itself, but about an ""ang lee film"".Imagine if instead of ang lee, the film would be directed by Jason bourne director Paul greengrass or alita director Robert rodriguez. The answer in your heart at this time, probably is a more objective evaluation.Lee's recent work, from ""Billy Lynn's long halftime walk"" to ""the twin killers,"" has been conceptually technology-driven, moving away from the nuanced human perspective of the year, especially in ""the twin killers.""So the evaluation of ""the twin killers"", first from the technical point of view. Although the new movie format created by ang lee this time is the deluxe version of 4K, 3D and 120 frames, unfortunately, like most netizens, I only have the condition to watch the 3D version of 60 frames. In fact, most of the comments on this movie are also from the 60-frame version.In terms of my personal experience, I can say that there is neither the amazing feeling brought by high frame rate, nor a lot of discomfort against my habitual thinking.Prologue intentions obvious wide Angle lens, the train rapidly across the screen technology for high frame rate is the biggest show off, and then in the process of, I also have one or two action part there is a similar of immersive VR games, as for the other paragraphs, does not see a higher film, similar small video from my phone replaced by 4 k home theater sense of upgrade.""Immersive"" is one of the aims of Mr. Lee's recent obsession with high-frame-rate shots, which capture more content and create a more immersive feel, but it is clear that the effects of the technology, though somewhat new, are not revolutionary.When it comes to technology, the inevitable is a story.The story of the twin killers will no doubt prove to be the film's Achilles heel, as the soft science fiction concept of human cloning is a cliche in Hollywood, and the outlaw agent is even worse.Coppola and kubrick wouldn't have made much of a story of this kind, and the type of story that requires intense conflict and ups and downs isn't something lee is good at, and it might have been better done by some great b-movie director.In this kind of story text, what ang lee tries to express on the ideological level, such as the reflection on science and technology, the challenge to patriarchy, and the self-questioning, are all superficial, lacking in strength and depth.Technically, we think it's passable, and in terms of stories, we think it's uninteresting, but what about the combination of story and technology?In fact, this is lee's biggest challenge, the new photography technology requires a new movie grammar. At high frame rates, many of the techniques used by filmmakers fail, and many of the more experienced actors can flip.Just like in Billy Lynn's long halftime walk, supporting actor vin diesel is certainly a seasoned actor, but his layered performance feels overdone with a high frame rate. High frame rates not only make the world more beautiful, but also make actors' so-called ""performance marks"" heavier.It's worth mentioning that will Smith's performance in the twin killers is obviously more natural than any of the actors in Billy Lynn's long halftime walk. On the one hand, this is the deep foundation and efforts of will Smith himself; on the other hand, it is also the result of lee's increasingly deepened understanding of high frame rate films and his targeted training of actors.However, throughout the film, we can still see that the so-called high frame rate shooting, has not yet formed a new set of audio-visual language. Although ang lee has made some progress in the training of the actors, in the scheduling and shooting of the film, we do not see many changes that match the technological innovation, and even some places will form a burden.For example, in a blasting scene in the second half of the film, the smoke of the instant explosion becomes granular because of the high frame rate. In a conventional movie, this would have been a place where high-speed editing would have been used to enhance the sense of thunderous force, but in ""the twin killers,"" it's a strange slow-motion scene, where there's a disconnect between slowness and plot tension.There is always a process for innovation, and paying tuition is even more inevitable. We certainly respect ang lee's pioneering spirit of seeking breakthroughs in film technology and art, and expect him to give us an early glimpse into the future.Still worth a look!",Gemini Man

337,opinionated-alchemist,When will Will Smith be a believable character?,5,19 January 2020,"Yes- this review contains spoilers - but really... Gemini Man is not a movie, which can surprise you in any way.I don't go much into the story. It is quite flat, there are no twists - nor surprises. The outcome is visible from miles away.
The picture isn't bad at all, if you are excusing some pretty bad CGI moments. Parts of Gemini Man look like pretty bad green-screen combined with a computer game (probably a couple of years ago).
The action? Not too bad. Some pretty good stunt scenes. But then also a lot of tricks which are obvious for the viewer.But the biggest problem (like so often) is Will Smith. Sorry - but he is just not believable in the role as a stone cold killer. He puts his tormented ""Will Smith acting face"" on and it is more than cringeworthy. And the whole body acting? You want to believe, that somebody who works for so long in Hollywood and acted in so many action movies, should take gun handling, strategies, movements serious. Thinking about John Wick/Keanu Reaves. But no - Will Smith isn't so dedicated. And it shows!When does anyone tell Will Smith, that a full fletched soldier doesn't carry his emotion to the outside (or to his eyebrows...)?At the end, the movie is slightly entertaining. The whole story arc is a bit relieving - no in this flick not the whole world gonna burn - it is not Armageddon! But this is just a slight upside.
In the next movie with Will Smith, I just don't want directly to see the (always same) acting of Will Smith.Maybe action is really nothing, what he should do (maybe action comedies... but definitely not real action)!",Gemini Man

339,michaeljpfitzgerald,"Structurally sound, feel good action",4,4 June 2020,"I remember sitting in The Matrix: Reloaded, during the much hyped fight between Neo and all the Smiths, thinking 'This would have been a lot cooler if they'd just put a bunch of guys in makeup'. The technology just wasn't there - Neo and the Smiths all looked like weird, bendy cartoons, moving in a strange approximation of humanity, but still badly triggering the uncanny valley.Given the hype about Gemini Man, I was expecting some improvements on that technology...but, again, I found myself thinking 'they just should have gotten a good double'. Jackie Chan was fighting himself more convincingly twenty years ago - there simply isn't the technology, yet, to really, truly animate people. I suppose they have to keep trying, but it robbed this film of a pair of cool fight scenes, for basically no payoff.Now, the...youthening of Will Smith thoughout the other parts of this film was impressive, and much closer to the mark. There were angles, and moments that the illusion collapsed, but the ruse was aided by the age difference, and Smith did a really good job of differentiating these selves he was playing. I hope someday we get to hear from Smith about why he chooses the films he does - he's a better actor than he ends up in vehicles for.Genuinely weird to see Clive Owen up and about, and this is as good a job as he's done of not being himself as I can recall in a long, long time. Winstead is always good value, and I want her to get the roles that her being Sigourney Weaver Part 2 demands that she should. Russel Wong is a delight, and I'm thrilled he's getting so much work.I liked this, a lot. Flawed story, and as is the case with a lot of Smith properties, seems to be trying to do one more thing than the screenplay can handle - this happens in Cruise films, too, but Smith remains likable in those collapses...Tom, less so, I think. This one struggled bouncing between lovely, well thought out modern shooter scenes, to just...late game reshoots with explosions.

340,ReadingFilm,Gemini or Cancer?,10,30 October 2019,"Ang's contrarian compassion brings a soothing veneer across it. His strange obsession with technology only makes sense that he knows he can do the Ang Lee picture backward and forward, but is restless in being this brand and auteur even at his own expense. So he's able to tap into this vein of the counterfeit 21st century, the copy and paste identities, the streamlining of the self, the individual's escalating irrelevance against the vast systems we create to entrap us, all the while servicing the entertainment mechanism (the film does so many things in so many ways it would be almost impossible to reverse engineer such specificity). Reviews keep saying it's a 90s vehicle but what era is it even anymore? This narrative of western culture no longer exists - 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s -we are here in a global age. So any art that would attempt to process the rapid evolution of the emerging hyper age can only be schizophrenic to those of us still inside that linear time. I sense Lee's reaction to these apocalypses is not to be ensnared by the more thorough enclosures of escape that are inevitable from more thorough apocalypses. He knows rapid evolution comes with rapid destruction. He gets ahead of it like a soldier on the front lines arguing the usefulness of cinema to begin with, with how it's still about fathers and sons, the past, and regrets. The response is interesting as well. Critics, themselves clones, still seem to only care about Will Smith and his narrative of box office totals. So the echo clone blockbuster creates echo critics with echo narratives. How futuristic: even without Will Smith we will necessitate a fake one to feed the input, and fake critics sprout in response. You see how rapid evolution is always, like the many Will Smiths, going to restlessly arrive for something human, else it kills us in the process.

This could have been a great movie; but it is brought down a notch by the corny dialogue that Will Smith has to deliver. He has never been a great actor. He tries and he is really sincere; but he misses by this much. Interesting enough, the CGI Will Smith looks more real than the old Will Smith. The old Will Smith doesn't really look old enough. He just has some gray hair and both the young and old Will Smith look like they go to the barber shop every day although there are no scenes in the movie of them going to the barber shop. How they get the young Will Smith to switch sides is also not plausible. Clive Owen makes a good villain. He should have been James Bond instead of Daniel Craig.

Then you realise the writing is in the hands of the man that somehow singlehandedly brought down the biggest show of all time. The story of Gemini man is one you know how it will ride out.The film starts off well and quite hearstopping as we are introduced to Henry (Will Smith) as a hired assassin entertaining his ""last"" hit, which entices his thoughts of retirement. We meet Danny a female Agent hired to spy on Henry during his next phase of life, Henry is on to it and from here a partnership is made. Enter Clive Owen who'll have none of this retirement and clones Henry to have him kill the real Henry. From here it can get predictable. The scenes are full of action and beautifully shot thanks to Ang Lee.Will and others are more than fine in their roles, it's just unfortunately you are sitting there and can almost predict the next line. It detracts from the ride being more fun. Still its worth a gander.",Gemini Man

It's a decent story with slightly OTT CGI, but you are here for watching an entertaining film no? You know you won't be getting an Oscar winner with this. Just go with the flow, enjoy the ride and enjoy the various wonderful locations the film is set in. Really enjoyable action movie.",Gemini Man
348,neoclone07,Don't waste your time,5,3 December 2019,"Man, jeez, I wasn't expecting much of an entertainment out of this movie, but, oh boy, it was lower than I could possibly imagine.
Latest movies from Will Smith are pretty lame, but this one sucks big time.
A bland, boring, script with regular action shots and bad CGI. The deaging effect is pretty decent... if you watch it in dark scenes. Whenever some light is cast over the deaged Will Smith, you can see how bad it is.
Don't commit the same mistake as I did. You're gonna waste 2 hours out of your life. Go watch something else.

350,dtrani,Lacking but not a disaster,6,29 September 2020,"Gemini Man is not as bad as critiques and audiences claim it to be. There are definitely flaws but this film was not a complete flop when it comes to an interesting action movie. To say the least this movie had great potential that was not fully unlocked.
First off many would claim that the film's story is not appealing. This is not true. The characters are well written in certain ways and the basic plot is easy enough to understand without making it boring. In fact, the most interesting character, in my opinion, is probably Henry's (Will Smith) clone. The only ""writing"" issue I have with this feature is the romance. They seem to hint many times at a ""romance"" between two of our main characters but it always comes off weird being that one character looks too old and the other too young.
The film does in fact have fairly good visual effects. I did enjoy seeing a young version of Will Smith and even forgot that he was fake at times. But unfortunately during the moments that were rough, they were very noticeable. At times, Junior (will smith clone) would speak and his lips would not fully move or would look like mumbling. Also, being that Ang Lee loves to sometimes film scenes with fast shutter speeds, the cgi is the most flat and wacky being that everything looks so blurry and soft.
I cannot say that this film is a disaster. I enjoyed a lot of the action moments and was fairly engaged the whole way through. But for a director with his reputation, I definitely was hoping for something more jaw-dropping. Satisfying but not Cinema-status for sure.",Gemini Man

Then it had a few moment with palm trees, library lamps and long archways that had depth of field blur (F4.5 say).I love Will in anything, especially this one, it's just amazing how he and brad pitt are saying things to us in film without yelling it (about life, choices, maturity as a person, for me as a man).The story was good, the CGI was mostly the best uncanny valley send off I have ever seen. I don't know where we are headed with these ghosts in the shell. Are we entering big city led lights virtuosity, is hollywood telling us something? Is culture and society?

Irrespective of the typical plot issues (if you want plot, read a good novel, this is cinema), the pace and story is good. I don't know why there are so many Benioff haters in the reviews. Seems a bit unfair, all in all.
The one thing that bugs me is the budget - this is by all counts a big budget movie, yet it feels like small to medium budget. Other than the CG of Will Junior, what did they do? Buy the yacht?
In terms of the business of movies, the ROI is there, but if I put that amount of money in, I would want spectacular ROI, thankyouverymuch.
In the last twenty minutes or so, it is as if they ran out of time for special effects, or out of budget, if that is possible. Still gets a 7, though. Even if just for the motorbike scene.",Gemini Man

That's all you really need to know right there. Smith plays Henry, a government assassin/sniper who can make a head shot on a man in a train moving at 200 miles an hour from a half mile away. This guy is really good. The government also wants him dead and sends a clone of his younger self to do the job, thinking this guy is even better. I had to force myself to stop thinking, ""How the hell did they do that?"", when Henry is fighting himself. A wonderful Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays an agent sent to keep an eye on Henry and they share great chemistry. The action sequences are masterfully shot and the hand-to-hand stuff of Smith fighting himself is a marvel. Interesting locales add to the adventure. A strong supporting cast and a very formidable villain round out a very good, fun movie. Score: 8.5. Go. Who you gonna trust? 11/9/19",Gemini Man

The way it is shot makes no sense until you figure out that it had a few deleted seconds before when probably that extra was firstly filmed facing the camera.If I understand even a little bit of how Hollywood works, I guess the poor guy had to work his way through many beds to get his first break in this movie, only to find himself edited out because he was too beautiful to eclipse Will Smith.Back to the movie in general: wow this was bad! The script is weak, we are required to suspend our disbelief much too much, the action scenes are bad, the story in itself is shallow.The computerized younger Will Smith is cringe inducing.

376,luningyuan-23687,The new technology brings the story to the next level,7,5 November 2019,"Ang Li's new film, Gemini Man, once again starts a cinema revolution all over the world. Like last time, this film also shot in 4K, 120FPS, which you many not able to see in your local cinema. Since the upgrade fee is too high for those cinema companies and only a few High-Tec films each year, there is not enough reason for them to spend that money. And which ii think is the main reason that reviewers don't like this film, this film must be seen in a 4K&120FPS cinema.
Luckily, there are some High-Tec cinemas in China, well, actually quite a lot. So, I experienced Li's new High-Tec work, and to be honest, it's brilliant! The story is not the spotlight, just a very classic Hollywood style story, but the car chasing scene and the fighting scene on the 4K 120fps screen, it is so extraordinary. ""Cool"" won't be enough to describe it.
I think I should explain what is 4K and 120FPS. Well, you can wiki or google it, of course, but I would like to explain them to you by myself, which will make this article looks not too short. 4K means the resolutions. It is much clearer than those films we usually watch, as those would be 2K. So, yes, double it. As 120 fps, this may hard to explain. FPS as short of ""frames per second"". The movie also called ""motion picture"". One short clip of video actually contained maybe thousand or hundred of pictures, when you watching the video, actually, you are watching those pictures flipping in front of your eyes every quickly. So, normally, in film, 24 pictures will be slipped in front of you in one second, but in this film, there will be 120pictures in ONE SECOND! This really is amazing, all the pictures are in 4K and 120 in one second, which means you can see everything in this film clearer than ever, even a pore. With this technology, the characters on the screen will be more real and lively.
Watching this film in a proper cinema may be a challenge, but it will be soon available in a DVD store or online store, try it on your best screen at home.",Gemini Man

Imagine all those beautiful professionally taken DSLR photos, but as a film. This is the future of cinema, and it will impact action movies the most.But...this movie is such cringe worthy because they decided to de-age Will Smith. And if 120fps makes everything pop and jump out of the screen, then get ready to really notice all that CGI in the worst way, plus the rest that is used in action scenes.I am actually excited for future use of 120fps, but not in films that use a lot of CGI, at least not until CGI matures A LOT more.Lastly, a script and storyline that needs to be slapped for taking your money is the final straw.

387,PossibleOptimism,Cool...but expected more. Here's a long review...,6,8 March 2020,"Let's be clear, Will Smith is a great actor, and the rest of the cast presumably did their best. But the script/ plot lacked real motivation and was executed in a clunky manner. Nothing too original about the plot of super soldiers to take over the roles of their emotional counterparts, yet the writers attempted a little twist with the use of a new technology. Even though nothing's unique about cloning. And they killed all the suspense early from the trailers to how the story played out. Traded a dramatic entrance for a emotional climb to an anti climatic meeting.
Seems like all they were doing was showing off how realistic CGI Will Smith's performance was--and then building the story.
To be fair, the digital recreation of a younger version of a living actor was spot on amazing and they had a lot of close ups to use. But it was in the action scenes where it all fell apart. Replacing actors with full digital doubles was easy to spot and the motion was wrong. Took out a lot of the entertainment value. Not to mention the confusing documentary style daylight color grade. We don't all need shaky cam, but this was supposed to be an action movie...
All things considered, it's no autumn blockbuster, but still worth a watch.",Gemini Man

But we are meant to ignore the point we already know that? Like the trailer clearly let us know its his clone but more than half the movie is confirming his a clone.And some of the scenes in this movie are just stupid especially the ones below:1. When the clone shoots Will smith with Bee venom just to confirm he's a clone but he's boss/dad already confirmed with him the scene before that they are clones.2. Will smith tells the clone not to kill his evil dad/boss because it will break him inside. But then goes to kill the guy himself instead right in front of the clone? How the hell is that any better you killed the man in front of him its still going to scar him.3. When Will smith acts like his about to die and the clone comes in to save him, anyone could've guessed that was going to happen.4. The big reveal of the 3rd clone, guessed it was another clone straight away and new it would be an emotionless clone because of all the foreshadowing.Sorry i keep referring to Will smith as Will smith but the movie was so crap i forgot his name lol.The only good thing about this movie was the technology used to create the clone. It was not perfect but defs wasn't bad either.This movie could've been a lot better but i think its offensive how stupid the movie thought the audience must be to surprised by any of the twists in this movie.",Gemini Man

395,moviebuff-90191,Brilliant Movie,10,29 October 2019,"Gemini Man is a brilliant movie, tons of action scenes and martial arts. The movie plot is easy to follow and is interesting, but one must concentrate on the dialogue otherwise you won't know what is going on.
The VFX is phenomenal, I don't know why some professional critics spoke negatively on that aspect, the younger Will Smith looked realistic.
I had a good time at the cinema watching this movie. If you love action flicks and still haven't seen Gemini Man, go see it!(January 29th, 2021, Update)
Gemini Man has become one of my favourite movies, I own it on Amazon Prime Video and have streamed it lots of times, but I wanted to add some new things to this review.
I still stand by my original review, I love this movie and the action scenes, but there is one thing I don't like in this movie...the older Will Smith mentions to ""Junior"" a couple of times about a relationship, the first time in the Catacombs...first and foremost ""Junior"" needs to get away from ""Clay"", a relationship is the last thing he should be thinking about, and it isn't really about 'dying to be in a relationship and connect' (as Henry put it) it's about the fact that ""Junior"" is a living being and he needs to get away from that life and find a better career (a career that does not involve being a trained killer) and the second time in the car near the end of the movie ""Henry"" tells ""Junior"" that Junior should be a husband and a father....now that may be good for some people, but it isn't for everyone, it seems that ""Henry"" is putting his own desires and regrets onto the young man.
I like the fact that the main female lead ""Danny"" and ""Henry"" have a platonic friendship, and the fact that the movie doesn't try to make it into something more, there is mention of sexual attraction but ""Henry"" shuts that down right away, also ""Junior"" shows no interest in the lady in that way, which is a good thing. There needs to be more movies like this.",Gemini Man
396,garabedbaghsarian,"Ignore the hate, watch it for yourself",8,23 November 2019,"I don't get the amount of hate that this movie is getting, the trailer was okay; not grabbing someone's attention to go and watch it. But when you give it a try and watch it, you'll love and enjoy the action scenes it contained.
The movie talks about Henry (Will Smith), a Sniper Assassin who worked for the DIA and wanted to retire but kept getting refused. In his ""last"" mission, he kills anonymous terrorist aboard a bullet train. But it turns out that he was an innocent target and after that, he became wanted person by ""GEMINI"", secret black ops unit that wanted him dead.
Later, GEMINI introduces a ""new weapon"" that they believed was the best solution to kill Henry and to be used in future wars. It was a clone of younger Henry when he was stronger and faster. Honestly, the mastermind behind this idea had a convincing reason to create such a thing, instead of losing real men who have families, their clones would go and take the fight. In this way, there wouldn't be a loss of souls and soldiers. But the more you think about it; clones can get manipulated and turn into a very deadly weapon, just like the movie Terminator.",Gemini Man

Right off the bat you can tell his clone is CGI as the physics breaks down. The bike will land incorrectly, body movements are off...etc. Its like they didn't try it in the real word so they would know how it should look like.The writer also doesn't seem to know how cloning works. If you ever met identical twins you would know they have vastly different personalities even though they share the same genes. A clone would be even farther removed as they were gestated in a different wombs, grew up in a different time, with completely different experiences.Ignore all that and it is somewhat entertaining.

The only real issues were the lighting on Junior's face from far way, the action sequences looked very animated and was definitely in uncanny valley in terms of CGI.The action sequences were great as well, especially in the end when the three lead characters have to face off against a second clone of Henry's characterOverall it seemed like the writers(or whoever pitched the idea whether it was Ang Lee or not) just thought 'hey let's make a film in which we get to make a CGI duplicate of Will Smith in a film, writing definently needed work, also seems that they invested most of the budget on the mo-cap and maybe the actors like Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Will Smith considering the location, at times it seemed that there was a green screen in the background, either that or it was really horrendous lighting, looked very off and noticeable.This movie definitely isn't anything special not saying its unwatchable.",Gemini Man

408,treborquest,wanted to love it.....but....,6,12 October 2019,"Went to see this in ScreenX, but that really didn't offer anything extra, except that it made the movie just more expensive. It's also offered in MX4D, and that's probably why this movie has a problem. it seems to be made for 4D, because of the acting and editing.
Through the entire movie there are scenes that build up to the action that would be enhanced by 4D. so basically it feels like it's made to let you experience 4D
But then there's the cgi and that's where the movie really misses the mark.
young Will Smith often doesn't look like young Will Smith, but like a bad computer animated person, that lipsyncs with the dialogue just a fraction too late. His lips don't move naturally, the eyes are wider than they should be, tears in his eyes look fake and the acting is slightly too slow, probably to make it possible to make Will Smith look that much younger.I have to say, the movie, no matter how unrealistic the plot is and how often there are wtf moments, still is pretty enjoyable. It sometimes felt like a James Bond movie, American Style (over the top, bigger than big). I had a good time, just wouldn't do ScreenX again and think the movie could have been much better if the editing and special effects were better.",Gemini Man

The script made zero since for it would explain what the character was feeling while the actor was acting another way. There was one emotional scene which didn't make since by what happens in the ending of the climax. I am all for ""good time"" action flicks but it was joking around but felt serious. Its kind of like that awkward kid from school that tried to be cool but in the end looked like a try hard idiot...Yeah that's this film. Why was this film made with a high farm-rate of 120 fps? That type of filming wasn't necessary. There was only a few action scenes which weren't high scale at all. One of them I couldn't even see what was going on, they actually needed Mrs. Winstead to wave a gun around with a light on it for us to see anything. What happened to sympathy in this film's universe? Every character that died had no emotion on any of the characters. One died the characters would move on and you wouldn't hear anything else about them.

The acting is good, the scenary is beautiful though not a fan of making bullet holes and damaging walls of historic buildings, and the announced de-aging looks quite impressive and convincing. Almost ironically the CGI fails somewhere else. This is not a Marvel/Disney movie and you will not expect people shooting laser beams from space guns, yet some of the fights look as if they were taken from a Spiderman movie, with bouncy characters that don't follow a natural behavior, instead of real people fighting.

The actors and locations jumped out at me visually like no other movie I can remember seeing. The action set-pieces were nicely done, especially the ones in Cartegena, Colombia, that made full use of the tropical color palette in that city.The story was pretty much a standard action thriller operating more or less at the James Bond level, with a bit of sci-fi thrown in. I enjoyed it just fine, but perhaps that was partially because I knew nothing about the plot.

It was only dimensional going backward, not forward, and occasionally images in the background actually appeared in the foreground. The film was so unbelievably flat that you wondered why 3D was used at all, with dull, dark photography that was boring. Filming in120 FPS was unnecessary, barely noticeable, and only added to the muddled shots. The green screen shots were terribly obvious, and, oh yes, a $138 million film actually had a lot of cheesy day-for-night scenes, like 1940s westerns.

At times the shots seem quite mismatched too - individual characters delivering dialogue in a long-shot, making them look disconnected from the very people they are supposed to be talking to (perhaps they were all shot on different days/locations/continents?)

It was too bland with absolutely nothing standing out and it could've been wholly replaced.It's hard to pinpoint the problems in the story other than being mediocre and unimaginative.

It is unnecessary and ultimately amateurish looking.This is most obvious in the scene where see the the 3rd clone tearing across the screen at suspension-of-disbelief-breaking speed.These bad editing decisions aside, the dialogue is hammy, and/or unbelievable, and the basic storyline itself is just confused. It really feels in places as if this is several film ideas smashed together into one whole which just doesn't work...Making Clive Owens the actual father figure of the clone added some horrific and frankly weird scenes later in the film where we are subjected to these two, clearly pretty savage murderers, having a ridiculous pretend ""family time talk"". I also kept getting the feeling Clive Owen was basically a cut-price Darth Vader...(can he turn his son to the dark side or not etc...) one of the many clear storyline ""inspirations"" which this film mashes together clumsily. (Moon was probably the inspiration for this film's main premise) Individually, each of these ideas could have worked.

I don't know why this isn't rated higher than it is.Regarding the technical aspects, it's the most convincing deep fake I've seen for sure! Like if you went into it without knowing it was cgi, you might think it was Will's son that looks just like him. Oddly the most telling aspect was his voice. It just didn't match up perfectly and didn't have that young Will feel to it (like hearing old Will coming out of his mouth). Just a bit off. And the facial expressions were a bit stiff.

Even Arnie's The 6th Day (2000) had a plot more original than this.There is some good to take out of this film though, we get to experience amazing Next Level use of 3D Technology featuring HFR (High Frame Rate). There are honest moments of ""Whoa"" and ""That was cool"". However, this wasn't enough of a distraction from the awful script. It was as if the technical crew just wanted to play with their toys as soon as an opportunity presented itself (cough, Jerry Bruckheimer, cough).On that note, I can see this technology being used in a more balance collaboration that will surely pay off down the track.

And yet it happened. Why?I heard all the hype about de-aging and HFR but it was so bad that even the CGI of Henry Cavills mustache or the Steppenwolf in Justice League were way more convincing / believable than ""young"" Will Smitch.And don't label it as action or si-fi.

The story itself had many predictable aspects to it, but I was able to overlook them. The various settings, and the cinematography were very good. The motorcycle chase was clever and well done. They did a fine job with the cloned version of Will.If you're looking for really high-tech, CGI and special effects, you'll be disappointed. What I DID like was that the special effects were NOT over the top and dominant. I could actually see the action/ fight/ chase scenes and know what was going on. There is just a bit of ""Crouching Tiger"" types of moves in the final fight scenes. Not so much as to mess with me too much.It was a nice surprise for me.

Will Smith does a good job when he is himself. His animated younger self is just terrible - I'm sure they tried very very very hard and appreciate the amount of effort that went into the coding of the young Smith but you can tell and therefore your believe is lost - it's just not right. It's a step forward and one day, very soon, we will not be able toto tell the difference but because we can and because it is so important to the plot it lets this movie down.

Just sit back and watch in awe as a tired of killing assassin finds himself stalked by a clone of himself....It's fast paced and the visual effects are excellent.

Sure, there are exciting action scenes individually but from the moment where they met, and then to where he went against his father are all treated very very monotonously. I believe reading a book might have been more exciting.2) Junior is extremely distracting. CGI. Good and bad. Double edge sword. Crying and emotional scene with Clive shows fantastic CGI but for most other parts, very non-believable and weird. Takes my attention off in the film and it's a very very bad thing in any movie.

I think this is the future, now old actors will be playing younger self in Movies in near future. But in this movie, it was demanded by script, however this can open door to the future movies of this older-actor-playing-younger movies.Gemini is a very good movie.
You will be happy after watching this.
Its a family movie that can be watched with all.Watch it on weekends and someone around. Dont watch it alone.",Gemini Man
512,mklarsen-51895,Hmm...,7,9 October 2019,"I watched this last night and wondered how it would play out. Personally the fight scenes were great but they were simply good because they increased the speed in which they were fighting and not because of quality. The motorbike scene is awesome but you couldn't help feeling bad for Jnr. It's worth watching, I am just not convinced it is worth paying to see at the movies.",Gemini Man
513,spacequazar,Will Smith fights Rubber Smith,4,23 November 2019,"Thats about all there is to it. But IMDB wants me to write more, so i'll say this. The old Smith is still a decent actor. The action isnt great but good enough. So is the writing. What was most off-putting for me i that rubbery looking animated face of young will smith. The de-aging or whateer it's called was almost as terrible as in Star Wars. The movement seemed artificial as well. Walking looks robotic because every movement of the legs in every step is the same. At least that could have been prevented. In the final scene we get to see Will and Rubber walking alongside each other without constantly moving and good lighting. What we can clearly see there is that the algorithms/capabilities arent good enough yet. I left the movie thinking about how the big stuidios have and probably will continue to use this horrendous idea of ""seamlessly"" mixing animated chrackters with real ones, I never want to see that done again until its so good i actually cant tell the difference. Anyone who found it believable should seriously get their eyes checked.",Gemini Man
514,JuniorTorres720,Good Movie with Fun Characters but Story Lacks Depth,8,31 January 2020,"Gemini Man was a good film. I enjoyed the movie and it's visual effects. The fight scene in the beginning between both Henry and Junior was intense and the best fight scene of the movie in my opinion. I thought the younger Will Smith looked good even though on some scenes it looked blatantly CGI. I know they're working on this new de-aging technology and can only imagine what the future will look like. Perhaps it'll look completely lifelike and we won't be able to tell the difference. That's crazy!The movie was good and had some fun characters. The only drawback for me, however, was the lack of depth in the story. I felt like the story was underwhelming at times and lacked proper development. It feels like Junior's turn to the good side was rushed and wasn't as dramatic as it could have been. Overall it's a fun watch and a good movie to watch. It's not bad by any accounts but could have been better in my opinion. I'd recommend it.",Gemini Man
515,lviniciusmiranda,Will Smith saves the movie,6,4 February 2020,"I love watching Will Smith and I will go watch almost everything he does.

Gemini Man will not win any awards, and it could've been better, but it's why you go to the movies. To be entertained.Will Smith and the supporting cast do excellent jobs, Ang Lee's direction is assured, and the young Will Smith? Maybe I don't see enough movies, but i thought that was seamlessly amazing! Unlike anything I've eve seen. It was if I was watching present day Will Smith do scenes with ""The Fresh Prince."" That's who he reminded me of, sans the wisecracking personality.Gemini Man is a movie that's never boring, has an excellent performance from the lead actor and some truly revolutionary ideas.

( Steven Seagal style :))), anyway boring story boring drama , nothing special, a 5 star movie , you got 7 for the special fighting effects ... and i don't know why imdb is saying that my review is to short so i have to tape some words here to pass my review.",Gemini Man
519,revboose-781-838014,"Nothing New, Sadly Predictable, But Could Be Worse",6,8 January 2020,"If you watch this movie with friends, try this game: first, read them the intro paragraph from a review, then give them a 5x5 grid, which they will then fill with action movie tropes, to be crossed off every time you see one on-screen. I guarantee there will be a few blackout cards by the end of the two hours, and everyone will have at least three bingos!I like Will Smith, and MEW, and Benedict Wong is always good for a chuckle, and they do the best they have with the material that they're given, but somehow it just doesn't quite get to the level I've come to expect from them. And nothing's a surprise. We already know Smith's angst over being an assassin; we know his clone will go through an existential crisis; we know Clive Owen will be a hardass. The fun is supposed to be in the ride, and it's missing here.The digital effects also suffer a bit, despite being done by WETA, the people who brought us The Lord of the Rings. Junior's face looks okay at some points, and at other points it's like watching a cutscene from a video game. There are other places where digital effects seem to be thrown in where a practical effect would have been much more meaningful.And yet, I wanted to watch it to the end. Once I'd figured out all the steps, all the things I was going to see, I wanted to see *how* my predictions played out.

1) The villain (Clive Owen, completely wasted). Nothing original there, nothing new in the characterization or portrayal. Think back to the original Robocop. Kurtwood Smith was a sleazy hitman, but he played it funny, insouciant, like a lark. That was new and fresh.
2) The effects were ZOMG bad, right out of Matrix 2 and how the Army of Neos looked like they were overtaxing a PC with a ten year old graphics card. Sheesh.Lead actors acquitted themselves well (Benedict Wong, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Will Smith).Diverting, but ultimately disappointing.",Gemini Man

527,Propagandist,Ang Lee did it again,7,23 February 2020,"In my eyes Ang Lee can't make a bad movie and this one is no exception!
Maybe I was easy bait, since I had seen the horrible Ad Astra some days before, and virtually anything was better than that, but also in hindsight I like it. I admit it had some minor plot holes, but the stunning visuals, the excellent work of the two leads and the fact that for the first time I saw a convincing digital character totally compensated that.
And yes, it is a fun movie with not much depth, but who cares? For me the greatest skill of this protruding director is his ability to create every movie nearly perfect in its own genre. He is as good in drama (""The Ice Storm"", ""Billy Lynn"", ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Eat Drink Man Woman""...) as in action (""Hulk"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Ride With The Devil""...) and comedy (""The Wedding Banquet"", ""Taking Woodstock"", ""Pushing Hands""...).

528,patrickcoyle-85837,Not Will Smith's best but a decent movie.,7,15 January 2020,"I'm guessing most of the hate is probably because this movie came out around the same time as Joker. Which by the way is a joke of a movie. Gemini Man is about Will Smith having a younger clone of himself trying to take him out because he wants to retire from the business of being an assassin/hitman. There's a little more to it but a simple plot. There's a good amount of action, acting is fine and effects are fine. People are complaining about CGI for this one but the effects are fine. Some of the action is unbelievable but then again.. it's a movie. Plus the clone is supposed to be a younger and better version. It's not as if the writers are making this try to seem like a realistic movie. Maybe if Will Smith spent most of the movie looking drugged up, with makeup and sitting around most of the time laughing and looking out of his mind then this would've had better reviews because Joker was definitely more ""cringe worthy""
Just watch this movie if you like action and enjoy Will Smith. It's not one to go out and buy on 4K for 30 bucks but worth a rental or owning if you get it on a good sale.",Gemini Man
529,bwkolbuck,Why did I see this movie?,5,25 October 2019,"So apparently the director of this movie, Ang Li, is known for his technological achievements in film. He directed Life of Pie. I'll get into the ""technological achievements"" in a second but I want to address the story behind this film. So in 1995 This movie was supposed to star Nicolas Cage and it had a different director. People kept coming in and dropping out of the project. They rotated through actors, producers, writers, directors you name it!I will continue this conversation when we get into the bad things. But their are good things in this movie, it's just that the badness shines through. First of all the movie looks nice in terms of color and contrast. When Junior (young Will Smith) is in the shadows and darkness he actually looks like Will Smith from the 90's. Will Smith also does a convincing performance as Junior, he sounds like how he did. The shootouts and action scenes have good choreography and sound mixing. The Cinematography ranges from pretty good to ok. And all the lead characters have a dynamic... it's a weak one, but it's there.Now the bad stuff: The script is D class, Rampage, Skyscraper, Venom levels bad. ESPECIALLY the dialogue. Characters just tell us things that we don't see, we just believe it because Will Smith said so, or they tell us something really cool that happened off screen. Kinda like the (dare I say it) STAR WARS prequels, when Obi Wan and Anakin have no chemistry so Lucas just maid them tell us that they're friends. Like when they're in the elevator, and they're like: Remember the time when you saved me, remember the time we did that thing, BLaH bLah BlAh bLaH bLAh BlaH. That happens a lot in this movie. If you were a talented writer you would let us figure it out. There are also lots of plot holes, wooden acting when Will Smith is Henry (old Will Smith) and from the lady and Wong from Doctor Strange when he doesn't say anything funny. Also when CGI Will Smith is out in the daytime you can see the imperfections on his face. Especially when his lip moves in the daytime, it looks really bad.SPOILERS I guess it isn't that but still. Henry (old Will Smith) says he's deathly allergic to bee venom and he mentions it like 4 times, and it's so obvious that the bee venom will come in later and when Henry is injected with bee venom his friends cure him of it instantly. Henry gives a long monologue to Junior about how he feels, like, you don't know how he feels, you know his physical traits not his mental state. Wong didn't have to die and the last scene of the movie is trash.Gemini Man had some cool, some terrible writing and in the end the good and bad break even which means you've got yourself a 5/10. It did nothing to raise or lower my view of the movie. I also never believed Will Smith as ""Henry"" I just saw Will Smith showing up for a paycheck. Look forward to my review for: The Untouchables. Shortly after there will be some Spooky Reviews coming soon, including but not limited to: Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween (1978) Scream 1, 2 and 3 and The Shining. Possibly even reviews of Friday the 13th parts 1-4 if I have the time.",Gemini Man

531,pencritical,Tired of reading reviews written by GOT season 8 haters,8,25 June 2020,"First off, yes, I agree GOT season 8 sucked. Badly. You can blame it all one one guy or not, but frankly if all of you hate the guy so much why watch this movie? Or did you, actually? Seems more like all the DB haters are just here to pile on more hate and frankly I quit reading any review that mentions him.Two, you haters are all jaded pieces of crap that have forgotten the joy of just watching a movie for special effects I mean why else would anyone watch Star Wars or its ilk. This movie is amazing just for the realistic younger version of Will..True that it is never going to win any awards for movie script/plot or acting, but just think how far special effects have come. Blows my mind almost as much as Avatar did - just because we can make something like it. Perhaps it's because I was brought up in a world where Gilligan's Island was not reruns, but I think it's pretty sad that my 60 year old self is less jaded than you 20-30 somethings..So my review is this, it was an enjoyable, but typical action movie long on action, short on plot. When are they not? But it is a movie that should be watched and appreciated for what is great about it. A decade ago no one could have made this and even if it isn't perfect, keeping in mind the reality that there is no young Will Smith, but effects played over another actor, I think it was a great watch. TTake a chill pill and enjoy the movie. If you want to watch Les Miz, then go. This isn't that and I've never seen an action movie that was. They are all just like this..Then again, I'll always have soft spot for the loveable Fresh Prince. .",Gemini Man

This isnt either of them, this film has good action scenes and some pretty wild special effects in places.But it also has very cookie-cutter action and some very rubbery looking special effects similar to Ang Lee's hulk movie.Will Smith is perfectly serviceable as the title character but doesn't get many moments to really be Will Smith.The co-stars are all doing an ok job though none truly stand out or are memorable.Clive Owen is the oddest character in it, trying to do some sort of American accent at times and then other times sounding like he dubbed over his own lines at a later date...Either way, if you want a fun action popcorn flick then go watch it, just dont expect it to be one worth seeing again.",Gemini Man

544,ceejay-13178,It's a Will Smith Movie!!,5,19 September 2020,"This is my first ever review and it's ironic that out of all the inspirational, great, scary, mediocre, abysmal and just plain old why?? movies I've watched...it was this one.Let's be honest, I'm not a WS fan, his earlier movies may have had one or two half decent attempts and he's probably a nice guy, but I'm just not a fan, could be the hype machine around him and his earlier ""I'm Will Smith"" persona. But, as the years have gone on and he's aged, I'm finding myself tolerating him, to the point of not minding his movies. Out of them all, I do prefer the action type...like this one, because he's not a bad action ""Hero"" and give me WS over Bruce Willis any day, at least there's some credibility with this guy and no I'm not going to dish out the hate, perhaps in my maturing days I'm finding him more agreeable as time goes on...maybe.Anyways, for those that think this is a 90's movie, guess what? You're right, because the script has been doing the rounds for a considerable time, but when it was written the technology just wasn't there to make the hero appear young...until now. In fairness, the deaging of WS is well done and I did find myself pausing and scrutinising the effects, which was a bit distracting, but if Ian Mckellen, Patrick Stewart, Lloyd Bridges, Carrie Fisher etc can be successfully (if not creepily) deaged, then so can WS and it works well, as he hasn't aged too badly for this process to look too weird.As for the movie, it's a by the numbers ""Classic"" (90's) action movie, given the present day treatment and as you can expect it's no brain teaser, but what did you expect? Scripting is a bit clunky and the set pieces are well choreographed, with the motorbike chase scene raising a chuckle at it's silliness.The story....well, Will Smith has become an enemy of the state (yes, intended) and has to be taken out.......by himself. That's it, no need for any spoilers because if you've seen the trailer, then you know exactly how this movie will go minute by minute, but you knew this, didn't you?This movie delivers eactly as you'd expect, silly story, excuses to play with guns, any reason to cause explosions and some fist fights, standard fare. It's fun and makes its 2 hour run time pass quite quickly, I didn't yawn once or play my mobile game, so that's a positive sign. This is why it got a generous 5/10 for me, because I wasn't disappointed and it seemed like a perfect WS vehicle, a middle of the road score, for a middle of the road movie.Grab some popcorn. get a few mates around or your better half, switch your brains off, forget about the outside world for a couple of hours and you've got a decent night in. Oh and apart from the excruciating closing few minutes, I actually enjoyed the performance of WS and am not ashamed to air this publicly.For whatever reason I just cannot hate the guy...he is after all.......Will Smith!!",Gemini Man

553,wire_,Gemini Man (2019),1,19 October 2019,"This is daytime TV of sci-fi action cinema. Chinese business influence is evident in total lack of any cultural dimension of the product beyond the simple boy-girl agent buddy story and a clone's daddy issues. There are no ideas, no plot, no intrigue. Of course critics hated it; it defies criticism; too dumb.So why are audiences split with the critics?Audiences who are not aware of the use of their own eyes, and who from a young age have been conditioned by advertising and FPS vid games will grok the visual language of the action, the impossible camera, and base emotional gambits, and may not miss a story. This is a product to be Seen. Every cinematic concern outside of visual immersion is a distant second; not only second, but everything else goes totally unconsidered.The use of CGI and HFR 3D makes its entire world into an uncanny valley. Like 60s Viewmaster travel discs. The color grading is midday BRIGHT even at night, in sense of worst excesses of HDR. There is no mood of the light. ""It's like looking through a window!"" At something totally fake.Good news is that the 3D looks deep, and there is some visual flair such as underwater, and for the motorcycle chase ghost ride. While 3D is used for certain effects, the people doing the photography clearly do not yet comprehend power of the medium and second guess it by using 2D gimmicks such as depth-of-field / rack-focus to push your eye in the frame, and heavy-handed closeups. This is a movie that has been visually compressed to sell in 3D and standard, IMAX, TV, laptop, airplane and phone.This experiment in the future of storytelling-which is to skip storytelling for simulation-hits two beats. First, it's got something that seems a lot like action, if you can overlook none of the stunts you see, no matter how literal anything looks, actually happened anywhere but on a computer screen. And second, it's got a bit of buddy chemistry between Smith and the Scott Pilgrim chick.OTOH Will Smith youngified back into the Fresh Prince shedding big cyborg tears at the hostility and betrayal of his adoptive, manipulative, clone-war-managing white-supremacist dad may pluck at your heart strings, but it left me cold as ice.The one gambit the story has to generate excitement is that the two Smiths think so much alike they outsmart themselves. But for some reason this goes totally unexplored. Generally the circumstances of this movie are so arbitrary and outlandish it totally fails to develop any sense of place or time. Every element of this movie is pure device. Think Bay's Transformers.There are a couple of lame stabs at sex appeal where Smith tried to flirt with his sidekick but this only serves to establish the relationship is platonic. Will there be sexiness between her and Fresh Prince? He has her take her clothes off in an encounter so pointless and tame it doesn't even rise to level of T&A. Fresh Prince is operating at the level of a 10 y.o. so nothing is gonna develop there. Scott Pilgrim's GF could've been written into a mother figure for Junior and it would've fit this plot.As to locales, settings: High marks for reprising Rambo First Blood small-town hardware store set for showdown.Movies seem to be a dying medium.",Gemini Man

556,Slackshank,Not far from Asylum,2,24 February 2020,"This movie has a plot that has no intellectual tip.
The scenes and dialogue is similar to the ideas and own games I used to play as a child. This said, the movie seems like it's from 8-12-years-old boys script.There is no good idea for the cloning and basically why bother cloning a guy to replace the previous guy. This kind of idea has been shown way too many times in entertainment.And the CGI, I won't get into details but for most of the fast paced scenes it is visible to the naked eye that motion and detailing of CGI is very unappealing.Overall is very close to Asylum productions, but bigger budget and good cast (whom cannot save the movie, but deserves the 2 stars for their involvement).",Gemini Man
557,zlfh4,"Will Smith, need I say more?",7,7 November 2019,"While this is certainly not the best Will Smith action thriller I have ever seen, it's certainly not the worst. The plot was more interesting than Wild, Wild, West but not as good as Men In Black and Independence Day.",Gemini Man
558,nickjo1998,So that's it huh? I'm some kind of Gemini Man?,7,1 October 2019,"I was lucky enough to be invited to a premiere screening of the film, in 60fps and in 3D (been a while since I've seen a film in 3D, and the framerate was distracting in very few scenes).It's a technical feat. Young Will Smith is probably the best looking CGI de-aging effect I've seen in a film (until the last scene).
The cinematography was also really well-done, there are some interesting shots, especially one panoramic shot of a train whizzing by. And shots hold for much longer than the typical action film, often showing impressive long-take shots.
The action is tense, with hard-hitting fight choregoraphy, as opposed to the ""cut away"" style many modern action films go with.
Will Smith, both young and old, delivers a very good performance as assassins struggling with their identity & place in the world, albeit in very different circumstances.
The plot takes a bit to kick in to full gear, but once it gets rolling, it's a thrilling ride some minor speed bumps.All in all, a solid Hollywood action film, it's no masterpiece, but very enjoyable.",Gemini Man

The plot was not overly out there and the characters were believable.",Gemini Man
560,superruser-lr,"Interesting concept, not-so-good execution",4,7 December 2019,"The idea that Gemini Man showed us is great: an action/thriller/sci-fi flick about a hitman hunted by his clone offers a great potential story-wise and character-wise... but it is lightly executed here. There where some sequences that are exploring the protagonist, but the story doesn't want to go further than that. The antagonist is not interesting at all. What a shame.On the action side of things, though, Gemini Man didn't disappoint. The shooting sequences of the film are well crafted and visually clear, and pretty cool to look at, especially when, at the third act, a character continues to shoot on the floor while another character gives some help, that's some badass scene here. Also the first moment when Brogan took the motocross in Cartagena... the camera work is magnificent. Although I didn't saw this film in the 120fps-3D theaters because there are simply no such equipment here.The VFX team did a great effort trying to make Will Smith as a younger version of himself realistic... well it works when the lighting is dimmed a bit... but when it is outside... oush. I mean the details on the skins are very good, but the movements of his lips when he talks are not that great. I think this is the last frontier to finally have a convincing de-aging. But again, shout out to the VFX sorcerers of Weta to always pushing the boundaries.At the end of the day, Gemini Man , because of it's poor execution of his concept, make it a disappointingly basic thriller movie. But it is somewhat enjoyable to watch thanks to his well made action sequences.Gemini Man's rating: 4.5/10",Gemini Man

Well the HFR 3D was okay, but goddamn the other reviews were true, too many bad, unnecessary dialogue, predictable, story-line was bland. Just wasn't good enough compared to previous works of Ang Lee, it felt completely boring other than just CGIs and 3D effect and the clear motion of the HFR that kept me awake.

566,Akaanksh,Another Mediocre Action Flick,5,12 October 2019,"Boring, lazy and unimaginative is how one would describe the new Will Smith starrer 'Gemini Man'. While the director Ang Lee, known famously for critically acclaimed films like 'Life of Pi', maintains his skill with the camera, the screenplay lacks the punch his other works had and makes it look like a mindless action flick.The film has a horrendous amount of plot-holes and forced character motivations. The plot revolves around a conspiracy called the 'Gemini' that clones people and 'edits' their clones to make them a perfect version of the original person. This entire plot detail, which forms the main crux of the story, is introduced too late in the movie leaving the entire first act nothing but agents getting assassinated while the lead characters escape from it. Even the actual villain of the story was nothing more than another generic villain whom the writers tried to make complex in vain.The story could have been a lot better if they focused more on the conspiracy and less on blasting cars or fighting with the front wheel of a bike.As for the acting, Will Smith is charming as ever and does whatever he can with a shallow character he was given. Benedict Wong, though was in short parts, was at his usual best.Unless you want to watch some mindless action, it is better to save time and money on this one.",Gemini Man

He must have been fairly desperate to take this film on. However, I am a fan and he did an ok job albeit a little woody in places. As the first time seeing a doppelgänger based movie using cgi, I have to say I was impressed. It did seem fluid in places yet silly and computer-game-like In others. But in time I'm sure this technology will be nailed. I still can't see a better job being done then Tom Hardy in Legend tho.The plot was extremely transparent. There's nothing surprising at all. There's not really any kind of twists to keep us interested. You can spend the 2 hours munching popcorn and knowing exactly what u already know about the movie before you see it. It should have been darker and less predictable but I guess they spent the budget on the technology rather then the writing!That said, it's enjoyable. It's a film you'll prob be glad you got round to see although not groundbreaking. But to see the Fresh Prince's face again does bring back some great memories. I think Will is the only reason this film gained the notoriety. In fact it would work with any a-lister imo. But I think he needs to choose his next role more wisely or retire himself.",Gemini Man

Lighting and visual textural smoothness degrades this ""movie"" to video game status. If you've ever played or seen FPS's or other action franchises like Call of Duty, Hitman, Battlefield, Assassins Creed, or Grand Theft Auto, this looks like a live action cutscene in the vein of those games. The camera angles and movements are game-like, leaving you feeling pumped to get your hands and the controller and mess some dudes up. Be prepared to mash B!The cast was chosen hilariously. Good guys are tried and tested likeable actors (Smith, Winstead, Wong) and bad guys (Owen/Edmond) are blooper level dead pan tropes of bad guys. This is an ""action"" bleeding heart tough guy movie, but it doesn't do that well either. Almost all action sequences are very unnatural CGI, with a little actual live action elements.Plot: ... I would say is not believable. Doesn't appear to have much forethought or depth. Most of the characters don't feel like they have a past.

I guess they thought they'd avoid any sort of John Wick or Shooter type set up and go with the utterly implausible. Don't know why they didn't go a little extra, have him blindfolded and spin around as he pulled the trigger, could of had a couple of seconds of bullet time watching the round curve around and hit the target Wanted-style.So I suspended my disbelief and continued to watch, Amazingly our 'hero' never picks up another sniper rifle and all but looses this ability to make impossible shots. The plot is paper thin and the characters are frankly cardboard cut-outs. For these action film-types you don't usually care yet the story tries to force you to care. All in all, it's extremely predictable.The effects are well done but in parts it feels like a modern Steven Seagal movie, where he'd gotten too old and eaten too many pies so they had to do camera trickery and speed up film. Here there are some decent action scenes but they feel very CGI generated in places. The Young Will Smith face is 98% there, some times you see him and you can tell it's not quite right. That's not what ruins half the action scenes though, it's the CGI instead of real stunts stuff that wrecks it because some parts of it wouldn't be out of place in a Spiderman movie.In Conclusion:
Sadly nothing special is brought to the table, the whole Young Will Smith thing does nothing and could have been achieved with a younger actor regardless of all the CGI like say... Looper.

I don't know what happened here.. Why did Ang Lee take this project on.. perhaps He should bare some responsibility for this mess. I guess a paycheck is a Paycheck.
Why did Will Smith do this project.. Same perhaps. Maybe the machine thats Hollywood should stop insulting the viewers intelligence. I have no idea how this faired at the Box Office... Im sure it was very expensive to make .. But why ..
JUST WHY...",Gemini Man

619,kalixtshawxo,Fire the weapons.,5,11 October 2019,"Major spoilers. But first off let me say this kind of movie is what makes liberals hate guns.... not John Wick which is grounded in close to reality gun use.
So first spoiler and why i just said what i said. (This movie btw is set ""now"".)You cannot, CANNOT, shoot at a train over 2 kilometers away on an angled course of travel towards you at SEVERAL HUNDRED kilometers per hour with a medium caliber rifle (Looked like a 308win) and hit the deaired target in the head. I dont care what math yiu do and how much you spin the turrets on the scope. Especially not by getting an aim at the tatgrt, then suddenly changing aim to some point ahead of the train and shooting there, to which then the train travela into the path of the bullet hitting the desired target several cars back, through the glass nonetheless.
This was the opening scene to set up how good our hero is.Moving on, tactics, why does the super assassin hunting our hero get on the roof of the place the hero is in? Since the super assassin we already know is a clone from the trailers, why didnt he just snipe hero from 1/2 mile away? Cause the movie would be over.
Also, in general poor weapons handling from most of the actors.Clive Owen as the main antagonist bad guy, ends up coming across in the end like a bad Bond villain.... what a waste.Several scenes wrre just beyond belief ... i know some suspension of belief is needed in a movie, but hey i let the cloning go through, the more 'real' stuff not being real bothered me.
Most all the CGI was actually pretty good for 3/4 of the movie. until the super duprr assassin.
But when we got to the super duper assassin part.... it was like Blade II CGI fight scenes, and the super duper assassin was so easily ended by the super assassin and our hero now teamed up. Even though he had body armor that the 30 guys that just got killed wished thry had, the whole use of him (hinted at eatlier in the film) was anti-climactic. And the fire CGI scene was horrible. Next time just light a stuntman on fite.I could go on and on, i had such high hopes for this movie.",Gemini Man

The difference being I think Alita wasn't supposed to look human, going Will Smith was. Perhaps all the blame can't being to Ang Lee but it was him who directed the equally awful CGI Hulk effort...

Really? The labs would stop working and the scientists in charge would magically disappear, the clone would eventually go to college, the girl is safe and the MC would get to walk around in broad daylight like nothing is wrong

But it's the bad CGI that makes it hard to enjoy this movie. Everytime we see the young version of Will Smith, it feels like you are watching a PlayStation 5 cutscene. Yes, PlayStation 5.. because it's better than PS4 graphics but not even close to the real thing. The movement of his mouth, the over dramatic look in his eyes and the light reflecting on his skin.. it's just not good enough to forget that you are watching a computer generated person. It just feels off. I wasn't too crazy about the SFX stunts and fights either. Even the director seems confused by all this unwanted distraction and makes some questionable decisions: zooming in on a character's face without any particular reason or dismissing the 180 degree rule (that's a real thing, look it up!). And last but not least: how great of an actor Will Smith may be (twice!), this movie lacks star power. Emma Stone, Emily Blunt or Jennifer Lawrence could've spiced this whole flick up a little.

I went in to the move teather with my friend to see this movie with my mind open and high hope that it will be good movie and for Will Smith. I was blindsided by YouTube trailer and I thought it would be a surprisngly a good movie but no! I hate this movie I hate it! Ang Lee sucks Hulk sucked and Gemini Man sucks! I fall a sleep during this movie, it is boring and the acting sucks! Will Smith totally let me down! The story is terrible, the action is dated CGI. Most of the stunts Will Smith dosen't do it him self. I hate this movie! Give me my money back! I pay for the ticket and it was a let down! How is this movie great? 7 or 10? I give it 1!I hate the emotional love between Will Smith and his clone they were gay! Smith's younger clone wasn't Will Smith it was some dude in CGI face an his voiced was dubbed by someone else. I really hoped that Henry Brogan idiot he is will fight with his clone but no he fall in love with him! When you see a motorcycle chase between Brogan and Junior that wasn't Will Smith driving the motorcycle him self it was a stunt double! Smith is a huge disappointment! He can't act, he can't make his own stunts! Will Smith played an assassin, he is too nice to play an assassin he failed to convince me. Will Smith is no Keanu Reeves! Will Smith is not John Wick! Smith and Winstead acting like John Wick and they are not John Wick! The motorcyce chases in Knight and Day (2010) Tom Cruise flick in that movie Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz both real performed motorcycle chase they werent stunt doubles they real drive motorcycle. But Will Smith dosen't know how to drive a motorcycle or doing his own stunts! In The Bourne Legacy (2012) Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz both drive a motorcycle during chase and they did not use stunt doubles it was for real. Will Smith must use a stunt double you can see that is not Smith driving a motorcycle you can see his face!!!! Camera did show me a face it was not SMITH!Mary Elizabeth Winstead is sucha sell out for this movie. She was in Final Destination 3 and I like that film. She was in Live Free or Die Hard and I love that film to death! I hate A Good to Die Hard she was in but those two movies I like!The story: It was an spy sci-fi thriller in which Henry Brogan becomes a rogue government agent that becomes a hunted by a death squad and for a video game he shots them with one shot. This movie is a sell out garbage! Garbage! Smith has now a girlfriend helping him out and a Chinese guy. Couldn't Will Smith be an one man army? Why not? Lame!Have you hear or see The Bourne Identity franchise? The Bourne trilogy are the real spy movies not ""Gemini Man"" even with PG-13 they are much better believable movies! My favorite is The Bourne Supremacy (2004) because in that movie Matt Damon is one man army been hunted by death squad. My second would The Bourne Identity than The Bourne Ultimatum. His gf was killed in Supremacy and he was on the run alone. Have you hear about XIII: The Conspiracy (2008)? MILES way two part better movie!!! It was mini series but a lot of better it had tons of action and Stephen Dorff acted believable in that movie, he acted like a real asssassin. Will Smith did not act like a real assassin he was a troll in this movie. This role was not for him! Will Smith you bleeeewit! You Blew It Will Smith!What happened to that lab they make clones in this movie? They did not show us that! I have not seen any lab in this movie! Why making Clones about Will Smith and let them to kill eacother but on the end they don't kill eacother they become allies! I went in a movie teather back in 2000 when I was a 16 year old teen to see The 6th Day with Arnold Schwarzenegger in a movie teater. That movie was MILES way better than Gemini Man and that get's crap on it and it is futuristic sci-fi action movie entertaning about clones and I like that film a lot! This movie isn't futuristic sci-fi action movie! Than on the end we got Smith's clone shooting on Smith and his gf Winstead and that was a lousy CGI effect! That wasn't a real machine gun it was CGI! Watch Dreed (2012) that movie was a bad-ass and get's crap on it, but Gemini Man is great? In my opinion it sucks!I loved Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air I love his sit com show, he acted fantastic on that movie. Bad Boys (1995) was my favorite buddy cop action movie from Will Smith and Michael Bay I loved that film so much even today I love that film. My mom bought me a VHS and I still have it and on Blu-ray disc. I went to see Bad Boys II (2003) in movie teather such a big fan of the first movie i was and it was great experience and great fun to see that movie. That is why I went to see this movie only for Will Smith, because I wanted to see his second movie in movie teater and he let me down! I want my money back Will Smith! I, Robot (2004) destroys this movie to pieces! Will Smith did already a futuristic sci-fi action movie and it was great and it is called I, Robot! You know WIll Smith did not need to make this movie.This movie was a movie major flop Thank God! They lost $75.000.000. The audiance and movie critics were disappointed and so was I! I know no one is going to read my review and give me votes down but you know I have not review a movie since January I come only one here because I care!Another thing that is bothering me is this: Why is Will Smith Junior crying and whinning trough whole movie when he finds out that his step dad lied to him? He was an assassin why didn't he go after and kill his step dad? Why emotion in this movie? I did not care! Ang Lee you blow it! Just like you blow it with The Hulk (2003)!I hate this movie, I hate it! I went to see this movie with an open mind and I was disppointed with CGI crap and Will Smith acting like a gay and winning and crying! Gemini Man sucks it is uter garbage!The Bourne Trilogy are better movies, The Bourne Legacy is a better movie, XIII: The Conspiracy is MILES way better two part movie, Dredd (2012) is a better movie, The 6th Day is a MILES way better movie. Bad Boys I and II are better movie, I, Robot is a bad-ass movie!! Gemini Man isn't! Will Smith retire your making Bad Boys for LIfe next year and that movie will suck! Because Bad Boys II was made back in 2003 it is 17 years too late. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are too late and far too old for making another sequel. Bad Boys II end it perfectly the movie. So why making a third sequel when it is going to be a let down? Will Smith retire and leave Bad Boys movie alone!This is my movie review and Raging RANT on Gemini Man I hate this movie to death! I will never see it again. I will not buy the movie I am staying away from it! I was disppointed and my friend was also disappointed. This is atrocious utter crap garbage! Will Smith sold us a garbage, trash load of crap! Way to go Smith ruin your movie career!",Gemini Man

646,digitalchet,Predictable & flawed but not unenjoyable,7,7 December 2019,"While it's not as bad as the ""professional critics"" seem to make out, Gemini Man is somewhat flawed.
Sure, you won't find clever or surprising high-concept sci-fi here, nor truly deep and engaging characters, and the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired. There are moments where you wonder what happened to real-world physics, and scenes where the visual effects fall just slightly short enough to pull you out of the moment.
But despite all of that, Ang Lee, as only he can, once again delivers fast-paced action, striking visuals, and innovative tech to bring his vision to life.
Will Smith does a great job of making the deaging technology believable. His portrayal of his character's younger selves is fantastic and while the technology may fall slightly short in some scenes, you can definitely see the potential. This is no run-of-the-mill deep-fake.Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the HFR, but I understand why Lee opted for it. I just feel it takes away that certain cinematographic quality.Still, it's worth the watch if you've nothing else to watch on a Friday night.",Gemini Man

If you've seen I Am Legend, the CGI kind of looks like that, which isn't great as that film came out at least 11 years ago. All-in-all, I'd recommend this film.

679,SpencerPEvans,Clone Consensus,3,5 November 2019,"I'm sorry, I tried my HARDEST to enjoy this movie, but I couldn't. Long story short, the first half was dumb, slow and boring, and the second half was dumb, blurry and infuriating.Despite how much I'll rip it to shreds, the ONLY reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of just 1, is the technology to duplicate Will Smith. I have to admit, it's actually kind of amazing. But, Will Smith's performance is looking a lot like his After Earth performance... so it doesn't hold well in that area. AND SO MANY of the characters are invisible. Really, the closest I can get is an assassin who doesn't want to kill anymore - not really, but still - and that's it!The advertising and the name already suggest that the movie is about a man fighting his clone, but the movie spends FOREVER trying to build it up! Seriously, even when Junior (Will Smith's clone) does show up, the main characters take FOREVER trying to realize he's a clone!To make things worse, the characters act WAY TOO NONCHALANT to the action all throughout the movie. I get Will Smith, since he was a former assassin, but even when his partner - who has NO fighting experience, mind you - gets kidnapped and held hostage as bait to attract Will Smith's character (notice that I'm not saying his name, since I forgot it already), but she doesn't bat an eyelash.Plus, the fact that Gemini, the corporation that cloned him, is trying to kill the original is completely unknown as to why. What's worse is that they send JUNIOR to go after him! Why the heck would you send a clone who doesn't know he is a clone after the originator of the clone?!! That's bound to get an existential crisis! And his relationship with his handler is INFURIATING! I mean, Junior's ""father"" had already tried to kill him twice, but at the end he hesitates to do so. In fact, ALL THE CHARACTERS, feel the need to hesitate. And WILL SMITH'S character decided to tell Junior NOT to kill him because he'll get what he calls ""ghosts"". Sorry, he's a blank slate and his handler already tried to kill him, I think it's okay. Sure, Will Smith decided to shoot his handler for Junior, but does that REALLY help?And if that wasn't infuriating enough, the dialogue is AWFUL! It's like the writer had such a limited vocabulary, but he thought that ""ghosts"" - for instance - was a such a good mark of poetry, so he spread that throughout the movie a lot. Really, if you watch the movie, you'll see what I mean!Honestly, to me, this felt more like ""Us"" under the skin of ""After Earth"" and that should NOT be made.",Gemini Man
680,i_hussain_pk,Action packed thriller,8,14 October 2019,"I had very low expectations from this film since the reviews have been pretty bad including the rating on IMDB which i usually check out before deciding to see a movie. However the Ang Lee-Will Smith combination was enough to overcome any doubts and I am glad I watched this movie since I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it since it has some amazing action scenes including a edge of the pants motorcycle chase.
The acting is first rate all round especially from Will Smith who has to do double duty as an experienced pro battling his fitter, stronger, younger self. How does the deadly rivalry turn out? Well, that's the suspense bit which viewers have to find out for themselves. All I can say the digital recreation of the younger Smith is outright brilliant especially with the changing facial expressions reflecting the younger Smith character's journey of self-discovery.
There's a philosophical riff about human cloning and what it means to be a human being with chilling implications for the future of warfare as expressed by the Clive Owen character ( a very impressive performance by Owen albeit a brief one).
The plot is simple to follow which to me is a plus point. I enjoyed this movie more than I did the various superhero movies I saw in the last couple of years. But then I am part of an older demographic and likely not in tune with the tastes of younger people.",Gemini Man

683,ghostofchurch,Another Ang Lee Action CGI Mishap,5,22 July 2021,"While Ang Lee may be good at telling stories, he does not have a good track record with action movies. For me, the story is there. The plot seems fine.The problem lies with the horrible CGI. The shame is that they seem to have done a good job of putting a younger looking Will Smith on screen. Where issues come in is the intense action sequences.The action sequences could have been shot practically with stunt doubles or other movie magic with the trade off of a slightly less cool camera angle and still kept the movie immersive. The motion and movements of Will Smith's characters are so close to looking correct, but just that little degree of being off instantly breaks immersion for me when they doesn't feel like human movements.Because this is an action movie and the action is where my biggest problems are, it drops my score from a 9 and possibly a 10, down at least 4 stars. I score strictly along the lines of enjoying a movie for what it's meant to be. If you're able to not be bothered by the CGI action I think you'll really enjoy the film.",Gemini Man
684,eniac-11,Ok for an average action movie,7,8 March 2021,"The CGI ruined a lot. Sometimes it really looked awful and I kept feeling like the movement of the person and head rotation etc had been limited to make the deepfake easier. It just made scenes very artificial to look at with constrained movement.But action scenes where his face wasn't visible (sunglasses, cap etc) was quite good. I feel like it would have been much better just using a person that looked like Will and making the story that part of his DNA was used or something like that.Either deepfake isn't developed enough for movies yet or they just didn't put enough resources into it making it, which is a shame.",Gemini Man

Not much twists but has good humanity message as we need it. 7/10 is a fair score! would love to watch Gemini Man again!",Gemini Man
686,mskelly-4,An okay thriller,5,9 October 2019,"Gemini Man is being billed as an action movie. That's not really a surprise, it's pretty much what I would expect to see coming from a Will Smith movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. However, if Gemini Man is anything, it's actually a thriller. That's not to say that there isn't action in the film, you're never more aware that this is a Bruckheimer film then during a gun fight being held in the middle of a dirtbike chase through the streets of Columbia. There are plenty of fisticuffs and guns in the movie, but there's a lot more silencers than I'm used to in a Bruckheimer flick. It's kind of a thriller through that prism.Will Smith faces-off with a younger clone of himself on the eve of his retirement. It's a simple premise, but built up with a great deal more intrigue and espionage surrounding it. Smith himself is an odd choice for this role, he's one of those actors, much like Tom Cruise or Johnny Depp who don't visibly age. It would have made more sense with Clint Eastwood, who the script was originally written for in the 90's. The real trick in this film is not so much trying to make Smith look young (with de-aging CGI), but rather trying to make him look older. Either they've added some gray or he's stopped dying his hair. Either way there is a concerted effort to create a salt and pepper tone to his head and beard, as well as some extra ageing added through the contouring of his make up. Nevertheless, the age difference remains a great deal more subtle then I prefer for this type of film. Even more disconcerting is the young clone. While convincing, there's something not right about it - especially to of us who grew up watching the fresh Prince of Bel-Air and know what Will Smith looked like at this age... something is a bit off, though I doubt it will really throw off younger viewers.Smith is still playing to type here, albeit an older and slightly more cynical version of himself. It's much the same character that we saw him play in Suicide Squad. Benedict Wong is an excellent supporting cast, perfect when we need comic relief and reliable when we need back up. I'm most impressed though, with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. My main exposure to her is of course, Scott Pilgrim Versus the World, and that's a bit of a problem. I absolutely hate the character of Ramona Flowers and that's strange because in this film Winstead is so much more likeable. She elevates her performance and redeems herself from that role, giving us a competent female lead that is still likeable while being tough as nails. I kind of want to see more of Winstead now in other roles.The film doesn't really bother with a love story sub plot, it doesn't have time. It's self aware enough though to make it an issue - talking about how there are certain things you give up for the life of an assassin. It's a good way of addressing the elephant in the room without catering to it.If I have any real complaints it's the negative way in which fathers are portrayed- Of course the evil dude in charge of the clone isn't a real father, even if he says he is, but I always bristle when fatherhood is kind of trashed in this manner.Gemini Man is a good, fast paced, globetrotting thriller that will keep you engaged though you won't find too many surprises here. Even the twist towards the end can be seen coming a mile away.",Gemini Man

Now people are buying vinyl records again cuz analogue is just better. Anyway, we are a fickle people and tend to move on to venues with more substance including the movies we watch. (If you love movies, your favorites are probably older generation) I watched the trailer for ""Gemini Man"" , only slightly interested in buying a ticket to see it. Producers should realize by now, that not even the best special effects (CDG, 3-D, CGI) can replace good acting, a meaningful script and thoughtful directing.

We all suspend belief when we watch science fiction, but the chase scenes, particularly when the assailant moves across rooftops is too fast and looks like something from Super Mario-the bike chase scenes are a joke.The CGI to make Will Smiths clone appear younger is very patchy-in some scenes it is very good, in others he looked like a cartoon version-the technology is not there yet. Far worse were the shoot outs-it looked like a bad lazer quest on a friday night in the millennium falcon-one scene had so many red lines crossing it you could have knitted a jumper with it !-they were too cheap to use stock footage of a gulfstream jet and used bad CGI.The second ""clone"" appeared to be bulletproof, baton round proof, and fireproof.This is another well polished crap, please save your money and go and see Joker in 2d.",Gemini Man

With the inclusion of HFR aka High Frame Rate of the film, yes at many frames and still scenes the picture looks like fake CGI put into the frames with less amount of work in finishing. Perhaps the idea of Ang Lee was to build the cult love towards film for any action lover like me.

I have to say, I usually don't let armchair critics (let alone professionals), stop me from seeing something. I like to form my own opinions. However, I'm sad to say, this was an exception. I was really curious about this when I saw the first trailer, which was released while they were still shooting the film. Upon its release the bad reviews came out in droves, and it seemed like it plummeted in the box office so fast that it was available for streaming in no time. Still, I avoided it. I figured they can't all be that wrong. Look, its not the greatest role Smith has done, and again, some of the CGI gets wonky. But even shots of Carrie Fischer & Peter Cushing in Rogue One, and again with Hamill in The Mandalrean had that problem, and that's Star Wars for crying out loud. The writing isn't nearly as bad as what people make it out to be, and the story, although may not be the most original thing since The Matrix, isn't bad at all. It's a worthwhile action flick.

Fights are too cringeworthy and illogical, the propagation of events is fast. No development of the plot or the characters. There's a whole subspecialty in genetics called epigenetics dedicated to disproving every single point this movie is trying to make and this indicates major lazy writing. I don't really expect much of an action flick I just go watch for entertainment only; however, this movie even managed to ruin that. The puns at the end are so bad and cringe; the whole vibe is weird like the dialogue itself. Nothing make sense in a stupid sense of way.

719,onesixtyreviews,Film Review: Gemini Man Will Smith v Will Smith! What could go wrong?,6,11 October 2019,"I think I just watched the most video gamey movie of all time. I've seen movies with Super Mario, Pokémon and Creed bearing Assassins but Gemini Man reminded me more of that medium than any other film. Imagine if Naughty Dog were to make a 2hr game and then the only way for you to access the game was to watch Ang Lee play it on Twitch. Then imagine that the stream was in 3D, 4k resolution (my screening was unfortunately in 2k) at a consistent 120fps that never dropped.Technical innovation can often be scary when what once was ground breaking becomes tradition. I heard the horror stories of The Hobbit in 48fps which were said to resemble the presentation of a soap opera. I was planning to steer clear of this type of change but I had a change of heart after reading that Ang Lee was adamant that his piece of art be viewed only one way. My resolve to see the film as intended became even steelier when I heard that critics were being shown the film at 24fps or 60fps and wanted to see if it would truly make any difference.I'm so glad I sought out the technically advanced version because I am all turned around on the higher frame rate presentation. The movie looked so crisp and so clean. I was totally blown away by how good it looked and how combined with the 3D I was continuously drawn into every frame. I remember reflecting on Avatar after I saw it at the cinema and thinking that despite the generic plot it was such a thrilling experience that largely to the 3D. Gemini Man should be categorised the same way as Avatar as a sort of ""experiential"" genre.Plot wise Gemini Man is not all that strong. It doesn't quite reach the exciting heights of action adventures and it doesn't lean hard enough into science fiction to be a techno thriller. It does, however, avoid the clichés that many films fall into. There's no forced romance, there's real empathy and compassion shown by characters and the action isn't quick cutting ""we'll find it in the edit"" shlock. The film is also not as simple as Will Smith vs Will Smith as the marketing would have you believe.Will Smith is in his usual good form, playing himself but with some real overtones of sadness and empathy. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, in breaking with the norm, is a very competent female lead. I particularly like the choices that were made with her character and how she isn't turned into a stereotype or a damsel. Clive Owen has some layers to his character and it was nice to see him in a big film. Benedict Wong isn't quite as scene stealing as when he's with Doctor Strange but he is still very charming.The CGI is amazing but also still at a point where we're still staring into the uncanny valley. The bold choice to set a lot of the CG heavy scenes in the daylight ultimately comes back to bite the film. It's in the bright sunlight that the film really looks like a video game and this time that's not a compliment. The 20+ year wait for this movie was supposed to be because the technology was finally here to bring this concept to the screen but it still feels like we're a little bit away from that being the case.To go back to my comparisons at the start of the review this film feels a lot like a video game. And you know what? It probably would have been a lot better if it had been. This story is being told in the wrong medium and I wish that blockbuster films still had video game tie-ins because I would play the hell out of it.Ultimately the film is not essential viewing but it was enjoyable nonetheless:3/5 Stars",Gemini Man
720,smithdana-26441,Breathtaking effects for mediocre story,6,8 October 2019,"The times seem to be long over when Will Smith was at his best. But the material that director Ang Lee provides his star with is a flat story that has been seen before in way better shape, eg. Looper, and does it not do justice to Smith's still quite impressive star power. The dialogue is flat and interactions between actors seem forced. Wooden performances round the picture of a forgettable film. However, the technical aspect is impressive. Smith's younger version sometimes looks like a video game version, but mostly believable. But the real star of the film is the 3d extra high frame rate of 120fps. Unfortunately it gives the film a documentary-style look, but all in all this technique takes 3d to a new level and somewhat justifies the ticket price.",Gemini Man

This is a visually artful, cinematically sublime innovative script! The movie is awe-inspiring, technically advanced and an enjoyable creative force. It initiates a realization that having the self-awareness of who you are, is as critical as knowing who and what you are to others Introspectively speaking, if you could turn back the hands of time, would you? What would you change? A story about second chances trickles through this film. If you can see this movie in 3D HFR it's well worth it.",Gemini Man

A lot of cliché so what?,7,30 September 2020,"I don't get those who rated it like super low - this is certainly an enjoyable movie, albeit a lot of cliché like the old days but the acting is top notch. Story is non-existent but hey it's an action fiction title, not your summer night melancholy with a twist.Both protagonists are enjoyable with the main villain a bit too flat - your typical villain (even the face matches that) and the second clone was a joke - he's pretty good at loop kicks and parkour I give you that.All in all it's quite enjoyable, I certain won't watch it twice but having watched it on amazon prime video I think it deserves a solid 7.",Gemini Man
725,xxxjamxxx,DO NOT LISTEN TO NEGATIVE REVIEWS!,10,23 November 2019,I almost didn't watch this after the low rating and negative reviews but I'm sure glad I did. It is everything you expect of a Will Smith film and I was thrilled the whole way through it. My only guess for the low reviews on IMDB is the game of thrones fans who felt let down by the season finale by writer David Benioff. In all honesty I was let down by it too but to troll his work afterwards is pretty low. This film is unique and the young Will Smith is something I've never seen in a film before. This film should be at least a 7 on IMDB hence why I'm rating a 10 to offset the negative reviews.,Gemini Man
726,ohio937,Quite Enjoyable!,7,24 May 2020,Decided to watch even after reading all the negative reviews... We figured we're going to like or not... We're glad we watched. Quite good!

Is there anything that approaches high art in Gemini Man? Nope, not even close (some of the CGI was excellent some not so much). Did Will and Mary do their jobs well? Yes, and sometimes it was a lot of fun to watch (so glad there was no romance }not a spoiler for anything}, it would not have fit the premise).The big question; did I enjoy myself and have fun? Yes! I will even watch it again in a year of so when it streams somewhere. Not every movie is going to be the best on earth, so stop expecting anything that comes down the pipe to set the world on fire.

I'm a very picky person I honestly don't have movies rated a 10, cause no movie or series is gon be perfect (unless it's the FRIENDS Series) lol. This movie has a good amount of action, good enough story line, and they did pretty descent job on the AI graphics. To be honest no one should give this movie less than a 6, if you do then sorry but you don't know much about movies.

The dialogue is a little bad lil 80s ish at times and the plot is gery basic causing the movie to feel empty and feel slow. Overall though an okay movie Will Smith does good but not perfect and the action good for the most part. Ending ends bad too me and expected a bigger and better finish. Also younger will/clone will looked passable except for the ending were he lookes horrible they might not have time to really work on him for that scene. Did not see the movie in 120 fps so cant say anything about it. Overall an okay movie, worth seeing once.",Gemini Man
733,sky-smarty,3D HFR: Is this the future of cinema?,5,11 October 2019,"I love most work of Will Smith since the Fresh Prince, serious!
But I had to fight the urge to leave the cinema from start: Inspite the 3D HFR it looked as flat as watching the average Netflix vehicle.How can they make a production on the big screen look worse than the average soap on a poorly adjusted TV set?
Was it too bright, was the contrast too low, was the digital sharpness too high? It is very hard to pin it down but I never saw this in cinema before.Ok, technical it was a disaster!
Scriptwise not too strong either but the second half it felt almost as a different movie.
Stunts were entertaining, weaponizing motorbikes Jacky Chan style is fun to see.Honestly I thought ""Bright"" was the worst Will Smith ever was involved with but this evening I learned this movie is a very poor experiment. And it's not about the poor script or actors performance. It is the technical excecution or production.
I hope the future is not more 3D HFR, at least not before it has evolved to someting watchable. But until then it is not ment for cinema.",Gemini Man

To be clear, I didn't give it an 8 because I thought it was the type of movie you should expect to find an 8-rating on when viewing it. The 8 represents how much I genuinely enjoyed it, and not how much I expect other people to enjoy it.",Gemini Man

742,sapetterson,Good action movie with a few compromises,10,11 February 2020,"I saw the film first and read the bad reviews later, and in my opinion they are 90% undeserved. I was in awe of the picture quality, the fight scenes, and think it had a decent story..On the plot I think it made some compromises, but I understand why they made them and have it go that way. For example, I would have liked a more romantic ending, but others probably would have wanted the opposite. It still managed to touch on the (ethical) issues of cloning in a way though and was very enjoyable.The only thing I'd really like to criticize is that we saw so little of the character's development because of the amount of action, and there likely isn't going to be a sequel because it flopped at the box office.
Like, it's enough to understand their motivations and their story isn't what matters for themselves, and the movie ultimately is a snapshot of the characters trying to survive, but as a spectator I would have loved to get to know them better.",Gemini Man

746,newconceptmagazin,"""The Arrival of a Train"" Take 2",10,20 October 2019,"First of all, I want to make it clear that this film should have 2 separate score system.The first one is the common system, which you score the movie for its plot, and screenwrites, and etc. And that score is just about average.But this film is revolutionary in a completely different way. As it is filmed at 120FPS, and in 4K, meaning only a handful of cinemas around the world is able to show its absolutely stunning visual spectacle.The words can't describe it, you only have to see it to know it, and it is nothing like I've ever seen in a cinema. Albeit it has flaws, it gave me a whole new idea of how well the modern technology can capture the real life image, and all those brilliant IMAX films I've seen in the past were nowhere near the visual reality that this film is able to capture.
For the same reason ""The Arrival of a Train"" is highly regarded, I give Gemini Man a 10.I wish there will be more Cinity films in the future, so that more people will be able to see it, and also, I wish they fix that motion dizziness issues for some people.",Gemini Man

Did everyone suddenly go blind or not see any other CGI movies in the last decade?The de-aged will smith looks like some cheap Instagram-filter. You can literally see the lines where his real eyes are pasted into the young CGI version and sometimes the whole section seems to be floating in front of his face like some weird eye-mask.However, what really ruined the movie for me were the completely fake CGI fighting scenes. It reminded me a bit of the moments from the matrix reloaded where Neo pulls of a move the stuntman couldn't do and is replaced with a CGI version for a few seconds.But that was a small annoyance in a movie from 2003. In Gemini man the entire fighting scenes are officiously fake. The movement is unrealistic and defies physics in a way that just made me cringe.Except for 'Young' Will the acting in this movie was good, the story was below average and if the CGI didn't ruin it there could have been some great fighting scenes.Its obviously to soon to start replacing stuntman/actors with CGI and I hope Hollywood will learn a lesson from this flop!",Gemini Man

We are left with a film that is best left on the TV as background noise. Any attempt to sit and watch this film linearly will be met with frustration, or slumber.

And if it's true it is even sometimes predictable, especially at the end, it's far enough for the kind of movie Gemini Man is. It's mainly an action flick, not the next generation Memento.First, all the characters introduced are pretty charismatic. Will Smith is really great portraying Brogan and his younger self. For Brogan, you can really feel the old tortured assassin tired of killing and for Junior, the intrepid and a bit reckless new one in the starting blocks. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character Danny has a developed enough story to not stay the mere supporting sidekick quickly annoying or easily forgotten.The visuals are great, and for once, you can appreciate the style of the CQCs, pretty raw here, but nicely choreographed. The FX is really neat and the de-aged Will Smith is not that bad, even if he seems to suffer the ""mustache removal issue"" of Superman in Justice League.To sum up, Gemini Man is largely worth the ticket's price; surely not the movie of the year, but one with flaws forgivable enough to enjoy it in a theater.",Gemini Man

And I went in asking myself how could it be that Will Smith movie is getting such low reviews, I kept waiting for those tjings they wrote, I wanted to see myself. But it was just awesome!
One thing I would object though. Something that is seen in ALL the Hollywood movies. Please stop tying a bleeding wound ABOVE it, ever so tightly. This is how limbs are LOST. Don't you Americans have mandatory first aid courses for a driver's licence?? Did you know that you are being made fun of at those classes here in Europe, by actual medical professionals, citing this as an example how NOT to treat a wound? This is not how you stop the bleeding but how you completely cut off the blood flow. Putting pressure DIRECTLY ON the wound is how you do it, with your hands or tying something (clean, preferrably sterile) over the wound. But never, ever tye tightly to cut off the blood flow.

784,tocsa120ls,Your Michael Dudikoff VHS is here. Don't forget to rewind before returning.,3,28 October 2019,"I was wondering if some screenwriter found this script in a file cabinet that was locked since the early 90s, then the Trivia page cleared it up - essentially that is what happened here. You get your late-80s, early-90s B-action movie, but because the 80s stars are old now, instead of Michael Dudikoff you get Will Smith, Clive Owen stands in for Robert Davi, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is subbing for whichever female wrestler you wanted to bang in the 90s.
*** SPOILER ***
The script is so linear you could've used a straightedge to write it - protagonist confesses to WWE girl he has only two fears - now you know what exact two things will happen to him later. They dangle this secret project of creating the perfect soldier instead of Will Jr. - one that doesn't feel pain and does not question orders - guess who shows up at the last minute for no reason? Weapons that throw 200lbs soldiers back 10 feet can apparently fired offhand without an inch of recoil and nobody gets hearing damage either, despite standing right near it.",Gemini Man

The special effect are pretty amazing (except at the end strangely) and good enough to make believe most of the time.
We need to see more movie with Will Smith like that . He prove to be relevant for this kind of movie.Ang lee prove again to be a great director for action movie with interesting character.Still waiting for Hancock 2, Will!",Gemini Man

795,craigysyndrome,Gemini Man does twice as better than what I thought it would,4,30 October 2019,"I have to say, this movie did do a lot better than what I thought it would. After a week of watching Terminator Dark Fate, this film scored better than that. It is a straight forward story, and the action is over the top, but it doesn't take itself too seriously, I feel. It's a run-of-the-mill action movie, but it's not promising the world and all. If you have the choice between Terminator Dark Fate and Gemini Man, I would recommend this film.",Gemini Man

797,JF500,"Gemini Man is an enjoyable run of the mill action spectacle, though itself a clone of other films of the past like Looper, and is overall a standard vehicle for Will Smith.",7,4 October 2019,"It seems almost every year we have some of the same looking action films from some of the same exact actors, with new names. Gemini Man is the epitome of a standard action film. There are some moments that visual director Ang Lee implements that provide it with excitement albeit insanely ridiculous, but overall it follows all too familiar plotting and formulaic writing that everyone has seen before. The biggest drawback is that it copies so much from Looper in the fact that it's a younger version of a protagonist going up against his older version only different because its not time travel, and it's a clone factor. The cgi for young will smith clone is impressive enough but seems a bit extravagant. There are some genuinely well executed action sequences but they're highly unbelievable, but it does serve as action eye candy. Will Smith is standard as usual and not much else. Clive Owen is somewhat interesting in this particular role and gives it some identity. There's just not much new to offer here but it is a fun film if you enjoy action and don't get too annoyed that its been conceived before.",Gemini Man
798,nicholasadairhunter,Unique Concept-Great Execution!,10,13 October 2019,"I can't believe what terrible reviews this movie got. For a concept so big yet so unique, it would be very hard to execute it rightly. And when I saw the poor reviews for this movie, I lost high hopes, thinking it failed to do it right. But they were wrong. This movie is a groundbreaking peice of art. The cgi in it is unlike anything I've ever seen. And as the movie progresses, the characters move closer and closer to me. Clay Junior feels like an accurate depiction of someone who finds out he's a clone of someone who knows more about him than he does, and Henry Brogan is such a great character as well. I personally can barely think of anything bad about this movie that deserves it's hate. And I highly recommend it to you.",Gemini Man
799,JordsMeintjes,Uncomplicated,7,12 October 2019,"Seen before, done many times, there isn't much new with ""Gemini Man"" except it's gimmick feature of cloning.That being said, it's not bad, it's just simple. The story is basic and has been similar to the plot of many other action films that involve government security. Although they play it safe it does excite, it does draw you in, and it is enjoyable. What counts most in movies like this, that try to get you asking questions, is the ending. When you think of the plot and soak in what just happened, you cannot help but think ""oh, it's a less complicated Bourne movie.""Acting from its lead, Will Smith, is great and he is in incredible shape. He is undoubtedly committed and truly becomes the character that's been written for him. He is impressive when acting out his clone, however the CGI is hard to watch. For the most part it works, but some scenes focus too much on his face, forcing the viewer to dwell on the fakeness of the CGI. The supporting cast are also quite good, although a little shallow with them not being fleshed out as well as they could have been. This isn't because of their acting ability, but because the writing was simple.At the end of the day, what takes away from this film is it's writing. It could have explored the moral choices and consequences of cloning a little more but all we get is a little conversation at the end with no real outcome. If not that, it could have made the plot of government conspiracy a little more complex and heavy.Good acting. Fun time. Uncomplicated.",Gemini Man

810,mjdanhov,Green Screen bonanza,1,5 March 2021,"Choosing a Will Smith film use to be a solid choice for movie night, but after 'After Earth' and, well, 'Bad Boys', I knew there was potential for failure. I just never expected it to bomb this hard! I mean, we all know there will be duds here n there, but oh.. my god..From the laughable teary moments( NOT funny haha, but disbelief) and the disaster writing to the oh so obvious green screen action, with the lighting coming from the same side, and by the way, the same lamps from what it looked like.. There is just not enough space anywhere to do a completed list of all that was wrong here..Suffice to say, it felt like I was watching a Spanish or Japanese production of a low budget, horror B flick, but somehow it was turned in to an action drama, and uh Will Smith is there.. Actually I'd prefer the b horrors, cus at least you know what you are paying for. This just leaves you wanting your time and money back..Reminds me of Bergs dud, Green Lantern but at least that was a funny dud..

It's probably the single most generic action movie I have ever seen, with awful looking gunplay and only one even minimally impressive - looking action scene in a movie that drags without them.

The storyline was nonexistent and the graphics were bizarre. The plot is just will Smith is old and is fighting a young will smith. Yawn. The younger looking will Smith was also very obviously CGI and the fact that you could tell he wasn't 100 percent human made you slightly uncomfortable in every scene. The only character you actually connect with on an emotional level is the pilot who dies in an underserving way, but also doesn't give you any space to react so you're just like, ""welp."" The action sequences were fun at times, but definitely didn't carry the movie. Horrible movie. Needed Taco Bell after to get it out of my system.",Gemini Man

I'm sure you have plenty of money from GOT and at this point, no one wants to watch your ideas come to life on screen. I have no idea how this movie ever got to be this bad considering it was in development for ages but this team made it happen. Also let's not forget Will Smith: one of Hollywood's most powerful actors, now hasn't been in a good movie for at least 5 years. I love you Will so for your sake, I really hope you pull a Keanu in the near future and start making good movies again. Just don't spend your money on this movie, if you really want to see it just wait 8-or-so months for it to be free.",Gemini Man
817,Rinette,"Not worth watching in the cinema - stream it on a rainy afternoon, if you must",4,19 October 2019,"This movie was not good. The script was laughably poor and the plot was predictable; a cat and mouse game across the world and something we've seen many times before. The action was alright but was often boring. A few of the characters felt superfluous, like they were only there for Will Smith to talk to and exposition for the audience - they had very little impact on the plot themselves.The CGI was alright but nothing special - we've seen it before and any time Young!Smith moved it felt like watching a cut scene in a videogame.Overall, I wouldn't recommend you spend money watching this movie - stream it when it comes out, it's cold and rainy outside and you have nothing better to do.",Gemini Man

I wanted to love this film and as this genre goes I tend to be a little forgiving. I did enjoy seeing Will Smith in another movie and there were certain aspects of the film that were entertaining.Unfortunately, I struggled with the piss poor CGI rendering of Will Smith's younger self. So much so that I found it difficult to enjoy the movie. It just seemed silly. Also, I'm not quite sure I would rate the writing as bad as some of the other people here have but it is true that it lacks depth. Also, some aspects of it were highly predictable. Perhaps written for people who Get easily confused. No idea.You want to love the characters, but the way it is written and directed its hard to really grow an attachment to them.

I did not like the CGI. It looks like someone else is wearing Will Smith's face and not in a good way. Does not look real. Many action sequences look too digitalized.

833,AmonStarrick,David Benioff strikes again,3,3 October 2019,"When I saw the trailer I thought ""Yea, I already know exactly how the story goes, but the deaging effects look nice""So I went into it expecting not much, but at least some average entertainment. But oh boy, the movie is kinda hard to enjoy. The characters have no depth, the story is totaly bland and the action in it's best moments is super average.I was right on both my predictions. The trailer already tells you the whole story and it does feel like you've already seen it before. And also, the creation of a young Will Smith totaly worked.The script is horrible and you can easily notice the flaws. There are some super obvious setups that are so randomly thrown in that you know it's gotta be important later, just to then be disappointed that the payoff is even worse. Speaking of ""Bees"".Sometimes it feels like scenes are missing. Some actually important stuff just happens off-screen.The finale is disappointing and unspectacular and also the special effects are super whacky. People jump and run so fast that it looks like an early 2000s movie.Conclusion: Will Smith keeps picking mediocre movies, I can't recommend you watching this, I was really bored.",Gemini Man

It was difficult to fall in love with a character, loathe a character, or even love-to-hate a character. Probably one of Will Smith's worst acting performances.

846,poe_diddley,See it in high frame rate for the best effect.,6,12 October 2019,Saw it in high frame rate 3D. Would like to see it in HFR non 3D honestly. The bike scene especially was fantastic along with most of the chase and battle scenes. However I feel that the rest of the cgi and lighting hasn't caught up to how to effectively make a HFR movie look smooth from start to finish. It reminds me of when HD first came out and some things looked incredible and others not so much. I'd like to see more films use this and see it improve as they learn how to use it effectively. Plot and acting were not the greatest but it's a fairly fast paced action movie so that is sadly typical of the genre. Will Smith is always likeable and however the they pulled off the body double was pretty cool. Overall I enjoyed it but there's room for improvement as far as how to use HFR. When it was used well in this picture it was truly a very very cool effect.,Gemini Man

Action scenes are ok at best (really bad CGI physics)- But the cringe worthy dialogue...I...just couldn't. Specially towards the end. Will Smith can be awesome depending on the movie, but these lines are just killing me. I understand actors and directors take any movie sometimes to pay that extra mansion, but come on at least don't phone it in this blatantly. Don't even bother if you're short on time",Gemini Man

This was a good film that was entertaining and an original perspective. I'm also noticing that anytime Will Smith does anything immediately the haters come out the wood works on why his films aren't that great. But why sway, what's the real reason because it really was not that bad.",Gemini Man
860,andrs_fuentes,A lost opportunity,1,2 July 2020,"There was a chance this could succeed. Smith is a solid actor, capable of a wide range of emotion. I think of Enemy of the State, Ali, I Am Legend, they all were excellent films. The failure here is a complete joke of a script. Bad writing, no imagination, boring execution, even as I write this I'm struggling to finish the film. So very glad I saw this on a streaming site, since paying retail to watch this would have made it even worse. Skip it.",Gemini Man
861,MarenacioBanks,Not One of Wills Best,5,28 January 2020,"Gemini Man is definitely not one of Will Smith's best films, it's actually something that should not have been a starting Will Smith feature at all as the storyline is stale the dialogue contrived and the supporting cast completely perplexed most of the time attempting to follow Wills lead. The main issue with this film besides the horrible special effects, aging techniques, and action scenes is Hollywood's attempt as a whole to redefine their aging talent and speed up the use of technology in the film making process, when neither is necessary. When something is not broke it does not need fixing, it is not the process of film making which needs changing, it's the method of distribution, which audience around the world are forcing the major studios to conform to. Gemini Man would have worked with all it's lack luster with a more well regarded action superstar. Will seems to be attempting to find himself which leaves us all his fans unfortunately experiencing a stream of sub part films while he goes through the process. When another witty, light comedic, Simi serious melodramatic film starring Will Smith comes to, I will be first in line to be sure to support the Will we have grown to know and love.",Gemini Man

I was engaged the whole time and did not get bored. The picture is great and rich in colour. The cgi isn't bad and most people don't explain their reasoning behind it.

Because this is really ridiculously poor writing.
I thought the CGI looked fairly good. The actors performances & the action, was what you would expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer vehicle.

Its the first time I do that for a movie in the last 5 years, that's how bad it was. Also saw it in high frame rate, I hate that. It makes it look so low budget and un-cinematic, couldn't take it serious really. REALLY hope this tech doesn't catch on. Will Smith is Will Smith but he can't do nothing to save that awful script.

He is really good with action movies so I had to see why most of you sheep considered that a movie . The movie was starting great and the action scenes was intense and good and then we see the first appearance of Will Smith Clone . You have to keep in mind that this is not another actor playing Junior , it is CGI ... Keeping that in mind , the action scenes almost looked real , this is a really big accomplishment and I think that in 20 something years from now this movie will be the first of his kind because you will be able to create CGI actors that will look 100 % real so as the action scene and I think that Will Smith saw that opportunity and this is why he made that movie .If your a teenager or not a movie fan then I would suggest you to skip this one because you wont see what is behind it but if you can keep that in mind you will be amazed on how CGI can create a characters and emotion etc..",Gemini Man

You feel like you're watching the movie for any errors where the technology can't keep pace with fast moving scenes. Some of the fights scenes looked way too artificial.Half way through I was checking my watch wondering when this novelty movie with an average storyline would finish.I don't think this is Will Smith's comeback movie. Here's hoping for better results with the next Bad Boys movie.,Gemini Man

We know Will can act, but even harbour scene was missing something, as if they acted in space of 7 years and never seen each other. Contents of the dialogues. Clive looked and sounded rather like his Sin City character. This bothered me even more than plot or cgi etc. I did not hate this movie or dislike that much, just some strange aftertaste.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead wasn't necessary at all, if the wasn't in the movie it was still the same she didn't have An integral part. Junior as Character becouse the technology was with only one facial expression.I think the technology is Only in its infancy, therefore the use need to be in small or like in the avengers endgame that the Characters Wore mask.Film director- I love Ang Lee , Life of Pi and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are really good movie but here the result are nothing like the two film I mentioned. I think he is visionary but the technology Does not allow this vision yet.About the Cinematography- here it it the only part in the movie I enjoyed and this is the train Scene where we first meet Henry when he assassin the scientist on moving train.Conclusion- good first scene, the rest of the movie much worse.",Gemini Man

Later this week, we go out with my family and saw the trailer again. We thought, why not give a chance to this movie. So, it was a surprise except for Will Smith's poor quality clone. It's clear for me the 3D tech is not on that level where it should be make him real. I think it could have been work better with face mask. All over the film itself was very good. The storyline flawlessly went forward, built well by actors, cameras and locations as well. I think the trailer made the worst for this movie.

I love the fact that US and Chinese companies have also collaborated for such art. The appearance of an unexpected car manufacturer as one of the sponsors probably was a lovely. Watching this movie made me think of the future of humanity and how bright the that future will be actually.

This is a movie you will forget before you walk to your car in the cinema parking lot. Was it a total waste of money and time? no. It was ok, some average fight sequences that didnt seem real.

928,pkjeldsen-50630,Could have been so much better,2,25 November 2019,"This movie had potential, but when Will Smiths enemy ( his cloned self) enters the stage it all falls apart.
Will Smith a retired hitman is being hunted down for no real reason throughout the movie and seeing him as a computer generated Fresh prince simply makes this hilarious. It would have been cheaper to use make-up on the real deal instead of making this sorry excuse of a computer animated caracter. Avatar did it so much better ( and I don´t like that movie either).
The movie tries to create a kind of connection between Will Smith and Will Smith and in the final another Will Smith ( with no capacity to feel pain).
I watched it in full but I was left with a strange feeling as if Will Smith is walking down the same path as Bruce Willis choosing crap scripts to make a buck or two.
The movie could have had a cool plot like some of the Bourne Identity movies ( except The Bourne Legacy), but it didn´t.
it was an attempt to show off the capacity of computer graphics, and usually it is good, but this time it failed.
So where did i cringe the most? At the end, when it was all over and Will Smith Junior takes it to campus...sigh, having a fatherly talk with Will Smith about growing up, making your own mistakes, and... oh God I nearly puked...

Will Smith did a decent job portraying two characters, but the characters themselves weren't special enough to justify the stale plot. It feels that the side characters were there only to have Smith talk to someone and the villain was generic to the point of yawning.Technological advancements were lost on me, since I couldn't see this movie in my theatre as it was intended. I was left with underwhelming action that looked quite fake and ""rubbery"" at times and I was honestly amazed how uncanny valley it was at certain points.Despite some good actors, a talented director and couple of visually striking shots, ""Gemini man"" was a joyless experience that tries to be deep, but feels empty. It's not ridiculous enough to be fun and it's not smart enough to be appreciated on another level.If you want a generic action movies with couple of fun stuff thrown in there, I guess this is servicable enough, but for me - this is a definite skip.",Gemini Man

Creating human clones to fight our Wars would be a great concept. As stated in the film no longer will soldiers come home with PTSD, lost limbs, or even death. A couple scenes sets in the movie reminded me of Game of Thrones. In particular the scene when Henry and Junior were in area with the skulls on the wall. At the end of the movie I read David Benioff listed as the Screenplay Writer. There has been plenty of reviews saying that the CGI is bad. It was okay for me. I saw the movie at a MJR Digital Cinema.

A hitman finds out there's a clone of himself and he sets out to find out why, who and how. That's it. The 3d was done quite well with this movie. Felt like I was in the room with the characters.

955,sergioout,Th first real glimpse into the technical future of ACTION,7,10 January 2020,"First of all this movie is not great and it's also not bad. It's an action movie and ""acts"" like one instead of trying to be a drama, or having a psychological ""edge"", it's what an action movie, in my modest opinion, is suposed to be.
Nowadays people get disappointed because a movie has to a have it all... well it doesn't! It's just fun but more important IT IS THE FUTURE!
People must come to realise that as we were stuck with 480p resolution for years and got up to 4k (2160p) and even 8k (4320p) we must also advance in framerate... How can people say this movie looks bad??? Our eyes are capable of seeing more than 100 frames per second, tv sellers use the 100, 200hz propaganda so they sell, and you ""want"" to watch movies in 24 lousy frames!!! No, it doesn't look ""cinematic"", it looks blurry and far from reality, you are just too used to it.
I'm fine with lower framerates if it's intended as an art style but please watch this movie again for this technical detail and see for yourself, the fighting and chasing sequences, you can finnaly see every movement instead of the blurry mess you get in 24p, you can even tell every CGI moment BECAUSE they couldn't make it look like real movement in this framerate.
Please hollywood and all you movie fans, understand that approaching the way movies look to what we perceive visually in reallity is the FUTURE. Saying that the image looks strange and you don't like it is like saying that colours in cinema look strange and we should go back to black and white.
If you agree please take time to write a review also praising the producers for their bold move of making it one of the pioneers in high framerate Cinema.",Gemini Man
956,gavcrayton,Why the hate?,7,15 November 2019,"Was this a fantastic film? Not really...it was good though. The CGI let it down a little ie. a motocrosser that defies physics.

958,onsgly,Strange use of CGI,4,9 December 2019,"I don't think anyone was expecting this film to be anything more than 'switch-off-your-brain' fun. And it that regard, it somewhat delivers. The story is predictable and the characters are entirely one dimensional. But again, that was to be expected. What was surprising, is the amount of cgi employed in the action scenes. I was aware that there would be de-aging tech used on Will Smith's younger version, but they completely replace the guy with what appears to be a rubber-man version that has super powers (real-world physics do not apply to this guy at all). Some of the set-pieces reminded me of Halle Berry's Catwoman (yes, that bad). It was by far the most distracting part of the film.
Other than that, it's another forgettable Smith movie. He seems to do one of these every now and then (After Earth, i-Robot etc.)",Gemini Man
959,Weirdyoda04,"Almost a good movie, wish I read the reviews first",4,4 January 2020,"I get why some people like the movie, it has some legitimately good things going for it but the flaws are too numerous to overlook.You know how some movies have one or two shots that look silly and bring you out of the movie for a few moments but you're quickly drawn back in and you forget about it? Like when there's a car crash and the CGI car doesn't move quite right. This movie has so many of these moments it's impossible to believe a single action scene. I don't mean this as an insult but you can find better CGI in fan videos on YouTube.If you can somehow overlook the hammy special effects you find a much worse problem in the plot holes. The writing and acting is really good in some spots, like when Will Smith's character meets Mary Winstead's and he accuses her of spying on him. But all that is ruined with motivations that done make sense, under developed characters, and huge plot holes.At the end of the film there are numerous questions that are addressed with a few lines of dialog basically amounting to, ""Don't worry, everyone can live happily ever after now.""Last thing I'll say is the anti-aging tech has come a long way but still looks noticeably fake. Some people don't seem to mind but it definitely goes into the hammy CGI category for me.",Gemini Man
960,sharnel327,Will Smith made it decent,5,3 November 2019,"The idea of the film is great. Will Smith is great. BUT the script, action, and rush of the film made it extremely predictable and dull.

Not very clear. Why did they make Will Smith clones? Reasoning not very convincing. And of the clones, why did major villain raise 1st one as his ""son"" but not the 2nd clone? And what was the purpose of ""the woman"" - just to have one in the film? Never explained why she became so invested in helping a guy she surveilled for like a day - someone she never knew before.But Ang Lee directed it. He's and action-only director and the movie delivers on what Lee does best - action scenes, fights, chases, and shootings. However, this does not makeup for the convoluted story nor the cheesy computer-generated versions of Will Smith. And in some scenes, it was obvious that stunt doubles were used in scenes where the actual Will Smith was present. Why do that? If you have already CGI'd him, why switch off?This was certainly NOT Will Smith's best. Haven't seen him in a really good, sensible, believable action film in quite some time. I hope he hasn't lost his touch for picking really good films that builds on his former ability to fill theater seats.",Gemini Man

969,samarthb,Classic example of how technology should never overshadow story,2,12 October 2019,"Let's first objectively evaluate the two technological advancements of this film: de-aging and high frame rate.
The de-aging is good in 90% of scenes, except for an extended final scene in broad daylight, where it's absolutely horrendous.The high frame rate is interesting but looks fake and occasionally causes disorientation during action scenes.Now let's talk about whether this film NEEDED these technological advancements, and the answer is a resounding NO. Had the story, script and screenplay been good, I would have easily bought another actor playing younger Will Smith. And while the high frame rate made sense in theory for larger than life films like the Hobbit trilogy, here's it's a blatantly unnecessary gimmick.If you remove these technical aspects and evaluate the film's story, it's extremely basic with poor pacing, direction and dialogue. I hope this film serves as a reminder to future filmmakers (I'm looking at you James Cameron) to always use technology to serve the story, not the other way round.",Gemini Man
970,Zoom88,What a let down!,4,1 January 2020,"Sadly this was one of the worst films I have seen Will Smith perform in. His acting was not his usual stand out, the fight scenes was like watching a Video Game and looking at the face of the Young Henry Brogan was like looking at an Avatar on a video game.

972,dfoxxc,Movie is better than critics say,9,11 October 2019,"Sure the script needs some help, but let me tell you Smith does an absolute great job at being Junior. Honestly, he evokes emotion and naïveté so well and since the VFX is actually well done (90% of the time) you actually sense the humanity in this CG character (mainly because of Smith's performance). Winstead and Wong are solid co-stars. Each bringing their own thing to the table. Kinda felt like they could've been utilized better (including Smith), but I'm chalking that up to the script too. Smith really does shine twice, but the script really doesn't help elevate the concept. But besides the script being the problem. The action sequences were good, cinematography was cool, the interaction between Junior and Winstead and older Smith was entertaining. There's a few lines that Junior says to Winstead that made me laugh out loud. He's not the young wisecracking Smith, but he's this naive and almost innocent, yet confident Smith that makes the delivery that much better. Sure there are a few gripes and small issues, but it was overall fairly entertaining. I'd check it out. I saw it in 3D 60fps and it actually looked really good since it was shot in 3D. Probably not necessary, but I'll be seeing it in 2D 24fps to see if it helped or hurt it.",Gemini Man

To know that you can just watch the trailer and you can predict what is going to happend in movie. If you are a fan of Will Smith like me then you can just watch it without any attention.
On the other hand if we consider the quality of the movie then it's crap. I mean you can predict what gonna happen next. CGI is very much noticeably bad especially the movement of young Will and his mouth. The script is poor, dialogue is worsts. Have no twists in it and so many things to notice. Some plot is missing that happened off screen.
If we consider making then I'll give it a fare mark. Acting was good but writing is worst of it i must say. Entertaining though. Happy watching.",Gemini Man

Brilliant character film!,8,18 October 2019,"I have just finished watching this film and having read some reviews, I cannot believe how poorly this film is being perceived that it has a mediocre plot line and the special effects is nothing new. This is mainly a character film with some brilliant action set pieces thrown in. I can confirm that the story is normal for this type of film with some brilliant special effects (of Wills younger double), but what was outstanding was the acting, especially of Will Smith and Mary Elizabeth, they have really good chemistry in every scene. I really liked the thought provoking moments between the older and younger versions of himself also. Please go and watch it as it seems like the negative reviews are killing this film.",Gemini Man
993,GhostInTheRentalStore,don't watch the trailer,4,4 April 2020,"If you've seen the trailer, you've pretty much seen the movie. Still, I was hoping for more when I rented this. Some secret twist, or amazing action sequences that will leave me dizzy. Misdirection to fool the audience. A gripping plot with amazing characters. Unfortunately what you see is what you get.The biggest weakness is making the clone this sheltered crybaby. Who's an assassin.... who doesn't like killing people. It would've been so much better if they turned him into a stone cold killer with no feelings. Like the Terminator. This relentless killing machine that will stop at nothing to get at his target. It's all there to ""edit"" his DNA, as the movie states. Who cares about ""feelings"" or if young Fresh Prince can turn over from the dark side. In something that's pretty much a popcorn flick. That's what bogs this movie down.Not to mention why this clone has a 90's haircut. Going with my Terminator idea, they could've did so much more visually with the character. Hair dye, tattoos, piercings, etc. He could've been like Dennis Rodman, and all loud in your face. Instead we get this subdued, boring, polite student type character. Reverence to how Will Smith looked when he was younger doesn't make for much fun.As for the action, it wasn't bad in some places. I enjoyed the chase on rooftops and motorcycles. Yet the action sequence at the end defies all reality. Characters survive things they should not survive. They're making shots they should not make. And they have guns that never seem to run out of ammo. I swear a handgun in this universe has more bullets than a machine gun.When I first heard of the premise of the movie, it sounded so intriguing. Even before the movie was filmed. Unfortunately it doesn't' live up to expectations. Also, filmmakers really need stop with the trend of giving away the whole story in the trailer.",Gemini Man

Maybe that is why I don't hate it as much as others do. Will I talk about this movie 10 years from now? No. But if nothing else, it was fascinating to watch a film with that level of clarity and definition. You could definitely tell the difference that filming at a 120 frame rate, it was almost like looking through a window. A little bit jarring at times, but I can see the potential that it has for future movies.The movie suffers from some bad and unmotivated dialogue as well as underdeveloped characters. Will Smith has an amazing ability to portray every character he touches as believable and yet the whole movie still felt a little flat.Personally, I liked the action scenes. A lot of action movies suffer from poor camera angles and dark rooms to hide the magic of the fight choreography but I thought they did pretty well with this one. Although I did think that the characters must be robots at some point because wow could they survive some crazy stuff, but hey, I'll suspend my disbelief because that's Hollywood baby.Overall, if you are going into this movie wanting a cerebral, mind-blowing experience you will undoubtably be disappointed.

1024,casman-67636,Decent Popcorn Flick. Worth seeing in 3D-HFR.,7,19 October 2019,"TL;DR
The story, acting, and plot are standard popcorn action movie. The 3D-HFR is new technology that is worth seeing in the theatre to see where the industry is heading. It improves the action and visuals to be more realistic and less exaggerated. The cinematography, sound, and 3D was really good.Detailed Review:
The plot is not ground breaking or new as others have mentioned. The technology and technical aspects is where this movie is noteworthy (think Avatar). Based on the many reviews it appears some may be distracted by the tech.The HFR adds a higher definition and more detail that is hidden in the standard 24 frames per second (FPS). The human mind will fill in gaps when they read books and watch TV/Movies. For those not familiar, HFR is to movies what 1080p HD is to TV broadcast. The higher definition provides so much detail the mind does not need to fill in the gaps, so acting cues and facial expressions are more noticeable. The acting was on par for an action movie. The higher detail allows viewers to be more critical than what is normal.The HFR also changes the tone of the medium. It affects VFX and practical special effects. The cinematography took advantage of the HFR and I thought it was well done. The explosions and action scenes looked more realistic and less like a 1980's action TV show than many current action films. HFR is the future of movies. It will take time for the audience/critics to adapt.The Real3D was noticeably improved in this format. Oddly, the screen cloth was visible and you can tell if the characters were behind the screen or in front of the screen due to the deeper 3D effect. The depths were more clear where it felt like it was filmed in 3D vs re-rendered in post production. The CGI character of Junior (the younger Will Smith) was very lifelike. A few instances you could tell it was CGI by the movement of the character but the detail was great. There are few instances of better CGI characters. If the reviews concern you, see it early in the day when tickets are cheaper. If you are into the technical side of movies, It is worth watching in the theater in the 3D-HFR format.",Gemini Man

I agree it's not the most engaging in storyline (semi predictable) but not the worst either. Yes, it had flaws and don't think this film was made expecting to win Oscars in any category-just good, old fashion entertainment. I thought the CGI was decent for this type of movie and the pace was nice-not constant violence and not so much dialogue you are dozing off in between. The low rated reviews are surprising.

If you like will Smith then you would know that this is not his best performance and reason for that movies story. You have to be more imaginative when it's Will God Smith, I cud have added more younger will Smiths for more fight scenes.Fun 8 out of 10
Looks of the actress is awesome but did not seem that the movie needed her could have opted for a little funny person,
These movies with wills name on it needs to be fast pace action movie but this was not fully action..

1035,ziqinlowsmart,Smooth storyline,6,22 November 2019,"Film Review of Gemini ManGemini Man mainly centers on one character which is Willard Carroll Smith Jr. However, Will Smith play 2 characters in Gemini Man: a 51 years old government elite assassin named Henry Brogan, and his younger clone, Junior. There are also two operative partners for Henry Brogan in the movie who are Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Danny and Benedict Wong as Baron. Gemini Man is a United States innovative action- thriller and of science fiction film that directed by Ang Lee and the screenplays of it are David Benioff, Andrew Niccol and more. Ang Lee who is one of today's greatest latter-day filmmakers. He has directed multiple of good films such as Brokeback Mountain, World War II, Life of Pi and etc. Ang Lee has won for Best Foreign Language Film in Academy Award of Merit which also known as Oscar Award for Wo Hu Cang Long (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) in year 2001 and best director award for the film, Brokeback Mountain and Life of Pi. The movie was released in cinema, Malaysia on 10th October.
Gemini Man is a movie that can't get rid of clone or doppelganger. Henry Brogan as the main actor whom is an elite assassin that going to retire when after completing his 72nd job. There is a Chinese quote says that plans will never being expected to go smoothly on time when there are changes happen in sudden and this eventually reflect on Henry. After the last job, his life comes to meet a ridiculous and insane incident which someone mysterious would want to assassinate him. Hence, the each and every action of Henry can seemingly predict by someone. Then, what make him insane is when he gets to know the person that keep on trying to kill him is himself, but in a younger age and look. It is a cloned version of himself.
The movie Gemini Man is such a leap for Ang Lee compare to his previous directed films as the making of Gemini Man is difference from his others artistic film. Gemini Man is being created by the director Ang Lee as he has intentions to create a more factual and ""messy"" style of shooting in addition to explore ""the beauty of digital cinema"". Therefore, Gemini Man was shot at the aforementioned 120 frames per second (fps), with 4K,3D, high dynamic range (HDR) and immersive sound. Besides that, the amazing part was Will Smith acted for 2 roles; himself and a younger cloned version of him with the help of after effect which is ""jaw dropping"" effects from Weta Digital. During the shooting, Will Smith plays a role as Henry Brogan which in the age of 51 then when the cloned version of him comes out in the particular scene, Will Smith continues to play the role as Junior by plotting a lots of black dots on his face. After editing with after effects, a 51 years old man eventually becomes a 23 years old teenager. This shows that Will Smith have to act out two characteristics almost at the same time. The difficulty is that Will Smith at age of 51 but he still has to act out the feeling of teenagers which that he tries to get the feeling of a youngster therefore he revises back and learn from his previous film.
After watching Gemini Man, there are scenes that I found is quite interesting. The scene which Henry being targeted to sniped by an assassin in Cartagena, Columbia which they chase after each other along the road from Baron's hostel to an old building. The scene which Henry and the assassin stand at the stairs and dodge each other from being snipe. The director has chosen to use a huge mirror that hang on the wall to bring out the conversation of the actor and the mysterious assassin in that scene. This is because the director tends to keep the identity of the assassin as a secret. Therefore, before the identity of the assassin being disclosed to the audience, the director shoots the scene that the assassin is present and there are obstacles to enable the assassin to hide behind it. During the conversation, Henry wants to keep the assassin to stay away from him he decided to throw a grenade towards him. However, when he throws the grenade, he purposely throws towards the mirror but not the guy although Henry already noticed the position of the assassin. This has initially shows that Henry was not tending to murder him but give chance to the assassin from stop killing him. For that situation, Henry has the high ability to assassin him but he does not do that. Not only that, the scene that made me feel amaze and 'wow' is Henry and Junior, the cloned version of him both work together to fight against the second mysterious assassin. When the assassin being defeated by both of them, Henry take up his helmet and see the second cloned version of him, and they were shocked. This movie eventually plays with the technique of digital cinema that bring a lot of new media into a film.
The scene in Gemini Man has used various kinds of shooting angles. The opening of the movie could be see that there is a train in Belgium moving fast and the cameraman has used a wide angle shot for one part of the scene of moving train as this could be define that the scene wish to bring out the sense of intense due to the main actor is conducting his final case that assign by the government department of Defense Intelligence Agency which is snipe the target terrorist in the moving train. Moreover, they have also utilized the lighting in one of the scene which Henry's house being embedded by someone but at the same time the actor is also having a nightmare that regarded to his childhood memory, they have use the red and blue light to indicate that actually the situation is intense and back to forw.
In the nut shell, Gemini Man tends to be a sci-fi movie regarding doppelganger. Yet, the movie has brought out the message of love as when someone who is being exploited and they deserve a chance to get back to the right path. I might be not perfect on reviewing the movie that mentioned above but this is what I have learn from Gemini Man.",Gemini Man

Of course not better than other big productions action films like James Bond or Mission Impossible.One of the main reason to watch that film is ""Ang Lee"", but it's wasteful to use Ang Lee, this is not the kind of movie for Ang Lee. Some of the scene in the film have beautiful photography, it's on the credit to Ang Lee.Will Smith has a good performance also to the fighting.

But the outcome didn't quite make it.Although the action was good, the sentimental scenes weren't long enough for us to actually catch feelings for the moment. And the funny scenes, honestly, what the hell happened to them.I don't even know what to comment on the ending; it was simply cringeworthy. All together, the writers could've used another six months or so on the script, it had several scenes missing, and it was too obvious what we needed to know in the future of the movie. Its living room was unfurnished and hallway overstocked with boxes. That's what I have to say about Gemini Man.",Gemini Man

A cool concept cant mask the generic & outright boring action scenes, stilted & awkward dialogue & very one dimensional cliched characters. Story also feels rushed & jumps from one place to the next without cohesion.

Coming from a fan of Will Smith and enjoying the majority of his films I was expecting something up to the mark. Unfortunately due to the bad CGI in most areas especially the CGI of Will Smith's young face was laughable, absolutely awful. I felt it ruin the film so much so it was like it was off a old video game from the 90s. The story itself was enjoyable and had great promise but again with the CGI was embarrassing.

1061,vexint,"The movie poster looked cool, but...",2,19 September 2020,"They should have just made this another Call of Duty video game installment instead of an actual movie. That way the special effects (at least in the action sequences) would have fit in better. It could have been like, Call Of Duty: Fresh Prince Edition, that would have been way fun!
The younger CGI version of Will Smith moves like a bogie straight out of your typical first person shooter video game. And yet, this movie definitely misses just about every mark. In judgement, it should receive 4 court martials and an article 15 for excessive military cliches and bad dialogue.
There are some bright spots though, you almost care how the movie ends. And, in contrast to the predictable dialogue, Will Smith does deliver a couple of sharp one liners that almost seem ad-libbed. I didn't see the movie in extreme HD, notwithstanding, the head shout/facial scenes of the young CGI version of Will Smith didn't look half bad (which are all dialogue scenes) -- just the action and fight scenes were not natural looking at all. Not surprising, Will Smith basically plays himself very well - both the young CGI version and natural old version of himself. But every time I saw the young CGI Smith, I could hear the theme song to the Fresh Prince of Bel Air in my head which kind of disrupted the movie. But no need to argue, I just don't think the filmmakers understand.
For the denouement, the film staggers towards this anti-war, or perhaps pro-peace, or maybe its a pro-family, or a generally pro-good stuff kind of message that reminds us that you can earn your Disney-style ending as long as you are able to bring enough bullets so that you kill everyone and anything that stands in your way. But it is very, very important, as many other mediocre and bad films have repeatedly told us, to bring enough .22 caliber rounds. If you bring anything bigger than a .22, then the bad guys might not be able to finish their soliloquies as they slowly bleed out -- as trife as their lines may be.",Gemini Man

Yes, there were holes in the plot, it wasn't as detail oriented as the Matrix and the CG was inconsistent and even laughable at the end, particularly at the end. However, it was a good enough plot, great acting, well choreographed action and fighting, hints of emotional attachment and a happy ending which stressed a very important message about growth, change and legacy. This was NOT a bad movie.How this got 5.7 on IMDb is beyond me. Suicide squad was horrible and scored higher. Land of the Dead was HORRIBLE, yet, scored higher. Extraction with Chris Helmsworthon, on Netflix, was comparable. Personally, I think this was better, but it scored much higher. Complete disrespect with how this film was assessed. Deserved 6.7-7.

Don't get me wrong, roles like Mike Lowry in Bad Boys he walks on water with because in more than one aspect of the character that's who he is but in other roles to me he struggles. This role as Henry would've been great for Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes, or Idris Elba but Will baby, it's a no.

1085,brocksteven,Reasonable action movie but not groundbreaking (one generic spoiler later in review),6,16 October 2019,"Overall, this movie is pretty good. I saw the movie in 2D so my comments about the CGI are based on that version. I see no specific reason to see it in 3D based on my viewing despite the casts' claims but I wouldn't say it'd be an entire waste either. One thing I find is missing in a lot of reviews is the reviewer's own personal scale. So, here's mine.I would rate this movie based on Will Smith's performance as significantly better than After Earth but a little below A Pursuit of Happyness or Seven Pounds. The CGI, with the exception of one explosion, was good. Somewhere between Avatar and say something like GI Joe: Rise of Cobra but closer to Avatar. Clive Owen was passable as the villain although he was arguably the worst character in the movie of the main cast. I preferred his work in Inside Man for example. Most of the secondary characters didn't have a lot to work with in terms of screen-time or character development but the movie is pretty much four characters (Will Smith, Will Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Clive Owen) so it doesn't detract from the movie.In terms of action, the movie delivers on most fronts here rating fairly high as an action movie. Something closer to an Expendables or Terminator 3 than say a Get Carter.The story, while hardly groundbreaking, is ok for an action movie. If you're thinking it's a drama, it's not. It's a stereotypical popcorn flick. The plot is a little like Looper but (spoiler alert) ends on a more positive note.Overall, if you're not expecting too much originality (other than in the digital younger version of Will Smith) and you like action films, you will probably find it entertaining.I would give it between 6/10 and 7/10 somewhere around the same type of score I would give a movie like Terminator 3. Slightly above average for its genre but not groundbreaking. For example, I would give a movie in this genre like The Matrix something closer to a 9/10 or 10/10 due its groundbreaking technology as well as original plot (definitely not for its acting!).",Gemini Man

The 60 FPS allows you to follow the action with clarity. Visually, the CGI is good. Animation-wise, you can still tell when the transitions happen, but film creators will get better at it over time. I was interested in this movie specifically over the higher frame rate and it did not disappoint. The day all action flicks start getting shot at a high frame rate will be a great day for cinema.Substance-wise, the movie is mostly filler, even as far as action flicks go. The script is not good (though it features isolated good moments, few and far between), the pacing is shoddy.

1149,n-78083,This is not a movie all concerning the story,10,7 November 2019,"I give 10 because I thought 5+ something overall has been underrated this film.I watched it from one of the four Cinity cinemas in Shanghai, China. 120 FPS, 4K and 3D. Because of that, I gained unexpected tremendous astonishing visual experience from those shamelessly short minutes of fighting and car-chasing scene. It allows me to see something out of the capabilities of human eyes, super alerting clear with every detail from fast moving objects, which makes me believe this is absolutely surreal like I was equipped with a pair of eagle eyes, then again drawing back attention to real world thanks to its fine production of 3D in normal speed.I admit the plot has much space to improve, admit that not covering all fast-motion scenes throughout the full length is a regret. I also do not disagree the idea that it'd be better if this technology applied to a like car-chasing film. But, I understand the cost, money wise, and resource wise, for now.To me, this is a pioneer trial of new audience experience for future movie world. It's definitely worth my spending four times of the normal fare to access to that future satisfaction.As a Chinese, I hardly write anything on worrying my inadequate English might cause misunderstanding. I insist doing this one because I think it's not fair to comment it's value without talking about the contribution of visuals that only a Cinity screen can bring.Thanks your time for whoever has done reading my words.",Gemini Man

Yes you have to admit that the script is pretty flat, dude come on this script is already 20 years old. But we really should focus on the presentation.
120fps really worked. I watch this film at Dolby cinema (2K 120fps 3D), and I really need to take a second to admire the camera set. With the application of the 120fps, everything become so lively, every detail just become so real. You can clearly see their moves in the night fight without motion blur, you can see every spark, every fragment when glass was broken by a bullet, you can feel the pressure when the camera is looking up underwater. Again, the liveness is being greatly increased. And it's really astonishing.
Also, beside the screen play and the 120fps, other parts of this film are finished in a really good way. The mise-en-scine, moving long take and the others...are really good.
So please, don't miss the point of this film. The HIGH FRAME RATE ( HFR) is being promoting all by Ang Lee himself. It's a long hard way, but it's might be the trend of the future.
Just.. go to the theater aroud you, which can provide you as high as they can in frame rate. The difference is obivious. It's not about the screen play, it's about how it was presented.",Gemini Man

I am pretty sure u didn't watch it in HFR. Guys, this is not what it meant to be seen. Ang Lee shot it in 4k, 3D and 120 frames per second. The action scenes and some other scenes are actually very breathtaking. This is the ""selling point"" here. With cutting edge techs for this movie, I could say this is a total breakthrough for HFR movies. The point is that it could inspire other filmmakers to use this or at least in part of their film.The story was mediocre no doubt about that but that was kinda on purpose. Lee chose this simple story for his second attempt on HFR filmmaking for a reason. He wanted more people to understand his film and with this new format new tech, he didn't want to play too wild.For the ones who want to see this film and yet still hesitating. I know there are not a lot of movie theaters are actually supporting this format out there but try to find a high frame format to watch (60/120fps, the higher the better). The second important thing here is 3D (if its possible). 4k resolution is relatively less significant imo, you can go with 2k instead.",Gemini Man

Action sequences great stunts great .plot thin but self explanatory. Lose yourself in real film enjoy the disbelief of cinema. I've wasted more than 2 hours on worse,Gemini Man
