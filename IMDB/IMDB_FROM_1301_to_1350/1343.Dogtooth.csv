0,SnoopyStyle,"strange, very strange",8,26 August 2016,A couple has kept their three adult children in isolation all of their lives. The siblings do lessons from tapes and do tests for stickers. They have strange ideas about the world outside. Only the father goes outside to be a factory manager. Christina works as security for the factory. The father brings in Christina to have scheduled sex with the son. The interactions bring about unusual results.This is a strange movie about a strange family. It is unusual. One imagines all the strange interior cultures that could arise from isolation. The use of deadpan mannerisms really work to make these characters awkward and alien. They have strip them of their modern civility.,Dogtooth
1,Bunuel1976,"DOGTOOTH (Giorgios Lanthimos, 2009) **",5,1 February 2011,"I first became aware of this Greek drama (the horror elements attributed to it are mainly implied) via an enthusiastic review in a British movie magazine. I was immediately intrigued by the plot (of the children of a family leading an oppressive/deceptive sheltered life – though the result is a long way from Joseph Losey's THESE ARE THE DAMNED [1963]) but, since it was surprisingly Oscar-nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, I made it a point to check this one out before the ceremony (even if there is little chance of it emerging the eventual winner).I have only watched a handful of titles from this Mediterranean country over the years, so I could not tell what was the current trend in their film-making style; as it turned out, this seemed to follow in the no-holds-barred tradition of directors like Lars von Trier and Gaspar Noe, neither of which I am at all fond of! The film, therefore, resorted to snatches of hardcore pornography to get its various points across. Some elements prove engaging, such as the presence of a woman from Father's place of work to provide sexual service for the two elder kids in exchange for trivial gifts, who is eventually assaulted by the old man when she in turn gives them presents 'behind his back'. At other times, it is even amusing: not only when performing a spastic dance for their parents' benefit, but the notion that an imaginary other brother had been scratched to death by a cat – when one such animal unaccountably turns up on the premises, it is brutally killed there and then by the boy with a pair of garden shears! Mostly, however, it is just bewildering since no context whatsoever is given to this unusual situation, thus resulting an altogether pointless and unpleasant exercise! As expected, the eldest offspring ultimately rebels – deliberately breaking her ""Dogtooth"" (which would indicate the children's passage into manhood) in order to go out into the world unbeknownst to her father – though the film typically cuts off before anything of consequence happens, thus letting the audience 'make up' their own ending, as it were.",Dogtooth
2,writers_reign,The Lost Language Of Crayons,4,5 December 2010,"It seems more than likely that helmer Lanthimos was at Cannes in 2008 and caught the screening of Home because darned if he hasn't taken the premise - a family living in isolation with only the father moving to and from the outside world on a regular basis - and squeezed a little frosting on the top for good measure. Whilst the family - wife and children - in Home were actually aware of the outside world in Dogtooth the parents appear to conspire to keep such knowledge from their own children going so far as to home-educate them in a language that doesn't exist outside their own imaginations where, for example, 'wardrobe' could be defined as a type of food. There's even a spin on the traditional French idea of a father employing a prostitute to school his son in sex except that this time around it is necessity - the father realizes that teenage boys require a sexual outlet - rather than time-honored custom that provokes the father into procuring a female security guard at his factory to do the honors. They'll be 'teaching' this at film 'schools' for years because it can mean anything the tutor wants it to mean but I doubt if it would go down well at the Multiplexes. For pseuds only.",Dogtooth
3,grantss,"Darkly funny, disturbing and weird",6,12 March 2017,"Three teenagers live with their parents in an isolated house in the country. Their parents are over-protective and controlling, resulting in the kids living in an alternative-universe-like bubble.Very weird and quite disturbing, the story of how a couple literally imprison and brainwash their adult kids. Some of the unintended consequences are quite funny. Is very interesting in that you start to think that something bizarre is around every corner. Does drift on several occasions, and many things are left unexplained.Dark yet funny, disturbing and weird. Certainly not to everyone's tastes.",Dogtooth
4,neil-476,"Weird. Interesting idea, shock value, not entirely successful",6,1 December 2010,"Dogtooth is a Greek art-house movie.Dad has brought his 3 children (2 daughters and a son) to adulthood by sheltering them from the outside world in a walled compound. Fair enough - an interesting idea to play with. This has involved teaching them wrong words for everyday things and also ideas like if they stray outside the compound they will be eaten by man's greatest enemies, cats. Huh? Disbelief becomes considerably more difficult to suspend at this point.Dad brings in a woman from outside to provide son with sexual release, and she turns out to be the catalyst to introduce outside influences which ultimately fracture the strange but otherwise operational ""family"" unit.There is some strong meat here - sudden and quite shocking moments of violence, a fair amount of nudity and some moderately explicit sexual material. This sits within the odd story referred to above, some mannered acting and direction, and an irritating non-resolution.The film is not without merit: neither is it wholly successful, however. And, to be sure, it is entirely an acquired taste.",Dogtooth
5,evanston_dad,There's More Than One Way to Kill a Cat,8,22 February 2011,"Director Giorgos Lanthimos's other-worldly study in provocation seems to be about the dangers of trying too hard to keep your children safe from the world. Not only is it harmful to them, but, as the movie suggests, it's pointless: even if your children don't actively seek out that world, the world will find them.To say that the patriarch in this film goes overboard in sheltering his children is a hopeless understatement. In fact, words can't really describe the experience of watching this film. I imagine watching someone perform a lobotomy in his garage might come close: what you're seeing makes you sick to your stomach, but it's also so morbidly fascinating no effort of will can make you tear your eyes away.I'm not sure ""Dogtooth"" really needs to go as far as it does to make its point. It stops just short of gratuitous, and probably crosses over that line for many. But at the same time, I probably wouldn't still be haunted by it (freaked out is probably a better choice of words) this many days after seeing it if it had been less extreme.Grade: A",Dogtooth
6,zetes,"Weird for weirdness' sake, mostly",6,30 January 2011,"Middle-aged parents are raising their three teenage children completely quarantined from society, teaching them that the outside world is unsafe, and that only the father is strong enough to survive outside of their compound. This is an incredibly strange film. Honestly, I have no idea what the point is. I like strange movies, and I didn't really dislike this one until it started slipping into cheap pornography (it seemed fairly obvious to me that the director has a pretty unhealthy incest fetish). And it also doesn't help that the film's ending is very unsatisfactory. There are actually some other films that this reminds me of, most notably M. Night Shyamalan's The Village, which, while far from perfect, at least had some context and a far more intriguing story. Dogtooth is pretty much just people acting odd for 93 minutes.",Dogtooth
7,trashgang,disturbing flick,6,5 July 2015,"I came across this flick have seen it appear in a list of disturbing flicks. So I wanted to see this flick that had so many positive reviews and won prices. Disturbing for me can mean two things. It can be extreme in the way of gore or horror r the story is so weird that people will get offended by it. This flick falls into the second category.The story is simple, parents who re teaching their children that they can only leave the house when their dogtooth are falling out. By doing so they keep their children stupid and can tell them anything they want about the world. They are hidden from the world so they don't know what is going on. Naturally they are all in their teens and are discovering their body. To help the boy the father do brings a lonely girl at home who perform sex with the boy and it's here that lays the disturbing thing. It's all so weird that his sisters are out there trying to discover what it's all about so he has to do it with one of them while the other is having oral sex without knowing with the girl from outside. But not only that, a cat is something evil that eat children and they do believe it all. This flick isn't for everyone, if you are into Hollywood stuff forget it you will find it rather boring but people who like arty flicks or weird story lines this is a delight. Be adviced that it contains full frontal male and female which can be shocking too.Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 2/5 Effects 1/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Dogtooth
8,christopher-underwood,horrifying throughout,8,25 July 2018,"From the very start this is worrying and bewildering. Gradually we become to understand what is going on but it remains worrying. Quite right too because this, allowing for some artistic licence, is what happens when a parent decides to rule supreme and the other parent goes along. Most often we hear of such phenomena in parts of the US, often with a particular religious involvement/justification. But here carried to absolute extreme, before our very eyes, is the full effect of 'loving parents' who cannot allow the outside world, in any form, to challenge their own idea of 'bringing up children'. Some have referred to this as 'amusing', well I smiled once or twice but basically, this is horrifying throughout. Albeit fascinating.",Dogtooth
9,lasttimeisaw,a brainwave of conceptual idiosyncrasy,7,7 February 2017,"Greek absurdist Yorgos Lanthimos' Oscar BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURE nominee DOGTOOTH is a totalitarian allegory blessed with a brainwave of its conceptual idiosyncrasy. Confined within an upper-class residence cloistered from the outside contact, there lived a household of five, father (Stergiogiou), mother (Valley), elder daughter (Papoulia), son (Passalis) and younger daughter (Tsoni). The outside is off-limit for the family members, except for the paterfamilias, who works in an industrial factory, and sometimes, he would bring a security guard Christina (Kalaitzidou) to home to sate the son's sexual needs (interestingly, no such arrangements are organized for his daughters) and pays her afterward. The three adult children are strictly educated and, to a certain point, brainwashed by the parents' extreme pedagogy, according to which, language as we know it is re-interpreted in a nonsensical randomness, and they are not permitted going out until their canine tooth fall off (eventually one of them's will), together with other singular theories to justify their odd existence. No internet, cellphone, or television is presented to the children (a phone is secretly used by mother to contact father when he is in his office), but their residence is equipped with a swimming pool and a spacious verdant garden, where the trio offspring keep themselves busy in all kinds of childish competitions and occasionally wonder over the passing planes, but a cauldron of seething restlessness starts to alter the status quo, the outburst of violence, for instance, is unwarranted and haphazard, still, the biggest threat in fact is fomented by Christina, who introduces the idea of barter and new stuffs from the outside world to the elder daughter (two video cassettes), and willfully awakens the latter's sexual curiosity by commanding her to lick her ""keyboard"", sex is explicitly depicted through Lanthimos' static frames (an art-house attribute), often aiming at a somewhat unwonted angle, precluding the usual audience-friendly modus operandi, instead, it encompass a partial of its objectives, and masterfully under-girds the entire enterprise's absurdity and heterodoxy. Due to the fact that these characters are intrinsically guinea pigs entrapped in an unfathomable context, Lanthimos is given a free pass to elucidate the reasons behind all the rules and actions, and buffets his audience with ceaseless drollness, fierceness and quirkiness to burnish his anti- Utopia message, the training-dog metaphor might be the clearest idea we could suss from the whole film, where its minimally geometrical compositions, self-absorbing performances (a mettlesome Papoulia who pulls off an excruciating legerdemain and an affectively arresting Passalis whose abject mental state often hangs himself out to dry are awards-worthy high points), and an utter vacuum of musical accompaniment compensate the zany logic-defying premise and take a lark in its sky-is-the-limit peculiarities from where the elemental impulse and restraint of human behavior stem, and in that front, Lanthimos would explore further in ALPS (2011) and THE LOBSTER (2015), a track record vouches that he has been morphing into one of the most fascinating auteurs in our times.",Dogtooth
10,Hellmant,"Kind of a darker, graphic and more realistic variation on M. Night Shyamalan's 'THE VILLAGE'!",8,12 January 2011,"'DOGTOOTH': Four Stars (Out of Five) This 2009 Greek comedy / drama film (it's also somewhat of horror film as well, although it contains little violence or gore) is another to find itself on many 2010 critic's top tens lists (due to it's limited release here this year). It made it's way through many high profile film festivals (including the Danger After Dark Film Festival) and won several awards after premiering at the Cannes Film Festival in May of 2009 (where it won the Un Certain Regard Award). It was also recently selected as the Greek entry for best foreign language film at the upcoming Oscars. It's directed and co-written by Giorgos Lanthimos (with Efthymis Filippou) and stars Christos Stergioglou, Michelle Valley, Aggeliki Papoulia, Hristos Passalis and Mary Tsoni (singer of the punk band 'Mary and The Boy').The film tells the story of a married couple with a son and two daughters (all adults and none of them named) who live secluded in a fenced in home on the outside of town. The children have been kept inside the fence all of their lives and have no knowledge of the outside world. Their father is the only one who leaves the premises to go to work and to get groceries and home supplies, which he removes the labels from. The offspring are beat into submission and told of monsters that exist outside the fence which will attack them if they leave. They're also told of a fictional older brother that was banished from the home for his misbehavior. The only other person that has entered the home is a female security guard from the father's work (Alexander Voulgaris) who is brought to the house in blindfold and paid to satisfy the son's sexual urges. The sexist ultra conservative parents could care less about their daughters needs. The offspring have also been told that the only time they'll ever be old enough and ready to leave the house is when their 'dogtooth' has fallen out and grown back in.The film is impressively directed and interestingly written. It's constantly surprising and shocking with every scene and never gives the viewer any idea where it's going next. The acting is all superb, especially that of the three younger actors. The acting, writing and directing all give way to a very fascinating character study as well as social commentary. It's kind of a darker, graphic and more realistic variation on M. Night Shyamalan's 'THE VILLAGE'. It is very disturbing and contains some shocking violence (although brief like I said) as well as a great deal of sex and nudity. It's definitely not a film for everyone but it's certainly a thought provoking one.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko",Dogtooth
11,Buddy-51,stunning allegory about totalitarianism and propaganda,9,17 March 2011,"What if you could be the master of your own universe, able to make everything to your own specifications and liking? And what if, in that universe, you could have absolute control over your subjects, so that, not only would they have to do what you told them to, but you could even go so far as to shape the very way they look at the world? The unnamed middle-aged protagonist (Christos Stergioglou) of ""Dogtooth"" has created just such a kingdom for himself and his wife (Michelle Valley), tucked away in a rural area of Greece, where the two of them have raised their children - a boy (Christos Passalis) and two girls (Aggelika Papoulia, Mary Tsoni) who are all now in their late teens - in such complete isolation that the kids have virtually no knowledge of the world that lies beyond the fenced-in little compound in which they live. They know only that it is a dangerous and scary place and that none of them will be able to venture out into it until their dogtooth falls out - which is to say never. They are so misinformed as to how the real world actually works that they think planes are just tiny objects moving through the air, and that if one of those tiny objects were to fall out of the sky and into their yard, the children would be able to pick it up and play with it like a toy. They've also been taught by their colluding parents to believe that prowling cats are a mortal menace to be destroyed on sight. The kids spend much of the day doing repetitive chores, playing meaningless games and being taught an incorrect vocabulary (they use the word ""phone"" when they really mean ""salt,"" for example). The father regularly pays a young woman (Anna Kalaitzidu) he works with – the only person from the outside world the children are allowed to meet - to come and have sex with his post-pubescent son, and severely beats the kids every time they step out of line.A stunning allegory about the evils of totalitarianism, ""Dogtooth"" is somewhat reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" in its basic premise and setup, only here the guiding principle seems to be less about protecting the young ones from the harsh realities of a modern world and more about this one man's finding a way to achieve a kind of apotheosis for himself - making himself a god in the eyes of his children. For not only does he make them reliant on him for all the basic necessities of life, but he's made it so that they accept without question the ""truths"" of the physical and moral order he's established for them to live by.The man and his wife have together inverted and perverted the very definition of parenthood. Rather than grooming their children for an adult life in the real world, these parents deliberately infantilize their offspring, making it virtually impossible for them to leave the home and start a life of their own. This ensures that the kids will be there to take care of them for the rest of their lives.On a broader scale, the movie is a searing indictment of the power of propaganda, showing how easy it is to mislead people and to compel them to do what one wants simply by feeding them false information and, thus, skewing their view of realty and the truth. And isn't this how totalitarian dictatorships are born and sustained? But there's also an innate desire for liberty and independence lurking in the recesses of every human soul that must finally assert itself in a desperate run for freedom, and the movie addresses that reality as well.The movie is both raw and provocative as it takes on some rather touchy sexual themes – mainly involving incest - that some in the audience may find disturbing and discomfiting to put it mildly. There's also a fair amount of full-frontal nudity, brutal violence and more-than-simulated sex scenes in the movie.Yorgos Lanthimos' direction is spare and stripped-down, as befits a parable, with off-kilter visual framing that heightens the bizarre nature of the piece.""Dogtooth"" is unnerving, thought-provoking and provocative – and a must-see for the unconventional, adventurous movie-watcher.",Dogtooth
12,thesar-2,The Village II: Doggone Kids!,5,18 June 2011,"You don't get much to go on from the original poster and you'll take less when you complete the movie, Dogtooth.Talk about child abuse: In the subtitled Dogtooth, the father (Christos Stergioglou) keeps his wife, son and two daughters captive in their secluded home with a big backyard (or two.) Like trained pets, they know well enough never to escape, leave or venture into the real world – just beyond the fence. They just stay put, day after day, decade after next in the confides of the home while daddy is the only one who gets to leave for work.What's more (and obviously, with the above stated facts), they're homeschooledalbeit incorrectly. Just one of many examples is the quote of the movie from mother: ""A 'cunt' is a large lamp. Example: The 'cunt' switched off and the room got all dark.""This ""experiment,"" that strangely resembles and actually improves upon M. Night Shyamalan's The Village, goes a little haywire when the kids act up. And boy, am I downplaying that.The movie is both extreme independent and experimental. It's not for mainstream and it gets darker as the film progresses – both in sexuality and grotesqueness. I recommend it ONLY for film lovers interested in something new.",Dogtooth
13,dromasca,extreme risks of good education,8,8 May 2012,"Director Giorgio Lantimos' film Dogtooth (Kynodontas) is an anti-utopia. It imagines a world that does not exist, with rules and conventions so different from the ones of the society we live in that some of its aspects are shocking. A world governed by an order that kills emotions. A world separated from the real world by physical walls but also by a precipice which is deeper and wider than any physical wall. The material this precipice is made of is money and education.The family which is in the center of this film is rich. So rich that they can afford that only the father (owner of some manufacturing factory) goes to work, while the wife and the three children - twin girls and a boy, all just out of their teens - stay permanently at home. They seem to have never gone out of the villa they inhabit, they actually believe that the outer world is full of dangers, wild people and animals that just wait beyond the corner to bloodily kill them. Any intruder is considered a mortal danger (be it only a cat) with the exception of one woman brought by the father to satisfy the sexual needs of the growing boy. No contact with the world outside is allowed and in the absence of any information emotions cannot develop, or when they develop they are completely distorted.It's no wonder that this film shocked a lot of people, intrigued other and marveled a few. I am in-between the two last categories. There are many cruel and explicit scenes in this film, as the characters develop a set of reactions that is a function of their misreading of the world whenever an intrusion happens, under the form of a forbidden VCR tape (only family tapes are allowed) or of an unlucky animal. The antiseptic atmosphere created inside the perimeter of the villa reminded me Michael Haneke's two versions of Funny Games. There are two levels of possible readings of the world created by Lantimos in Dogtooth. One is the social commentary which talks about the extremes of the isolation brought up by money. The other is about the dangers and the spiritual emptiness created by an extreme education that tries to isolate the young souls from the realities of the world. To grow as a full man one needs to have the eyes open to reality.",Dogtooth
14,Cineanalyst,Captivating,8,2 December 2018,"Is ""captivating"" the right word? Well, if not, in the spirit of ""Dogtooth,"" I'll change the meaning of it. ""Captivating"" is the style of a movie that reflects its story of keeping people captive by giving the illusion of holding the spectator captive. This includes the lingering on shots (a count at the cinemetrics website gives this one a lethargic average shot length of 17.8 seconds), as though the movie itself is forcing the spectator to stay put. The perspectives of these shots, especially early on, are also confining--not even revealing all of the characters to the camera's, and thus our, gaze. Indeed, the opening scene entirely resists showing us everyone. It's quite some time before it even becomes apparent what the movie is about: that the parents have brainwashed and held captive their children from the outside world. Words representing this outside world are misdefined by the parents, and a Sinatra record is intentionally mistranslated. Meanwhile, once the movie has the audience captive, as well, it barrages us with a series of unsettling--violent and incestuous--acts confined to the same limited space occupied by the characters. It's no wonder that many viewers would just prefer to escape.""Dogtooth"" becomes quite simple after one sees the whole picture, although I suspect its initial stylistic obfuscation and its ultimate simplicity is what leads some reviewers to inflate its meaning, from political allegory to science fiction. On the other hand, I think it's about the power of movies: they captivate us--keeping us prisoner for a period of time from the outside world--but, then--even old VHS copies of ""Jaws"" (1975), ""Flashdance"" (1983) and ""Rocky IV"" (1985)--they expand our perspective of the world and set us free.",Dogtooth
15,sol-,Family That Stays Together,6,27 December 2016,"Offbeat and unusual as one would expect from 'The Lobster' director Yorgos Lanthimos, the plot of this earlier dark comedy revolves around an overprotective father who has coerced his adult children into never leaving home by systematically lying to them. Bored and frustrated but too scared to ever leave the house, his kids engage in dangerous, often violent games and sexually experimentation - at times with one another. The film sits very deliberately on the verge of being a full-blown comedy; it is hard not to laugh when one daughter talks about licking a keyboard, but at the same time, one feels sad for the youths who have no idea what the real world is like. In this regard, the film takes a sharp satirical swipe at mollycoddling and the dangers of not letting kids be kids, however, as a satire, the film is only half-complete. While the father's industrial workplace is painted as a cold, uninviting urban landscape, the film never delves into why he fears the outside world and why he is so afraid to let his kids lead their own lives. The ambiguous ending also does not work nearly as well as in 'The Lobster'. For all its drawbacks though, 'Dogtooth' is a hard experience to forget. With the fine line it walks between comedy and drama and that taboos it touches upon, it is certainly not a film for all tastes and the deliberate framing (heads sometimes not visible) is certainly perplexing at times. For those interested in something daringly different though, it is hard to pass up with its depiction of the ultimate dysfunctional family in contemporary times of global uncertainty.",Dogtooth
16,johnnyboyz,"Rich in imagery; a confrontative sense and a feeling of the director boldly following through with an idea, Dogtooth is tough to pin down but easy to get lost amidst.",6,4 February 2011,"Greek film Dogtooth begins with a static shot of somebody listening to the mellow enough commands of a person's voice on a cassette player, the voice going on to inform those listening that certain words mean totally different things to what they actually are. The young adults of about twenty-or-so listening appear to have little problem with what's being fed to them, obediently absorbing the false information that we are invited into accepting as what has been the norm for these people all their lives. When the tidbit ends, one of the group of three young adults, of both genders, suggests they all play a masochistic game of endurance that will test each of their respective mettles in regards to pain tolerance; when one other person in the room asks what the game ought to be called, the one with the initial idea pauses for a long enough time before replying that they do not know. Rabidly false information is being processed into them; their thinking patterns result in the sorts of above suggestions and when asked to simply reach a conclusion in the form of granting something a name, blank stares and non-existent replies are the order of the conversation. The sense of unease and feelings of an unnerving variety that are infused within Lanthimos' 2010 film hits us and sticks from these opening notes, Dogtooth a sick; twisted; frighteningly fascinating; surprisingly funny, in a morbid fashion, but eerily stark socio political black comedy about deeply rooted parental love and coming of age under the sorts of circumstances I pray few have ever come of age beneath before.The film is one of which psychiatrists and psychoanalysts-alike will take glee in both watching and observing, before they all sit around and discuss with one another as to whether the bizarre events that play out in Dogtooth match up to what numerous experts within their respective field have historically documented would, or might, be accurate enough to label 'realistic'. The film's predominant locale carries all the traits and characteristics of an asylum, the tones and hues of the place combining with the behaviour of those therein and the general mise-en-scene of the place to suggest such; moreover, the film is really set within a place un by two parental figures either so disenchanted with the 'real' world that they strive to keep their children from experiencing it, or, are totally bonkers. When watching it, I thought of the film as a riff of sorts on an old Werner Herzog film from the 1970s about a certain Kaspar Hauser; then I remembered these people are both Greek, and not yet technically 'free'.The film covers a dysfunctional family operating in a manner that to them, or at least some of them, is anything but dysfunctional; rather, most probably resembles normality for mostly everyone else in the world. An unnamed mother (Valley) and a father (Stergioglou) have kept their children, a son and two daughters, also nameless, within an isolated house complex complete with various rooms and lengthly garden for their entire lives so far. They've grown up and reached their twenties seemingly devoid of emotion, adhering to their parents' demands and kept free of mostly everything the world offers, from culture to various words of profanity to the inability to know what those aeroplanes are that fly overhead. The siblings have become so brainwashed and ill-related to any sort of humanistic sensibility that one daughter cannot tell the difference between right and wrong; decent and indecent; moral and amoral when she is duped into giving a specific visitor oral sex in exchange for a menial item.The son and brother is the only one whom is specifically granted an exterior link to the outside world; young woman Christina (Kalaitzidou) is a security guard at the gate to the building at which the father works. On occasion, he will lead her blindfolded from workplace to complex so she may service the son and brother with sexual intercourse. These scenes carry an agonising feel to them, a stark and unabashed depiction of two people lost in their own respective worlds; Christina as this already somewhat disturbed person brought into quench the needs of a young man whom really ought to just be let out to do what he wishes with his life. One additionally wonders as to how it was the father brought about the scenario involving Christina; you can see him pitching the idea to her, you can see her reacting to his notion of taking her blindfolded to his secluded home so as to come to meet and 'befriend' his son.The rule the parents implement upon the home is that of a communist ilk in that everybody appears to be treated equally, with distributed amounts of speech permitted and commonplace dress sense throughout as thinking is dulled and the only way to operate in life is by the way of the tyrant's wishes. At the be all and end all, it is effectively about the boss of a set place whom stands for something very specific walking all over the young people of the modern age. The reading into whatever political sub-texts about the proverbial state suffocating the young, or next generation, comes naturally with the territory; recent events involving student loan grants and the British government eerily coincide with the viewing of the film. But the ties are often loose anyway; with whatever statement or political substance along these lines there is, if any at all, does get caught up and somewhat lost amidst some of the film's more starker images as well as its more uncomfortable scenes including, but not limited to, animal cruelty and sequences of an asphyxiated nature. The film is bold and unremitting in its overall drive, the telling of a sordid story in the frankest and least exploitative manner possible that wavered and hovered around what it was I cold stand, but is worthy of catching up with regardless.",Dogtooth

18,howard.schumann,Provocative and Disturbing,10,28 January 2011,"DOGTOOTH (Kynodontas) Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, Greece, (2009), 94 minutes Winner of the Un Certain Regard Award at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival and nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos' Dogtooth is a provocative and disturbing film about the effect on a middle-class suburban family when the father takes total control of the lives of the three adult children, restricting their access to the outside world. Presumably in their early to middle twenties, the three unnamed children, a boy and his two sisters (Christos Passalis, Aggeliki Papoulia, and Mary Tsoni) walk, talk, and act like zombies.They are wooden, undeveloped emotionally, and uncertain about how to handle their sexual urges. Their affect is bland and they talk in short, choppy sentences, delivered without expression. Confined to their house and not allowed to set foot outside the gate that encloses a lovely garden and a swimming pool, they are told that only when their dogtooth falls out and then grows back will they be ready to leave the nest. Everything the children think, feel, and do is tightly controlled by their father (Christos Stergioglou) and mother (Michele Valley) who feed them lies about the world.Words are distorted to the point of absurdity. They learn that ""a motorway is a very strong wind, and ""a carbine is a beautiful white bird."" A woman's sexual organs are called a typewriter, a zombie is a yellow flower, and Frank Sinatra is their grandfather. The father teaches them that they must be protected from the world because there are cats out there that are ferocious man-eaters, leading the brother to horribly kill a stray cat he sees in the garden with a shearing knife (it is stated that no animals were harmed in the making of the film).On the outside, the siblings are docile, but underneath there are elements of rage that occasionally flare up as when the elder sister slashes her brother's foot with a knife because he was playing with her toy airplane. Though the children have been home-schooled and seem intelligent, they spend their day playing bizarre games such as seeing who can keep their fingers under a hot water tap the longest, and smothering themselves with an anesthetic to see who will be the first to wake up. The insanity is even choreographed to a bizarre dance routine in which the elder sister works herself into such frenzy that she is ordered to stop by her father.The only outside influence comes from Christina (Anna Kalaitzidou), a security guard at the factory the father works at who is brought to the house blindfolded to have uninvolving sex with the brother. Though there is no rape or sexual abuse, there is a physical assault when the elder sister watches a VHS tape of the films Rocky and Jaws in exchange for sexual favors from Christina and is hit over the head with the videos by her father. Viewers get a repeat showing of the father's violent tendencies when Christina is likewise battered with a VCR for ""bringing evil"" into their home.Her presence in the home does have the effect of loosening the household's tightly-woven structure, however, and brings the film to a powerful but ambiguous end. Lanthimos offers few clues as to what he is trying to say and the viewer must decide whether the film is a darkly humorous social/political/economic satire in the tradition of Luis Bunuel, a sci-fi horror story in the mold of Michael Haneke, an attack on capitalism, a reaction to the excesses of home schooling, or something else. Whatever meaning you ascribe to it, Dogtooth is a jarring experience that you are not likely to soon forget.",Dogtooth
19,TheMovieDiorama,Dogtooth mentally conditions its children through meandering tricks.,7,22 February 2019,"Before Lanthimos made a name for himself with western audiences, with the likes of 'The Lobster' and 'The Favourite', his first few films were pure Arthouse. With such a low budget, he was still able to explore his artistic freedom to conceptualise an original depiction on modern life. This includes good old-fashioned cunnilingus, incestuous shoulder licking and hitting children on the head repeatedly with video tapes. Oh yes, this is true Lanthimos. A husband and wife keep their children secluded in an idyllic house, preventing external influences from the outside world polluting their minds.An often dark psychological drama on mental conditioning and the provocative influences of pop culture. How watching Hollywood films and owning materialistic accessories can taint an individual's mind and make them susceptible to modern normality. Lanthimos has created an alternate reality, with this family adhering to their own rules and conditions. Nouns are often substituted with other nouns to produce a surprising amount of laughs. For example, ""I want to lick your keyboard"" is interpreted as ""I want to lick your *insert word for female sexual organ*"". A ""zombie"" is a small yellow flower, and a ""pussy"" is a big light. Simple learned techniques that have been altered to insinuate the father's control over his children. And that is the primary theme in this film, control.The father is perceived to be the trainer to his children, and often treats them like canines. A metaphorical scene, where the father asks for his dog back but is questioned if he wants ""a friend or an animal?"", acts as the conduit for the film's message. It is a visual representation of the ""Pavlov's Dog"" practice, and the small inclusion of external influences starts to manifest a rebellion within the family. Dancing the 'Flashdance' and recreating scenes from 'Rocky' represent the need for pop culture.But of course, in true Lanthimos style, it's not an easy watch. His static wide shots and visual attentiveness enhances the awkward behaviour of his characters. Their stance, execution of dialogue and physical interactions with each other are hard to watch. The performances from the cast, particularly Stergioglou, were frequently unsettling. However, this also acts as a detriment to the film.Lanthimos, despite his visual uniqueness, often leaves his characters meandering. The lack of narrative cohesion instead makes the story feel like a composition of random scenes, with little character development. Arguably the film acts as an insight to this reclusive family, but at only 97 minutes long it certainly feels a lot longer. Also, despite a few humorous moments, it's not as outrageously hilarious as it was made out to be. The black comedy is subtle, very subtle. Yet it seems Lanthimos just couldn't quite fully utilise the family's autocratic rule to its full visionary and comedic potential. As with all Arthouse productions, Dogtooth is a conversational piece. Ambiguous, open-ended and full of surrealism that will provide meaty discussions amongst peers. Also worth noting that hitting your jaw with a dumbbell is not a suitable way to knock out a tooth...",Dogtooth
20,Movie_Muse_Reviews,An examination and social experiment of the extremes of parental censorship,7,22 February 2011,"Think your parents are/were overprotective? Not after ""Dogtooth."" Giorgos Lanthimos' film, the first Greek film to be nominated for an Oscar in more than 30 years, imagines the pinnacle of what sheltering and censorship of children would be like to an absurd degree. A strange and ruminating film that is as fascinating as it is disturbing and unpleasant, ""Dogtooth,"" in all its gratuitousness, embodies everything that a great film should.Told in a series of clips that use a few takes a possible, Lanthimos shows us life in this family's estate. The father (Chirstos Stergioglou) is the only one who ever leaves the premises, while the mother (Michele Valley) and three teenage children, two daughters and a son, stay at home. The mother is wise to it, but the kids only know the outside is dangerous (flesh- eating cats lurk around the fence for one thing) and they will not be able to leave until one of their dogteeth fall out. Of course when you're a teenager, they don't anymore.Lanthimos covers the gamut of technicalities in terms of how this complete cut-off from society could work effectively. Every time the kids discover a word that has something to do with the outside world, the parents explain to them that it's another name for something within the estate walls. For example, the ""telephone"" is salt and ""zombies"" are little yellow flowers. The real airplanes that fly overhead are explained to be nothing but plastic toys that occasionally fall out of the sky (and when one does, the kids run to claim it).The only thing the parents seem to have trouble controlling is human nature, which begins the calamity. The film opens with one of its more perverse facets. Every week or so, the father brings Christina (Anna Kalaitzidou), a security guard from his work, to the estate and pays her to satisfy the sexual needs of the son (Hristos Passalis). Presumably, the parents believe that boys need an outlet for their urges or else they will manifest them in destructive ways, which in this case would upset the very tidy life of this family.As an ""outsider,"" however, Christina brings with her some troubling influences. She somewhat seduces the eldest daughter, who's smitten by her as she would be any guest to the home given the rarity of that occurrence. This, however, brief in the film, influences the eldest's behavior pattern and sets off a series of events.Lanthimos treats his film as an exhibit or exhibition of sorts. Choosing shots carefully and sticking with them for lengthy periods of time, the family becomes a case study. Jumping from scene to scene, the plot thrives on our curiosity as to why the parents have done this and in one what ways it has altered the psychology of the children. Most scenes either show how the parents maintain this grand illusion or how the children come up with games to keep themselves entertained.Yet ""Dogtooth"" leaves its imprint in some explicit and uncomfortable sex scenes as well as a few instances of the father delivering discipline as he sees fit. Although these scenes are not unjustified in some ways because you have to be a bit sick and twisted to run your family like this, I would definitely argue that it's gratuitous and largely for shock value.The reason ""too much"" applies to ""Dogtooth"" comes from its lack of context. Lanthimos expects us to infer motivation for why the parents have set up this world and these boundaries, even so far as crossing ethical lines to maintain it. We see results that create these compelling and complex characters, but do not dive deeply into the psyche. ""Dogtooth"" serves only as a scarily affecting showcase meant warn us about the dangers of censorship and what can occur when manufacturing family and a lifestyle.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Dogtooth

22,billcr12,Strangely Compelling,7,21 May 2012,"David Lynch meets Lars Von Trier is what Dogtooth looks like. Only could someone with their sensibilities come up with something so bizarre as this. A husband and wife live with their two daughters and son in a large, fenced in house with a swimming pool. The high school aged kids have never been outside the home, and know nothing about the world, other than what their parent's tell them. Words, for instance, like keyboard, is substituted for vagina when a visitor is hired to have intercourse with the boy, asks for oral sex from the clueless daughter and Sher describes the act as licking the keyboard; this behavior goes beyond strange. Dad is a control freak who monitors every aspect of his children's lives. The mother just goes along with everything he says. A cat has the misfortune of entering the property and the son, having been warned against the evil creature, kills it with a pair of gardening shears. Daddy tells the boy and his siblings, that in the future, they should get down on all fours and bark at the kitty to scare it off, and to reinforce the point, he has them practice their doggy behavior on the lawn. The girl for hire returns and asks the daughter to once again lick her keyboard. In return, the youngster is given two videotapes, Rocky and Jaws. Her father finds the tapes and beats his daughter over the head with one. He later visits the woman who ""supplied the movie and physically assaults her, while explaining that she is a bad influence. We're not done yet, it's time for some incest. Mommy and daddy come up with the great idea of placing their two daughters in a bathtub with the brother and let him choose one for a little family bonding. After a distasteful encounter, the daughter finally rebels against her wacked out bloodline. What the hell did I just watch?",Dogtooth
23,freemantle_uk,Typical art house bait,5,27 November 2011,"Dogtooth was a highly praised in the English speaking world, earning near universal praise, a nomination for Best Foreign Language and won the Prix Un Certain Regard at Cannes. But it is an example of a film being over-hyped just because it is a foreign language and the time of film the Cannes crowd love but most film fans do not.In a remorse country estate in Greece, three teens (Aggeliki Papoulia, Mary Tsoni and Christos Passalis) live in isolation from the rest of the world. They only contact with the outside world is their parents (Christos Stergioglou and Michelle Valley) and a security guard, Christina (Anna Kalaitzidou) who does sexual favours for their son but ends up getting the eldest daughter to perform oral sex. The teens are also taught weird lessons such as a unusual vocabulary, that cats are the most dangerous creatures known to man and they could only leave the compound when there loose their dogtooth and that the car is only safe way to leave the compound, even if it is a few inches. If the teens step out of line then they receive a slap, a beating or locked away.There are good ideas behind Dogtooth but there were poorly executed and I personally would have made a much different film. I like the idea of a psychological control, teaching the teens to avoid the outside world being almost like battery hens, that the teens are childlike, particularly the boy and that a girl ends up committing sex acts with out realising their significant. But the whole film felt very much like it was all set up and no pay off. There is real drive or plot and they could have been so much they could do with the basic, like the police and social raiding the compounding and the teens have to adapt to ordinary seeing that they have isolated and abuse, that the teen could test the boundaries want to go out the compound, a darker tale where the parents use more violence and sexual violence to keep the teens under control or the parents struggling to keep the teens under control.The director Yorgos Lanthimos does employ using 50s style single shots and lets scenes play out naturally. The simple approach works for the most part and Lanthimos does not hold back with the violence and the sex. But Lanthimos has a very cold and distance sense of direction. It seems like he did not care about the depth of characters or situation that is being played out. The it was very sterile atmosphere and character seems to act very calmly and just did not seem human. The acting from the whole cast is strong throughout and I do not blame the acts. Stergioglou is particularly sinister as the manipulated father. But Lanthimos seem to use violence and sex too much for shock value: the scene were well handled but some were over done, like the killing of a cat.Some commentaries have said Dogtooth was a satire and was funny. There was a scene that was funny, when all the characters were on all fours barking like dogs, but it was funny for all the wrong reasons. There is no satire or funny in this film and it is not much of anything. This is typical art house bait that French cinema snobs enjoy but does not appeal to any other audience. It is for people who have a smug scene of superiority thinking I am clever that I do not watch blockbusters like the plebs. They possibly do not this sort of film anyway.Dogtooth has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 93%, so in theory it should be challenging to be on the IMDb Top 250. But the time I wrote this review it has a 7.2/10 so it have not translated that way and I personally predict the score will fall in the new few years.If you want to watch something about a child or teenager being isolated, taught strange things or being manipulated watch something like Kick-Ass or Hanna. They are both smarter, better written and much more entertaining then Dogtooth.The only reason Dogtooth is getting 5 out 10 is because of the actors, some of the themes and because I can not give it a 4.5/10.",Dogtooth

26,I_Ailurophile,"Dazzingly jarring, frankly horrifying - and outstanding",10,27 September 2021,"Plenty of movies over the years have explored isolation and captivity, and abuse and neglect, but absolutely none quite like this. The very first scene ably imparts the extent of the calculated manipulation, and as awkward and unsettling as it is, the film only ever grows more direly distressing. 'Dogtooth' is as exquisite and fascinating as it is pointedly uncomfortable.While there's marginal progression from start to finish, this is an understated, plainspoken feature with far less emphasis on active narrative than on molding a portrait of this family, and of the carefully cultivated, aloof sequestration forced on the adult children. One moment to the next reveals a level of control and engineered arrested development so absolute as to be sickening and horrific. The movie is one giant content warning for physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, incest, animal cruelty, exploitation, and utmost deliberate neglect (as well as sex, nudity, and violence generally).For all that, the screenplay concocted by director Yorgos Lanthimos with co-writer Efthymis Filippou is deeply, terribly engrossing. Dialogue, characterizations, each subsequent passing scene, and the overall story is rich with astounding detail cementing the meticulously complete regulation, restriction, and purposefully distorted or misrepresented reality placed over the children. It's a marvel, and 'Dogtooth' is as fine in execution as it is in its writing. The picture is vivid and captivating as it plumbs the depths of the siblings' lives, their relationships to each other and their parents, and to the outside world of which they are given false or garbled knowledge. To that end, the cast is phenomenal. No one actor present particularly stands out from their peers in their excellence, but all give performances filled with electrifying range, nuance, and sharp expression and body language to fully inhabit and realize their characters. From the programmed ignorance and perpetual adolescence of the children, to the casual, unembellished behavior and methods of the parents, each part is brought to life with staggering, graceful seeming ease.Though it's left to each individual viewer to perceive and comprehend as they will, there's a point to be made that 'Dogtooth' represents an extreme but symbolic microcosm of daily life, and every person's development. True, reports occasionally surface of individuals who were kept in similarly severe isolation for years, perhaps since infancy, and who therefore experience difficulty adjusting to society. There was one such incident within my school district when I was growing up. More to the point, however - though never to such a profound degree, every parent raises their children in the way they know how, and withhold certain information or truths as they believe circumstantially befits the child's growth and intellectual development. Conversely, every person can in retrospect identify instances where their nurturing - however superficially innocuous, and well-meaning - was perhaps insulated to one extent or another, failing to wholly prepare them for life, provide critical information, or simply expose them to aspects of life which could have helped to shape and guide them more fruitfully. None of this is to say that the case presented in this feature is any less grotesque and startling - but comparisons can be drawn, which illustrates the ingenuity of Lanthimos and Filippou writing, and the impact of the final cut.Unadorned with a score and declining any narrative hooks or twists, the film is brazenly straightforward in its portrayal of the family - no one is even given a stated name, save for characters outside the chief ensemble. This approach to storytelling and film-making no doubt makes the feature an arduous prospect for some viewers, to say nothing of the shrewdly difficult content. Still, the end result is a movie that is endlessly riveting, daringly if underhandedly shocking, and incredibly well made. 'Dogtooth' is a cinematic experience like no other title I can immediately name, and it's very much worth seeking out to watch.",Dogtooth

28,Jonny_Numb,Eraserhead Goes Greek,8,14 March 2011,"In an interview (on the Kino DVD) surprisingly devoid of any deliberate insight, director Giorgos Lanthimos explains that ""Dogtooth"" was conceived not in terms of a linear plot, but as a series of unrelated sequences. Watching the film, that is plain to see. ""Dogtooth"" takes the notion of the dysfunctional family and transforms it into a baby that David Lynch would love and coddle. This Greek production is rife with stark imagery, coded language, and very attractive actors doing heinously antisocial (by our standards of sociability, mind you) things in the face of a unique, purely insular world where the antisocial is indeed the accepted norm. We have a soft-spoken patriarch who works at an unnamed industrial facility (the film contains nary a brand name nor a recognizable reference to anything within popular culture, save for a few key moments), carrying on a guise of bread-winning ""normality."" When he returns home each day, he plays bizarre games with his developmentally challenged adult children (who have no notion of what waits outside the ominously cheerful fence that encircles the isolated acreage), and leaves his grown son to participate in awkwardly graphic intercourse with the female security guard at his facility. When the security guard begins to draw the daughters into her web of seduction (seemingly out of boredom), she threatens to bring the outside world crashing into their consciences, something the patriarch doesn't take kindly to. While sometimes running the edge between bizarre for its own sake and outright pretension, ""Dogtooth,"" in its own hypnotic, stream-of-consciousness manner, manages to fascinate, compel, and haunt in equal measure. It's a sometimes-unpleasant film to view (and many mainstream viewers will be repelled by its stark, morally ambiguous perspective toward sexuality), but its images affix firmly in the mind's eye.7.5 out of 10",Dogtooth

31,EdgarST,A film is a monkey,10,23 April 2015,"In 2009 Greek Yorgos Lanthimos deeply affected planet Earth with his film «Kynodontas», prompting Hollywood to nominate it as Best Foreign Film. By then the movie had already won prizes and nominations by tens in Cannes, Montreal and Sitges (where Lanthimos won the «Citizen Kane» for Best Directorial Revelation, though he had already proved his worth among the connoisseurs with «Kinetta» in 2005). «Kynodontas» as much as people try to sell it as a simple portrait of family dysfunctionality, is more than that. It is a terrifying metaphor of Greek reality, embroiled for more than a decade now in an extremely grave economic, social, ethical and political crisis, preceded of its isolation from the European evolution for more than a century. Above anything else it is a portrait of the Greek bourgeoisie that lives indifferent and perhaps ignorant of that drama, but broken inside, devouring itself, and when it projects itself to the outside world mutilating anything that may threaten the continuation of its privileged status. This social traits and the metaphorical tone of the plot make «Kynodontas» different from the first film that comes to mind while watching it, Arturo Ripstein's «El castillo de la pureza», but otherwise they are much the same, as Ripstein's offers his diagnosis of the cancer consuming a lower middle class family, shut up in an old house in México City, where a fanatical father wants to preserve the integrity, pulchritude and morality of his wife, daughter and son, without realizing that the surrounding world is pulverizing and sinking along with México City. In «Kynodontas» realism does not matter. From that universe, alternatively funny and frightening, where words have different meanings (a zombie is a flower and a vagina is a lamp, for example), and where family members play weird games (as inhaling chloroform and winning the first who wakes up), there is no escape. For no one. The mother, two daughters and son defend home like dogs and behave as such: there is a really horrific shot, in which three of them (literally) bark to the exterior, as trained dogs, deprived of their sense of free movement, incapable of trespassing the front gate of the ""fortress"" where they live.

33,framptonhollis,"creepy, uncomfortable, strange, funny",8,7 March 2018,"O...that was...sure something... So, Yorgos Lanthimos has officially become one of my favorite filmmakers working today and perhaps of all time. He relishes in the kind of absurdity, unpretentious artiness, dry black humor, and disturbing horror/tragedy I love so very dearly, and these elements can all be clearly found in 'Dogtooth', his third and first truly notable film. Here, many important motifs of what has developed into the Lanthimos style can be found and are really mastered. While I personally find 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' to be the better film, I can definitely see some arguments for 'Dogtooth' being the man's masterpiece thus far. It is an original and gross and totally compelling work that kind of feels like what would have happened if the first half hour of 'Bad Boy Bubby' was stretched out to fill up the length of the entire film and just replaced the rest of it all together (if you've seen 'Bubby' you might know what I mean; if not, it's less likely but you still might know what I mean (I hope (I guess))), and, since 'Bad Boy Bubby' is far and away one of my favorite films, any possible comparison to it that is not directly meant to showcase how the non-'Bubby' film is absolute trash in one way or another is a very high compliment. However, I feel like a film like this one should come with some kind of warning. Even for the guy who made stuff like 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer', some of the scenes in here are genuinely shocking. The sexual explicitness far exceeds that of your standard film (American film in particular), and many of the sex scenes do not feel simulated. Now, if you're like me, this is, if anything, a mild-to-moderate plus on the film's part, but if you're a Catholic nun or something I do not recommend it. Anyone else with an open mind and enough patience to sit through an arthouse drama with a slower pace should see this whenever they see fit. It's definitely a unique and, for weirdos like me, somewhat enjoyable (please don't take my usage of that word in the wrong way; I mean, I seriously think the movie is at least a little entertaining, there's plenty of weird, off putting laughs to be had and it is unnerving enough on a minute by minute basis that I was almost always glued to the screen) experience that I'd like to mention also has a very subversive-sort-of visual style, as many of the camera angles are intentionally awkward and just slightly off in some way in order to add to the overall mood of the piece, which is another little motif of Lanthimos (although it is nowhere more apparent than it is here, as many of the shots in a film like 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' (exemplified for the third time in this single review, nice going me) are beautiful to look at and do not feel awkward or off at all and instead are incredibly perfect and necessary, but still do have some uncomfortable atmosphere about them, of course) that I find absolutely fascinating.",Dogtooth
34,bandw,"If you are wanting a different movie experience, look no further",5,24 December 2012,"This story of an authoritarian father, who has restricted his two daughters and son to never leave the family property until they are now young adults, can be interpreted in many ways, among them being:1.) As a satire on the current trend of excessive parental paranoia and control.2.) As a metaphor for a government that implements its oppression by keeping its citizens at the emotional level of docile children.3.) As a comment on the ""nature vs. nurture"" debate.4.) As weirdness.From this list I would choose number 4, since this movie pushed me beyond my limits of tolerance for weirdness.Some scenes are very difficult to watch, like the father beating one of the daughters about the head with a video cassette tape, a tape that she should not have been watching. The scenes of violence are accentuated by amplified audio.There are some sex scenes that are graphic enough to be in a porn movie, but here they are creepy rather than stimulating.

35,Foutainoflife,This Is A WTF Movie,6,3 December 2018,"This is about a family who lives way outside the norms of society. The parents feel that their children will be corrupted by influences of the outside world so they confine them to their fenced in home and yard. The kids look like they are in their twenties but I think they are supposed to be teenagers. It is just a weird movie that doesn't have much of a pay off.No one can say that the movie isn't disturbing. The parents have brainwashed the kids to think they can not leave until their ""dogtooth"" falls out but that isn't something that will ever happen. The children spend their days playing outside, like little children, collecting stickers and occasionally the Dad brings in a woman. The woman is there for the sole purpose of having sex with the son and spending brief amounts of time with the girls, which eventually ends up being sexual encounters as well. There are notable acts of aggression between the siblings but nothing that is too crazy outside of killing a ""man eating and most dangerous"" animal in the world which just so happens to be a cat.While speaking of the cat, I was a little confused about the whole idea of them believing that there was a brother who lived somewhere on the other side of the fence who was killed by a cat. What was that?I was really hoping that this movie was going to give the children the chance to learn of their parents betrayals and therefore inspire a blood-soaked rebellion but that never happened. I was so disappointed. When the film ended, I sat there looking at the screen, asking myself how they could just leave us hanging like that and wondering if the daughter made it out alive or not.This was, once again, disturbing but it is unfulfilling. You just watch the crazy for a while and the movie ends without any resolution. I know I'll never watch it again and if I do remember it, it will be because of how irritating it was to not have had a resolution.",Dogtooth
36,tim-764-291856,"Modern masterpiece, or incoherent claptrap?",7,1 December 2010,"Ambiguous, allegorical - yes, those dictionary terms that only mean that I don't know, you don't and we don't know. If you don't get 'IT', that's up to you and ultimately, your fault.Whilst to many, this sort of alien, hell-on-earth is fascinatingly intriguing, as the weirdness sets in and hypnotises. Already set up by the steady, assured production and accomplished acting, we're on a sort of lets-see-what-we-can-think-of-next scenario.Naturally, I gently questioned the actions, the occasional psychotic violence, the controlling father - and that fence. The most poignant part was when he drove a few feet to just outside their perimeter to retrieve a model plane, then reversed back in again. I explained to my inner self that the sisters licking each other's arms and shoulders etc for 'treats' was something to do with cats - cats being the Devil, as it would seem. Cats aren't and maybe the girls instinctively knew that. The father striking various females with either videotapes or VCRs, I can follow and one can see that if something is seen as a bad influence, in the furthest stretches of the imagination, that might happen, as a punishment. Beyond that, I started to conclude that any screenplay can make up a meaningless language and that any object or verb can be randomly given another name that is totally unrelated. There are simply not enough rational sticking plasters to make any semblance - if it were really clever and had a 'message', then it would have more of these to tease us. I'm glad I watched it and would do so again, except my recorder failed. It's really good to see a Greek offering and it could have been so much worse. There are many moments of quiet, contemplative beauty. Compared by some to Lars Von Trier, whom can be anywhere from excruciatingly bad to exquisitely moving and profound in his displaying of the human soul. The comedy, where it's for purely comic effect could be seen as tasteless, stupid or irritating - or funny. As for the multi-layered incest and sexual encounters, these may be in the fore of the writer's or director's psyche and this film a vehicle for their revelation. Or not. I'm not a psychologist. The fact that, as I recall, all these scenes were completely without emotion; robotic. That, I'm sure was for the film's sake but further diminishes its credibility. The film opens the doors to human reasoning and in line with its intention, I'm doing just that. To me, Dogtooth should be seen as that and not as a masterpiece.",Dogtooth

39,ajs-10,Strangely compelling...,8,2 May 2011,"This Greek film got a lot of praise when it first came out, and I can see why. It's very strange, but at the same time it's strangely compelling. I should point out that it does have subtitles, so if you don't have the patience for them then maybe you're better of not reading further. OK, so with the subtitle haters gone, we shall continue.Three teenage children, two girls and a boy, all live with their parents in a large house in the countryside. A high fence around the property keeps them safe from outside influences. The children are home schooled and are encouraged to compete with each other every day. The son is of an age where he is sexually active and, in order to keep his urges in check, he is visited by Christina who comes every week or so. She is paid by the father who blindfolds her and drives her there and back. They are never allowed outside the compound, in fact they don't want to go outside the compound, but the oldest daughter is getting curious.As I said at the beginning, this is a very strange film; everything about it seems very unconventional. The children are taught that words that mean things from the outside are actually things inside their world. For instance, ""sea"" is a large chair in the living room, or ""zombie"" is a small yellow flower. Even the way the film is made is quite strange; you quite often see shots where everyone's head is above the top of the screen. I found the dialogue really odd at times too, not just the language difference, but the way things are said seems quite bizarre at times.Good performances all round; Christos Stergioglou was excellent as the father, very convincing and Michele Valley did a good job as the mother. Aggeliki Papoulia was also excellent as the older daughter and Mary Tsoni as the Younger Daughter, Hristos Passalis as the Son and Anna Kalaitzidou as Christina all did a good job also.A very compelling film with some scenes of sex and violence that may disturb a few. It always keeps you guessing just what might happen next. Quite controversial with some very unusual views on the world, it will certainly get you thinking. A very even pace all the way through, no incidental music to speak of, but still a very interesting piece. I really enjoyed it Highly recommended.My Score: 8.4/10",Dogtooth
40,itamarscomix,Unsettling,7,18 July 2013,"Whether you take Dogtooth as an allegory or at face value, it's a disturbing and unsettling film. Greek director Giorgos Lanthimos used very naturalistic, realistic presentation and amateur actors to present the surreal story of a family of five living in total isolation in their country estate, the domineering parents creating a clean and controlled reality for their children to protect them from the temptations of the outside world.It's not an easy film to absorb. Lanthimos throws the viewer right into a day in this family's life, and shows every aspect of it without rolling any punches, throwing an explicit (and disturbing) sex scene and some gruesome violence at the audience before they even have a chance to figure out what's going on. The naturalistic photography, uncompromising candor and relentless editing make for a very difficult watch, that many would have the stomach for and few would ever want to rewatch. And while the open ending makes sense, it also makes for a frustrating film with no catharsis that stays more or less still throughout, not quite using up the dramatic potential it starts out with. Still, it's an unusual and gutsy film, worth your time but not recommended for the easily offended.",Dogtooth

There's nothing clichéd about this art film; it has to be taken just for what it is - a close examination of a truly dysfunctional family.The majority of the film is slow; I get that. Every day can't be buckets and buckets of fun. Some of it is melancholy, some bleak, some offering a slight glimpse of happiness, some offering a break from the ennui, and this film is rightly a journey into the tragic unknown.Taboos about in this outing. It really does make you think sometimes. For instance, I sit by the upstairs window in a supermarket and watch people walk in and out of their cars in the parking lot. Is that quiet kid in the yellow shirt being sexually molested by the man holding his hand? Is that woman in the purple jacket buying food for her mother who is tied up to a post in some damp basement somewhere? Is that black-clad couple currently running from the law because both their daughters were accidentally poisoned by the heroin the parents accidentally left exposed out on the kitchen sink? Nothing makes you wonder more, though, than the stunning ending of 'Dogtooth.' It came from nowhere and grabbed me by the jewels. It's so stunning that I've often made references to it in some of my other horror movie posts. Yes, it's a standout and, just that one scene alone, is worth the price of admission.",Dogtooth
42,vostf,Film student would-be-clever artsy-fartsy stuff,3,3 April 2011,"Yes, the story sounds original (although the theme of a sealed-off world and fundamentalist education is nothing new) and it could have been a good film school short. Now, at 90 minutes this is stretching an interesting premise way too far. Full disclosure: I got bored really early on, could perfectly see where this was going and eventually decided to stop watching at the one hour mark.I have watched to the end bizarre and unsettling movies like Eraserhead, but here this is not about the gruesome story. There's very little beyond the would-be-clever diluting of the premise. Talent is here in the acting, so it must be somewhere in directing actors. But on the whole there very little to keep your interest: the storyline is obvious, you're in for no surprises (ah, yes they mistake a couple of shock plot points for a bona fide unpredictable storyline) and the only reason to watch more of it would be to make sure nobody thinks you missed the point for you're not clever enough.Bottom line: a dull movie, with some good acting here and there, taking itself too seriously without delivering anything truly consistent: classic film student stuff.

And sex is one of the recurring challenges in his films.There's a lot more to do with this film than get perturbed by scenes, but there's plenty of that if you wish.One other side note, without telling much, how about the role of a film being somewhat revolutionary within this film. Even if the films are a Rocky and a Jaws... and wasn't the ""name"" of the automated shark used in Jaws, ""Bruce"" by the way.And lastly, well off this fine film, but one of the actresses is in an interesting band, if like me you have warped ears to match your eyes.

His premises are always fun: here, we have a family with 3 kids who are raised with no contact with the outside world and are presented (frequently false) information through the filter of the father. We catch the kids as they are old enough for the disconnect between their age and understanding of the world to be obvious, but also where the balance between control and their own curiosity and learning is tenuous. During the movie I was frustrated because I wanted to understand the motive behind the father's actions, and the details of the set up. Instead, I think it could be reasonably interpreted as a political allegory about authoritarianism, or about parenting and sheltering children. There aren't real plot developments, just strange and unpredictable developments within the constant framework they live under, so once you've gotten past the shock of the premise it isn't too exciting. Sexual curiosity and exploration is the most emphasized and straightforward manifestation of their independence, and leads to some amusing scenes. I like the ending symbolically - the oldest daughter finally decides she has to go into the world to learn about it, so she knocks out her dogtooth and hides in the back of the car. Of course, she doesn't know anything about how the world works, so she suffocates back there, and the movie ends on that. Extremely strange movie that I think achieves its goals, but it's just so strange and exclusively driven by its ideas that work on a metaphorical but not always a literal level that I am not fully satisfied.",Dogtooth
45,loganx-2,They Lost Their Lives In Backyards,8,16 March 2011,"Dogtooth is a film about a family who has never let their children of out of the house.I say ""children"" but by the time we see them they are well into their 20's, the eldest perhaps even her early thirties.So that they do not become confused when reading one of the very limited, and in all probability, heavily redacted books, in their home the parents have taken the time to replace certain unknown words with more tangible ones.The ""sea"" they are told is the word for the armchair in the living room, a ""zombie"" is a small yellow flower, and a ""pussy"" is a large bright lamp. ""For example ""If you turn out the 'pu$$y' the room will plunge into darkness"", the mother tells her inquisitive daughter.I am perhaps giving you too much information up front, the film is largely silent in passages, preferring to tell its story visually and subtly.It's not until a substantial way into the film that are we are told what ""Dogtooth"" means. What we do see and quite early on is that the father brings a blindfolded woman to his home regularly to have sex with the son, who has become increasingly aggressive toward the fence which separates him from the outside world.Lacking any understanding about why he hates the fence he can only taunt it and hurl objects at it, while suggesting that he can do a better job of cleaning the carpet than it ever could.A haze of cognitive dissonance pervades everything.This is all deeply disturbing, and things only get worse as they continue on. Some of you who have seen the 1968 horror film ""Spider Baby"" also about three adults living and functioning as children and living out a macabre combination of extreme innocence and violence, may experience a sense of deja vu.""Dogtooth"" like ""Spider Baby"" is also full of pitch black and bleak comedy, but in Dogtooth the comedy is more brutal, surreal, incisive, and believable.The three children of ""Dogtooth"" having grown up with all things equal begin to become aggressive as the new visitor (the woman brought to have sex with the son) becomes something they cannot share, and begins herself to exert her new found celebrity over other members of the house.We don't get any background as to how this family began or why. We can't understand the parents motives any more than the children could. When silent the family resembles a scene of domestic perfection (the children clad in white), but when the parents speak they sound mysterious and absolute as Gods on a distant mountain.If you were or have ever met someone who was had a prolonged and sheltered upbringing you might note a familiar childishness in the small gestures of the actors. It's not just that they are pretending to be children, they are intelligent enough to realize something is wrong with the world, but lack any background knowledge that would tell them what it is.In a scene which recalls Luis Buneul's ""The Exterminating Angel"" (about a party where the guests find themselves unable to leave for reasons that never get explained) the children watch their father leave for work at the edge of the open gate, peering out, but not daring to cross the threshold, like an invisible forcefield had been thrown up at the edge of the driveway. They are told the only possible way to leave the house is in the car. The floor is hot lava.""Dogtooth"" is a satire, of the perfection of the nuclear family, the idea that children can be raised without being contaminated by the rest of the world, but its execution is so ruthless and comical that its easy to forget that its about anything else than a family living in their own private universe. What does freedom mean when the word for freedom might translate to ""wood shed""?From this train of thought, outside of the obvious hypocrisies of the parents and the deeply uncomfortable sexual episodes (akin to the thematically similar ""Splice""), we can see a variety of questions emerge about the role language plays in shaping reality (never have Orwell's notions of a limited language creating limited human beings been better expressed), and the reactionary feelings many people have to modern technology (which revolves for better and worse around communication).We don't know exactly why the parents have done this terrible thing to their children but we almost understand their need to create their own perfect world, as instinctively as the son understands that the fence is his natural enemy.Dogtooth is a very cerebral horror film and if you have dark sense of humor, also an exceptional domestic comedy. It's rare that I am shocked in a movie, but there were many moments in ""Dogtooth"" were my jaw was on the floor, or my hands defensively covering my face to keep the images away.Everyone may see something different in ""Dogtooth"" ""it's about the homogenizing effects of capitalism"", ""the horrors of traditional patriarchy"", ""a critique of modern Greek politics"", and they may all be right, when a movie has an ending as devastating and tension filled as the ending here, such considerations take a back seat.""Dogtooth"" takes us into this world of inverted logic, wicked parents, and disastrous siblings rivalries, a place where you might sit on the sea under the gentle light of the pu$$y with a zombie in your hair and reflect on all that you've seen and done and then on the much larger region of all that you don't know, haven't done, and can only vaguely imagine if at all.http://doormouseetc.blogspot.com/",Dogtooth

Some of it makes absolutely no sense at all. Some of it does but it's very disturbing.And I hate it when animals are killed in a film.

49,avik-basu1889,A fascinatingly weird depiction of Institutionalisation !!!,8,28 September 2015,"'Dogtooth' is a 2009 Greek film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. It is well known for its brutal and an almost transgressive portrayal of the effects of Institutionalisation and lack of exposure to the outside world. It received an Academy Award Nomination for best Foreign Film. Its plot explores a family whose members remain unnamed throughout. There is a father who serves as the patriarch. His wife is somewhat subservient in nature. This couple consciously isolate their three children from the rest of the world by not allowing them to venture outside the premises of their home. The conception of the world for these children remain completely based on what they are taught by their parents which in some cases are comically flawed. But this claustrophobic atmosphere gradually has an effect on them which leads to a remarkable climax.Some people have claimed that this film is heavily influenced by an obscure Mexican film named 'The Castle of Purity'. Some have even accused Lanthimos of blatantly ripping-off the mentioned Mexican film and after reading the synopsis to the Mexican film, I can understand some of the claims. But the fact that I haven't yet had an opportunity to watch 'The Castle of Purity' makes me unqualified to make a judgement on the extent to which the two films are similar and hence I will refrain from commenting on this issue.'Dogtooth' is one of those films that while watching will make you mentally ask yourself on multiple occasions - 'What the hell am I watching?' It goes to disturbing extremes to depict the effect that isolation can have on people. These children in the film have remained exactly that i.e. children throughout their lives. They haven't been allowed to get exposed to the outside world by their parents. Their reality is an alternate one to ours and all their beliefs and ideas have been shaped and moulded by their parents.Although its bleak and disturbing, but the themes that Lanthimos is exploring are very deep and social. There are many ways in which the film can be viewed and accordingly interpreted. The film can be viewed as a damning indictment on home schooling. It can be seen as a commentary on the evils of having overprotective parents. In a broader sense, you can view it as an allegory for living in a totalitarian state. It can also be seen as a film having feminist ideas about living in a patriarchal society where the men decide how you should behave and how things should be and the women are denied the right to have opinions and feelings. It can be seen as an allegory for organised religion where the followers believe what they are told and their views and opinions are shaped by the sold called 'holy' men. The ending for the film is pitch perfect. It strongly underlines the significance of a person's upbringing and childhood. This theme was hinted at and touched upon in 'A Clockwork Orange'. Lanthimos, i think with that ending told us that no matter how hard you try to get rid of your past, you will always find yourself trapped and unable to relieve yourself of the ideas and morals that you were fed by your parents.Lanthimos actually juxtaposes the dark and depressing content of the film with bright visuals and colourful cinematography which lends it a 1970s look. There is some disturbing violence and some disturbing sexual content in the film which is appropriate considering the disturbing style of the film, but it sort of renders it unsuitable for some audiences. The style of camera work does remind me of Michael Haneke due to the manner in which some of the scenes are allowed to take place through long static camera shots. But another important aspect of the film is the humour. There are some bits of dark comedy scattered throughout the film.The acting is effective. The characters are supposed to be weird and distant. They are supposed to show a distinct lack of passion and all the actors portray the characters suitably. The only issue that I have with the film is that it's not a film that I can come back to again and again. The cold, distant characters and the distant style of the direction and the narrative makes it essential for the viewer to be in a specific mood to watch 'Dogtooth'. It's certainly not a film for all occasions. After watching this, I wanted to take a shower and watch something like 'My Fair Lady' and I think the director was trying to induce such an effect and I count that as a success.",Dogtooth
50,eagandersongil,The essence of the human being is always born,9,27 August 2017,"A cold film that is both hot, tense, shocking and disturbing, dazzling human nature in a sarcastic and absurd way, Yorgos Lanthimos' ""Canine Tooth"" is a driving lesson where technical and creative resources talk so much. To the point of making the viewer believe in the complete absurdity of the plot of the great Greek director's work. The script of the film seems simple, basic, and maybe even silly, telling the story of a father and a mother who raise their 3 children (already in their 25s), just inside the house, making them believe that the world outside Is dangerous and taught them the distorted concepts of the world, the script tells us this story, but what is in between the lines is much bigger, it is worth to emphasize that even with the one and a half hour of film, the family is very well developed to the Everything, and is not missing just a little individual development of each character. Yorgos shows us a bit about the deconstruction of human nature, even with the 3 young people learning distorted and disconnected concepts and values, nature is there, the ambition to explore, the natural development of sexuality, the search for subterfuges to achieve freedom Even at the expense of blood), even the sense of economy is present, for even without the 3 young people knowing what it is, a barter trade is born between them, and even aggressiveness and civil obedience are shown as inherently high To the human being, we can change its world, change the name of everything, create mythologies and limits, but gradually the human being is awakened from and born independently of society. The thing that most skips the eye on the technical part is the camera, the camera angles can be used to magnify a character, to vilify a character, to humanize a character, and so on. Here the angles do not start at all, they are cold, they do not seek character from anybody, they simply transmit the story to us in a completely impartial way, it seems sometimes as if we were seeing a house camera, like a big brother, with angles Badly positioned, and characters out of the corner, this is purposeful because the characters have no name, we have no sense of where the story goes, nor what made the family to do it or their childhood, nothing more fair than The filming is also cold and indifferent, because we, the viewers, have to complete these gaps, photography does not say much, even though it is always very clear, we do not use warm colors, we have a palette pulled to a blue, Besides, there is the good soundtrack, and the good assembly. The performances of this film are frighteningly cool and realistic, even with that half- robotic tone (which is a feature of the Yorgos films), the performances do not sound cheesy or over-exaggerated, they are exactly as they should be. Yorgos Lanthimos is an interesting guy, reminds me a lot of the dinamaquês Lars Von Trier, his style and his approach, Yorgos is a guy with very few films in his career, but already it is good to keep an eye on him.

52,flicklover,Typical supposed art garbage!!!,3,1 December 2018,"This Greek film got a lot of praise on the festival circuit in 2009. Like most European art films critics loved it. I was curious to see the film. The premise sounded interesting. The very thin story is about a couple of parents that have raised their three kids without having them leave their home. The kids are now teenagers. The father tells them that they can only leave the house until their dogtooth falls out. Two girls and one boy. The parents are so determined to shield them from the outside world that they even change the meaning of certain words. The father is the only one who can leave the house. He goes to work at his factory. He does bring a young woman that works for him to their house in order to have sex with his son. He doesn't want to get know where they live so he blindfolds her when he drives to his home. She has sex with the son a couple of times but the next time she asks him to give her oral sex. He refuses. So the woman approaches one of the girls and offers a gift if she does what her brother didn't do. The fork agrees. The curious girl then goes to her sister and makes the same offer. The next the woman comes to ask the girl to satisfy her, the girl demands that she give her a couple of VHS tapes that she brought. She finally agrees. Tge girl sneaks to the VCR one night and watches the videos. In turns out that they are Hollywood films. The girl is so taken by what she sees that begins to act out and repeat the lines from the films. She quotes ROCKY and JAWS. The father finds out about this and takes the videos and hits her repeatedly with one of them. He goes to his employee and attacks her for corrupting his kids. Being that the woman won't be back, the parents have the son choose one of his sisters to have sex with. The father has such control over his kids that he has them act like dogs. The parents have an anniversary so the their two daughters dance for them. When one the girls gets tired the other one continues. She proceeds to perform the moves from FLASHDANCE until she gets tired. Later, in desperation to leave the house she goes into the bathroom and hits herself hard in the mouth with an exercise weight to knock her dogtooth out. She goes to her father's car and hides in the trunk so she could leave when her father goes to work the next day. The father finds blood and tooth pieces in the sink in the bathroom. The whole family looks for her frantically but they don't find their sister. The next day the father goes to work and still doesn't notice that his daughter is in the drunk. Credits.Let me say that this a film that dares you to keep watching. Their are moments of explicit sex and violence that are off putting so if you are easily offended stay away . The film is really a black comedy that really isn't that funny. The premise is interesting but the film is just offputting. It isn't the most violent or sexually explicit film I have ever seen but the it is the typical art film that goes to great extents to make its point. The film I believe comments on the lies that parents and even society tells children to control them. That is a worthy topic but just because a film goes to the worst parts of human nature and isn't a fairy tale like a lot of films that come from Hollywood doesn't necessarily make it good. This film is the typical art piece that gets accolades from snobby critics and filmgoers. I beg to differ. This film takes an intriguing premise and wastes it.",Dogtooth

54,dommercaldi,Yorgos Lanthimos Just Being Yorgos Lanthimos,8,24 April 2020,"Pros:
1. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the grainy imagery helps to cement a constant feeling of unease.
2. The scene where the Son (Hristos Passalis) disembowels the cat in the garden is incredibly shocking and visceral.
3. Christos Stergioglou (Father), Hristos Passalis, and Angeliki Papoulia (Older Daughter) all give great performances.
4. The movie provides an amazing insight into the lives of a Mother (Michele Valley) and Father who inoculate their children from the outside world in order to raise them untainted. It's simultaneously fascinating, crazy, and mind-blowing, especially when the children think that a cat is an enemy and they have no idea as to what a pussy is.
5. The ardently formal and straightforward dialogue is not only a hallmark of Yorgos Lanthimos (Director), but it is also a brilliant attention-to-detail for people who haven't learnt to converse properly with other humans.
6. The violence, though only really making an appearance in the third act, is exceedingly brutal and uncomfortable.
7. The ending is suitably depressing and mind-blowing.Cons:
1. The first 30 minutes drag as nothing much happens.
2. The plot, in large portions, just goes round in circles and doesn't feel like it's progressing.",Dogtooth

The father has shielded his family - that includes his wife, two daughters, and son - from the outside world by building a huge fence around their home that only the father may leave out of, occasionally bringing by a hooker named Christina to satisfy his son's sexual urges. He often uses bizarre methods such as having the family get on all fours and bark like a dog, gives new meanings to otherwise ""Harmful"" words, and beating his children on the head with a VHS. (Confused yet?) But when Christina grows tired of the son's daily routine, she seeks services from the eldest daughter, who starts to grow more rebellious, which threatens to shatter the whole world the father has invented.I'm gonna give high praise to the feel of the film. The cinematography, atmosphere, and tone are very unsettling, and rightfully so. I also have higher praise for the film's talent. It's finely performed through subtlety and body language, and features one of the year's best performances, leading or supporting, by an actress, courtesy of Aggeliki Papoulia. I'd be willing to call Dogtooth a good movie, if it weren't for the fact that it just ISN'T a good movie.The film is unforgettable, both a good and bad thing. Good because of reasons mentioned earlier, but bad because it doesn't know what to do with them. The screenplay is very disturbing, original, but the film is often just unpleasant to watch. Some scenes that look like they were intended for comedy are really not funny, they're just jaw droppingly outrageous. And the film's finale is almost successful in bringing it's theme of the dangers of shunning the outside world full circle, but no cigar.Dogtooth was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Feature about a week ago, and seeing the film, I really don't know how that's possible. The film is violent, slow, and is not the type of movie they usually give this award to. The nomination is inspired, but it's simply too off-putting to actually win.I give Dogtooth **1/2 out of ****",Dogtooth
56,PipAndSqueak,Uninformative view of family dysfunction,4,9 May 2010,"Every nation seems to produce its own version of a perverted and incestuous family group; Fritzl in Austria, Rosemary and Fred West in the UK. Doubtless there is a real family in Greece on which this film could have been based. What is obvious in all these cases is that it is not just one of the adults acting alone. There is collaboration both within and outside the family. Why is this odd and damaging behaviour never challenged? Unlike Michael Haneke's brilliant film 'White Ribbon', 'Dogtooth' is a useless depiction of sexual perversion, family psychological and physical violence, incest and all the other crap that keeps the dirty raincoat brigade happy. It was no surprise to note several people leaving the auditorium before the end. There is no point to this film other than to show in graphic detail examples of behaviour that should only ever be heard about in a court room. This film should only be kept by social workers and counsellors who have to work with the victims of the abuse it depicts. Everyone else, keep away from this pollution.",Dogtooth

I may like what many people make out of Shakespeare but when I check the sources, it just isn't there. The wisdom and beauty was interpreted. What I found was just another glorification of power and all the other shenanigans going on in this abomination that we call ""society"". It seems, that this film is Shakespeare to some. What I find, however, is just another warning against setting yourself apart from ""society"". I know, that some people have interpreted the film just the other way around but I'm sorry to have to tell them that this is just a figment of their splendid imagination and nothing that this film can boast with. It's as it is with all successful ""art"" (as opposed to the mostly unsuccessful, yet in hindsight most successful, real art) being sold by the most impertinent of bulls-t artists: the better you sell, the more you get. I give this film 2 stars and not 1 because it still shows how far people can go in their delusions and imagined horrors (""war on terror"" etc), thereby creating real horrors. However, the film ""The Valley"" did this much better. Another reason for giving this film 2 stars is the full frontal nudity and strangely unattractive sexual content, which, in spite all nudity, did not arouse me ever so little. That is, in a way, an achievement. Just to make sure that I am properly understood: I would have loved to see a film in which parents successfully protect their children from the bad influences of this abomination we call ""society"" and how these children don't have to be blocked out from the abomination because they are immune to it. That, for sure, this film does not show.",Dogtooth
58,noahgibbobaker,Justifiably weird.,8,9 December 2020,"Dogtooth is my introduction to Yorgos Lanthimos, now I can't wait to dive into more of his work. The screenplay by Efthymis Filippou and Lanthimos is fantastic, the dialogue is very peculiar, it could be seen as pretentious or weird just for the sake of it, but that's absolutely not the case. The weird dialogue serves a major purpose and was my favourite thing about this brilliant film.I loved almost everything about Dogtooth. The comparison between these children's lives and captive dog's lives. The original and absolutely fascinating idea. The concept actually brings up a lot of questions about how much control parents have over their children. The use of interesting, unique sounds to create the score was nice to see. I love music and hearing original sounding music composed, not only in films, but in general. These days interesting music is refreshing and something I really appreciate. I'm not one of those people who thinks all modern music I had either, but I do hate the lack of variety in mainstream music.I have some issues, one of them is very insignificant but I'm going to mention it anyway. One of my insignificant issues is the scene with the cat, I recently got a kitten and I can confirm that cat would have run away after a mere glimpse of a person, like I said, insignificant issue. An issue that is far more important is the tone, some moments seem unintentionally funny when the tone feels serious. This is most prominent during the barking scene. The acting was mostly great, Christos Stergioglou, Hristos Passalis and Angeliki Papoulia were fantastic. But Mary Tsoni's performance felt really cartoonish and I found it hard to take seriously.I didn't want this review to go on for too long so that's why I didn't expand a few of my points like I usually would.

60,asifahsankhan,"A ""zombie"" is a ""flower,"" while ""pussy"" means ""light""?",9,27 June 2017,"""Dogtooth"" —(Greek: Κυνόδοντας) is a ""Un Certain Regard"" (which recognises works that are either ""innovative or different"") prize winner at Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award nominated 2009 Greek film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. (only the fifth Greek film so honoured).The movie is made more from concepts than from imagery. Example? Most likely, the scene that makes the biggest impression is the one that best encapsulates the family's strange rituals. To celebrate their parent's wedding anniversary, the two girls perform an awkward, shuffling dance, as invented by two children who have no knowledge of choreography, while their brother accompanies them on guitar. After the younger girl bows out, the rebellious older one begins throwing her body around with bizarre, manic abandon, until her parents object to this display of individuality.The Movie: ""Dogtooth"" — follows a family so gripped by its patriarchal system that the entire reality and perception of the unit is distorted to horrific proportions. The father (Christos Stergioglou) is lying to himself that, by bringing up his son and two daughter's to be scared of leaving the house, is for their benefit rather than his. This idea is shown to be at its most extreme as all three of the ""children"" are in their early twenties and have clearly been brought up without a normal education; they believe that outside the house lies danger, that planes going over land in the garden and are in fact toys. They even believe that cats are deadly and end up killing one in fear with a set of hedge shears. The illusion, however, is being stretched by the natural instinct of their age, with the gradual questioning of the twisted father leading to some form of rebellion. The brother (Hristos Passalis), whose sexual demands are met by a paid nurse (Anna Kalaitzidou) who visits on occasions, is not being brought up to replace his father's patriarchal position (in spite of sleeping with his sister when the nurse is found out to be supplying them with sweets and a video), which suggests that this is more than simply the product of a male dominated family unit but the concluding product of a paranoid, power hungry father whose love has twisted into the most perverted kind of over-protection.",Dogtooth
61,pivic,Brilliant way past the hard core,9,21 June 2011,"This is one of the more disturbing films of late, not only/much because of what goes on in the action and the inaction in the film, but more of its concepts and how it translated into my own life. I shan't say too much about the plot of the film, but everything evolves around a family: mom- and-dad, girls and one boy. The children are confined and the parents seem to have made up a world for them, a world that does not have much in common with my own. Having watched this film, I continually got the feeling that its makers tried to hold up a mirror of sorts to the viewer. While a lot of people might think ""Oh, what a horrid family! What doings! Such victims! The father!"" I think the energy could be used to see other things in our own lives in the very same way. For instance, what's sane about the way we keep organised religion alive, and safeguard it? How about censorship? Or, in a more micro-cosmic way, who are we to judge?

62,RockPortReview,Bizarre and Original beyond belief!,9,27 January 2011,"Dogtooth 1/26/2011This Greek film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos won a special award at the 2009 Cannes Film festival and is quite possibly one of the most bizarrely original films I have seen in years. It's about trying to raising your kids without the influences of the outside world. It's the age old question of nature versus nurture. At the end of the day you just have to trust and hope that your kids will make the right decisions. But how these parents raise these kids is a bit strange to say the least.This family of five has three teenage children (two girls, one boy) that live is a fenced off compound on the edge of town. We never learn any of family members' names as they are just referred to as Eldest daughter, Younger daughter and Son. The Father is obviously a fiercely controlling man and quite possibly stark raving mad, who owns a local factory. The Mother is the kids teacher and your basic homemaker, although is firmly under the control of the Father. The teens have never been outside the high fences of their house and have no idea how the rest of the world lives. There is a television but all they can watch is home movies. What's even stranger is the vocabulary they are taught, with basic words having completely different meanings. The sea is a leather chair, a motorway is a strong breeze, and a zombie is a little yellow flower. In this world the Father has created, he is fighting against nature itself and has contingency plans and explanations for anything that might pop up. He uses Listerine as a punishment. The airplanes that fly overhead are really just toys. The cat is the most fearsome, man eating animal around. They hold family contests for stickers. The kids are also told they have another brother who has been banished from the family and is forced to live on the outside because he was being bad. There is no end in describing how strange this family is. The only outsider that is allowed in is a female security guard from the Fathers factory named Christina (the only named character). She is paid to have sex with the son to quell his urges, but when Christina requests that he go down on her, he refuses. Afterwards while talking to the Eldest daughter, who is fascinated by the sparkling headband that Christina wears, comes up with a new plan. Christina gives her things from the outside in exchange for ""licking her"". The Teens are such a model of perfect innocence that to them licking a person anywhere on their body can be exchanged for favors. The Eldest daughter bargains for some actual movies that she finds in Christina bag, but when the Younger daughter squeals on her. The Father is infuriated that his Children have been contaminated by this vile woman. He goes and beats Christina with a VCR, then beats the Eldest Daughter with a VHS tape duct taped to his hand. With that the Father is no longer willing to trust anyone from the outside, so he has the Eldest Daughter replacing Christina to have sex with the Son. At dinner the kids are told that they are not able to leave home until they have lost a Dogtooth. After the eldest daughter's experiences, she wants out so bad that she knocks out a bunch of her own teeth including a Dogtooth. She then goes and hides in the trunk of the car and waits to leave. The end. This is really one of those movies that needs to be seen to be believed. It is definitely is not for everyone. If it was rated it would be NC-17 for its handful of graphic sex scenes. But don't let that deter you, see it!",Dogtooth

64,WubsTheFadger,Dogtooth,8,17 February 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, I'm not a big fan of foreign films, but this one blew me away. The story is mysterious and tense throughout the entire film. The plot is dark, disturbing, and at time horrifying. The dialogue is mostly good but there are some dodgy moments. The story shows how impressionable the human mind is and how we can be driven mad by the abuse and secrecy of others. The only part of the story that I don't like is the fact that there are a lot of unanswered questions.The acting is all around great. Christos Stergioglou, Michele Valley, Hristos , and Anna Kalaitzidou perform well. Angeliki Papoulia and Mary Tsoni bring a pure sense of innocence to the screen. They both perform above standard and truly captivated me with their stellar performance.The pacing is mostly smooth and the runtime is perfect. The amount of nudity is not that bad and the amount of gore is minimal (I had heard that it was worse).Pros: Disturbing story, great acting, amazing performances by Angeliki Papoulia and Mary Tsoni, good runtime, and a good use of nudity and goreCons: Some dodgy dialogue, some slow pacing, and a lot of unanswered questionsOverall Rating: 8.1The only other foreign film I have seen besides this is The Hunt which I loved.

He has facilitated this by limiting their education; their exposure to anything that might teach them anything. As a consequence, the children seem innocent, retarded, and crazy all at once. And, of course, this all comes to some kind of head in the end.This movie is an offbeat, quirky experience. It's like voyeuristically watching the doings in a private insane asylum.

67,Der_Schnibbler,Laughable,1,4 December 2012,"Two weirdo parents keep their three children locked in the house by brainwashing them from birth that the outside world is dangerous. The kids never leave the house for fear of death. In a further effort to confuse, the parents intentionally teach the kids erroneous definitions for words. ""Telephone"" means salt, and ""sea"" means sofa.This would've been an interesting idea, except that the film is as interesting as watching a blade of grass grow. The dialog is slow, agonized, and stilted. At one point the dad plays a Frank Sinatra song, which he has told the kids is their grandfather singing, and ""translates"" it for them in real time. His translation is simply propaganda, wholly unrelated to the lyrics. Problem is, it's RETARDED. There is NO SUSPENSE IN THIS FILM WHATSOEVER.

The film leaves the viewer without any explanation whatsoever throughout the film: off center compositions, endlessly dragging dialogue, slowness, silence, unlogical behavior - you can have it all!
The film confuses you as much as the kids in this isolation are: they name knifes as telephone. Why are there so many stickers on their bedframes? Why did they see the home video VHS like a million times and can chant the dialogue from it? Why is the boy frozen in front of the hedge at the border of their grounds? Why are cats the worst animals and why did their ""brother"" die outside their grounds?
The atmosphere is damp and dull, slowly we get introduced to domestic violence, run-down ethical behavior, weird believes about the world... and two nearly dictatorial parents, lying to their kids on and on.
I got strangely uncomfortable watching this film, it is such a surreal, grotesque mess - violence, psychological pain, dominant parents that do not really care (or care strangely wrong) about their offspring... it gave me super chills and I stayed glued to my seat to see what happens next... also for finally some explanations that the film never gives the viewer. Be prepared to not get a ""solution"" to this mess, at least not a real one...

70,magnuslhad,engrossing,8,1 September 2015,"Parents confine their grown children to their home. This seems to have been the state of affairs for all their lives. The limits of the world for the boy and two girls are the walls of their spacious compound. They have been brainwashed to believe the outside world is hostile. Only the father leaves the compound, and only in his car. The narrative invites a number of interpretive possibilities, the most obvious being that this is an allegorical take on the limits society imposes on us. The father tells his three apparently nameless children that the outside world is toxic. He administers outside influences in carefully controlled doses - music is mistranslated, even language itself mutates to suit the needs of control. The son's sexual urges are taken care of by a prostitute. The sexual needs of the girls seems not to be a consideration. Paradoxically, it is the outside world seeping into the curious minds of the children that brings a resolution of sorts. You are never sure exactly what is going on, but this film compels from moment to moment, and fashions a surprising plausibility from startling circumstances.",Dogtooth
71,timmy_501,The human condition reduced to an absurdity,9,11 June 2010,"Dogtooth is not a comedy. The absurd situations in this film became humorous several times but I always choked on my laughter as the subject matter was too serious to be funny. The film is about three young adults who live with their parents in a large but isolated walled compound; the two young women and the young man have no knowledge of the world outside of this place and not much of the world inside of it. In fact the parents deliberately mislead them with nonsense on nearly every topic, for instance they claim that men are commonly killed by cats. Additionally, the siblings are taught the wrong words for certain objects and concepts, thus a ""salt shaker"" becomes a ""telephone."" These young people have been given a mostly carefree extended childhood at the cost of ever having any autonomy or knowledge. The parents' theory seems to be that the world is a terrible place and contact with it is more damaging than an isolated life. This Eden-like setting is a blessing and a curse: the characters are free of most problems that face normal people; they have no real responsibility and thus no worry. Still, like any human they yearn for answers and they have a certain half formed desire to be the masters of their own destinies. Further, in what seems to be a recent development the children are seeking an outlet for their sexual needs; while the parents can prevent them from being exposed to any stimulus they cannot stop biological urges from surfacing. Any solution to this problem is bound to upset the already fragile artificial world in which they live.The implications of this film can be applied to any number of societal relationships. The connection these siblings have with their parents is quite similar to the affiliation between a citizen and his government or a believer and his religious institution. The film implies that for any of these relationships to work the individual must forego intelligence and blindly follow the institution although this sort of obedience is contrary to human nature. At the same time, the few people in charge must play their part perfectly in order to keep the trust they've been given; this proves just as difficult for the leaders as the followers, here for example when the parents allow themselves things forbidden to the children and inevitably draw unwanted attention.Dogtooth is a film that raises all sorts of questions about the individual and the society he is forced to play a part in and it encapsulates these questions into a deceptively simple plot. Wisely, rather than answer these questions the film leaves these questions to be pondered by the viewer even as it neatly reduces the entire question to the absurd.",Dogtooth

I was surprised therefore to find it was a delightful and very very funny film. That's not to say that it doesn't have some disturbing scenes but they are far outweighed by the charm and comedy (and comic timing) on display here.The concept of having children who have never been exposed to the outside world and don't understand the things we take for granted makes it possible to see many of the absurdities and insanities of modern life. The resultant behaviour of the children in their teens often has a unique charm as well as the dark edge that everyone else seems to have seen. When one of the girls, who has never seen a film except of her family, is exposed to Rocky and Jaws her subsequent behaviour is falling on the floor funny for the most part. There is also an utterly charming sequence in which the two girls perform a dance for the family. Imagine a dance performed by someone who has never seen dancing before but has seen Rocky and incorporates some of Stallone's training routine into the dance. There is also a very funny sequence involving a Frank Sinatra recording.OK there is violence, incest, abuse and general darkness but to me this was far outweighed by the charm and humour of the piece. It was exactly the right length coming in at just over 90 minutes - any more would have been stretching it too far. The ending too was just perfect.",Dogtooth

And all you can feel is a sense of horror, because you want this story to end fast, but also end well for the children, but you know with every passing minute that the possibility of something like that happening is almost non-existent.Christina's dream where the son is the zombie, is also his two other siblings for the duration of this movie. And the only time one of them exhibits behavior that at least somewhat familiar to us in the audience is when art in the form of movies get involved. Or at least to me it was.Dogtooth can also be perfectly interpreted to politics and religion, but I'm certain that that is analysis done already.It was certainly a shocking movie that stayed consistent and true to form for the entire duration of its runtime.",Dogtooth

So is this movie good. I found it to be extremely good and very refreshing. I have literally not seen anything even remotely like this film in my life. The story is beyond quirky, as well as perverted, sadistic, with moments that can make you feel a little squeamish, all without being a horror movie, in fact I found this movie to be very comical. The basic premise is about a family where the children have been isolated their entire lives from reality. The movie shows what happens when a father and mother team up to teach their children their own version of reality, including a vocabulary existing of well existing words, but with the family's own definition. For example keyboard means vagina in their world. I won't go into the incredibly complex plot or what happens, but I will say this movie touches on taboo subjects such as incest. So is this movie for everyone, HELL NO! This movie is not just somewhat cerebral it is both disturbing at times and highly avant-garde.

79,ryanpersaud-59415,Welcome to the Greek Weird Wave,8,15 November 2021,"The Good: You either get Lanthimos or you don't. It's really as simple as that. Lanthimos' films are characterized by dark subject matter, people and places that exude a weird, alternate humanity, extremely dry humour and absurdism out the wazoo. In Dogtooth, we see these elements before they become refined in his later films, but it's almost more effective because of this. This isn't a ""weird"" world that Lanthimos has created; it's a pocket world inside of our normal one, which ultimately makes the film more tragic and emotional.This is a very dark story and could have been told a way that emphasizes the cruelty, injustice and terror. It isn't. Dogtooth is instead absolutely hilarious (if you're into dark humour) and sardonic. It's quite possibly one of the best examples of a film that marries tragedy and comedy together so seamlessly.The performances here (possibly because of the language) aren't as overtly inhuman as in his later films, but the characters give UNBELIEVABLY good physical performances. They are grown adults who lose themselves in their performances as children, and I barely noticed their ages as the film went on.Unfortunately, that implication means there is a lot of disturbing stuff in Dogtooth. Particularly regarding coercive sex and incest. This is not a movie that is for everyone; but I like that Lanthimos did not shy away from the central theme of control based cults like this one: sex. It is directly responsible for the most disturbing scene in the movie (by far) and left me shaken.I also appreciate how this film doesn't really hold your hand; the story is simple, but nothing is spelled out for you. For a large portion of the movie, the audience is asked to piece the film together. For those use to Hollywood hand holding (and restraint), this will be an adjustment.The Bad: That being said, I do have to admit that this movie takes a while to get going. The intention of slowly revealing information and trusting the audience's patience is great; but they may get carried away with it for the first 20 minutes or so. I will admit I turned the movie off at a point when it just felt like it wasn't going anywhere. But, stick with this one (if you're not TOO put off by the beginning).The Ugly: Giorgos Lanthimos is one of my favourite directors of the 21st century and if you've liked his other stuff, I would highly recommend Dogtooth.

80,JoeKulik,A VERY POOR Excuse For A Film !!!!!!!,1,18 August 2015,"Yorgas Lanthimos' Dogtooth ( 2009) is a VERY POOR excuse for a film, in my opinion. It portrays a social situation that is so very highly improbable, and so full of internal contradictions, that it could NEVER happen in real life. As such, this film can't even be called some kind of commentary on family life because it only bears a very superficial resemblance to actual family life at all. As such,this film definitely belongs in the Fantasy genre. But the fantasy portrayed in this film is o veritable ""freak show"" and, such, the only value that I can attribute to it is the entertainment value of viewing a ""freak show"", just like the actual ""freak shows"" of the 19th Century, where people paid money for a chance to gawk and gape at poor, unfortunate people born with a severe birth defect, or with a severe genetic anomaly. But, sorry, I myself just see no entertainment value, no ""fun"" in gaping and gawking at such SICK portrayals of human life. That this film won so many film awards would be utterly laughable to me, were it not such a tragic commentary on the state of Western Culture.",Dogtooth
81,wickedmikehampton,A must-watch weirdness!,7,15 December 2020,"'Dogtooth' is fascinatingly screwed-up, a low budget movie that was perversely intriguing and ended as a question for my imagination. It's one of the best weird movies. After you watch it, you should see 'Miss Violence'.",Dogtooth
82,Cinnyaste,Brilliant and Disturbing,9,25 March 2011,"Isolated and predominately patriarchal, ""Dogtooth"" is a parallel Universe where people speak in phrases reminiscent of language training tapes: Q. ""Do you like the tile?"" A. ""I like this tile but not that tile."" This world's syntax is revisionist. The vulgarism 'pussy' means 'bright light'.A nameless family – co-conspirators husband and wife, three teens, two girls and a boy – lives in a secluded villa. The teens deeply fear venturing past the fence. Only the father leaves (to run a plant) in the safety of a car. After years of propaganda, the teens believe the outside world is a dangerous place where a gentle cat is able to tear a person to shreds. The teens (who regularly recite many of dear old Dad's mantras) simultaneously drone they can only leave, ""when a dogtooth (maxillary canine) falls out. The left or the right - it doesn't matter."" To underscore the point, the parents perpetuate a family myth about their ill-prepared son who suffered a horrific fate after departing with all his teeth.The teen's days are spent playing silly, competitive games, learning new words and studying anatomy. Cheap stickers are their reward for being good. A big night of entertainment is watching memorized home movies, the teens mouthing the words spoken on the tape.Here, Mother can give birth to a dog, and the commercial jets flying overhead are really prized model planes the teens wish would crash in the garden so they might fight to retrieve them.Professing a deep bond and great familial love, the parents expend a lot of energy holding the world at bay. Dad plays a loving message from Grandfather. It's a Frank Sinatra record (in English, the native language is Greek) Dad translates as ""Your parents love you. Love your parents. Never go away."" There's also swift, arbitrary discipline that, at times, is amazingly severe.Dad arranges for a lovely female Plant Security Guard to visit the home (she's blindfolded while driving there) to have sex with the son. Thanks, Pop! The guard also has sex with a daughter. She later trades ""a (vaginal) lick"" for American films on tape. The daughter surreptitiously watches the films then recreates ""Jaws"" and a number of other films. They're hilarious (and fodder for film lovers to guess).The cultural diffusion also leads to sex spreading throughout the family, and threatens the precarious isolation.The Director's strange compositions limit the view in this film of moments, only a scant few highlighted herein. There are profane, highly shocking, heartwarming, odd, truly funny, absurd, sad and even more shocking moments. The sexuality and incest is past frank to near porn; the violence surprising and, while not graphic, it is emotionally disturbing.Cat lovers will certainly cringe.This is a stew roiling with anger over patriarchal dominance, the effects of a malevolent dictatorship and, barely hiding contempt for it, American cultural imperialism. Throw in a few morsels of male superiority. Add a desperate smidge of subterfuge to mask the truth.It's also a counter-intuitive cautionary tale warning parents to shepherd their children lightly and kindly then free them to inhabit the world as adults. In ""Dogtooth"" there is no line between appropriate sheltering and a death-stifle. Like people struggling under the thumb of a benevolent Father-Dictator, these teens have inherent dignity and curiosity... and the right to live.""Dogtooth"" is fascinating and a brilliant allegory. It's reaches into the psyche, messes around and leaves an indelible impression. (You may despise it but you won't soon forget it.) The price of making it to the payoff may be too high for some. Those who do may find Dogtooth addresses large questions. What are the consequences of the emotional, physical and intellectual barrenness meant to squelch or contain us? Is the spirit, the soul, truly inexorable?The answers are evident. The only requirement is to exit the trunk.",Dogtooth
83,Manal1987,Dogtooth (2009): Bringing the House Down,10,23 August 2016,"Before anything, this is a film you MUST watch. Period.For exactly 10 minutes after the credits showed up on screen, I sat there open-mouthed and glued to my seat, unable to control the myriad of feelings that had been stirred inside me while slowly realizing that I had probably watched one of the greatest movies of the century (according to Manal (myself), this is an unarguable fact).Two sisters and a brother are raised in a big, secluded house and are made to believe by their parents that they can't go to the dangerous world outside until their dogteeth fall out – a story that you do not fully get your head around until halfway through the film. The background story of why the parents are doing that and to what ends is almost completely overshadowed, as if Yorgos Lanthimos is precluding the emotional attachment and inviting us to examine the significance behind the allegory.Most of the uncomfortable, eccentric vibes you get down your spine while watching the story unfold are caused by seeing this family living by rules outside our denotative system. They are told facts that run contrary to our common beliefs, they are taught words with different references, and, consequently, experience the world from an alien perspective. The fact that the allegory is presented realistically heightens the absurd element to a great comical extent (a Lanthimos trademark where the anomalous is presented as normal, creating the aforementioned absurd effect). In one scene, as a kind of entertainment, the father plays Frank Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and tells his kids that this is their grandfather singing. While the kids awkwardly (but joyfully!) dance to the song, he translates the song to them as follows: ""Dad loves us. Mom loves us. Do we love them? Yes, we do. I love my brothers and sisters because they love me as well. The spring is flooding my house. The spring is flooding my little heart. My parents are proud of me because I'm doing just fine. I'm doing just fine but I will always try harder. My house, you are beautiful and I love you and I will never ever leave you."" Representing the ultimate authority, the kids unquestionably believe whatever their parents tell them, including that their mother can give birth to animals and that the cat is a dangerous animal that feeds on human flesh.The parents in the film do not practice their authority primarily by enforcing fear and discipline but by presenting the kids with a brand new system of significance whose signifiers no longer match our signifieds (among many others, they use the word 'keyboard' to refer to the vagina, and 'zombie' to refer to a yellow flower). This might sound pathetic and deplorable if we see it from the outside – outside the system they live in. However, if we are in their shoes, we will see nothing abnormal and deal with the authority's commands as common sense. Ironically, by the end of the film, we gradually realize that we are the target of the allegory and that our presumably 'outside' world is another construct we are trapped inside. Whatever family values we cherish or religious dogmas we believe in or humanitarian beliefs we hold dear are all part of a bigger system made to confine us. Now we roar with acid laughter because we know we are the subject of the cruel joke.Whether we are capable of breaking free, physically or figuratively, is left to you to decide in the typically-Lanthimos, mind-baffling ending.I have probably said it to everyone I know, and I have to say it again: I love Lanthimos' mesmerizing frames which foster a compelling sense of confinement and stagnation. They are awkward, but beautiful awkward. Besides, the performers' enunciation and gestures are in absolute tandem with the overall cynical spirit of the film.It's my second Yorgos Lanthimos film, and the second time to be assured Greeks are still capable of making epics.I give the film 10 out of 10 (and a kiss of appreciation to Lanthimos!)",Dogtooth
84,arturmachado-29588,No Plato's Cave,2,18 August 2017,"Greek indie movie directed by Yorgos Lanthimos about three teenage siblings (a man and two women) who live in isolation without being able to leave home because of their protective and authoritarian parents who told them that they can only leave when their first canine tooth falls of, and another bunch of lies that make this family totally dysfunctional, as well as the film itself. Yes, it serves no function unless your idea of entertainment is to get bored. Towards the end of the film, I ask myself: what is the purpose or message? There are those who see in this film a social / family allegory, because we are largely the product of our education and of the lies we're told taken as truth, but even that perspective does not save the film from my negative evaluation, it was very badly thin and NO, it does not have a deeper meaning. It is what it is.On the same topic, Plato already did it almost 2500 years ago.

It is creepy, disturbing and darkly funny in all the right places.From start to finish it gripped me to my seat. It's left of centre, incredibly odd and perfect in every way.I don't know how anybody could possibly watch this without feeling their skin crawling on the back of their necks because it is pretty disturbing stuff. It felt like I wasn't watching a bunch of actors, it was more like I had been picked up and transplanted into this bizarre household. The ending came suddenly and I wasn't expecting it to finish so abruptly but it was probably the perfect ending to an amazing movie.Dark. Odd and disturbing.10/10",Dogtooth
87,jnguyen46117,DogTooth: 9/10,9,12 February 2011,"It is one of the most bazaar movie of the year, it is also one of the most funniest movie of the year. Right from the beginning, you see that this family is nothing like an ordinary family. The family consists of two parents and three teenagers, one boy and two girls. The boy is at an age where sexual needs are required, and instead of going out and fulfil those needs like a normal guy, his dad (who is nuts) hired a female security guard who will do the job. The reason you might think the father doesn't let his children go outside may be overprotection, but as for the idea goes, being overprotective does not allow you to keep your children inside for all these years, the idea does not allow you to play tricks on them. One of the many tricks the dad played was telling the children that the ""cat"" is a dangerous animal and if you go outside, it may eat you. That might sound silly, but the film took the idea so seriously that they had the actors bark as a way to scare the ""cats"" away.Both the mother and the father knew what the outside world is like, but maybe they don't want their children to be involved at all. The film is nothing more than a heavy-handed metaphor about the perils of over protecting your children, but it was crafted nicely into this little dark comedy/drama that will make viewers uncomfortable. Some of the shots are really graphic, but the direction was fresh. Almost all of the shots of the film is shot on a tripod. The director had this idea of not moving the camera and set it in one place to take the shots. This might seem amatureous, but it was actually brilliant what the results was.The film was hilariously difficult to watch. At times they do these weird things that you can't help but laugh. And then you realize that the things they do seems so real and you feel the urge to yell because those things they did were so un-human. Watching Dogtooth was really hard, but it was a hell of a ride as well. The kids know nothing of life and they never will. This is a quote that the mother said when the girl asked her what a pussy was: ""A pussy is a light."" And this is when the boy asked her what a zombie was: ""A zombie is a small yellow flower."" Funny, but it's a perfect example of how nuts these parents are. Their dad wanted their behaviors and performances to improve, so he told them that their mom is going to give birth to two more children and a dog. That they were going to have to share their rooms, but if they wish not to share, their behaviors must improve. It will take their mother two months to give birth and she hoped to give birth as soon as possible. The dialogue is ridiculious, but not in a bad way.Throughout the ""ride"", the film took you to some unexpected details and should not be spoiled. Direction-wise, it was daring. DogTooth is by far, no doubt the Best Foreign Language Film of the year.OscarBuzz: Best Foreign Language Film, I haven't seen Biutiful but I think it woulnd't change my mind on who should win.",Dogtooth

I thought it was going to be very shocking and disturbing but it wasn't and thats' why i enjoyed. But i didn't like because you have to make your own interpretation of different questions you wonder like : why the father do that? why don't the children try to get out? what does the ending means?

90,missraze,Oh for God's sake (IMDb won't let me put caps lock),1,29 November 2016,"0/10. SO BORING! I agree with user reviews from: -paul2001sw-1 from UK -cliffbressette from USA-Der_Schnibbler from Germany and rectangular_businessman from Peruamong many others, from ALL around the world, I am SURE, who *hated* this film, or at the very least, felt let down and then some by the overhype from imbecile viewers and reviewers, and the empty promises that this movie would be so extreme, and an original masterpiece. I've seen things that make Ichi the Killer look like a kid's film. So seriously before you take to the public praising something as ""extreme,"" mean it. Don't just cheer that it's the ""best thing ever!"" 5 seconds after watching it, like a child getting off their first roller-coaster ride T_T. 1st of all...huh?? Who are these people saying it's a metaphor for politics and religion? Who are these atheists and nihilists who decided to take that view? Nowhere in the film was there any praying or mention of religion, nor society or politics...they don't even mention the current president/prime minister, or a fictional one...and if they did, that must've been during the time I dozed off and had to rewind... And what the hell in this bimbo movie gave them the material to even interpret it that way? Was this film SO empty that you figure it's got a deeper unspoken meaning? Pfft. It's got as much meaning as a Ziploc bag. 2nd of all...huh?? Who are these people? What time period is it? Though it was clearly the first and only indication for what type of family they are, the Frank Sinatra scene and their vintage technology and wardrobe and diction could be perfectly normal if it is based on the time during the song's first release, you know. But you wouldn't know because they don't explain it. Last time I checked, when you give no background information on setting, time, or characters, it's a trash film. But whoop-dee-doo, it showed her jerking off (her own brother, mind you, because...why?) so I guess it's good, right? Wrong. The father raised the children to be airheads, so they don't realize incest is a no-no. So deep? If the director has a problem with incest and thinks bad parenting leads to it, it doesn't seem like it. If the director wants the movie to suggest it's totally fine to ""free yourself from your parents' and society's restrictions"" it didn't work for me because it was too poorly made.And people think how he raised his kids is some sort of freedom statement for how ""WE"" should be now? Including the part where he beat the crap out his daughter for watching an action film? Or where he hired a hooker to constantly have sex with his son? Or when he convinced his son that massacring a house cat is the way to go? Mind you, the father's blatant hypocrisy of raising his kids to be weirdos in his attempts to keep them from bad outside influences however not stopping him from inviting the bad influences in single-handedly was not an intended crux of the movie, but a clear sign of poor plot creation, character development, and script writing. So don't be fooled, losers. And his useless obedient wife who never talked sense into him wasn't even controlled by great sex since they didn't have it. What literally is the message here? There isn't one. The director just wanted to be weird and no one around him cared about his stupid ideas, so they tossed a trash ""script,"" vapid ""actors"" and an ugly landscape at him to work with.For example:The scene where he tells his son he now has to have sex with someone else (since the hooker he brought got violently fired) doesn't exist. It was only lazily implied. Why didn't the children stand in a line, shoulder to shoulder, and the father calmly pacing back and forth in front of them like a drill sergeant looking to see if the cadets have unlaced boots. They would be standing there kind of nervously. And he would announce that his son has to choose one of them, now, to sleep with. And then the son feels them up in front of his own parents, who stand there visibly not bothered sipping tea. And THEN the incest sex scene happens. That would've been cool only because it would have been well done, or done at all.But no. They just went STRAIGHT to the sex scene. This is the kind of stuff people get therapy for: withstanding years of (domestic) sexual abuse. And this movie skips to it and through it and away from it like no biggie, and passes it off like a deep statement. Excuse me? Am I supposed to be brainwashed by this lazy, pseudo-controversial garbage? Instead I was left to toss my sweets into the air and try to catch it with my mouth for an hour.I see this film as simply what it is:nonsense. If you just HAVE to make sense of this film since you did waste all this time on it, the only thing I can come up with off the top of my head is that it's a film about patriarchal sexism within the family, NOT society, and weird rich families who pretend to be perfect. And this film was a cheap, poor excuse to show taboo (you guessed it, kids!) sex. If you wanna see sex so bad, have some of your own, or watch porn. I have no problem with sex, I have no problem with violence. But that's because I know how to use them. Putting them in a film and wrapping some flimsy clingfilm excuse of a plot around it and selling it off as art, however, is insultingly ridiculous.",Dogtooth
91,gooseshaw,"Have you ever repeatedly slammed your head into a wall? Neither have I, until I watched this movie.",4,29 April 2020,"The following is a real conversation between some moronic producer and one-trick-pony director/hack Yargos Lanthimos about the initial conception of the critically acclaimed film 'Dogtooth'""Hey, I want to make a movie about some parents who keeps their kids separated from the rest of the world.""""Ok, that sounds interesting! So what happens?""""Just some stuff.""""Well, what stuff? What's the plot?""""Ehhh, there is no plot.""""There's no actual story of any kind? So what, it's just an empty movie where pointless stuff happens to no end?""""Exactly! But I'll throw in some meaningless violence and sexual perversion so people know it's a deep, indie film.""""Well okay, just remember to make sure you tell your actors to deliver their lines with zero trace of emotion like you do in every other film you make!""This movie hurt me. It's a fraudulent empty production that provides nothing for the viewer. The trivia section of this movie claims that Lanthimos came up with this ever so unique idea when he began to question the 'institution of family itself.' Please, I beg you Yorgos, if my eyes roll any deeper into my head it may cause permanent damage.This is the most recent of Lanthimos' films that I've seen. The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017) was fine, but ultimately just a dumbed down and emotionless retelling of a Greek myth. The Lobster (2015) was decent and somewhat funny until I stopped watching. And The Favourite (2018) was a dull, bland, movie with an uninspired excuse for a story, that happened to feature some good performances and remarkable costumes and set-pieces (and one funny moment during a dance scene). There is a commonality between all of these films that are so obviously important to Lanthimos, and that it his decision to have his actors act as if they've been lobotomized. This is not deep, it's not artistic, it's boring and senseless, especially once you notice that this quality exists in every one of this director's films.I absolutely would not bother with this film unless perhaps you're depressed already.",Dogtooth
92,varun_120,Dogs#it,1,21 July 2012,"I have seen many bizarre films, but most of them were good films. This film was very bad. It was even worse than David Lynch's pretentious films. The film has only 6 characters. One boy, twin girls and their parents and Christina an outsider. The father is the only one who is allowed to go outside the house. While the mother and the boy and twin girls are not allowed to go.They are told that there are too many dangers in the outside world that can kill them. Very ridiculous. And, yes there is Christina, some security guard, who is taken by the father to his home. Christina is paid by the father to have sex with his son. But, Christina soon disturbs the so called balance set by the father, by asking one of the sisters to have oral sex with her, in exchange of which Christina will give some stuffs to that girl.In the end, father doesn't trust Christina and tells mother that the brother and sister should have sex. The same twin girl who has sex with her brother, escapes the house in the end by breaking her tooth which the family calls a dogtooth. The family believes that one can leave the home when his /her dogtooth falls naturally. She hides in the trunk of the car and she doesn't come out of it, indicating that she has died in the trunk.So, that was the story. It is weird and more importantly the most boring film I've ever seen in my life. Once again some pretentious reviewers found some interesting things in this film and rated this film high.

93,PopCulturedwithMovieMike,One of the most odd films you will ever see.,7,29 January 2014,"Wow. What was that? I'm not really sure what to say so I'm just going to let a more experienced movie critic say it. Roger Ebert: ""Dogtooth is like a car crash. You cannot look away."" That pretty much sums up the whole film for me. While I was watching it, I often felt guilty. Like I was doing something bad. I'm not sure I would call it a great film, but it's certainly worth a watch if you are into different films. Let me put it this way. Only people who are hardcore into cinema will see Dogtooth. I think it's safe to say that the only people I know that will ever see this film are right here on this site. Dogtooth is your typical foreign film. It's very slow placed, very light on exposition and many times it feels like scenes are taking place for little or no reason. This is not a bad thing, although I was hoping for a little bit more interaction between the siblings about their plight, as well as with their parents. Dogtooth tells the story of a family that shelters their 3 grown children from the outside world. They are so sheltered that they have the mentality of children. Often interacting with each other as if they were little kids. To shield their children from words they don't want them to know, they replace them with other words. For instance, while at the dinner table one of the girls asks for the telephone, her mother then passes her a salt shaker. Dogtooth deals with many themes. Some of them might be too hard for some people to sit through. Among these themes are incest, the advancement of technology and violence in film. But the main theme in Dogtooth is how by sheltering their children, the parents are literally destroying them. What I took from Dogtooth is that no matter how scary it is out in the real world, you can't shelter your kids too much. In order to grow up into a normal, productive member of society, one must experience the good, the bad and the ugly. The same can be said for people who love movies. Sometimes you have to watch some good movies, some bad movies and some ugly ones. I'm not sure I've seen an uglier film than Dogtooth.",Dogtooth
94,RitchCS,Huge Spoilers,10,7 March 2011,"*** This review contains spoilers *** Once again, I come here baffled by the fact that there should be an age limit for amateur reviewers using the same guidelines the MPAA uses for rating moviegoers. So often, a brilliant movie such as ""Dogtooth"" comes from out of the blue and dozens of 'too young' viewers offer their criticism which is obviously going to be, ""This is the worst movie I've ever scene!"". The MPAA should and would have put an NC-17 rating on this film and no underage kid should be allowed to review it on the IDMB message board. With the exception of Chloe Sevigny and Vincent Gallo uncensored oral sex scene, the Elder daughter masturbating her brother to a full erection before having incest intercourse, this indeed was an adults only movie. Setting the graphic sex aside, the story is excellently, poignant, somewhat humorous, while remaining highly dramatic...very difficult to compare to any other American made film...maybe, ""American Beauty"" or Dylan Baker in ""Happiness"". I was so grateful to the writers who left messages on this board... about 90% arriving at the same conclusion that the Elder did not make i out of the trunk alive. Fortunately, I was able to watch it on ""Pay For View"" on ATT U-verse or I might never have seen it. However, as the camera focuses on the motor running, the movie ended and there was about 30 seconds of a solid blue screen as if the 'complete' ending had been clipped and edited with the blue screen before starting the closing credits. Two more items which helped solidify the ending consensus was when Papa accepted the fact that Elder was gone, he told his wife he would pick up his dog the next day as the dog should have gone through phase five of its obedience training and the following morning with Elder in the trunk, he went to the animal shelter...that was not his work place. He told his wife that the dog would help fill up the void left by Elder. The second clue was that Younger was now sleeping with her brother in a spoon position, then turning to kiss him as she would take the place of Elder supplying the brother's needs. Years ago, in the 60's when Bergman and Fellini were both grand masters of movies FILLED with symbolic characters, props, and plot lines, quite often their films would just end which allowed us avid moviegoers to discuss these movies for weeks to come. ""What did he mean by this?"" or ""What did the priest in total darkness carrying two pigeons?"" represent.

95,dipesh-parmar,Greek Genius!,8,12 January 2011,"Certainly the biggest surprise of the year for me. Directed by Giorgos Lanthimos, this Greek film centres around a family home. A wealthy father lives with his wife, son and two daughters in a modern secluded house, all seems quite normal. But nobody is allowed out of the home apart from the father, the wife doesn't want to leave the house. The children, all in their early 20′s, seem to have been imprisoned since birth. Their schooling is in-house, relying on home-made tapes and books, and have become infantalised. Unknown words are given alternative names by their parents, deliberately, so for example 'zombies' are yellow flowers, leading to many unfortunate incidents! The parents use a fictional brother who has been banished from the house as the means to imprison the three children. No outsider is allowed into the house, apart from a woman, Christina, who works in the factory of the father. She is paid by the father to have sex with the son. Bored with the son, she befriends one of the daughters. Their friendship blossoms, the daughter's curiosity leading to rebellion and all manner of carnage awaits.Many people seem to be put off by the dark tone of this movie, but the the deadpan black comedy electrifies this film. Dogtooth has echoes of Michael Haneke's direction and style of acting, and some of David Lynch's earlier movies such as 'Blue Velvet' in its depiction of the sinisterly weird in the familiar and normal. There are some wonderful moments, including an awkwardly brilliant dance sequence by one of the daughters. The misinformation supplied by the parents creates some brilliant moments of surreal comedy and violence, not least the introduction of a cat.The film has many unanswered questions, not least why the parents have raised their children in such a calculated way. Disturbingly, the mother, though not initially, is as complicit as the father. The director is to be applauded for being able to maintain some genuinely disturbing scenes with some absurdly innocent and playful black humour, which Todd Solondz's Happiness managed to capture brilliantly.

Don't Miss Oscar Worthing,10,23 February 2011,"Dear readers , first of all i wanted to say that this is the first time a movie really shocked me and its plot will remain unforgettable written deeply into my soul.Everything on this film works in high level of cinemaphil world.I dare you even if you re not so amazed from trailer and reviews comments to watch this movie if you don't watch it you ll miss a piece of art without the economical sponsors of big movies, i can say i ll go buy tomorrow this movie on BR or DVD because i consider it a real masterpiece.This is the movie that must be on every home cinema and can be played many many times without to be boring.Try not to miss this movie.My Opinion is that if this movie misses the Oscar price it will be very unfair.First time for many years i have been stacked on the screen from first second to the last and i was surprised so deeply , i didn't expected this high end result with such a low budget congratulations to director and all people who worked hard for this motion picture.Even the black swan this year that is nominated for Oscar price too and i admit that the actresses acting was very strong , the plot wasn't so deep as this films plot.Here we have simply the Truth that all people afraid off to hear for centuries.There's no GOD ?, there's no Church ? , there are no States Countrys Nations? Politicians? ...people there's nothing existing on this world for your own good always there's a motive behind everything because we doing what they told us to do we simply acting like a pack, you know why? because we believe every bullshit they telling us to control us even if they are parents or politicians or church people or supermarket directors police man whatever ... because this is how the human mind is build some guys to believe every bullshit and some guys try to control every bullshit .This masterpiece motion picture simply explains the domination game. All this fear is created by our complicated mind ,we can survive alone inside our home but in a bigger world view we need a leader pack or we ll end up in a trunk , if we were animals without brain, life could be beautiful but with such a labyrinth inside our head like this? for sure we need a leader pack and not only one to trust and to leave us rest without troubles like every other animal on this planet(the reference on film to the dog trainer and the compare with the human trainer no difference at all except one small detail)........as in this picture we are commanded by psychopaths (usually human leader packs are psychopaths with higher ambitions than average normal people trying to make everyone to listen to them because of their disturbance they cant differentiate their motives that are dependable through their economical educational or even their sociological level)so the movie is very disturbing to many people also to me because for many of us is the first time we realize whats happening in real world its first time we loose our dogtooth as they told us believe and GOD will save you and we must face the biggest reality out of our home. Someone told us there is GOD...there is Paradise and simply we believe it ,without to questioning it as they told us also, -the truth of the movie ? no live creature with mind or not wants to be enslaved body or mind of whoever GOD even if the price is death, we make our future we decide for our mistakes we work for our own good no GOD can gives you nothing but only hope... Be human not humanized Thank you",Dogtooth
97,karmaswimswami,"A marvelous, sui generis, mindblowing film!",10,28 March 2014,"""Dogtooth"" is so extraordinary an accomplishment by Lanthimos that he will be his own toughest act to follow for the remainder of his career. Here born fully formed is a visual and narrative style like no one else's, with an austerity of camera set-ups that propels the story rather than hindering it. The performances by Christos Stergioglou and Aggeliki Papoulia are two of the best in cinema. This thrillingly perverse tale of parental narcissism and paranoia gone perversely awry will etch itself deeply into memory and demand to be re-heard. Lanthimos channels the genius of a dozen other filmmakers (including Pasolini in ""Salo"") to come up with a pastiche that is hauntingly like no one else's work ever. In 20 years and in 50, ""Dogtooth"" will remain as fresh, vital, and distinguished as the day it was released.",Dogtooth
98,thecatcanwait,B F Skinner meets Josef Fritzl,2,21 December 2010,"I'm trying again to like this, after watching 30 minutes a couple of weeks ago – and giving up; too bored by the banal – deliberately contrived - affectless acting and incomprehensible plot.""Sharp, political, satire"" said the lead intro. But the longer i watch the more unsharp and unintelligible it becomes.A bad sign: I'm at 40 minutes and already itching to fast forward.Some kind of weird Behaviouristic Regime is going on; child rearing as overly determined dog training. Improvement in behaviour and performance leads to treats – and licks of various dissociated body parts, including ""keyboards"" (all will be explained in a minute). Non conformity to be punished by withdrawal of privileges, hard smacks on head, or mother giving ""birth to 2 children and a dog"" (introducing competing rivalries i think that's meant to be meaning)No, not liking this at all. I won't be attempting to make this more interesting than it is.The 3 kids are zombified into learning that the word for very strong wind is ""motorway"", that a ""shotgun"" is a beautiful white bird, and vaginas are ""keyboards"" (actually, i quite like that – keyboard is better than ""fanny"" anyway) Other strange beliefs include: jumbo jets falling out of the sky are little paper aeroplanes; cuddly domestic cats are man eating monsters – so best slaughter them with a pair of shears.""The Eldest"" (daughter) does a Zombie dance for Parents Anniversary near the end. I quite liked it. I reckon every absurd film should have at least one silly dance to remember it by.So were this family all part of an odd Skinnerian Behaviouristic Experiment? Were they a Cult of Capitalists gone Crazy? Was the father Josef Fritzls long lost Greek brother? Who knows. Who cares. I don't",Dogtooth

Great premisse, but inefficient and boring.

102,tjackson,Set my Dogteeth on edge,7,6 August 2010,"After parking for $16.00 at the overpriced MFA lot in Boston where I saw Dogtooth for $10.00, my teeth were already on edge - including my Dogtooth. Did I get my money's worth? Let me say this about that. This story of three teenagers cloistered by their wealthy father on his isolated country estate where they're taught preposterous behavior including erroneous words for things (little yellow flowers are 'zombies' and pussy means 'big light') is violent, sexual, bloody, and ridiculous. That's the fun part.It seems to be tragic, but without a real story and it's too open-ended to come off as a satire. Is the family of the future (as the director suggests) doomed? Is there a larger political critique? Is the film, as has also been suggested, a critique of Greek society and its acceptance in the European Union, or the corrupting influence of American popular culture.It's fair to say that it is all these things if you want it to be. I was desperate to feel that it would open to larger possibilities. But it just veers and crawls from one funny/horrible situation to the next. It is a surrealistic and instinctive film, but without the intricacy and dexterity of David Lynch, the sly lyricism of Bunuel, or the political commitment of a Pasolini film. The film looks beautiful but in the end it doesn't go anywhere. Film loving audiences may be so hungry for open ended, interesting, provocative films that they are buying into Lanthimos ultimately repetitive and boring attempt at a lyrical nightmare. This is just too empty, too easy, too slow. I hesitate to say that it was all Greek to me, but perhaps that was part of the problem. I do look forward to his next film.",Dogtooth
103,scarletheels,Not for the casual viewer but should be seen by film fans,6,7 March 2012,"Three children (Aggeliki Papoulia, Christos Passilas, and Mary Tsoni) live a sheltered existence with their parents (Christos Stergioglou and Michele Valley) who control them to the extreme in order to protect them from the rest of society. They invent an older brother who, they tell the children, ventured outside the confines of the estate and was killed by a vicious, flesh eating cat. The parents improvise new definitions for words like sea (an armchair) and zombie (little yellow flower) to further isolate them from anything beyond their bizarre, manipulated microcosm. The children's only link to the outside world is Christina (Anna Kalaintzidou), a security guard at the father's workplace, who is paid to relieve the son of his sexual urges. One day, Christina offers a present to the oldest daughter but she is obligated to give her something in return - oral sex. The family structure starts to unravel once Christina is gone and the oldest daughter is forced to replace her role as the son's personal prostitute. Whatever cruel punishment her father exacts, the oldest daughter isn't deterred from rebelling and, eventually, going to great lengths to gain her freedom. Dogtooth, original Greek title of Kynodontas, is shocking and depraved. This is not for most people and most definitely not for anyone under the age of 18. With multiple sex scenes (a few including incest and a very graphic fellatio clip from a pornographic video tape), an act of animal cruelty, violence and bloodshed, child abuse, and full frontal male and female nudity, this is not for the casual viewer. It seems the only debauchery left out of the film is bestiality (thank goodness). The dialog is painful to endure at times but the acting is kind of hypnotic. In fact, it's hard to stop watching entirely because of how inappropriate and insane the movie is. It plays out in a silly fashion with the lies the parents tell the children elevating to absurdity for their own selfish desires (e.g., Frank Sinatra is their grandfather so they have a reason to listen to his records). For me, the highlight of Dogtooth is when the two daughters dance for the parents, who are celebrating their anniversary, while the son strums an expressive tune on the guitar. An innocent, reverent dance with her younger sister turns into a frenzied solo interpretation of Flashdance that becomes so intense, she's ordered by her mother to stop. Imagine contestants on shows like America's Got Talent or So You Think You Can Dance who are aired only because their dancing is so horrendous, so hilarious, so over-the-top, but so full of spirit that it must be witnessed.",Dogtooth
104,erostew,Just... Wow.,10,18 June 2021,I just watched this and I have no real idea what it was that I watched. I don't know if it's some kind of allegory or a morality play or just a big stick to poke the audience with. There really isn't any insight provided into the motives for what these 2 parents have done to their children. Or why they have done it in such twisted fashion. I think we all just have to come to our own conclusions.Definitely the weirdest story I have ever seen put into a movie. It's like they put reality into a blender and tapped the pulse button a couple of times. What came out still has some similarity to the world we live in but most of it is sort of mixed together in random and strange combinations.The cinematography and direction are spot on. The film exudes a sort of claustrophobic but powerful energy that is wrapped in the tightest chains. But you can tell that it's only a matter of time before those chains are going to shatter.The acting is nothing short of brilliant. Especially the sisters. Everything from the way they move to the way they say the strange things that they do is completely i sync with the way they have supposedly been raised. The father somehow manages to not seem completely hateful or evil and that takes some real work.You'll notice that I haven't mentioned anything at all about the events in the film. That's because anything I say would spoil something that you should really discover for yourself. I suggest going in with an open mind and not trying to fit this into the context of the real world. Because it just doesn't mesh.As much as I really like this film I probably won't be eager to watch it again. There are some parts that are genuinely hard to watch. So if you don't make it all the way through it's understandable but you should definitely try.,Dogtooth
105,Arconada,"Weird, no, bizarre",6,6 March 2014,"Weird, no, bizarre. These are the words to describe this art-house movie. The movie does not tell a story, but just a phase in time. Yet, it draws your attention enough to keep watching. And the acting is very good. Although the story is to bizarre to believe it, the actors submerse in their roles, and make you feel they are actually living in this situation, instead of being actors that play merely such.The movie is about a family with overprotective parents. They have created a little world for their children, two daughters and a son, within the fence around their house. The children grow up separated from the real world, they have never been out, and believe only the things their parents tell them. One such thing is that they will be ready to leave the family when they loose their dog-teeth, which of course is not likely to happen.Yet, the children grow into their puberty, and to prevent that the boy molests his sisters, the father has arranged for an outsider to relieve some tension, now and then. Inevitably, this woman is going to bring in some traces of the outside world and stirs at least one of the children to rebel against the parents.That is what this movie is about, no more, no less. Children growing up separated from the real world has been a theme in movies before, think of ""The Truman Show"" or ""Blast from the Past"", but in those movies it was a basis for a plot to develop. In this movie it is just a display of a phase in time, a recording of children that go through a stage of their adolescence. And yet, the situation is weird enough to keep watching.",Dogtooth

108,Turin_Horse,Mind can be trained... for whatever!,9,17 November 2014,"After having read quite a few reviews for this film here at IMDb it surprises me nobody has made a connection between ""The Village"" and ""Dogtooth"". Both films deal exactly with the same topic, although at different scale, yet the two films are extremely different. In both films we can see something that probably psychologists know well, that a brain can be ""trained"" to believe... absolutely anything!... and religions are probably the best proof of it!We all are brought up in a particular ""setting"", composed of the family, the society, the geographical location, and the rules, values and beliefs that, mainly the family (but also others), want us to follow, respect and believe in. Take a newborn out from his birthplace and bring him to another place with another family with different values and beliefs... and after a few years you will have an individual who is absolutely different form what he/she would have been should have remained in his/her original birthplace. Well... of course genetics and epigenetics play a role too, and not minor, but that's another story...Dogtooth is a haunting, even scaring film. Some will hate it for this, it is not a film for everybody. You must take some distance from the events depicted and try to watch it with an objective attitude, and then maybe you will discover how extremely well constructed the film is, and how cleverly Yorgos Lanthimos delivers the message of the film. Great interpretations from all the actors help give the film its dense sense of realism. Might something like this happen in real life?? one may wonder, and the answer (disturbing answer) is that, sure it can... and happens continually actually... and most of times unnoticed by anybody.",Dogtooth
109,Shanghai_Samurai,What's more bizarre?,7,3 February 2019,"I was drawn to Dogtooth after seeing Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster and Killing of Sacred Deer. A kind of bizarre surrealism characterizes his work - with no paucity of wtf moments. When applied to a more traditional cinematic model, the combination of his weirdness and mainstream work can be fantastic, as with this year's The Favourite. But his earlier works, like Dogtooth, are the experimental foundation of his art. This story of a father, who has a normal job, but comes home to a family confined to their house-compound by a carefully crafted reality where leaving the house is certain danger until they reach the age of their ""dogtooth"" falling out (their incisor teeth, the right, or the left, it doesn't matter), leaves us with a voyeuristic look into a suburban bizarro world, with its own language, customs, and adaptations to human needs. This isn't for everyone - but maybe should be, as Dogtooth perhaps shows us more about ourselves, of what we are when left to the total control of a patriarchal power that nourishes are nature with the improvised trappings of the modern world.",Dogtooth
110,K-nightt,Mirroring destruction,8,8 October 2010,"Well, this film was highly anticipated by me (it had won the un Certain Regard prize at Cannes). The message is one of enclosed despair, it mirrors what it's like to be perpetually condemned to a preverbal state, and not having the tools to deal with it. It seems that, once play can no longer sustain oneself, one must retreat to a world of sexuality and aggression. Since the eldest daughter incorporated the nameless and hopeless lifestyle imposed by her parents, she was indeed an incarnation of their nefarious deeds. The only way to break free from their rules would be to attack their rules, and this could only be accomplished by attacking herself. The scene where she knocks her tooth out with a hammer is intense and realistic, yet behind pain and destruction there is beauty, in the disfigured and bloody smile leering back from the mirror. Life could no longer go on the way it had, the incestuous nature of the family unit had reached an extreme. In a bizarre bathtub scene, the brother sits there and gropes the naked bodies of his sisters, one at a time, feeling their breasts and then their buttocks, I imagine in an attempt to see which causes him to be more aroused. As everything else that conveys true emotion in this family, the scene transpires in uncomfortable silence, the demon of preverbal communication again casting its shadow. Born preverbal, dead preverbal, as the labyrinth of abandoned speech is manifest in the eldest daughter's aborted escape, remaining locked in the car trunk, representing in a very vivid manner that, upon mustering the desire to leave the perverted Eden in whence she dwelled, she was in effect entering her coffin.",Dogtooth
111,Carrzinho,The ridiculous becomes malevolent,6,27 August 2019,"Dogtooth (2010)
As first you play the detective in this movie trying to fathom what scenario is being played out in front of you. It gradually become clear that two manically protective parents have effectively imprisoned their two daughters and one son in an admittedly lovely spacious house and gardens away from any other human contact.
New words have their meaning altered to maintain the status quo and add a breezy ridiculousness. The extremely childlike though near adult teenagers mostly play to amuse themselves.
Their curiosities are relentless and they are discovering their bodies.
The Dad has decided to recruit a discrete co worker to satisfy his sons ""urges"" and this third party begins to dissolve his meticulous curated family.
The early hijinks are certainly amusing and it's a fascinating look into a perverse world. Little touches like the son being poor at throwing mechanically show a compromised upbringing and help convince of the circumstance.
When the co worker is dispensed with the film takes a turn you spent the first hour hoping it wouldn't. Despite the the darkness of the movie, the innocence provided a light and unfortunately when it is extinguished it becomes a difficult watch. Every scene thereafter is dripping in malevolence and the characters therein begin to unravel.
This section of the movie runs to the conclusion and is thankfully imbued with pace but it strips away the pleasure of watching it (as indeed it should) but it also makes it much harder to recommend. SIX",Dogtooth

Then OK, here it is yet another symbol about the fact that you are enslaved by society"".and all this goes on for 90 minutes, during which, of course, occasional nudes and heartless sex scenes are offered to the watcher.I understood the end of the movie 20 minutes before the final scene, and I was already yawning way before that.",Dogtooth

In the story, a stern patriarch and his obedient wife keep their teenage son and two teenage daughters cloistered from the world and misinformed about the world. For example, they teach their children new words with absurdly inaccurate definitions e.g.""zombie"" defined as a little yellow flower. On the surface, the film is about the influence of authoritarian parents on their children. From the political perspective, the movie can also be viewed as a political satire on the absurdity and terror of dictatorships which gain their power through violence, fraud, brainwashing, the control of mass media, satisfaction of basic needs, etc. Besides, the film also shed light on humans' curiosity. The audience will be amused by its absurdity, shocked by its gore and sex and impressed by its uniqueness and political satire.",Dogtooth
115,forlornnesssickness,Dogtooth : A family as nutty as North Korea,7,14 June 2014,"Living in the big house with a swimming pool in some unknown remote place, this family is shut off from the world outside. They are not only surrounded by the big plants in the garden but also the big, tall fence blocking their view. The family is affluent, and the house is mostly clean, and they do not see any problem with being stuck in this isolated place. They do not watch TV or read newspaper(but they have some books), and only signs of the civilization outside are the planes which fly across the sky above from time to time.How do they come to have such a bizarre lifestyle? The movie never explains the motive, but it seems that the father initiated this lifestyle probably a long time ago. He is the only one who can go outside with his car(he seems to be the manager of a big plant), so it is his job to supply anything his family needs in their life. He seldom talks about his family in front of other people(he just says that his wife is too ill to meet people), and he blocks anything that may interfere the family life. When he buys foods and water, he painstakingly removes the labels for not giving any outside information. How thoughtful he is.His wife obeys to him as a good wife(she is physically not ill at all, by the way), and so do their children. They have two daughters and one son. Though they are in late adolescent years, they behave as if they were still little children under the protection of mommy and daddy. They have several strange games to spend their daytime, like ""a game of endurance"": they test themselves who can stand longer when they dip their fingers in hot water. In case of their other private game, they anesthetize themselves with chloroform to find out who will wake up first.They have been leading a good life at least in their view, but it is gradually revealed that something unstoppable is being emerged while their abnormal behaviors, including barking like a dog on their knees when they believe they are threatened by a cat, continue. Though he cannot block everything, the father is determined to stop that by any means necessary, and there are several bursts of violence to shock you mainly due to the clinical, objective attitude of the film.The film, which won Un Certain Regard Award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2010 and was nominated for Foreign Language Film Oscar early in this year, has a lot of cold, distant feelings, but it is also interesting and, sometimes, amusing to watch. The director Giorgos Lanthimos, who wrote the screenplay with Efthymis Filippou, keeps everything straight throughout his film with the wry, subtle sense of black humor. The aforementioned twisted vocabulary is used several times in a funny way, and there is also an outrageous scene depicting the way the children celebrate the anniversary of their parent's wedding. The actors in the film play as seriously as possible to make the twisted reality of their characters mundane – even when they cross the boundary of our ethics out of necessity, they never look self-conscious while supporting the detached tone of the film.Maybe because of the death of Kim Jong-il two weeks ago and the following response of North Korean people shown on the media, these bizarre human behaviors in the film are not that weird to me as I remembered. I and other South Koreans know too well about how twisted North Korean society have been while shutting up itself from the world and brainwashing its people with the crooked ideas just like the family in the film. One savage scene in the movie reminds me of how severely North Korean people are punished if they are found watching South Korean TV shows.I remember well when Kim Il-Sung, the former dictator and the father of Kim Jong-il, was dead in 1994. Even we South Koreans were flabbergasted to some degree to see the hysterical mass mourning even though we had been well aware of that he had been literally worshipped as the big daddy of North Korea. Now his son is dead, and his grandson becomes a new leader to be worshipped without much trouble, and we do not find the recent behaviors of North Koreans under this wacky dictatorship particularly weird, mainly because we have seen this before. Compared to this insanity, ""Dogtooth"" is like a mild fairy tale.By the way, what is the point of the movie? It does not express its opinion while firmly holding its austere attitude, but I think the lesson from the film is that the kids are bound to grow up no matter how much the parents try to restrict them with their stringent home schooling. Maybe it works for a while, but it cannot last forever. No wonder some North Korean people escape from their country in spite of the constant brainwashing and the possibility of severe punishment.",Dogtooth

117,aristofanis,Needs reworking,5,14 May 2010,"As a Greek speaker and with a certain familiarity with Greek cinema, I went to see this movie in London with some reservation. Mostly because my experience with Greek art house movies of the past 25 years or so consist of slow scenes, with minimal dialogue, short sentences and bad acting. Now of course there are directors like Theo Angelopoulos who can pull a slow movie off. But not everyone is Theo.So I was disappointed to see this mannerism repeated again in Dogtooth! Of course in this case, there is the excuse that the expressionless faces and the minimal dialogue are due to the dysfunctionality of the family in question. Yet the colleague at dad's work and the dog trainer are equally pathetic as characters and as actors. Only the roles of the parents seem to convince.The premise is an intelligent one and the meanings and implications become obvious. The commentary on contemporary society is successful. In other words there are all the ingredients for a very good film but the opportunities here are completely wasted. Some of this lack of ideas is desperately attempted to be compensated with long and tiresome sex scenes.Yet the biggest lost opportunity is when the daughter escapes the premises. This could have been a fine chance for great cinematography as she would run out and about the real world. The confrontation between the artificial environment of the parents and the outside reality is what I would be interested in.Greek filmmakers need to experiment with style and learn from real life characters and situations rather than from previous Greek films.",Dogtooth
118,slammerhard,It's all Greek to me.,6,19 February 2021,"Up until Dogtooth the only Greek film to gain such notoriety was Nick Nicholaidis' Singapore Sling, but unlike that one, Dogtooth found itself in the spotlight competing for an Academy Award. Maybe it did not win but it made Lanthimos a household name and gave him the chance to work with some of the biggest Hollywood stars. The next thing you know is that every filmmaker in Greece is turning out weird S*** in an attempt to be the next Lanthimos. Every notion of logic and decent character development got thrown out of the window. All you needed was a couple of actors to do weird stuff in front of the camera to get a shot at Cannes.
As a piece of filmmaking, Dogtooth works in a Reservoir Dogs way. It's a mishmash of ideas and scenes from other films. The recipe for Dogtooth is sixty percent The Castle of Purity, twenty percent Shylaman's The Village, ten percent Sitcom by Francois Ozon and some Haneke and Trier thrown in the mix. You add some splashes of bright red blood and sex (lots of it) and you're ready to go.
For some reason the actors speak in a weird manner-an idea borrowed from SIngapore Sling. The main concept does not stand up to much scrutiny but at least his mixture of hi art and sleaze is presented in a visually appealing way. Those greens in the back yard sure look great in high-def.
Dogtooth was okay at least but you can't say the same for his subsequent efforts. Alps, Lobster, Sacred Deer, all suffer from poor and nonsensical scripts and there is no sex and blood to make your time worthwhile. But the damage is already done. No chance a Greek filmmaker will ever try again to make a normal film about normal people under normal circumstances.",Dogtooth

One of the kids asks what a zombie is. The mother replies ""A zombie is a small yellow flower."" You get the impression that some of the kids have serious mental problems. There is scene where the one girl takes a Barbie Doll. She starts cutting off the dolls fingers and feet. A normal kid wouldn't do this. There are scenes like these some people may find disturbing. There are some people that didn't like this movie because it dealt with subject matter they thought is immoral or something. I don't think there was anything wrong with the subject matter.

120,zuhairvazir,Euripides Reigns,8,15 April 2014,"Dogtooth' is a bizarre amplification of conditioning humans from birth. A Greek film, which deals with the subjects of confinement, recluse, incest among other rather uncommon states of mind. A complex Greek film, like this lovely film, directed with poetry by Lanthimos, simply must; for the sake of it's 'Golden Age (60's)', travel far and wide and acquire inspiration from the likes of Michalis Kakogiannis (1962 -2011) and find it's roots in texts of the Greek tragedian Euripides. On the other hand the film also has a bent towards the neorealism of Modern Greek Cinema. This film's narrative blends in the classic social context and use of uncommon or fresh actors; in order to remove any pretense that a known actor may carry. Perhaps also to walk that extra mile, naked without charging double. 'Dogtooth is an extremely strange film and a directorial achievement. Hilarious at times yet quite unsettling at others. The contemporary pace of the film is interjected with visuals that come at you with the force of a heavyweight's power jabs. Although calm on the surface, the underlying discomfort from the get go gets to you after a while. The movie pulls you in within it's three dimensional characters and you become a Dogtooth.Things start to look different, nothing seems right. The blatant Freudian punctuation , the mystery shrouded in psychosis, the back- story; everything happens slowly for your mind to grasp the details, editing, the intentional taping of 'out of frame heads'. All of it takes you deep inside a hole and leaves you there, expecting to find your way out.A dark, unexpectedly convoluted and a Gordian film whose violent scenes are either executed very well or the actors did get a real whack or two or three. In the end it sticks to you like caked blood.I am still pondering over the ending, without rational answers. However sometimes reason goes out the window and 'Dogtooth' settles in with ease or unease.",Dogtooth
121,cix_one,Impressive...,2,27 February 2011,"I see how this can be a movie that Hollywood-hating crowd can be fooled into liking. The folks who marketed this movie pulled it off masterfully. As I said, impressive...Let me explain. I *do* like good European movies. Yes, even the ones with long pauses (think Tarkowski's original Solaris). I *do* think Hollywood puts out a lot of violence-drenched crap (oh, but Got forbid, can't show any sex!). So I *am* as thirsty for European cinema and for indies as the next guy. But this doesn't mean I'm going to swallow anything you pour in my cup...The story of movie, simply put, has nothing. Nothing. OK, so sick people do exist. No breaking news there. The story *could* be interesting if the movie meant to be a dystopia, but it's completely unbelievable as portraying the ""real"" world (because the character's actions are unbelievable). So it's not dystopia and doesn't feel real. Then what is it? Most likely, just a bad movie...I can definitely believe that people either go gaga about this movie or they see it for what it is. As an intellectual American aspiring to rise to the refined taste of the Europeans, you're naturally compelled to see something in this movie. But as an European transplant in the States, I can only tell you not to fall for it; sometimes a bad movie is just that and nothing more. Oh, and when I tally my festival-going experience in the past 10 years: US & Canadian indies win over European movies, hands down.",Dogtooth
122,SteveJ_888,There's a difference between funny and stupid ...,1,26 October 2011,"If I learned anything from reading viewer reviews on IMDb it is that no matter how good I think a film is someone is going to hate it, and vice versa. I've also learned that when a film has won an award at Cannes there's a good chance it's going to be awful. I've concluded that some people like certain films solely because they are ""different."" Even when there is no story, no humor, or no action a film can still have some value if it has one essential element - truth. This film has absolutely nothing. The ""characters"" portrayed are no-shows. There are no reasons for their actions - they have no ""reality."" That's okay for a comedy, but this film isn't the least bit funny.The film is sometimes visually appealing – but so what? Some images are nicely composed, but even completely random use of a camera will eventually yield something. As an alternative to watching this I'd recommend simply walking around or sitting on a park bench for 90 minutes.

The concept is so weird, and yet, original. The idea that someone would do this kind of thing, willingly, to their children is crazy to me. Abusing your kids is one thing, but the manipulation of the three children (although?? they aren't still kids??) in the movie is on a whole other level. It has the horror of a thriller without the splatter. It takes home schooling to an extreme. The poor kids are so innocent, and have no idea that their whole world is wrong. It's such a sick family, and the whole group just agrees that this idea that what's happening is right.

I turned to my husband and said, ""I don't need to see any more of this, thank you."" It just went downhill from there.I do ""get"" what the filmmaker was going for and the message behind the film, but I can only think of one person I know who I could recommend this to -- a good friend who taught film studies for years at our local university.

125,mshackletonchavez,Great But Not For Everyone.,8,21 December 2018,"No one's quite has caught my attention as Yorgos Lanthimos has, and held it for such a feature. One of the most unique and brilliant cinematic experiences I've ever encountered.This film is simply stunning. There is nothing else quite like it,it being first venture into Greek cinema and Yorgos Lanthimos directorial style, I have subsequently ordered the rest of his films on DVD. Everything is so unique, the cinematography which stems from the directorial style is simply one of a kind, it has such a distinct visual framing. Often showing entire characters, or half covered by walls and inanimate objects, I personally feel this is one of the best ways to focus attention and bring about a deeper understanding of character, better than extreme closeups or standard angles. It feels so natural and yet unnatural, a near perfect balance. A lot of the background in this extremely contained film remains static, this adds to the eerie tone to a level that I have never before experienced. Mainly due to the directors evidently matured and strong voice.The performances are also extremely incredible, they are practically without fault. Christos Stergioglou, Michelle Valley, Angeliki Papoulia, Mary Tsoni, Christos Passalis and Anna Kalaitzidou all deserve the praise and recognition from this film. The characters feel so raw, more crude and real than almost all other films. The chemistry, pain, innocence, evil and wonder are all delivered with such assurance, confidence and talent that it is truly unforgettable.The inherent black comedy film is beyond any motion picture I have seen. This is not a film for people who like being spoon fed, it is the polar opposite of a black comedy such as Three Billboards and Birdman which feel like un-nuanced loud features in comparison to this. The screenplay by the director and Efthymis Filippou in tandem with the direction is much to thank for this. The ridiculous and yet cruel evil situation depicted within this film is a common thought experiment for some and a nightmare if ever truly practiced, as this film depicts. The danger of the Cat and then the fish introduced into the pool and the missing brother. They are all made to bark like dogs, all to make the father seem stronger. The son is frustrated, no world and often ponders about in his life bubble only gratified by Christina. The daughter who learned something about the outside world, and the fathers anger. It is so raw, and almost feels like it could really happen, as it is deeply human and displays our most innate desires and emotions so clearly.There is so much to praise, the directorial style, the performances, the cinematography, the timeless colouration that is very plain yet delivers in displaying the supposed purity but underlying evil of the household. Even down to the sound evokes and aids the tone, the set design in its angular walls and yet the house feels so big, such a little world yet it feels so big.I understand that many would dislike this feature length motion picture, a lot of people wouldn't get it. It is very subtle, some would call it boring or too long. And even I felt it was a little draggy in places. Also some may take distaste to the fact that this film gives no context, and just launches in. Leaving the audience to ponder and to slowly be delivered this world one piece at a time, but with modern audiences who like to be spoon fed more and like simpler plots, they wouldn't like this movie. Thus limiting this films broader appeal.Overall this is a truly great film, very much worth watching if one is interested in something very different from the usual tat one encounters these days. 8/10",Dogtooth
126,Naive-fox,Walking the thin line,5,21 March 2017,"Having recently seen Yorgos Lanthimos' ""The lobster"", I was well aware of what to expect from this early job of his. Maybe ""The lobster"" weakened the punch that only the first film from a director can deliver. Perhaps altering the viewing order would have swapped my opinion in both films. Or perhaps I simply find Lanthimo's essay in family bonds, seclusion and education flat and too unnatural.Yorgos Lanthimos' fresh breath in cinema is always welcome. The weird and tense atmosphere of Dogtooth is masterfully crafted, if sometimes over the line and beyond. The overuse of explicit sexual themes and some graphic scenes may drive some people away. While some are there for a reason, many are thrown in for pure shock value.Yet it is the forced innexpressivenes of the actors that bothers me the most. Trying to recreate a mechanical, unaffective behavior of three teenagers raised in seclusion, their lack of expression goes often over the top failing to create any kind of response on the viewer. The lack of sense in some of the parents' actions and the children's lack of any analytical skill doesn't help a film that goes too far to reiterate the same concept over and over.Dogtooth's open ending may fit best a film of his kind, but ultimately leaves the viewer with too hollow a sensation of non- conclusion after over ninety minutes of reiteration.",Dogtooth
127,lrishJoe78,Brilliantly disturbing,8,9 December 2012,"This was one of those movies that doesn't leave your head for quite some time after you've watched it. It manages to be both disturbing and funny at the same time. Indeed I can't remember the last time I saw a movie which caused a cinema audience both to laugh out loud and look away from the screen in genuine horror like Dogtooth did.The movie takes on the concept of a family living in complete isolation from the world in a remote country home, with the ultra-controlling parents making up a reality as they go along to keep their three teenagers inside the home and inside the reality bubble they have constructed. Despite the insanity of it all, the film avoids the trap of becoming a classic horror and instead makes the characters human and relatable throughout.While this is certainly not for the faint-hearted, those who give it a chance will find it to be thought-provoking, funny, scary and not a little crazy. My only criticism might be that the story left a lot of unanswered questions, but perhaps that is no accident, and the beauty of it is that it doesn't matter.",Dogtooth

131,Nhirscher,Oh Brother...,9,2 December 2018,"Out of all the absurdly bonkers movies that I have seen of Yorgos's filmography, David Lynch's filmography, and Chan-wook Park's filmography-- I can say, with unabashed conviction, that this is the most absurdly bonkers.Dogtooth explores a father's sheltering of his family to the most extreme point. The teenagers in the family, of which there are two girls and a boy, are raised under an entirely isolated culture that is dictated via the mother and father. They are taught the meaning of words that are contrary to society's definitions of certain words. Naturally, this lends itself to hilariously comedic moments of situational irony.Yorgos, through his explanation of the origins of certain words and ideas, supports postmodernism and deconstructionalism. Both of these, in the film, clearly lead to an assertion that the world is one of cultural relativism. Normalcy is just made up by society.The film, independent of its philosophy on language, has a buffet of quirk and black comedy and absurdity and horror to satisfy. Dogtooth will have you howling in laughter less than five minutes before you are wincing in tangible pain.This movie is simultaneously a movie that explores such profound philosophies with such great subtlety and also a movie that has straight up incestuous...cough... touching. (Note: I use the word 'touching' to avoid censorship.)I recommend this film to someone searching for an exploration of society's impact on its people with a tough enough skin to avoid the potential mental scarring that may result of a few, touching, Dogtooth scenes.9/10",Dogtooth
132,pratyush,Dogtooth - close to a masterpiece,9,19 December 2010,"Not a lot of movies shock me. So I was quite surprised the unsettling impact Dogtooth had on me. A father locks up his 3 children who are in their late teens - early twenties in a large house and they have stayed there all their lives.The three children are told lies of various degrees. Living totally isolated from the world and in a manufactured universe, they do not react like normal people would. The lack of awareness and exposure makes for very interesting scenarios and reactions.The film can be pondered upon on several levels. For instance, governments never really tell their people any thing close to the whole truth. Thoughts on these lines - the harms caused by leaving people in the dark are the obvious things one can take back from the movie.I am very interested in the alternate viewpoint of the parents though. They genuinely thought exposing the children to the world would be harmful for them. While that is not some thing one can possibly agree with, there are some positives which do come out of it in my opinion. For instance, when one of the girls who has never having been exposed to popular culture, dances, she creates some thing unique. As she has not seen any thing before, she is not influences by any thing and creates her own style. That is a positive in my mind.This is film which is close to a masterpiece. When the film had released, it was panned in The New York Times and received an average review from Roger Ebert. I am quite pleased then, that it is slowly getting appreciation and is ending up in a few best of the year lists as well. This is a must watch according to me. 8.5/10.",Dogtooth

It's probably the most interesting movie I've ever watched.Now, being interesting doesn't mean that it's either good or bad. But it has different elements in it which makes it unique and also in my very own opinion, good, in the first place. You feel like it's about some kind of an example of a dsytopic world but it happens in the most realistic way that you also feel like it's the real world. What makes it really masterful is, the system is intelligently criticized with lots of metaphors that makes sense and a family with 5 members.There are plenty of scenes to talk about for hours and hours. It makes you think in a different way, it disturbs you to make you realize the lines that are drawn for you in your life. The details are everywhere, they are in every scene. The movie is there to show that the manipulations in the real world are shaped by the freedom and the different perspectives.These are the movies that describe the cinema best, not the action-packed Hollywood movies that denies you the ability of thinking.Anyone who is interested in the art of cinema should watch it without any hesitation.9/10",Dogtooth

I love the actors who transform themselves into a world of artifice with a ferociousness, you can see it in their intense gaze.The airplane scene is funny! The dog and cat horror motif, jarring perhaps, but it's funny! The bathtub scene - incest à la Russ Meyer is not so funny. As my 3rd cousin once removed used to joke, incest is best. No Gracie, it really isn't.The film is a profound and dismal commentary on the self imposed blinders we wear everyday. We're all humans captured in the zoo of our own making. Surrounded by a tall hedge we can't see what's on the other side.

The result is creepy to say none the least.What's creepy is, that the teenagers are still treated like toddlers and are not allowed to know the meaning of bad words like 'zombie' and 'cunt'. The parents also make things up to keep the balance. This balance is immediately disturbed by outside influences like the girlfriend of one of the teenagers and even a visiting cat in the garden. The parents try to restore this balance with even more lies to disastrous effects.Classifying this movie is hard, but you can see the influence of Lars von Trier well in this young director.

All signs form the outside is translated by the parents to fit into the hermetic prison-world that they have created for the now adolescent kids. Imagine it like ""Blue Lagoon"" made by Michael Haneke if you catch my drift.To fight of the obvious boredom the kids invent games and competitions. Good behavior, according to the parents, is awarded with stickers. There may, or may not have been an older brother in the house who may have escaped, or might have died: it's hard to tell how far the parents rules goes, but they are no stranger to cruelty. That's it basically. We follow the strange family with their odd behavior. Their system works, but for how long? What if the kids start to question it and if so, what will the parents do? It might be good to remember that even stranger relations have existed in the real world and most likely still does.

Is it any good? Well, the concept is excellent and very relevant, we have established that. The acting at times is a bit weird and stilted but then you realise why they talk in this strange way. The occasional moments of violence are brilliantly filmed, so much so that you feel that the daughter, to refer to one scene, is really being hit hard over the head. The framing seems a bit odd - some out-of-focus shots, lots of missing heads, makes it seem a bit amateurish. In fact, at times it is almost as though Lanthimos is trying to make a Greek Dogme 95 film. This is a minor gripe though, and on the whole I enjoyed this film (as did many people in the well-attended Greenwich Picturehouse in South London last night). And, bizarrely, occasionally very very funny. The ending won't be to everybody's taste but, on the train afterwards, I struggled to think of a better ending. All in all, the film has awakened my appetite to Lanthimos's work and I will certainly try to seek out his two previous films, ""Kinetta"" and ""O kalyteros mou filos"".I see that ""Dogtooth"" has been sent to the Academy as Greece's representative for next year's Oscars. Well, I can't see it winning, but I certainly can see it making the final five. I keep my fingers crossed.",Dogtooth

Everything bad in their life is directly or indirectly the consequence of their parents' actions. I suppose the viewers of the kind I mentioned will feel a perverse pleasure mixed with pain... A kind of filial masochism, I guess. The rest of you who are more like me, and don't get a kick out of identifying with victims, will be quite bored, I'm afraid.

153,rbrogan-61779,A film where the viewing experience is very much dependent on the sensibilities of the viewer,8,30 September 2015,"Dogtooth is a film where the viewing experience is very much dependent on the sensibilities of the viewer. For myself, I found it quite absurd and ridiculous from the outset and was not shocked (much). I rate Dogtooth up mostly because I enjoyed the indie style of shooting, reminiscent of Submarine and Wes Andersen films, which made gave the film a more satirical than disturbing character. After reading other reactions, I wondered whether this is a film that ought to be laughed at or if it ought to induce cringing (at least one scene, in particular does). After thinking about it, I thought that yes, satire ought to be laughed at and the subject matter ought to be seen as quite stupid; horror and fear are not an appropriate response. If anything, horror and fear bolster something that should be opposed. However, having some parts, here and there, that are more serious than funny is also good, since we do not want to just totally laugh off topics that are important.",Dogtooth

Apparently it's funny that the father and mother habitually lie to their children about what various objects are called. If the objective was to make a satire out of perceived normative family social dynamics, the film has failed miserably. If the film's objective was to create a farcical & barbaric piece of trash, I would say it's a job superbly done. Overall, it is of no value.If anything, this film demonstrates how insulated art house and independent cinema producers desire to be. Stick the badge of artistic license (&, somewhat bizarrely, the badge of dark comedy) on a film that encourages its audience to laugh at the language, narratives and existential questions of identity twisted by psychological manipulation & you'll know what kind of people that this film attracts.

One of the most unpredictable films I have ever seen. Which is very complimentary. In his comments, Lanthimos said he attempted to imagine-SF style-the future of the family for the latest hardliners of this failing institution. For this audacity only he deserves to rank high with Baron Cohen. What happens next, the smithy of euphemisms parents find for their children, their mechanical take on sexuality, the insularity of judgement are very thought provoking. It makes you think in all ways possible, from suave at the girls'games to vehement at the sudden bursts of violence, profound after the end credits. Daily bread for Alzheimer dodgers.

This quote invented by the mother could be the epitome of ""Dogtooth"". Distortion is systematic. Zombies are yellow flowers while young flowers turn into zombies. It's nothing but a question of definition as far as definitions do not distort the balance of this imaginary, yet somehow applied reality. Something like the boy sitting next to me in this internet café while I'm typing these words, captured in his ""Mafia Wars"" reality. The parents of this boy sitting next to me, are presumably not rich enough to afford to built a false and consistently deceptive world, an expensive shelter, in order to ""protect"" their children from the malice of reality, so they let their boy on his own Are they more indifferent or simply more honest to themselves comparing to the ""Dogtooth"" parents? Well, ask Mr. Balboa, not meAnd then as a sequence of what one would call ""crime and punishment"", ""a nobody"" who –unluckily- is so fond of oral sex, an ""instrumentum vocale"" hired by the father-master to cover some basic needs of the family, becomes the catalyst for the forced fulfillment, the broken dogtooth and the untraceable blood Worth seeing only if you have not read all these dithyrambic reviews...P.S.

161,hjpog,It's a pretty good piece of art..,8,11 March 2017,"First of all, the movie is definitely a good example of an art film as I mentioned in the title. The film has a thought-provoking, mind-blowing structure. It certainly causes questions about the system. Of course we have seen films that question this contradictory system. Like Fight Club or American Beauty. But these movies give the messages directly to the audience. In Dogtooth, the audience has to make a good effort to understand criticism. Because in Dogtooth, a person who watches a movie in a normal way is hard to get messages and even does not understand. A person watching the film in this way can perceive the film as just a simple thriller and see that a father has raised his children with his deviant experiences. But by doing so, the director is actually questioning the authority and aims to show people the problems of accepting things imposed. So when you see that the characters in the film are similar to the dogs, it is absolutely wrong to perceive them as humor only. On the contrary, you can see this as a bad thing. Certainly a film that should be considered quite complex while watching. If we come to the cast in the movie, maybe it could be a big name for the Greek cinema. But there is never an artist around the world. Such a seemingly simple squad seems to have done an good job. I can also say there is no contrived scene. While watching the film, I can say that there are a lot of directors that I liked the style of director Yorgos Lanthimos. First of all, I can give you an example of Terrence Malick. Because there was a great visual throughout the movie. Terrence Malick's films are about complex visuals. Really it is not simple to achieve such a good visual. And the director used the camera quite well. I can say that you are quite relieved when you watch that wonderful visual. The other director I find close to the director's style is definitely Quentin Tarantino. Because the director has been very brave and really wants to give everything directly to the audience. If we give an example, nudity and blood come first. Every cinematographer knows that Quentin Tarantino uses the blood issue very well. This director did not overdo it when he was using blood, but he also gave blood at the appropriate level. And there's a nice silence in the movie. Too many directors use it. My mind came to Sergio Leone first. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, we saw in the beginning of the movie that no one made a sound for a long time. There was such a scene in Dogtooth. It's a pretty good movie for me. The film criticizes the rulings in a very good way. The film has received some bad reviews because of its courage. But this is a wrong idea for me because it is an art film and the director has the right to give everything. In addition, Dogtooth has the Oscar nomination for best foreign film in 2011. It's like a good show of the success of this film. And overall Dogtooth is not a masterpiece for me, but I can call it a pretty good example of an art film.",Dogtooth

This film talks about the myths and lies we are told to maintain status quo and the appearance of stability and normality. It explores the abuse of protecting a child from outside influences to the extreme of denying human instincts and inquisitiveness about their world. Its shows how telling children lies for their own safety makes them fearful of the world and patronises there innate understanding about life. Its amazing because it creates a world with an absurd, fully realised, vocabulary that is completely understood by the members of this family ; its surreal nature forces you to question the oddness and the parameters of your own existence.

Just when it looks like things might get interesting the film ends and I sat there feeling cheated and thinking I might have been better off spending my time watching paint dry instead of this film. Everything about the film is dull - the plot, the characters, the dialogue. Most of the time when I see a film I don't like, I can still pick out one or two redeeming features but I genuinely cannot understand why anyone would like this film let alone watch it more than once. And as for it being called dark, very disturbing, intense - really? There was one part I was mildly disturbed by then I went back to feeling bored again. I'm guessing I was supposed to care about the children but I didn't. The only interesting thing about this film is the fact that the female characters are always instantly ready for sex with absolutely no foreplay and don't seem to be in any pain during it even the girl who I'm guessing was still a virgin. That's the only thing about the film that has stayed with me which is not good. Seriously I would not recommend this film to anyone except as a possible insomnia cure.",Dogtooth

165,dedalus7632,"Lick my shoulder, please..",7,6 December 2010,"A far reach from the Jules Dassin/Melinda Mercouri comedies of a generation ago, this erotic horror comedy shows a dark side of rural Greece, with a Hitchcockian logic that works within its own framework and makes it a candidate for a re-make, someday, tying up a few loose ends. The insane world the parents create for their teenage family falls apart when the daughters discover sex, the trade-off that buys them into the new world being a jar of hair jell. The father is suavely insane, but his wife goes along and if anything, she is further beyond the pale than he. One hopes for the girls' canines (dogteeth), to appear, with their prophesy of escape. In one scene, the younger girl's primal dancing suggests a much earlier Greek paganism, and her mother has to calm her down. In general, though, the games the family plays have a disconcertingly modern if not innocuous feel. George Cosmatos wrote a script about a crazy family in a similar setting, ending with their hacking each other to death. This film doesn't go that far. You are aware of an underlying sense of doom, and the lingering shot of the father's Mercedes, his having disappeared through the door of the factory to his day job, as if things were normal, is a good visual for its unanswered questions.",Dogtooth

It is almost deemed a fact to say there is no film like itIt is a film that makes you think a large deal about what you've just witnessed and how the content reflects on modern society today.There are many questions still hanging in your mind when the closing credits begin. Firstly, you wonder why these parents went to such an extreme for their children or how, with the father knowing of the outside world, condemns the strange behavior the siblings learn to adopt to. Your questions will hang off the paper.Dogtooth is a haunting and thought-provoking portrayal of what lack of knowledge and ignorance does to the human mind and how it impacts someone completely locked away from the outside world. Perhaps there are thousands of people in North Korea asking each other if their dogtooths look loose?Although the film is very slow and lacks the excitement of Lanthimos' other films like The Lobster and The Favourite, I recommend Dogtooth for the experience and for aspiring filmmakers who would like to the film and it's style.",Dogtooth

I have honestly never seen any other film like it. Sometimes hysterical, sometimes shockingly intense. It is a hypnotic trip that displays brilliant originality and borderlines pure insanity.

I would loved to see the ending very different, for instance, the realisation of the kids of the outside world , exiting their house ,the redemption(something like the Truman Show). Also , i think that the movie is a little bit gross with the incest , and all the weird sex scenes. Finally, i would like to point out that the acting is great, the kids speaking i a slow monotonous voice, due to the lack of socialization, but what i found strange is the fact that other people outside of the house speak the same , like the female security guard . 7/10 , With the director Yorgos Lanthimos to be very promising , and hopefully bringing sometime soon an Oscar to Greece.",Dogtooth

Weather someone wants to interpret that on a society or family scale it doesn't really matter for the results and characteristics are the same. Although since I grew up in Greece i believe that that movie wants to focus on the outdated traditional Greek family values that for some reason still survive in many cases. The original motive of protecting the children leads to isolation, lies, manipulation, corruption and the creation of a world that makes twisted, incomplete individuals of both the parents and the children.This is a highly symbolic film that uses exaggerated, harsh images and stories to get its opinion out clearly. Whoever tries to interpret the events of this film literally and tries to find realistic motives in the characters will fail miserably.

The situation though, gets very upset when sex comes in to the equation. As the Satan itself, it gives the knowledge to those characters to understand more about their lives and live moments of pleasure, moments forbidden by the system they live in.

I am glad to say that this one was good, period. It is definitely not an easy movie to watch, as it can be really intense and deals with one or two traditionally taboo issues, but it is definitely worth giving it a chance. For me it has been a completely surreal experience, best described as stepping into a world as peaceful as heaven and as confining as hell, where things seem to work in their own whimsical way, leaving me with a constant bafflement as to what is to come next. I honestly did not realize how time went by and, when it all came to an end, I found myself asking for more. This is a movie that disturbed, moved and fascinated me while I was watching it and made me think after having watched it. It is surreal, it is symbolic (it could definitely be seen from a political point of view), it is ironic and at times it can be unexpectedly funny in a dark, twisted way. Directing it in a ""dry"", ""strict"" manner, as if just trying to capture the events that take place, was definitely a perfect choice, as was the complete absence of music. The actors did a great job at acting in the emotionally detached manner that was required plus, I have to say, it probably took lots of guts for them to do some of their most ""awkward"" scenes. All in all, I would say I admired the artistic integrity of the director and actors and their dedication to getting across the main idea and the atmosphere of this movie.I don't really know how I could classify ""Dogtooth"". Is it a drama? (Well for a drama it is kind of under-plotted.) Is it a comedy? (It is definitely not a comedy, even when you laugh you are still disturbed by the absurdity of it all.) Is it horror? (It is not horror, it's just a horrific situation but everything, the horror, the violence etc is mostly implied.) Is it fantasy? (Well it is an alternate reality, but mind you this is a family that kind of looks ""normal"" on the outside!) So really, I give up. It's just a really strange, really intriguing movie, one that in my opinion is definitely worth your time.Oh and one more thing: it is also one of these movies that it is best to know the least things possible before you see them. Quite a few things (particularly the funny ones) are based on shock value - not that the whole movie is based on shock value, of course. If you ask me, even the theatrical trailers show too much.",Dogtooth
183,anup-2111,this dog has got really sharp tooth.,8,21 May 2013,"Fresh piece of art called 'Kynodontas' alias dogtooth that could truly define modern art in moving terms.Surely not meant for the people who take movie as just another popcorn entertainment.This had the acting more often you expect in theatrical play.One of those movies that pictured gory circumstances in the most naive way possible be it the ""lick for gift scene"" or ""running to bag the crashed plane"", the anesthesia game, not to mention the incests that happened without even knowing it was one.The plane expressions,so consistent that you do not miss the lack of it.All the characters perfectly portrayed.The movie starts slow paced where you feel is it just you or everyone else too who is waiting for something to happen.As it progresses you accept and start liking the fact that this was the only pace movie could have moved.What the creator is trying to show does not need much of scene change or pace.Perfect cinema for audience who likes disturbing stories.The movie is strange and gory not because of some blood bath scene or killing,instead the effect that it creates as a father crosses all the boundary of deceit due to his twisted beliefs.If you liked Dreamer,Happiness,you will adore this 94mins of strange experience through Greek cinema. Truly defines why this movie has made its place in the academy award nominees list for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year.",Dogtooth
184,zuhair_v,How to Train your Dragons,8,9 February 2014,"'Dogtooth' is a bizarre amplification of conditioning humans from birth. A Greek film, which deals with the subjects of confinement, recluse, incest among other rather uncommon states of mind. A complex Greek film, like this lovely film, directed with poetry by Lanthimos, simply must; for the sake of it's 'Golden Age (60's)', travel far and wide and acquire inspiration from the likes of Michalis Kakogiannis (1962 -2011) and find it's roots in texts of the Greek tragedian Euripides. On the other hand the film also has a bent towards the neorealism of Modern Greek Cinema. This film's narrative blends in the classic social context and use of uncommon or fresh actors; in order to remove any pretense that a known actor may carry. Perhaps also to walk that extra mile, naked without charging double. 'Dogtooth is an extremely strange film and a directorial achievement. Hilarious at times yet quite unsettling at others. The contemporary pace of the film is interjected with visuals that come at you with the force of a heavyweight's power jabs. Although calm on the surface, the underlying discomfort from the get go gets to you after a while. The movie pulls you in within it's three dimensional characters and you become a Dogtooth. Things start to look different, nothing seems right. The blatant Freudian punctuation , the mystery shrouded in psychosis, the back- story; everything happens slowly for your mind to grasp the details, editing, the intentional taping of 'out of frame heads'. All of it takes you deep inside a hole and leave you there, expecting to find your way out.A dark, unexpectedly convoluted and a Gordian film whose violent scenes are either executed very well or the actors did get a real whack or two or three. In the end it sticks to you like caked blood.I am still pondering over the ending, without rational answers. However sometimes reason goes out the window and 'Dogtooth' settles in with ease or unease.",Dogtooth
185,qwertyuioplkjhgfdsazxx,What a trip!,5,3 August 2021,"I think the overall message the movie is trying to convey is fairly clear, it's about the dangers of home schooling, cults, and indoctrination at a very young age that has lasted until the three children became adults, and the family of this movie represents an extreme case that could actually be legal. The brainwashing and the low education of these children is a reality not only of this movie, which is set in the 70s, but of today as well (the only math problem they have to solve is basic school stuff, but the women can't solve it).I like several aspects that this movie presents, like sexism (among many things, the son has a guitar, the piano and an easel and even a personal sex servant to have fun with, while the girls have to share chloroform and a headband; also the idea that women peak before their 30, while man are still good until 40), brainwashing (the gaslighting of the children is pretty evident, but the wife was probably brain washed by the husband as a child, as she seems to have lived in human society, as evident by her hiding while throwing a fake small airplane to trick her children into thinking it fell from the sky, but does not understand that she can't give birth to twins and a dog, and chose when to deliver them), fear mongering (being afraid of cats and being told to behave like dogs to fight them like a military training exercise), abuse of power (the security guard who could have lost her job if she hadn't accepted being a private sex worker of the boss's son), complete lack of empathy and sympathy for literally anyone or anything (an example that comes to mind is when the son got hit by a hammer by the sister, his reward was not being comforted by his parent, but he got slapped by his dad instead), and the movie portrays these in an original way.The movie has many comedic moments, some intentional (inhaling chloroform-like liquid as a fun activity, the seemingly calm and goofy dog that was going to be trained to be aggressive like a rottweiler, the girl getting tired after dancing for 30 seconds at the anniversary show and asking to sit at the table like a child, the obviously fake cat) and others maybe not have been intended to be funny (like the fake blood that squirted out the son's arm stab wound, or the girls face when she smashes her teeth).I also liked the slow progression of the movie (how Christina introduced the licking as a pleasure thing to someone who understood it as an exchange method, which then transformed into a blackmail way of getting something which led to the climax of the movie).The animal instincts of the human being, related to sexuality, violence, jealousy and such were conveyed in a very uncomfortable manner, which makes a lot of sense since the characters aren't really human beings since they never lived in the real world with other humans (the themes of the movie reminded me a lot of The Lobster, and I was not surprised when I found out they were directed by the same person).However, like The Lobster, there are many questions that the movie clearly chose to not answer (like how can overly protective parents have a knife, a weight, garden scissors and a hammer with easy access, why did the dad share to the children the only ways they could abandon the house, if the world was such a horrible place with cats that eat children; and many others). In my opinion, it is clear that you don't need such information to get the message of the movie, but it makes the development of the story less believable and plausible.My brain naturally suppresses and forgets embarrassing, cringing and uncomfortable moments, so I believe I'll forget most of this movie in a few months. Hence, even though I like the already mentioned themes and the presentation of the movie (I was always engaged and never bored), my apparent low score comes from the fact that all the discomfort and unrest I felt while watching this movie will eventually lead me to only remember very little things about it. Yet, I understand and respect very positive reviews of this film and I will still recommend other people to watch it once in their lives (as well as The Lobster).My favourite part of the film has to be the last shot of the movie, where it is framed in a way that made me expect that the daughter would open the trunk and escape, but nothing happens. In my view, this is a big metaphor that now I was the one that was living in a movie fantasy where the girl escapes and wins, while the movie was the realist one, where she probably never left the trunk derived from the fact that she doesn't know how car works, and probably would not understand the lock mechanisms. Interesting touch to end this interesting movie.",Dogtooth
186,batuhancanliturk,Minor scale example of the system which imprisons us,8,21 October 2017,"Authority is a person or organization having political or administrative power and control. Governments have authority on their people or on other states. Understanding the fact that authority is the reason of major events that we are not aware while time is swift. We should consider of our parents as an authority in minor scale. This is exactly what Dogtooth wants us to think of.Authoritarian father, his wife and his children live in peace and quiet isolated house with the garden. All events that happen is known by the father who obsessively wants to raise his children with his rules and his understandings. There are no diversity between the children to ensure consistency like the governments do. In the name of becoming uniform, children have no names. Hence, they can not develop their identities. They are all same to the father which is ruler. There are rules for everything and the rewards for achieving tasks. If we have rewards, there must be punishments too for the unsuitable actions. These are strong components of the system which runs by the father. Language is created by parents too. They change words' meaning like in pussy and zombie scenes. That is another example for use of power. Beside that, he keep his authority on his children in patriarchal way. He assigns task for his elder daughter to satisfy her brother who had previously a woman to meet his sexual urges like a robot. On the other hand, there is even no chance to talk about his daughters. Raising his children with this attitude keeps them stay in their childish behaviors. We can view that in many scenes such as arguing about the plane toy and sleeping with their parents. They can not grow to maturity.Children obtain information about everything without questioning from the tape which has recorded before. It is their only way to learn something such as geometry. We have also seen that in the record player scene which the father makes wrong translations for maintaining loyalty to the authority and the family. He also ensures his sovereignty by this action. Fear is another need for achieve his monopoly. All the dinners should be attended formally. Remember the scene that his daughters discusses their dresses are okay or not. Because they are afraid of their fathers reaction if he finds anything improper. In order to block interactions with the outer world between his children, father removes all labels and tags on the products they use. This idea makes me think about the North Korea. People of North Korea get what their leader gives.All the mess begin with the woman who is a security guard. When she wants to misuse elder child for the first time, elder starts to learn from her about the outer world. Because of routine of reward system, she did not hesitate to fulfill her demands and maintain the same attitude for her sister. Movie tapes leaves bigger impression for the elder. The idea of leaving started to grow. However when she decided to leave, she tried with the way that defined by the father which says they can only leave if their dog-tooth's fall down. Another example of outer world encounter is the cat. It becomes another fear and misery for the children. Misery always pull people to its unknown that the father uses a lot.Finally, I want to add two more things which light upon. First one is mirroring between the dog trainer and the father. They both work for ""cultivating"" of their ""pupils"". Second is perception of happiness. Whether if we talked about father's actions is proper or not, children are happy to be there. It is like us in our tiny worlds without realizing anything out of it.",Dogtooth
187,dwmarshall1,A genius film on so many levels,10,2 May 2011,"A great film, and one that must have been hell for the cast to make. It works on so many levels. It castigates those parents who believe that the only way to raise their kids is by shielding them from every outside influence. It derides the use we make of myth, folk tale and downright lies to create an alternative, scary world that they must inhabit. As a system of controlling a nation (and I wonder to what extent this is influenced by the financial problems of Greece) it shows how lies in any closed system can sustain that system for a while but must always end in revolt. The spin of benign nations, too, is crucial in controlling its people.

Τhat is why we don't know where or when everything is happening. This film demonstrates a universal problem. People might think that it is a mockery of western society or capitalism. I don't believe that to be true. It's the same weather you live in the middle east or in Europe. Whether you have cappitalism or communism. It's not specified politically. Because in the end it doesn't matter. It is about our lives and how we choose to lead them. We ARE trapped. We are being told LIES every day from our parents, who want the best for us, but they don't know any better. But they were raised the same way they are raising us. It's a circle. And from our governments as well. But we can't break free, because that's all we know. We still choose to participate in such a society. That is the absurd. And that is why this movie is surreal or supposedly weird and raw.But what about reality shows? Or splatters? Or Rambo? Or Die Hard? Aren't they absurd? Yes. Do we watch them? Yes. Because they're not about us.

189,them42,Ruuffff! : I gave it a 2 (one for each laugh),2,16 March 2015,"It's very difficult to write negative comments about a movie when so many other heap praise on it. I find that although I want to say ""it's complete crap and anyone who says it's artsy, deep or interesting is simply a pretentious loser"", I realize that wouldn't be fair because they may see things that I am missing. Those that liked this might simply be more ""film savvy"" than I am and have a better feel for the nuanced cinematic even that this could very well be. I just don't know. With that said, I have to say that I thought this was complete crap.Here's why:As you probably already know, a husband and wife decide to raise their kids in isolation. They want to protect them from the evil world around them. I assume they are home schooled. The boy certainly knows how to play the guitar – do they have books – how did he learn (mother or father)? The girls dance but as we see, clearly they had no instructor (the guitar/dance performance was one of two scenes that I enjoyed). They have told the children that leaving the grounds is deadly – they must remain within the gates or suffer horrible consequences. They seem to be okay with this. They seem to be okay with just about everything. They seem like idiots.The look and feel of the movie is lifeless and drab. Maybe that was the intention but right from the beginning I felt distanced rather than involved or interested. I was not drawn in – if anything, I was put off. The music was not noteworthy with the one exception of Akira Ifukube's Godzilla segment – a great piece but out of place in this total POS.The characters themselves are boring. Living in isolation like these three do would not make them imbeciles and yet that is how they behave (and so does the ""normal"" girl brought in as a sex partner – the fourth imbecile). The children appear to be in their late teens or early twenties and other than that, we get to learn nothing about them. There are a few sexual encounters that take place but they are no more interesting or revealing than when we get to see the kids drinking orange juice.The adults are just as dull. A drag to look at – two old burnouts with little to say. Their responses to the children's questions are very, very lame. Their ""teaching moments"" are so over the top and contrived that you don't buy into any of it (get on all fours and bark – this is how you protect yourself from the dangerous predatory house cat). Okay, I'll admit that I laughed when they all went into a barking frenzy.The ending is attempting to say ""something"" – I am not sure what they intended, but to me it seemed to say ""hey, we're still out of good ideas!"".Okay, so what do I have here - 94 minutes of screen time. Three of those spent laughing at the celebratory brother/sister musical act. Add in another minute of mild amusement during the barking scene. That leaves ninety minutes of crap and anyone who says it's artsy, deep or interesting is simply a pretentious loser (yes, I am kidding - I just disagree strongly).",Dogtooth
190,natg520,Hypothetically Speaking,8,22 February 2011,"This a dark comedy and it takes the question of the family very seriously. So if you can't take an absurd situation as being a valid way to explore our everyday reality then you should skip this one. But this one is so good that it can only be compared with films from very established directors like Lars Von Trier or Michael Haneke. This isn't mumble core, though it has some of the same trappings. The dialog is simple, slow and sometimes idiotic, but it's in context. And that context is an extreme that works for this film.For all of it's charm and inanity at times, this is a very brutal work. The violence can't be passed off as just part of the plot or some cool movie stunt. It is very real. I could almost feel it. It was shocking, not for the actual event that takes place in the film, but because it was timed so well. For this made-up family it makes a twisted sense. It's this horrifying ""making of sense"" within an absurd context that is the director's brilliance. I put this film up there with ""The Boss of it All"" or ""Benny's Video"".",Dogtooth
191,sparkyjaffe,weird but not really interesting,1,26 March 2011,"I had read about this film, and thought it must have some merit...so I kept watching even though I failed to find it anything more than repellent. I was sure something would happen that would redeem it, but nothing did. Two parents abuse their almost adult children by keeping them totally apart from the world except for visits from Christina, the security guard who is paid to come provide sex to the son. Presumably there was an older son,but despite my hopes, nothing comes of this concept. I suspect the film was meant to be black humor, and I could see it was trying (the father doing a translation of the Frank Sinatra song was the most blatant example; but perhaps making a kitten the frightening predator was supposed to be funny as well)but it did not amuse me. Ah, jeez, think I'll stick with Wes Anderson for my family humor.",Dogtooth
192,berbasloth,Moments of inspiration but flawed IMO,7,11 May 2010,"I don't know where to begin with it so I'll lay out the plot very thinly first. The story takes place within a large family house with a husband, a wife and three children who are being kept in the house for some reason that isn't made fully clear. For me the movie started out intriguing with the opening scenes showing the particular quirks and absurdities of this family's life being amusing and engaging. The movie owes a debt I think to Michael Haneke on a visual level and a thematic one, especially the darker subject matter being framed by the children dressed in virginal clothing looking innocent whilst engaging in very adult situations and sometimes the feel of something like Funny Games does linger in the air from time to time. I've no doubt that the film is a statement on Governments treatment of people as children who need to be shielded from certain things but ultimately for me the film doesn't quite hit in the way that The White Ribbon does because it didn't seem to get out of first gear on a narrative level. I didn't feel a great sense of growing tension or knew where the story might go, and the disjointed scenes no matter how arresting on their own didn't quite gel to make a cohesive movie that left me satisfied as a viewer. Maybe I'll enjoy it more as a whole next time around but I would definitely recommend this movie at least for the experience of seeing some of the scenes.",Dogtooth

Probably close to 30% of the audience walked out, but I was encouraged by the 70+% that remained, especially since most of the audience were 60+ Americans. The 20-somethings I talked to on the way out were very enthusiastic. The woman sitting next to me said ""What did it mean?

Everything from the dangers of creating a ""perfect family"" to ""the mechanization of capitalism and upper middle class life"" to metaphors for the dangers of repressive families and governments.

A country that everything goes wrong in it, the people are subjugated and oppressed, freedom of speech doesn't exist and privacy is eradicated. This film is a portrayal of that country but within the compounds of a house. The irony is, which exist in many other films about dystopias, the house according to the father, that is to say the ruler, is a perfect haven for his children to grow. He creates an enemy as to turn them supporters of his cause. The enemy instead of being a belligerent country is the outside itself, it is the place that only when your dogtooth fell should you be able to live in it safely.When one think about the future, one might be frightened of the future in which climate has changed in a way decimates countries and artificial intelligence is the biggest threat on the survival of humanity. But one might also think about family. What families will look like in the future? In a world that capitalism enjoys its utmost brutality and technology devastates social interactions, what doesn't mean to protect your family from any harm?One might think about an act of going to live in the wilderness as an attempt to live peacefully out of the reach of the hands of modern world.

200,golden_dove88,And the Emperor was wearing no clothes,3,29 August 2010,"I first saw this at the SXSW film festival. I had high hopes because this film had won several awards and seemed to have gotten high reviews. Not to mention it seemed to be a very interesting movie. However I was greatly disappointed. Within the first few minutes of the film a woman turned to me, utterly confused, and said 'Is this Dogtooth? Am I in the wrong theater?'. Unfortunately, yes, we were in the right theater.The flaw with the film isn't necessarily style, though it is one that is very strange, it's more of a huge flaw in directing and story telling. Often moments would drag on for five minutes more then it should and the events lacked the flow it needed to keep anyone interested. Five minutes felt like ten, ten felt like twenty, and, well, you get the picture.The story was there but very thinly present. Not to mention the director or writer, who ever is to blame for this, seemed to resort to cheap gimmicks (the long awkward sex scenes, unnecessary gore, etc) just to try to keep it interesting and edgy. But this isn't what makes a good movie, that has never been the case. If it still had these things in it, but it still had a strong story then I wouldn't care. However it seems to me that the director was too caught up in doing something scandalous that he forgot what this film was supposed to be about. It was obvious from the start what was going on and it didn't let us think about any other possibilities. Yes, I get it, it's a metaphor but that doesn't mean it's a very good one.It's boring, and I suppose you can point the finger at me and say something along the lines of 'you're not cultured enough' or 'it's art!' but the fact of the matter is just because a pile of dog dirt might look like the Virgin Mary, it doesn't mean that it's necessarily a holy relic.If you're really REALLY interested in watching this.

I mean big boy, or immature man boy. And yes, he gets to choose which sister will become the regular service provider. Isn't that a lovely cute family ???Obviously my parents neglected to take care of those needs of mine. :( now how cruel is that you say for a horny dude. Boy, did they do a number on me. I guess I missed out on my boyhood. In this movie, long are gone the days of ""Leave it to Beaver"" Family. This, my friends according to the director is the structure of the family in the future. This family has its own vocabulary, its own reasoning, its own rules and for some reason, the kids who appear past the age of 18, function as if they were still eight years old. One thing they are not scared of is, sharp scissors, licking each other, hammers and lots of blood, At times, I thought I was watching a Vampire movie. You get to watch cruelty to ""ferocious"" little kittens, incest and a few female on female action scenes. Animal Activists, take your banners out. I tried to find some sense and reason behind the scenes. I tried to see some deep dark haunting mystery behind the father's twisted mind. There was nothing to decipher, nothing to comprehend. There is no logic to this movie, We never understand how did the father come to think the way he does. We never understand why do both parents encourage their kids to engage in incest. We never get an explanation as to why the mother would go along with the husband. We never find out why the kids have accepted the status qua for so many years. The only thing that kept my attention going was the forced sex scenes that had no reason to be there. So to be generous, I gave it two stars since I needed to see some X rated scenes, If you know what I mean. The acting is really really bad. The actors seem to be reciting their lines from cue cards and yes some people did leave the theater.I can't even figure out why it is called ""DogTooth""For all I know, It could have been called ""PinkyToe"", or ""Beware of the big bad Pussycat"" It would have made no difference.

I had to speed it up to around 1.4x and the movie still felt too lengthy. So brace yourself and your free time. Secondly, there wasn't much emotions or chemistry between the characters. Yeah, you may argue that this family is too sick for such, but no, they should at least show some intense feelings towards each others once in a while. They're human after all, right? However, I love the plot and how the parents were making up their own certain systems for their kids to follow. Truly worth contemplating.

209,multilangelo,Dogtooth: a masterpiece or a piece of copy?,8,13 September 2013,"""Dogtooth"" is a masterpiece for me. It has its own unique style that differentiates from the Greek production and actually makes it one of the best Greek movies of this century.The plot is simple; it revolves around a family which that lives at an isolated country estate. The three teenage children of the family are growing up without ever going outside, because they are led to believe that the external world hides severe dangers, like cats, which can kill them. Every word meaning something outside their home is interpreted in a different way and the distorted definition is recorded, so that they listen to it everyday. Hence the sea is the armchair and zombies are yellow flowers. The parents (actually, the father) have created a limited world for their children, from which only the father can go out to the real one. However, the balance of this insane world is disturbed by Christina, a woman brought to satisfy the sexual urges of their son. So, what happens when the sense of the initial security is replaced by curiosity for an unknown world? This question is answered in the rest of the movie.However, what really impressed me is the direction, which is great. Its simplicity in direction and acting creates an effect of awkwardness and and makes some of the scenes more shocking. Lanthimos has succeeded in making the subliming ideas more understandable by creating an ambiance and insanity with explicit scenes.The are some people that find this movie either boring (because of the general neutral mood of the acting) or brutal. Also, some critics dispute its originality and consider it as a copy from an older Mexican movie. It seems that these approaches are superficial from those who have not understood the different aspects it offers that prevent it from being a mere copy of another movie.In general, for some people it might be extremely shocking, but it is worth seeing.",Dogtooth

It can only be characterized as the life of psychopaths and their innocent victims,expressed in a pretty stupid way. and something important. i recently happened to meet a person who was in the production (just a beginner, but he explained me a few things) and what he claimed the film was about, was the way a typical Greek family is stuck to tradition. At that moment i felt disgusted.what kind of family did Lanthimos grow up in , to have this aspect of a family in his mind? if he wanted to be radical , he could have used a lot of other ways. there is no English word to express how strongly i feel about this film, only the Greek word ""αισχος"" and i desperately ask you not to watch this...as a Greek, as a well-educated adult, as a human being.there are so many other Greek movies over the years, some indeed masterpieces, some just decent, but THERE IS NO WORSE Greek FILM YOU CAN POSSIBLY FIND.i am genuinely surprised (and sad) about the nominations and wins of this film.",Dogtooth

I didn't get anything political out of it but it's one of those movies that can mean different things to different people. For me, as a father, it was a statement about family and how we create our own little world at home that nobody from the outside would understand properly. It's about how outside influence can ""poison"" this family dynamic and how parents fear for their children's future interaction with the unknown. The parents in the film take this to the absolute extreme of course and end of paying for their abuse, in a way, at the end when they lose the oldest daughter. The affect of this abuse on the psyche of the children manifests itself in acts of aggression and inappropriateness between each other. Very interesting movie.",Dogtooth

215,sangsue,Just Look At It As A Kind Of Garden Of Eden,10,4 March 2012,"The way I saw it, it was like Adam and his two Eves. Their father wants to protect his children's innocence and they're his blank slates. He and his wife have created children who have only matured physically. He keeps them in his compound and because his kids have been brainwashed from birth, they don't know any better. The father and mother have ensured that they stay ignorant by teaching them the wrong words for things and filling them with horror stories about ferocious cats to keep them from leaving.But because they have matured physically and have sexual urges, the father pays a woman from his factory to have sex with the son. But it's clear that this woman is actually the serpent, teaching the eldest daughter to use sex as currency each time she trades headbands and VHS Tapes for the eldest daughter's ""licking""of her genitals. To the eldest daughter, it's just like licking a shoulder or an arm. But like the serpent into the Garden of Eden, she brings KNOWLEDGE that corrupts the daughter so much that the father beats the woman with the VCR then beats the daughter with the VHS tape but it's too late. The enlightenment that leads to rebellion is already beginning.Eve has now tasted the fruit of knowledge and it's only a matter of time until she leaves the Garden. She knocks out her ""dogtooth"" because that's supposed to be what her parents demanded happen before she could go to the outside world. Then she runs and hides into the trunk of the father's car. Only she doesn't realize that without oxygen, she'll die.That's the last thing the viewer sees but if the movie continued, the father might have used the eldest daughter's escape as a cautionary tale for the remaining daughter and son. It's unknown how much the outside world has spoiled the world they know.I've seen the movie twice because I love it. It's so surreal but definitely Adam and Eves.",Dogtooth

A clever metaphor about the idea of a family and the extreme results that an over protecting parent could provide to his/her kids. A deep phychological thought that tests the human behavior under an unusual situation. I have to say... this was the weirdest cinematic experience I've ever felt which was a very unusual pleasure! This film tests you in every level. The cinematic power of the film - the directing, writing, cast - is unbreakable and superb! The cinematographic language of the film is unique and the script communicates with any kind of audience without actually being totally understood. The fact that sometimes the film is symbolic and not very particular makes it totally ''open minded'' that is a very genius behavior towards the audience.

226,duncan-202,"Pointless, pretentious drivel",1,30 July 2009,"This is without question the worst movie I have ever seen.Normally I think I have a fairly open mind when it comes to films. The inclusion of graphic sex and violence, obtuse surrealism, erratic cinematography and laborious pacing doesn't deter me... as long as there's a point. If they're there to provoke a response; to elicit some kind of engagement and to reinforce the message of the film; in short - if they add to the enjoyment of the film; then all's well and good.In Dogtooth's case however, they appear to be there solely for the sake of being there. If there's a theme to this movie other than pandering to the impossibly gargantuan pretensions of the clearly deluded writer/director, I completely missed it. I too was at the Wellington session mentioned in the previous user comment; and I and my girlfriend were very close to walking out towards the end. Had we left, it would've been my first time ever leaving a movie before it finished... and I've sat through Transformers 2.It's not even ""so bad it's entertaining"". It's ""so bad you'll feel angry at yourself, the producers, the cast, and the writer/director for not just wasting 90 minutes of your life, but subjecting you to 90 minutes of mediocrity in an intellectual and creative wasteland"". There are almost no redeeming qualities - the acting is bland, the camera-work is irritating at best, and the script is unintelligible.Please trust me on this: I am not a prude, I am not easily shocked, and I enjoy a ""mind workout"" when seeing festival films.But put simply, this movie should not have been made.",Dogtooth

228,mailmarwa,Weird movie with a weak script,2,1 March 2011,"The movie is weird no doubt. I found the concept somewhat similar to ""The Village"". However, this one is even more abstract. A weird family with a psychotic father creates an illusion for his children. Everything taught to children about life is bizarre such as teaching them how to bark, Telling them that the word ""Cunt"" means frog.The family lives in a villa where virtually no one except Christina can enter (who is brought my the dad to satisfy his son's sexual needs). There is a lose core plot of what a completely different parental teaching can result in. The kids are trained and reared up like pet dogs.The movie has no relation between what the director is trying to portray and what is depicted. It makes no sense if watched with the intent of understanding the movie. If weird movie implies a critical acclaim then yes, probably that is the reason it got nominated for the Oscars",Dogtooth
229,M4GuS109,Not as thought provoking as it's style suggests,7,23 April 2010,"The main point of Dogtooth's plot is clear and simple: Orwellian authority leads to terrible situations. This sums up the whole film. The authority here is applied by parents on their three children. To avoid spoilers, I will go no further into details of the plot.The absurd moments of Dogtooth are enjoyable to watch and very dark at times. All the ""unexplained"" behaviour of the characters is backed up by plot details and promotes character development.Lanthimos doesn't hide his influences. He pays tribute to art-house cinema and even adopts styles and formulas in a very competent way. In fact, it would not surprise me at all if Lanthimos was just an alias for a collaboration between Michael Haneke and Lars Von Trier. Then Dogtooth would have been among their best work. However, the directing is certainly not just a sum of influences and there is some excellent camera-work to portray underlying themes.I could only describe the acting in this film as risky. The characters sound unrealistic, as if they are hypnotized. This can be blamed on the characters deep mental issues but still, unless one pays attention to the actors' facial expressions it is easy to dismiss all acting as flat and ""wooden"". Unfortunately, subtitles don't help much to avoid that.And then, just when the plot starts to develop, the most sudden and pretentious ending of all time comes to leave loose ends everywhere and show that the film had actually made its point in the first twenty minutes and the rest was merely there for extra shock value and controversy. The whole film reduces to just a ""look how weird we are"" collection of scenes. That's right. No deep meanings. No legitimate conclusion. Not even something to contemplate or discuss with other viewers. It could just as well have been the director telling us ""thank you for your money but I ran out of reels so that was it and interpret it any way you like"".As happens with too many art-house films (and modern art in general), some viewers will make up deeper meanings which can only be supported if you fill in the gaps of the script with made up details and side-stories. Then will argue that the having to use their brains proves the film a masterpiece and that anyone with a negative opinion just didn't ""get it"".But honestly, I summed up most of what the film tried to say in the beginning of the review. In ONE sentence. The whole film is just an excuse to practice directing technique and to use European art-house hype-creating formula of content that would get a Hollywood film blacklisted from all major studios. Well, I an NOT impressed. I am immune to ""uncomfortable"" scenes, so watching a film that consists of only that and little else is a huge disappointment to me. This time it will cost only 2 stars since the film is otherwise good.If you liked films like Dancer in the Dark, Funny Games, Dogville or maybe Requiem for a Dream, then you will probably love this. If you hate the combination of hollow and pretentious then avoid. If you enjoy absurdity and dark humour like I do then it's definitely worth your time.",Dogtooth
230,lsradu,Leftist Political Parable,8,10 May 2011,"I think most of the commentaries have totally missed the point of this flick. Dogtooth is first and foremost a leftist political parable, about the way a political regime (with fascist-corporatist connotations, capitalist in its essence) can infantilise its subjects. People knowing what was happening politically in Greece in recent years know what I'm talking about. From this point of view, the film is a complete failure (as all leftist parables are, see Ken Loach). It says something simple in a very complex way. It's a demonstration. The movie is even silly at times with is transparent metaphors. Having said that, the movie is superbly directed and acted, with scenes of a surreal beauty and ferociously disturbing.

If you fail to see what's behind dad's try to train the family to bark, you better watch a cartoon or bet on the chance of coyote catching Road-Runner. It's not a drama, it's a documentary about our real world, we are the family's kids completely blinded about what's happening next to us, happy enough to catch a model plane falling from the sky because this is our entertainment.That's our reality, blurred and fake. We have no means out of our fake reality, that's the plan. In case you think you are going to beat the system, you would probably find yourself in a car's trunk.That's the movie about.

It reminded me of Lars Von Triers ""The Idiots"". This movie has been firmly planted onto my psyche and I await its general release so I can go see it again. Of course there will be people who won't like the movie due to its sometimes extreme scenes: if this is the case and you're a little bit squeamish, then stay away. The urge for me to keep associating this film with those of Lars Von Trier's is hard for me to abate, and another connection could be made with Antichrist: if you liked Antichrist, I think you will immensely love this; if you found Antichrist hard to stomach then it's probably best not to view this: I doubt you'll appreciate its beauty through its intense harshness.",Dogtooth

Dogtooth should never have been written or directed or produced or funded. This should never have been allowed to waste my time. Who is rating this with 8-10 stars? Are you guys blind, deaf or stupid? There was no redeeming value in this movie besides the premise. I was lured in by promises of an awesomely dysfunctional family, insanity and depth. The premise held true but where was the plot? Where was the story? Where was the character development? This could have been a great 20 minute short, but for some reason they decided to stretch it into an hour and a half of torture (and not the good kind).By the end I was also ready to knock out my own teeth in order to escape. That part probably wasn't even written into the movie. I could totally see the actress permanently disfiguring herself to get out of her contract, and the director keeping the footage because it was the only optimistic scene in the entire movie. Think about it, you never saw Bruce after that scene. Did you? No because she took her new-found freedom and split! I actually envy her because she got out of the movie early.

What is right and what is wrong, will anyone ever know?We all follow the norms of the society without any questions, just like the children follow their parents rules.I think the father's goal was to create utopia for his family, but he achieved the contrary. He socially handicapped his children. Made them incestuous. They didn't even understood their sexuality. Men's sex drive was encouraged and women's oppressed.The only freedom they got was to express themselves artistically. And the only one who took advantage of that was one of the daughters in the dancing scene. It kind of reminded me of Ian Curtis on stage. In a movie with so little emotions directly expressed this was a firework. All the frustrations finally out. All of the children dreamed of getting out of the house, but the biggest barrier was the mental one. They didn't knew life outside their home. What were they going to do once they leave?

I'm speechless. Suddenly I remember why films like this has to be made. I love what there's no rules. When there's not necessary a need for understanding and no fixed answers given. It's a film you shouldn't even write an review about. It peels of every false layer of the human being and at deepest question the modern humanity. What have we become. It says to us: think outside the box. Live, without limitations. Embrace, even the madness. Life is a play. Now when this is said I must also compliment how beautifully it's filmed and edited. The scene with the barking dogs, which abruptly breaks into silence and into the tragic family constellation. It's finest art. And I laughed loudly, and my heart beating so fast.

Don't get me wrong, some things are better than others, but to believe this movie is pointing out the flaws in society would be like pointing out that fire is hot or water is wet - a bit obvious.I think the main subject of the film is, though, to point out the flaw in the idea that someone could raise a self-sufficient, self-contained family or clan, somehow separated from society. I think it would be one thing if the family was somehow naturally separated from society, but the idea that any set of parents would force this separation and think it's a good idea, is cruel, both to themselves, as far as the reality of their dreams, and to their children with their dreams.

The lights turned on, the credits were running and everyone was quiet and searching for answers in others looks. Its best surprise that I've got in years. You don't have to be special to watch it, just sit and you'll end it living it, even that it isn't your life. I appreciate latter how good the movie was when I realized that all the scenes didn't need background violins to drive your emotions to a certain field. Everything goes by itself naturally. I just registered to post this, as I couldn't believe those bad reviews. I'm a normal guy that doesn't read reviews, but this movie is different and I was curious about how would other people feel about it. Maybe its one of those that you just love or hate, but at the end you'll feel something that isn't indifference.",Dogtooth

It should be used as educational material in the Humanities Dept. of any self respecting University in the world, not to mention Arts and Media schools for its production merits, and just for the fact that these guys managed to produce a film that received international awards, from Cannes par example, with such little means at their disposal!

Furthermore, there are ugly scenes depicting incest and child abuse which is perpetrated by the children's parents. Moreover there is unnecessary violence with a lot of blood. This is a story of two parents who bring up their children in such a way as to constitute severe child abuse and surprisingly this abuse does not lead to punishment in the film. There are no hidden meanings/political ideas about society etc, don't be fooled by pseudo intellectuals. It is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. What a waste of my time and money.

244,kidf,"Whew, what a tough film to sit through",1,30 July 2009,"Saw this movie at the Wellington International Film Festival tonight, and at least a third of the audience walked out. On the one hand I can applaud the film makers for trying to be daring and different as the movie contains some fairly shocking concepts and sexual imagery. However, it's told with such incomprehensible structure and plotting that most of the audience laughed uncomfortably at how awful it was. Maybe something gets lost in the Greek language for Western audiences, and the almost unreadable subtitles didn't help at all (note to subtitle companies - don't use white or yellow lettering over bright backgrounds with NO outlining!).The film is ostensibly about the family dynamic that exists when the matriarch of the family cuts his children off from civilization and teaches them whatever nonsense, mumbo jumbo he pleases (planes are little models that fall out of the sky, a cat is a monster that eats people, a woman's privates are called her ""keyboard""). The problem is that it's fine if you are telling a story about that, but you still have to TELL the story to the audience. For most of the film we were just as confused and in the dark about what the hell was going on as the characters in the movie were. People are running around doing weird things and speaking gibberish. We aren't told why they live this way, or why a strange woman shows up at the house every once in a while blindfolded to have sex with the son. Was this their religion? Was the husband just a nutter? I'm not saying the filmmaker has to spell every little thing out, but you have to tell the story so we understand what the heck is going on. This was nothing but incomprehensible imagery and actions filmed for some kind of shock value that didn't really work. The only part of the audience that didn't walk out just laughed and shook their heads.And don't misunderstand, this isn't the kind of movie that's ""shocking"" or that people who want to see the forbidden edges of cinema should seek out. It's no ""Baise Moi"" or ""Irreversible"". It's mostly 90 minutes of really, really boring static camera angles and people talking nonsense, with very brief snippets of something vaguely violent or sexual. It's as if David Lynch made a movie with Salvador Dali. I'd avoid this one at all costs.",Dogtooth
245,iliaspart,Awful amateur film,1,10 February 2011,"This was probably the worst film I have ever seen. It is very boring throughout, has scenes of pointless violence and disturbing scenes of incest and child abuse. This is a story of horrible child abuse (sexual,physical, emotional, psychological). The worst thing is that the perpetrators of the child abuse go totally unpunished in the film. I cannot believe that it has been nominated for an Oscar! Maybe the people who made this film suffered abuse in the past and maybe the film is partly autobiographical but this is not an excuse. The film-makers of this movie should have rather seek some help for their problems than produce this horrible movie.",Dogtooth
246,iatetheturkey,Original and unique,10,27 January 2011,"A family of 5 - parents and 3 young adult kids - are living isolated in a house, somewhere. Of the 5 only the father is allowed to leave the house. Both parents are keeping the children secluded from the world, controlling every aspect of their lives. An outsider is introduced to the family, who will be exploited and will,in turn, exploit and corrupt. Along with this person reality enters the house, - and is, actually, used as currency - and the closely guarded equilibrium is disrupted.All the characters are bizarre and even repulsive, and dialog seems mundane and without plot. This is only the surface though, don't be fooled by it. As soon as you realize what all this is about, and all the pieces fall into place, then comes the real shock. This is not a movie about some strange family in a strange house, somewhere - we never learn their names only the outsider's name is known to the viewer - this is a movie about all of us. If you want to spend your evening watching car-chases and pistol-fights or sparkly movie-stars flirt, this is not the movie for you. And no, it doesn't spell it out for you, you have to draw conclusions for yourself. So, if you're lazy steer clear, you're not going to like it. Dogtooth is a multi-layered movie. It's originality lies not only in it's subject-matter, but also in the clever and insinuating way with which it uses it. P.S. The daughter's dance is an imitation of J.Beal's pole-act in Flashdance.",Dogtooth
247,spencerra44,A chilling and nauseating film about the extreme over-control of a family by a tyrannical father. Refreshingly unique and free of big-studio shininess.,9,21 February 2011,"I don't believe in writing reviews that summarize the events of a film. This dark, off-paced allegory of the consequences of obsessive isolation and control by a father over his children is brilliantly understated and under-acted. It made me feel like I had gone insane while taking a nap on an ordinary afternoon and awoke in a world that looked familiar but felt wrong. It creates the same kind of compelling dread that I have felt while watching other unusual and socially important films such as,""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Brazil,"" ""Running with Scissors,"" and ""Heavenly Creatures."" Like the film, ""Running with Scissors,"" I almost walked out on it several times, then applauded with tears in my eyes at the ending. If you like to be challenged to deal with the discomfort of emotion you feel while watching a stranger pick a scab on a bus while watching something that you can tell deep down is going to be rewarding in the long-run, or if you like to close your eyes and spin until you're dizzy, then take off your clothes and walk into public buildings to find out the reaction, then this is a must-see film.",Dogtooth
248,atsiroulina,extremely good!! very realistic!,8,28 August 2013,"Not a lot of movies shock me. So I was quite surprised the unsettling impact Dogtooth had on me. The violence of the parents begets more violence, and more, without the moral compass of being able to think for oneself, right and wrong disappear.Dogtooth tells us that oppression that happens with the best intentions is still oppression, that to seek to protect from outside corruptive influence is in itself an outside corruptive influence. The soul needs to be formed from within at some point. Who makes laws for the lawmakers, who polices the police, it's the same argument for me.The end is poignant in that sense.The daughter makes her first steps out on the world but she's dead, literally inside the trunk, or figuratively dead to the world. What's there to be reborn to? Can a future be surmised for her outside of that trunk when she doesn't know any better than to be sexually intimate with someone for a trivial object? Her values, outlook, perspective, have been shaped for her, the movie shows us the cost extracted. Dogtooth's power then is not only the sketch of social allegory but also the means to it. The surreal makes sense to us.It's also one of the darkest comedies I've seen in a long while. The usual wooden delivery of the actors in a Greek movie, is turned to an asset here. And I like how the daughter's liberation, or the onset of it, from her parents, happens in the form of a manic dance, in a final performance that celebrates the breaking loose from the confines of a prison of the soul. So it also has a political meaning!",Dogtooth

As the IMDb description states, the Mexican movie is ''The story of a disciplined and sexually driven man who keeps his family isolated in his home for years to protect them from the ""evil nature"" of human beings while inventing (with his wife) rat poison''.The director just changed the scenery, added some minor details and served it to the audience.

Disconnected, boring, shock value (largely misogynistic violence, incest, and lesbian sex scenes) alone keeps this movie dragging along. And it's a rip off of a 70's Mexican movie? Sure the theme is relevant, the idea of family cuts deep, your relationship to your parents, to your siblings, it all means a lot to everyone, duh. But the execution is lackluster. Character relationships are a roller coaster of impossible progressions, from stabbing each other to laughing and playing together a few scenes later. Even the aesthetic, which in a minimalist movie is huge, remains undeveloped and uninspiring. How this thing was nominated for an Oscar I'll never know. There's no true exploration of what would happen to a bunch of kids locked away from the outside world, just a scratch on the surface of human psychology, leaving a hardly visible streak on our global cultural landscape.",Dogtooth

I chose this movie because it seemed pretty well received and had the leafy branches on the DVD box. Pretty much from the first 20 minutes I could tell I wasn't going to like it but I sat all the way through it expecting some kind of twist or event to happen. It doesn't get better. Watch the first ten minutes if you absolutely have to but if you don't like that you won't like the rest of the movie. It's shallow and obvious, and it's not captivating or original and it certainly doesn't ""leave you guessing"". Also I noticed on the box that it said it's considered a dark comedy, you'd have to be pretty pretentious and stuck up to laugh at any part of this. If I met someone and they said it was their favorite movie, I would never talk to them again.

Going into this film, I had an open mind and was looking forward to seeing a ""Masterpiece"" due to the reviews and ratings. Maybe ten minutes into the film BAM! a sex scene and pretty damn often (way more than necessary) their were numerous sex scenes, and if that wasn't unpleasant enough why not throw in some brother and sister sexual acts. I can admit that the only ""shocking"" scene was near the end when one of the daughters smashes a hand weight into her teeth, but a ""beautiful masterpiece""...I don't think so.So the rating 7.2 really?

The first thing I thought when I started watching it was that it was going to be a tough experience because of the cultural boundaries between their country and mine, however, I took myself a big surprise: the movie is magnificent no matter where are you from. Aesthetically, the color palette (shades of green and red on a constant white color) is beautiful and gives a sensation like everything is too clean for being true. The story is constructed in a way that you can understand the situation of the characters even when it's completely surreal. I'm really struck by the game that makes the film with language, changing the meanings at its whim, highlighting the arbitrariness of the words themselves and thus creating an effect of estrangement in the viewer.",Dogtooth
255,neptunianmoon,Good premise but needed more...,6,13 March 2013,"I only just saw ""Dogtooth"" and I decided to add one more review for this controversial yet very interesting film. The 1st paragraph is my opinion for its meaning, which I think is the most important thing in a movie. When I watched it, I immediately thought of ""Festen"", not because they have the same story ('cause they don't) but because they eventually try to do the same thing: to debunk the image of the ""perfect"" family. Of course they differ... In ""Festen"" the dad appears to be in his right mind, but does the most horrible things to his kids. In ""Dogtooth"", we have a dad whose exaggeration of his actions stems from his own profound insanity, but whose actual behavior to his children is ""normal"". He does what almost all parents do, he is overprotective, he tries to avoid his kids leaving the house, he demands obedience, he schools them into living by his own personal standards no matter how deranged they are and he teaches them the wrong meaning of words as he chooses (which often happens in reality not with unimportant words like ""sea"" but with others like ""freedom"",""socialism"",""religion"" etc.). So, this movie gives a new perspective in what we thought was the most unquestionable thing: our family.Now on the down side, although this film isn't badly directed at all, it is very slowly paced without making up for it with beautiful or stunning images like Theodoros Aggelopoulos's films. It doesn't have a witty script and the acting is only average (with the exception of the father). It deserved an Oscar nomination just because of its premise and its boldness, because let's not forget that society is very sensitive to certain things yet (and that can be proved by some of the discussions and reviews it has induced). All in all, I'd recommend you to watch it only if you have an open mind to find the meaning in between the scenes that will certainly make you wonder in shock ""what did just happen???"".",Dogtooth
256,adamcain93,Imagery couldn't save this film...,4,26 July 2013,"Lanthimos seems to think that the only criteria for a (successfully) artsy, avant-garde experience is to be racy, explicit, and obscure. From the get-go he may have you captivated with the strange cassette tape lecture about how a ""sea"" is an armchair, but the rest of the film was just endurance for me. I never found myself empathizing for the three siblings, nor could I have hoped to understand the father's reasons for their homeschooling/brainwashing. The ideas the movie was supposed to convey were expressed very poorly, whether explicit or implicit. Little to no orientation (which was what probably sold all the pretentious film snobs trying to extrapolate ideas that just weren't there). A tiiiiiny bit of screenplay could have done great wonders for this film. In summary, this movie might have fared better as a photography exhibition in a modern art museum.

So I started watching this movie with a lot of expectation. After it ended I was like wtf did I just watch. Well if you want to make a movie about unrealistic concept why not make a movie about parents who teach their children to eat shit and drink piss from their childhood? I mean if you want to make a 2 hr movie about all possible psychotic concepts u can come up with thousands of it. Though I can still see some reviewers going to term those concepts as disturbing and thus .. brilliant as well. First of all no justification was given why the parents kept those children confined inside the compound. So I guess they were nutjobs. And the children who were violent enough to brutally kill cats, strong enough to pull out their own tooth, rebel enough to have sex with each other, cant overpower and overrule two old people to gain freedom? Salt is telephone and sea is sofa .. really? So the dad had to memorize and call them in two different names in office and home everyday? lol just think about it. Also the parents who didnt give them books, didnt give them education, didnt give them any means of entertainment or bought any toys or games, are kind enough to provide a girl for the boy's sexual pleasure? 
Oh my god I feel my heads gonna explode stating the loopholes. But u know what its a very nice movie to spoof. That would be hilarious. I sincerely hope the writer and director take a long break and re-evaluate themselves and the primary purpose of movie making before taking the next step.

Completely absurd (in the true philosophical, Albert Camus sense), it had me confused, at times laughing, and above all engaged. Whilst many people have considered this film to be ""pretentious"", with some not even considering it to be ""art"", I believe it is a deep, complex film told in a simple way with brilliant cinematography, acting and directing. 'Dogtooth' is difficult to process because it doesn't fit neatly into any film category. It challenges common elements such as context, plot, character development and it doesn't provide a unanimous meaning. For those accustomed to these elements, 'Dogtooth' may present a challenge (especially if you are easily offended). Perhaps this isn't a film for everyone, but then again no film is for everyone (as you may notice by reading reviews). I think your opinion of this film will be a matter of personal taste and resonance. There are a multiplicity of meanings offered by 'Dogtooth' and what you take from it will be unique.Above all I definitely recommend that you see this film.

However brilliant your thoughts would be, it won't be as creepy, artistic and ingenuous as Yorgos Lanthimos' Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Film ""Dogtooth"". Though this isn't necessarily the way you should see the movie. The director has brilliantly gave a story that is undeniably gripping and left it up to the audience to decide what they saw. Three teenager who never left their house,their parents teach everything about the world outside wrong, instill fear of it in their heads. The children are kept busy by daily routine, limited by rules to which they have to conform, or else they have to bear the consequences!What I liked about the film is that it possesses a surrealistic and whimsical atmosphere yet you have to deal with the fact that this could really happen. The apathetic, resigned, innocent and sometimes even clumsy faces of children, who are in fact no longer children, is delivered perfectly by the actors to the point of creepiness.The film made me think about human instincts, as curiosity; and survival, and whether they could be wrenched out of your soul when they are suppressed all through your life, or they go on living as long as you still have a soul and can never be extinguished.I see this movie as a dark comedy that may have political, psychological or even spiritual undertones and whatever way you see it, It will leave you thinking, asking and embracing your humanity more than ever.",Dogtooth
