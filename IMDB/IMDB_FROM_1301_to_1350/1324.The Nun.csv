0,TheLittleSongbird,The less than creepy nun,4,5 October 2018,"Have an appreciation for horror, remember really liking 'The Conjuring' films (though they need a re-watch) and liked the idea. The advertising also suggested a quite creepy film if done right. Seeing that 'The Nun' was not positively received, critically and by word of mouth, however lowered my expectations somewhat, being one of not many to have respect for critics opinions.Seeing 'The Nun' with an open mind, with the intent of actually liking the film and going against the grain (as has actually been the case quite a number of times, though often do agree with general consensus), for me it was not as bad as many have said and it is not one of the worst of the year. It's not even among the worst of the horror genre. It was though a disappointment and managed to be worse than my lowered expectations, far from being one of the best of the year as well. 'The Nun' at least didn't insult my intelligence (on the most part), it is not that amateurish and didn't get the sense it was completely not trying, while thinking that it could have tried harder. From personal opinion, 'The Nun' does have similar problems as 'Slender Man', except it's a better film.Found 'The Nun' to be a good-looking film, very spooky in setting and atmospheric in lighting. It's slickly photographed too and the effects not cheap. The music does have an unsettling ambience and doesn't sound cheap in how it's recorded or orchestrated.It started off very well, the beginning was unnerving and did have dread and tension.However, 'The Nun' did go downhill quickly too early and struggles to recover. One is told too much and far too soon, which completely diminishes the suspense and makes things very predictable. The direction is both leaden and disorganised and while the actors try gamely they have nothing to work with, with clunky dialogue galore and poorly developed clichés passing for characters that are both bland and annoying.Dialogue throughout has no natural flow and reeks of cheese. The story is very poorly paced, mainly dull, and the back-story is far too ridiculous, clichéd and with bland atmosphere and nothing new to engage with it or take it at face value. It is not fun, with comic relief that is not funny, sometimes not tasteful and features too much. 'The Nun', like 'Slender Man', feels like a short film over-stretched to breaking point for a feature film, the content is just too little and the titular character is far too underused and is more so what than scary when revealed. 'The Nun' also fails at being scary or interesting, the too thin story and deadly dull pacing kills the tension, suspense and dread, making the atmosphere bland throughout, while there is too much of an over-reliance on jump-scares that are too random, senseless and obvious to be creepy.On the whole, not terrible but disappoints. 4/10 Bethany Cox",The Nun
1,Leofwine_draca,Little to say,4,25 January 2020,"THE NUN is a spin-off from the overrated CONJURING franchise and offers more of the same. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga appear in cameo roles while in a case of nepotism Taissa Farmiga, Vera's sister, takes over the lead duties. The Romanian setting allows for some early gothic adventures which riff on various Dracula tropes, but soon we're in the familiar territory of demonic possession and endless hackneyed jump scares. With tired scripting and predictable CGI scares, THE NUN is yet another variant on the haunted house genre that really has very little to say for itself.",The Nun
2,SnoopyStyle,ok first half,4,9 November 2018,"It's 1952 Romania. An evil has risen in a small remote abbey. The Vatican sends Father Burke (Demián Bichir) and novice nun Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) to investigate. They are guided by local Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet).I was with this movie all the way up to a buried Father Burke being rescued. It's a solid horror up to that point. First, there is a jarring disconnection with the duo returning the next morning. The movie falls into a constant regurgitation of dark hallways and dark figures and random interiors. It's mind-numbing and not scary at all. It doesn't help that the general layout of the abbey is not clear or declared at all. The second half is a constant downhill slide to the bottom.",The Nun
3,claudio_carvalho,"Underrated with Fake One or Two Line ""Reviews""",7,24 November 2018,"In 1952, in Romania, a nun hangs herself to escape from an evil force. When the peasant Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) finds her body, the Vatican sends the priest Burke (Demián Bichir) and the novice Irene (Taissa Farmiga) to the abbey to investigate the case. They team-up with Frenchie and soon Frenchie and Burke are is attacked by a demon. Irene learns that Burke is tormented for killing a boy in an exorcism. On the next morning, Irene is accepted in the abbey and learns that there is a gate to hell in the catacombs. Meanwhile Burke finds that a demon called Valak has unleashed through a breach. Now they have to seal the breach with the blood of Christ to trap Valak inside the gate.""The Nun"" is an underrated horror movie with fake one or two line ""reviews"" that IMDb has accepted this year, giving credibility zero to this site that was a reference in the past together with Rotten Tomatoes. The cinematography is magnificent, the atmosphere is spooky and the cast has good performances. Unfortunately the plot has a big flaw, since the powerful Valak has many chances to possess Irene as a vessel to leave the abbey but lures her many times instead. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Freira"" (""The Nun"")",The Nun
4,nogodnomasters,That's not how I left her.,4,1 October 2018,"When a nun commits suicide the Vatican calls in Father Burke (Demián Bichir) miracle hunter and crossword puzzle enthusiast to investigate. He takes a long with him nun wanna-be Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) who had visions as a child. The location is in remote Romania (where else?) and the time appears to be post-WWII. The villagers claim the castle where the abbey is located is cursed. We get the castle backstory and the crux of the problem at 50 minutes into the film. Not hard to figure out. I thought Taissa Farmiga's face was perfect for the role. The priest, not so much. The dialogue was dry. Some jump scares and mild horror. I kept saying to myself, ""Is that it?"" No swearing, sex, or nudity. Note to self: If buried alive, don't use oxygen burning lighter.",The Nun
5,kosmasp,Nun of that,7,1 May 2019,"One of the alltime classics - the nun of that summary line that is. The movie is not close to a classic. It's not a ""stinker"" either though. It is more than decent overall. Yes it is predictable and yes it has jump scares and all that. But that is what we signed up for isn't it? I and the movie would argue so.While Marvel is quite succesful with their Universe, Conjuring created a Horror universe with quite some good movies. The first Annabelle may not have been up there quality wise, but the sequel made up for that. And this is fine too and was hinted at in Conjuring itself (and Annabelle Sequel). But we do get new players here, as was the case with the Annabelle Origin story. Now this will not shock hardcore horror fans that much, but it was made for a general audience anyway. Don't hold that against it. And yes cliches and predictabilities are high - there's still room to watch and enjoy/be scared though",The Nun
6,Sleepin_Dragon,What a disappointment this was.,4,7 October 2020,"I loved the trailer, from that it looked well produced, gothic and having a true horror vibe.....In reality, it's incredibly dull, you are led to believe that a Nun plays a central part, tormenting all around her, sadly we don't get much of her, when she appears, she looks good.Production values are decent, but they couldn't really go wrong with them given the story, it looks suitably gothic.The story is just so bland, there is nothing new here at all, it has all been done to death, every cliche under the sun imaginable is here.Genuinely the most interesting part was googling what Bonnie Aarons aka The Nun actually looked like in real life.4/10, may seem harsh, but the trailers promised a lot, and in all fairness, it sucked.",The Nun
7,classicsoncall,"""There is a powerful evil presence in this place.""",6,23 June 2021,"The whole time I'm watching I'm wondering if there was an actual story here. The opening set up is done fairly well, but after Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) saved Father Burke (Demián Bichir) from the coffin in the ground, it sort of just rambled along dark passageways and looked for ways to offer jump scares to live up to it's premise as a horror film. I will admit that the demonic nun of the title is one nasty piece of work and takes a truly hideous form. The film took the occasion of explaining to viewers the concept of a 'safety coffin', one in which a bell was attached through a metal tube so a person buried alive could alert a watchman at the cemetery. That's been associated with all kinds of clever sayings like 'saved by the bell', 'dead ringer' and 'working the graveyard shift', but if you do an internet search you'll come up with other explanations as well. Considering the preview we got of the satanic nun in ""The Conjuring 2"", I thought the movie would be much scarier with a more developed story. Oddly, the last name of the character Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) in the film, which was Theriault, was very similar to a ghost character in Stephen King's latest horror/crime novel titled 'Later', and spelled Therriault. Interesting coincidence there. About the most interesting thing I got out of this picture.",The Nun
8,jboothmillard,The Nun,5,31 May 2021,"The Conjuring Universe had two spin-odd prequels, featuring the creepy doll Annabelle, but the other thing that has become significant in the series is the demonic nun, first seen in The Conjuring 2, so this spin-off focuses on this. Basically, set in 1952, in Romania, at the Saint Cartha's monastery, two nuns entering a tunnel to retrieve an ancient Christian relic are attacked by an unseen evil force. The surviving nun, Sister Victoria (Charlotte Hope), flees from the attacker, a demon appearing as a nun, and hangs herself. Her body is discovered by Maurice ""Frenchie"" Theriault (Jonas Bloquet), a villager who transports supplies to the nuns. The Vatican learns of the incident and summons Father Burke (Demián Bichir) to Rome. They ask him to travel with Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga, Vera's sister), a novice nun, to investigate the situation. While Sister Irene is teaching children the relationship between religion and science in a school, when she is interrupted to accompany Father Burke to Romania. There they meet with Frenchie, who leads them to the abbey. They discover Victoria's body and take a key from her corpse. Then they encounter Mother Abbess (Gabrielle Downey) who informs them that the nuns observe a period of silence during the night and offers them a place to stay at the convent. Frenchie is returning to the village when he is attacked by a demon, but he escapes. Burke tells Irene about a boy named Daniel (August Maturo) he exorcised in the past; he is haunted by the memory of the boy's death who was fatally injured. Irene reveals that as a girl, she had visions causing the Church to take an interest in her. That night, Burke is rescued by Irene after being buried alive in the graveyard by the demonic entity. The next day, Irene and Burke return to the abbey, but only Irene can enter. She meets some of the other nuns and learns that they are praying constantly, swapping in shifts, to keep the evil entity at bay. Sister Oana (Ingrid Bisu) tells the story of the abbey's history. It was built in the Middle Ages as a castle by a Duke (Mark Steger) obsessed with the occult. The duke summoned the demon through a rift in the catacombs but was killed by Christian knights, who sealed the rift with a vial filled with the Blood of Christ. However, the bombings during World War II accidentally reopened the rift, unleashing the evil entity once again. Burke identifies the demon as Valak (Bonnie Aarons) and discovers the Abbess has been dead all along. Frenchie heads back to the abbey to help Irene and Burke. Irene is attacked by Valak and joins the nuns in desperate prayer to ward off the demon. But Irene discovers that none of the nuns she had seen and talked to were real, and that Victoria had been the last nun in the abbey and had sacrificed herself to stop Valak from possessing her body and unleashing evil. They theorise that Valak can only be stopped if they seal the rift with the blood of Christ contained in the reliquary. Irene then informs Burke that God has called her to make her solemn vows as a nun and asks Burke to elevate her to the status of a professed nun. After the trio unlocks the tunnel door with the key Victoria possessed, Irene is lured into a pentagram and possessed by Valak. Frenchie smears some of the blood of Christ on her face, casting out the demon. Burke is wounded by Daniel's ghost as Valak starts to drown Irene in a flooded chamber. Irene expels the blood of Christ in the demon's face, banishing it as the blood of Christ seals the rift. After Frenchie resuscitates Irene, he reveals his real name. Unbeknownst to the others, Maurice has been possessed by Valak, indicated by an inverted cross on his neck. Twenty years later at a university seminar, in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) watches Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) and the footage of their attempt to exorcise a possessed Maurice. Also starring Sandra Teles as Sister Ruth, Manuela Ciucur as Sister Christine, Ani Sava as Sister Jessica, Maria Obretin as Sister Abigail, Michael Smiley as Bishop Pasquale, and Joseph Bishara as the voice of the Demon. Bichir and Farmiga are fine, there was only a little bit of a story I could follow, the many appearances of the evil nun are certainly memorable, the jump scares don't always work, but the special effects are good, and the eerie atmosphere is reasonable, a slow but not terrible gothic supernatural horror. Worth watching!",The Nun
9,BA_Harrison,Holy Crap.,3,12 May 2019,"1952: after a nun hangs herself in a Romanian abbey, the Vatican sends priest Father Burke (Demián Bichir) and novitiate nun Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) to investigate. They discover that a bombing raid during the war unleashed an ancient evil, Valak the defiler, and they must try and banish the demon and seal the gateway from whence it came (using an ancient artefact containing the blood of Christ).Do people really find nuns scary? Even ones that look like Marilyn Manson on an off day? I certainly don't (well, except maybe for Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act **shudder**). The Nun, the latest entry in the Conjuring universe, fails to change that fact. Director Corin Hardy struggles to inject any fear into the cock and bull religious mumbo jumbo backstory for demon Valak, conjured up by writers Gary Dauberman and James Wan, and resorts to countless cheap jump scares, unimaginatively executed and extremely tedious to watch.Throw in terrible acting (what the hell was up with the accent of French-Canadian drifter Frenchie, played by Jonas Bloquet?), lots of crap CGI spooks, and a dumb ending in which Sister Irene takes a shot of Christ's blood and spits it into Valak's face, and what you have is far and away the worst film in the Conjuring universe (so far).",The Nun
10,paul_haakonsen,But the trailer made it look so awesome...,3,9 November 2018,"I remember seeing the trailer for ""The Nun"" in the cinema at another movie, and the trailer made the movie look really, really good. Of course, that is the sole purpose of a trailer.Turns out that ""The Nun"" was a horrible, horrible waste of time, money and effort. I actually fell asleep during the movie, about 1 hour into it. And I had to return to finish it at a later time, several days later. Why not the next day? Well, because what I saw that 1 hour before passing out was nowhere near being interesting.Now having finished it, I can honestly say that the last 30 minutes did not improve on the movie in any way. This was, at least, a less than mediocre foray into the horror genre.There was nothing scary about this movie, and it was just all a pile of cheap tricks that have been done and seen in countless movies prior to this 2018 movie - other movies that fared a lot better than this one.The acting in the movie was adequate, but it was blatantly obvious that the ones performing in the movie had next to nothing to work with in terms of script and storyline.I managed to suffer through ""The Nun"" to the end, and can honestly say that I am not returning to this movie a second time around.",The Nun
11,BandSAboutMovies,Horrifyingly trite.,2,8 September 2018,"The Nun is the fifth movie in The Conjuring Universe, which are dramatizations of the real-life cases of paranormal investigators and authors Ed and Lorraine Warren. As the true story of the Warrens gets controversial* - Ed Warren has been accused of having had a lover live in their house for four decades, starting when she was underage - not to mention Gerald Brittle, author of a book about the Warrens called The Demonologist, suing Warner Brothers claiming they stole his idea, it's only natural that the storyline move to only tangentially involves the main characters.The series begins with The Conjuring, directed by James Wan, during which the Warrens investigate the haunting of the Perron family. There's some tremendous art direction in this film, particularly when it comes to the Warren's occult museum where they keep all of the occult objects they come across, kind of like the trophies in Batman's cave. There are also some genuinely frightening moments, giving one hope that true scares still have a place in the multiplex.The first spin-off, 2014's Annabelle, was seen by many as a misstep. I enjoyed the film's Manson Family allusions if not the entire story. 2016's The Conjuring 2, which dealt with the Enfield Poltergeist incident (and offered potential spinoffs like The Crooked Man and Valak the Nun, who we'll get to in a second, I promise) got the series back on steady ground. And 2017's Annabelle: Creation was a box office success.Becca disliked both Annabelle movies at first, yet has come to enjoy both of them on video and has tattoos of Valak and Annabelle, so that should tell you how excited we were for the potential of The Nun, a movie that has been teased for over a year with effective trailers and artwork. Just look at that poster that's part of this article. Kudos to the PR and ad team that worked on this - you got us in the theater. But did we have a good time?Funny aside - the theater where we went is often my favorite to see a new horror film in. It's always packed with raucous teenagers who shout, scream and go crazy during the jump scares. None of that happened here. Perhaps it was the fact that the air conditioning didn't work on a 90 plus degree day (we were offered the chance to see something else or wait an hour to see another showing, but we decided to stick with it). Or perhaps it was the fact that someone brought a baby with colic to see the movie and that child coughed throughout, continually giving us the real world worry that someone was insane enough to bring a child to a 10 PM movie. Then again - if a movie is really engaging, it defeats its environment and captures you. I've seen some great movies in fleabag theaters, after all.The movie starts in 1950's Romania, two nuns are being attacked by something we can't see. They're searching for an artifact, yet one nun is dragged into the darkness while the other hangs herself to that she can't be taken by the demonic force. Her body, partially devoured by crows, is found in the morning by Frenchie, a villager who brings the nuns supplies.When the Vatican learns of these events, they send ""miracle hunter"" Father Burke and novitiate nun Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga, sister of Vera, who is the actress who plays Lorraine Warren in these films) to investigate. There, they learn that Sister Victoria's body has moved from where she was laid to rest and that she's holding a strange key.While they stay at the abbey, all hell breaks loose. Irene has more of the visions she's had her entire life and Burke is haunted by a possessed child (spin-off alert) that he failed to save. Valak appears and buries Burke alive, with Irene saving him at the last minute by digging him up. There's a moment here where I thought, ""Surely they're not going to rip off the scene in Fulci's City of the Living Dead where Christopher George uses a pickaxe to rescue the girl."" Of course they do. But it's also framed and presented in a way that has none of the visceral impact of the way that Fulci shot it. Perhaps this is your first clue that I didn't like this movie very much.The next day, the nuns reveal that they've been praying non-stop to keep some dark evil at bay. After all, the abbey was built in the Dark Ages by an evil duke who worshipped the devil and summoned Valak, just at the moment that Crusaders broke in, killed him and sealed the gateway to Hell using the blood of Jesus Christ. The flashback that happens here presents us with a glimpse of a film that would have been much better and more exciting than what we're currently enduring, a film that necessitates constant looks at your watch and math to determine just how many minutes are left before you can escape the theater.Bombing runs during World War II broke the seal and now, the evil of Valak has been slowly leaking into the abbey and the surrounding village (again, a much better idea for a film that we only get glimpses of). Nun by nun has fallen to Valak's evil and now, the nun who seemingly runs the abbey has transformed into Daniel, the buy who Burke failed to exorcize, and is attacking him.While all that's going on, Frenchie comes back to help and Irene joins a prayer circle of nuns who were never really there in the first place. Valak carves a star into the shoulder of Irene before taking her to a room filled with dead nuns whose heads are covered by bloody rags, making one long for a better nun film such as Alucarda.This is where the film shows it has no concept of the occult, kind of a cardinal sin when it comes to making a movie about it. Valak traps Irene inside a pentagram, instead of the center of the pentagram being used to protect and ward off the evil spirits. Everything up to here is shown to be Irene's visions. Keep in mind that devout Catholics believe that feeling the presence of spirits would be heretical, but this is a script that doesn't understand anything that it's writing about, so just go with it.Finally, our heroic trio find the Blood of Christ (and a woman is entrusted with it, showing again that this film has no real understanding of the Catholic Church) and use it to stop Valak (again, with that Blood of Christ being spit out of a human mouth in an act that a devout Catholic would find completely against their belief).Because every movie in this series has to tie back to the others, it turns out that Frenchie is the possessed man that appeared in the footage the Warrens show when we first see them. That said - the dialogue where Ed says, ""They called him Frenchie,"" was added and did not appear in the original film.Let's cut to the chase. This is worse than a bad movie. It's a boring movie that squanders the promise of great scares. At no point was I worried for anyone's safety. There's no real story arc for any of the characters, nothing that moves them through other than interchangeable forces of good and evil for the sake of telling us about this great evil that we've already seen in a better movie.The Catholic Church has been through some rough media in the past few weeks. Completely justified bad media, mind you. The Nun seemingly takes place in some alternate world filled with free thinking nuns like Sister Irene who believe that we should question everything and who are presented as being seen as on the same level as a priest. I loved that in the midst of all the Satanic panic at the end of this film, she takes the time to finish her vows and become a full nun, as it's a great advertisement for a church that wants nothing to do with a movie like this that claims that exorcisms and possession are real. It's another one of God's mysteries: a film that is the best sales pitch for the Catholic Church in years is one that they'd abhor. Take it from someone who angrily yelled at the Pittsburgh Catholic** and their reviewer Father Peter Horton from the age of 9.I know that I've been down this same path so many times, determined not to be an old man yelling that movies used to be so much better when I was young. But time and time again, I get all excited about something new only to be crushed by the resulting boredom and ennui that modern horror delivers. I should have to watch The Other Hell three times in a row as my penance.",The Nun

Sticking strictly to a formula that will either infuriate or satiate horror genre fans, ""The Nun"" delivers enough creepy boo-jump tropes to keep it above average. There's plenty of roaming about dark corridors and churchyards, with lanterns our only prominent saviours from the terrors of the dark. If, and it's a big if, you don't mind that Corin Hardy's film isn't trying to raise the bar for horror, and is in fact staying safe, then there's a decent enough good time to be had here. If you be one of those who constantly moans about bringing nothing new to the table, don't bother with this one, in fact, think of something new to bring to the table yourselves then...The set-pieces hold up well enough (buried alive shiver shiver), the atmospheric dread only occasionally punctured by Abel Korzeniowski's bombastic score. The story is interesting enough, such as why the entity is bringing terror to the abbey, what is the link to the ""Warren"" family, and the backstory axis for Father Burke (Demián Bichir) brings another demonic layer to the plotting. While talking about ""bringing something new to the table"", for the first time in this series we actually get a bit of humour, mostly from Jonas Bloquet's likable Frenchie character. Taissa Farmiga holds the lead well, where she has a very appealing visual reaction style that will serve her well if she stays in genre mode. While Maxime Alexandre's cinematography (low lights and fogs) is a big improvement from ""Annabelle: Creation"" and is tonally compliant.This formula has been done much better previously, such as Hammer's take on ""The Woman In Black"", but even then they were going on about new stuff being brought to the table etc etc etc. It is what it is, a boo-jump haunted house (buildings) picture that is there for those who like such things, who buy into it on that level. Is this a great film? Absolutely not, but it works on its intended terms and any expectation of a new branch of horror is going to have you crying over spilt blood. 6/10",The Nun

What BETTER time could THE NUN be playing, than during a month when History's most notorious Sex Cult is about to cram a fifth practicing member--sworn to take his marching orders from Foreign Cult Leaders--onto the U.S. Supreme Court? As THE NUN so explicitly documents, these Evil Cultists may turn a benign visage to the world 99% of the time, but they turn into growling demons the other 1% when ""Lucifer"" commands ""Jump!"" The original ""Martin Luther"" was a whistle-blower who lodged nearly 500 written accusations against this Cult more than 500 years ago. Have they had enough time to ""Clean up their act?"" NO! as THE NUN warns us. Rampant sex abuse has plagued EVERY ""Diocese"" world-wide, with billions of bucks in hush money already paid out collectively to millions of victims ripped soulless by thousands of costumed fiends.

Getting set to drop a bundle of spooky films off to a friend, my dad surprised me by revealing he had picked up this title for her,which led to me meeting the nun.View on the film:Ending with a similar ""We must go back and finish the job"" final act as his messy adaptation of It Chapter Two (2019-also reviewed) the screenplay by Gary Dauberman (who also did the ""story"",with James Wan) swings wildly between crossing the floor to a mysterious Haunted House Gothic Horror chiller one moment, and then retreating to undermine it with garbled flashbacks to the origins of The Nun taking away the sense of the unknown which the character had been carried on.Filmed at Corvin Castle in Hunedoara, director Corin Hardy & Shazam! (2019-also reviewed) cinematographer Maxime Alexandre overcome moments of sloppy CGI and rapid-fire jump-scare zoom-ins, by taking advantage of the real location with in-camera icy set-pieces, covering the walls of the castle with a ever decreasing shadow of The Nun walking towards her next victim, and pulling back to long elegant tracking shots, where the slightly out of focus long-lens frees The Nun to levitate into the background.Joining her sister Vera in The Conjuring Universe after showing her own Scream Queen skills in the Horror Comedy The Final Girls (2015-also reviewed) Taissa Farmiga gives a delicate turn as Sister Irene, who holds onto her faith whilst attempting to withhold screams of fear.

Maybe it's so the makers can increase its revenue when the inevitable directors cut is released in 4 months, but it really distracted me from the poor acting, cringeworthy comic relief (hello Frenchie) and the old nun who sounded like 'Zuul' from Ghostbusters.

19,phd_travel,Conjuring goes to Eastern Europe,8,19 September 2018,I liked this movie. The best thing is it really makes use of the Eastern European setting. The convent setting is Dracula worthy. A European setting also gives some historical element to the horror. Anything you could hope for in such a scenario you get.Taissa Farmiga is no stranger to the horror genre. AHS gave her a start and here she has the chance to lead the movie which she very competently accomplishes. Horror acting talent really runs in the family. Minus points are there are about 5 too many shock tactics involving ghoulish nuns - until they lose their value especially towards the end.Worth a watch,The Nun
20,trashgang,no need for this spin-off,5,24 July 2020,"What was this, It's a spin-off that's clear but to tell the history of the nun back in the days it's okay but how they told us the story for me didn't work out.As most flicks it starts great but after 5 minutes it's downhill and it never picks up again, it's not scary or creepy, well, maube towards the end when we do see the face of the nun clearly that's a bit eerie but this flick needs it from the jumpscene's and there are a lot.Some parts I thought huh, how becomes the Frenchman possessed suddenly and things like that, even the colors used in the church aren't used in real life.Nope, as many said this was a no-go and for me it was also a no-go. Luckily it never became boring so it's over before you know it but the story itself sucks big time.

What did not work: Well the story line of fighting a spiritual evil Priest, and clairvoyant is getting old. The usual ghosts running around, people put into dangerous situations. The usual jumps and scares, with lame humor. What worked: The acting was spot on. The priest was believable, the Nuns, etc did well considering the material the actors used. The director created tension, thrills and blends the sets and imagery perfectly. The ending was perfectly executed linking all the other movies. Gives a good example how demons, and spiritual real look at time differently then humans. We believe an evil is defeated, but regrettably evil sits and waits and is on a different time line. 30 years is like two days in the spiritual realm.

The Annabelle sequels were not that bad either so I was quite exciting watching The Nun as her appearances in the other movies was quite creepy. But I should have known better. The concept was promising but in the end the story was very weak with a stupid plot if there was any. The couple jump scares could not make up for what the story is lacking.

It tells the story of a priest and a novice who are sent to Romania (in 1952), by the Vatican, to investigate the apparent suicide of a nun there, and they encounter a powerful demonic force. The movie was directed by rookie filmmaker Corin Hardy, and it was written by Gary Dauberman and series creator James Wan. The film stars Demian Bichir, Taissa Farmiga (the sister of 'CONJURING' star Vera Farmiga) and Jonas Bloquet. It's expected to be another huge hit at the Box Office (like the others in the series), but this one has gotten mostly negative reviews from critics so far. I really enjoyed parts of it, but I was also really bored for large chunks of it as well, but that can be said for the other installments in the series too (except for the original). I also found the trailer for the movie to be a lot creepier and more disturbing than the actual film.

24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"You know, usually less is more.",4,9 September 2018,"'The Nun (2018)' is, essentially, jump-scare central. Of course, jump-scares have their place, but here they are so frequent and overtly telegraphed that they don't even work, don't even illicit the kind of cattle-prod jolt they're designed for, and this leads to an experience more versed in annoyance than horror. There's essentially one, oft repeated scare in the movie: the music all but drains every few moments, our focal character peers off to an empty corner of the frame and then turns back only to find something spooky and the 'boo' that comes with it. There is one, and I mean one, less abrasive fright. This moment only stands out because of the flick's otherwise poor quality, though. On top of its genre problems, the feature has no tone, either. It slips from dark, dingy and downright dull to silly, over-the-top and apparently comedic in a heartbeat; the punch-lines might just be the scariest thing about the picture. This makes for a dry and, frankly, boring experience that often feels incredibly ridiculous. It really is difficult to take seriously. It fails to live by the age old adage that less is usually more, something the other films in this series - which this tries to tie into in a few tenuous, and actually quite nonsensical, ways - tend to keep keenly in mind. It's safe to say that the film isn't scary and, worse still, it isn't even entertaining. After 'Annabelle (2014)', poor prequel quality really does seem to be hereditary. Maybe our only hope is if the almost inevitable prequel to this prequel takes a page from David F. Sandberg's surprisingly good 'Annabelle: Creation (2016)'. I'm not going to hold my breathe, though. 4/10",The Nun
25,ThomasDrufke,"Same old, same old...",3,14 September 2018,"There's a certain amount of suspension of disbelief you have to have if you're going to a horror movie. Once you get past the idea of a possessed nun hiding out in an old church/building in a forrest, then you have to accept the fact that normal people would agree to go check the place out. Why a crew of 3, in which, 2 of them are young kids clearly without proper experience? Well, if you're still with the movie after that, then there's the ridiculousness of everything that happens inside that house, and the overall manipulation of the direction. It's not necessarily surprising that a horror film misdirects and uses jump scares to gear up the audience, but it nonetheless gets tiring, even in a 90 minute film. There's really nothing special or memorable about this film which serves as a spinoff/sequel to The Conjuring films. The acting is fine, direction was poor, and the dialogue was laughably bad.

It started promising, and the first 20 min or so were pretty good - some spooky opening, some spooky location and some simple yet effective premise - all was set for this movie to really good or at least a descent one. Unfortunately the more i saw, the worst it was. Even some pictures or some brief ""cameo"" of the Nun in the original ""The Conjuring 2"" was much more frightening then this whole movie.Overall, the worst sin a horror movie can make is not being scare. ""The Nun"" committed it - i was bored out of my mind during the last half of it - and i love horror movies in general - i'm the one who is easy to be scared. ""The Nun"" in its last 15 min reminded me of ""The Evil Dead"" movies with all its comedy side - shotguns, monster head-shots, moving decapitated hands and etc. - ""The Nun"" has its all.

I also enjoyed the direction which was made by Corin Hardy and I believe that he did a great job on it. Regarding the interpretations, I liked very much the interpretation of Demián Bichir's who played as Father Burke and Taissa Farmiga's who played as Sister Irene. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jonas Bloquet's who played as Frenchie and he gave a different touch on this movie and Bonnie Aarons who played as The Nun.To sum up, I have to say that ""The Nun"" is a nice, entertaining horror movie with a decent plot and a good direction. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to like it.

35,cruise01,Better than expected with its jolts of jumps and scares but lacking in story.,7,21 September 2018,"The Nun (3.5 out of 5 stars).The Nun is a pretty decent supernatural horror film that is a spin off from The Conjuring 2 with the creepy demonic nun. Lets face it, the brief moment the nun was in The Conjuring 2 was creepy and gave you the chills. Now for a full prequel movie about how the nun came to be. And a backstory to a specific character that explored when her and a priest went investigating to Romania after two catholic nuns were attacked. It seems like an interesting spin off that deserved its own movie. It was better than the other spin off like the Annabelle movies. Still below the two Conjuring movies. The plot follows two nuns getting attacked by a mysterious nun in 1952. Father Burke (Demian Birchir) and Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) both travel to Romania to investigate these nuns death. They meet Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) who guides them to the monastery. Were they encountering the creepy nun that stalks the corridors and anyone that is there.I felt like the plot was predictable and is something you can see coming. A nun is attacked by some creepy nun which is trying to find a host of a new body. A father and a sister head out to the castle to investigate the strange occurrences. Not too long, until they begin seeing this demonic nun that is trapping them in coffins, bringing back tragic visions, and stalking them in a dark eerie castle. The film does have a fair share of scares and jumping at the screen moments. When you least expect it, something comes at you. Plus the set design of the castle and direction of the movie does make you feel unease. With a tone that is dark and dimmed lighting. Characters walking in dark corridors and a shadow of a nun walking slowly. Making it difficult to tell if it is an innocent person or some creepy entity. Demian Bichir was decent playing father Burke who has a tragic past with exorcisms. Taissa Farmiga is the perfect choice playing sister Irene. Cannot see anyone else portraying the character. Which her real life sister Vera Farmiga is in The Conjuring. Seeing the resemblance of these two actresses are very alike. Jonas Bloquet plays Frenchie, a guy that guides them but is attracted to Irene when he first sees her. Sure, if you pay close attention to the Conjuring movies, you may notice an easter egg or connection on certain characters. Overall, The Nun is a pretty fair horror film. It delivers on the scares and jumps. The direction is dark and eerie and helped build the creepy tone. The cast is good and Taissa Farmiga was perfect. The film does struggle with a weak story and backstory to the origins of the Nun which was briefly shown.",The Nun
36,eddie_baggins,The Conjuring universe's worst film yet,2,10 September 2018,"There's no point mincing words, the utter terribleness and blandness of The Nun legitimately surprised me.Taking what was one of the most memorable and unnerving aspects of the great Conjuring 2 , in the form of demonic nun and in need of a dentist Valak, The Nun felt like a nice natural step forward for James Wan's horror universe, but thanks to this effort, this universe feels placed in a precarious position outside of the Warren's fight against evil, despite The Nun rounding up some resounding box office figures over the weekend of its initial release.Making 2014's Annabelle look like a cinematic horror masterpiece, The Hallow director Corin Hardy directs Valak's story, that focuses on Demian Bichir's Father Burke and Taissa Farmiga's nun in waiting Sister Irene's journey to Romania to investigate a convent that isn't all the holy, without an ounce of imagination or creativity, making this 90 minute exercise an arduous and increasingly over blown outing.Amounting to what seems like endless scenes of Father Burke and Sister Irene wondering around the (incredibly smoky and foggy) convent grounds chasing shadows, shaking off hands in the walls and staying far too long at an Airbnb that doesn't allow for a normal night's sleep, The Nun is an almost scare free exercise in how to turn a frightening character into a lame and tired supporting act.In the cinema screening I attended on opening night, you could sense the dwindling interests of audience members, while unlike The Nun's polished forefathers, the lack of screams or nervous laughter was a sight to behold.So silly and unbelievable are many of The Nun's set-ups that it's impossible to feel any real sense of danger or unease, which is due to a number of glaringly obvious factors such as a lack of character engagement, frequently daft narrative movements and sign-posted scares that take away any potentially potent moments that The Nun may've provided it's unfortunate paying audience members.Come the film's shockingly overblown and fright free finale, you know well and truly that The Nun is a product of not a lot of thought or care, an example of the worst of what modern day horror can offer when done wrong.Final say -Take away the connection to the Conjuring brand name and The Nun would've been a straight to home release low-budget nasty. Ruining the character of Valak and tarnishing the future of further Conjuring spin-off's, The Nun is an unholy mess you'd do well to avoid.1 vial of blood out of 5",The Nun
37,TheMovieDiorama,The Nun may have atmosphere but religiously relies on jump scares.,5,11 September 2018,"The latest spinoff in the most unlikely of cinematic universes, that being the ""Conjuring-verse"", is an origin story for the demonic entity known as Valak. Whom of which we all saw terrorise the Warrens in 'The Conjuring 2'. The difference? That sequel was substantially more terrifying. This prequel follows a Vatican priest and a catholic novitiate as they investigate a Romanian abbey that is said to be unholy. In an attempt to differentiate this chapter from the rest, director Hardy and cinematographer Alexandre produce a gothic atmosphere to enhance the religious thematic narrative that powers through the film. From an evangelical monastery hosting various catholic and satanic symbols to a gloomy mountainous woodland area where tenebrous figures roam in the darkness. With the assistance of committed performances from Farmiga and Bichir, Hardy invites you into a world of immorality. However unfortunately the illogical plot, one-dimensional characters, limited imagination and obvious jump scares become a detriment to what could've been another decent entry in this franchise. Aside from a forced association with other instalments, this chapter feels ""holy"" unnecessary and ultimately generic with its excessive use of exorcisms, rapid Latin expulsion and mediocre visual effects. The incontrovertible camera panning forced jump scares to be predicted rather than unexpected, thus negating any sense of dread. Conversely, there are several heart palpating scenes of fear due to inventive sound editing, especially necks clicking as heads turn. The innumerable plot conveniences, particularly the bell when a character is buried alive, subtracted any menace that the antagonising demon should've upheld. It felt like it was tormenting them as opposed to eliminating the threat. What did not help was Dauberman's sinful screenplay which utilised forced humour and cheesiness to alleviate the dark tone. The character of ""Frenchie"" just did not work. These detriments evidently express my disappointment to what is a watchable, if forgettable, horror.",The Nun

40,matthewssilverhammer,Prayers Needed,2,14 September 2018,"The Nun is only scary if you consider a person who tickles you to be funny. In lieu of being clever, a tickler is simply taking advantage of an inherent, physiological reaction a person can have to be lightly touched or prodded. This is the comparable issue of horror film's only using unexpected jumps to startle people. It's not based in earned storytelling or genuine creativity, but in cheaply assumed natural human response, that when we're surprised, we jump. The Nun is a childish power-trip of a movie, the equivalent of a middle-schooler self-pleasingly flashing their hand in your face and declaring, ""Haha! You flinched!""
The latest and absolute worst entry in the Conjuring-iverse, The Nun takes place in 1950s Romania, where the Vatican has sent a specialized priest to investigate a cloistered abbey, that's being terrorized by a demonic force who's taken the form of a nun. Why the demon looks like a nun is preposterously explained, though why her growl is just a straight-up lion's roar is not; we can only assume the sound department just couldn't be bothered with trying. And why would they? Other than some mildly-good-looking imagery and one decent (though tonally awkward) character in a Romanian agnostic, clearly no one could be bother with trying.
Look, if you've ever seen a single horror movie in your lifetime, or even just one of those ""Home Improvement"" Halloween specials, then not one thing will legitimately shock you here. Every turn of the camera, every dark corner of the screen will yield exactly what you expect.

It was though. I had been looking forward to this movie ever since it was announced. I'm a huge fan of both of 'The Conjuring' movies, but have admittedly not loved either of the two 'Annabelle' spin-offs. I was very pleased to see James Wan was attached to the writing side of things on this one though and so held out high hopes for it. Sadly though, I have to report this is another complete misfire.Starting with the positives though - the movie looks great. The set decoration is truly terrific in nearly every scene and the building and surrounding area that the film is set in were ideally selected. The groundwork was there for this to be a very creepy movie. At times the movie does work too, but that is mainly when it is being subtle. There are a lot of scenes where images of 'The Nun' are sort of there, but also sort of not. You question yourself whether you are actually seeing what you think you are. I really liked that side of things. Too often though the film is far too in your face. The demon will jump out of a tree and scream into a character's face (a very lion-like and un-scary scream I would have to say as well).The dialogue in this film is a real mess too, which surprised me considering Wan's involvement. The character of 'Frenchie' is particularly painful. He is meant to be the comic relief, but nothing he says is in any way funny, and is frankly a little embarrassing in parts. Also some of the things the demon says like, ""The village will be missing its idiot tomorrow"" (or something to that effect), are cringe-worthy and should never have made the final cut.I was very let down by this film. There are a lot of jump-scares, and not one of them gave me the slightest jolt. My heart-rate never rose above resting in any scene and I was frankly bored for the most part. The only saving graces were that the film looked great, connected in with the rest of the series well and had a truly great final scene that left me a little blown away.

This is a spin off from the Conjuring movies-the Nun first appeared in the 2016 Conjuring 2-and it tells the backstory of the Nun. It takes place before the 2017 Annabelle:Creation as far as continuity goes and it was filmed in Romania. At the beginning of the movie, it says it takes place in 1952-one of my favorite years! Demian plays a priest that is sent by the Vatican to investigate the death of a nun in Romania. He takes a novice nun, Taissa, because she is familiar with the area-she is a novice nun because she is studying and has not taken her vows, yet. They enlist Jonas as a taxi service/guide because he is the one that discovered the dead nun's body. When they get there, the trio find that there are some pretty spooky shenanigans going on. One of them being a nun with green glowing eyes, played by Bonnie-she also played the part in the Conjuring 2-that likes to float around from place to place with a demonic presence just flowing off her. Lorraine and Ed Warren pop up a couple of times, once at the beginning and again at the end.

It helps that there are three really decent actors in the main roles, though the Mexican and the Belgian Bloquet are hard to understand from time to time, but that may well be an asset, as this kind of dialogue is best mumbled, and the director can get on with the task in hand, delivering an intense, relentless series of scares and shocks, which he really does remarkably well.James Wan and Gary Dauberman provide the story, and Gary Dauberman the screenplay. If not exactly inspired, the story and screenplay, supposedly based on a true story from 1952, are certainly at least serviceable.Director of photography Maxime Alexandre makes it look tasty, with the help of Jennifer Spence's production design, and Abel Korzeniowski's music score is corny but effective. It has a good, old-fashioned traditional horror movie look, which works to its advantage. There is CGI of course, but the film isn't drowned in it.

The visuals are also stunning from the offset - I am put in mind of the faux-European feel of Hammer films, but with a massively increased budget.A priest is sent by the Vatican to investigate the suicide of a young Nun from a Romanian abbey, and uncovers a demonic power. The power has some connections with 'The Conjuring (2013)' and its burgeoning franchise. Luckily, however, you don't have to be familiar with that series of films to understand much of what goes on here.I would say that the film as a whole is solid rather than spectacular, interesting rather than essential. It does, however, contain some memorable set-pieces (including a very uncomfortable scene of someone being buried alive), some nicely shot moments and a good air of unholy evil courtesy of Director Corin Hardy.Demián Bichir plays Father Burke, Taissa Farmiga is Sister Irene, Jonas Bloquet is Maurice ""Frenchie"" Theriault and Bonnie Aarons is The Nun - the acting is uniformly impressive and is never reduced to second place behind the myriad of horror effects.",The Nun

Worse of all the plot takes forever to take shape and to get going. It boils down to a bunch generic Catholic and demons tropes. That being said the dialog is crisp and to the point. The acting, especially of Frenchie, does a lot to patch over the very weak script. And yet the atmospherics and the neo-expressionistic sets create a lot of dread and a sense of foreboding. The film still scares and gives you chills through the force of its direction. It's Gothic and while empty the visuals are very pretty in a eerie sort of way. Sometimes that is enough.The film was a great way to start the Halloween season. Just don't think about it too much. It falls apart if you do.",The Nun

The acting by the lead characters also disappoints and characters are also half cooked. The origin and disappearance of possessed boy Daniel remains mystery. The movie follows the same standard of horrifying soundtrack, and predictable jump scares scenes. Bonnie Aarons in the character of the nun is a huge disappointment as barring her initial few scenes he presence becomes endurable and the reason is half cooked characters.

The music is creepy & the cast is very good especially the priest the church sends to investigate the suicide of a nun,father burke is a good character & a good performance from Demia'n bichir.

54,kluseba,Oozing with atmosphere,9,24 September 2018,"I don't care about The Conjuring series but decided to watch The Nun nonetheless because it takes place in Romania, has both religious and occult elements and is set in an old monastery surrounded by a gloomy graveyard, dense forest and isolated village. The film turned out being entertaining from start to finish, didn't overstay its welcome with a very reasonable length of ninety-six minutes and oozed with sinister atmosphere. The film doesn't only rely on the usual jump scares but has extended atmospheric passages that increase tension towards the end. The dramatic climax and falling action make for a final third that was among the most entertaining in horror cinema of recent memory. Another positive point are the characters as Father Burke intrigues as experienced veteran with a gloomy past while Sister Irene convinces as charming, intelligent and resilient young woman and the French farmer charms with his gentle manners. The three characters investigating a supernatural phenomenon complement one another perfectly. The acting performances are also very solid.The only thing I would have done differently are the two references to the Conjuring franchise right at the exposition of the film and at the unnecessary resolution. The Nun is good enough to stand on its own and doesn't need these references. I would even go as far to say that this movie is actually better than the somewhat exchangeable main franchise.If you like atmospheric horror movies with great characters and very good actresses and actors, The Nun will certainly entertain you from start to finish. You don't need to be familiar with The Conjuring to appreciate and understand this film. The Nun turned out much better than I expected and is the best horror movie I have seen so far this year.",The Nun

So says Fr Burke (Demián Bicher), Exorcist and Vatican investigator of Miracles and other strange phenomena. This Indiana Jones of the Curia is joined on a trip to Romania by Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), a Novice Nun. They are to investigate the apparent suicide of a nun at an isolated Convent. We of course know that the Nun killed herself to escape possession by a Demonic Entity which had aLready slain another Nun. Arriving at a village they meet Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) who discovered the Nun's body hanging from a window. He escorts them to the Convent where Fr Burke meets with a veiled figure who introduces herself as the Abbess.There are many Nuns in this film, Zombiesque Nuns jumping on their victims from above, Nuns dragging nooses through graveyards, jumping out of Cloister doors, strangling and biting people. We even have a choreographed group of Sisters marching in to a Chapel to pray against the return of the Evil One. Fr Burke has has his personal. demons as well as those resident in the Abbey. We see a flashback to 1942 when an exorcism ge performed resulted in the death of a young boy whose ghost now torments him. Sister irene in the past had visions which now seem to be relevant to events in the Convent.The attitude of the villagers towards the Convent is like that of Transylvania villagers towards Castle Dracula. Apparently it was once the abode of an evil Count who practiced Necromancy and tried to bring Demons through from Hell to walk the Earth. There is a line of humour running through the film which results in some scenes having a tongue in cheek aspect. Indeed Frenchie seems to be present to provide comic relief. Some good frights and jump scenes but this is no Classic and the narrative is confusing as to how the story fits into The Conjuring series. A coda to the film is a bit heavy handed in it's attempt to provide that link. Still, some solid Horror. 7/10.",The Nun
56,myriamlenys,a disjointed collection of tricks and scare moments,2,10 August 2019,"""The Nun"" just strings along tricks and scare moments - many of them culled from earlier works - without bothering to provide a true sense of dread. In doing so, it wastes fine actors and potentially charming characters on a random sea of nonsense.It does not do, here, to examine any of the ideas too closely. For instance : there's this Roman-Catholic monastery deep into the woods of Romania (!!), which houses an actual portal into actual hell. A handful of gallant nuns try to keep the Evil One at bay by praying constantly. During their exercice in perpetual adoration, they face spiritual and bodily dangers of the most grievous kind. The Vatican is aware of the situation, but does not find it necessary to help the nuns - or humanity at large - by dispatching, say, relief crews made up from extra nuns, priests, guards and observers. Ah, well, there aren't all that many Roman-Catholics in the world...Still, ""The Nun"" has excellent art direction and fine special and visual effects.",The Nun

Effects, mood lighting, loud sounds & creepy set design do not a movie make. Enough already!

59,truemythmedia,Ugh.,3,10 July 2019,"I have a weird relationship with the Conjuring series universe. I don't mind the Conjuring movies themselves, but the spinoff stuff has been a bit lacking. The two films directed by James Wan actually have some merit: they talk about faith in the face of evil, they talk about the possibilities of phony exorcisms and demonic possessions, and they have some genuinely frightening moments. They aren't perfect films- the third acts tend to blow up to the point of ridiculousness- but that seems to be what mainstream horror audiences like, so I can't really blame the makers too much. In regards to the first two films, I can forgive some small flaws in logic for a story that makes sense overall, and for a setting that feels grounded and still spooky.This film does not take the grounded approach to its story. This film doesn't take a logical approach to the story either. In fact, I'm not really sure what the creators of this story were trying to do. The story they told was silly and it really did nothing to expand the Conjuring universe. There were huge plot holes that were just brushed over as if they were trivial details. The character motivations made absolutely no sense, nor did many of the character relationships or backstories.

62,robertemerald,"Wrong marketing true, but big scale scary entertainment",8,27 October 2019,"The Nun is right on the edge of something like Haunted Mansion (2003) or The Frighteners (1996) and a far more serious movie from its own universe, The Conjuring (2013). However, being set in the early 1960s, and given the brilliantly gothic location, the movie tends to set its own seriousness, more akin to other gothic horrors such as Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). I get the criticism that a lot of the scares are a sophisticated version of Sideshow Alley's The Ghost Train, but I do believe that's a tad unfair. There are basically four main cast members, including a truly spooky demon nun as infamous as Dracula himself, and all really deliver in their roles. The special effects are thick and fast, and certainly achieve lots of panic tension if not outright scares. It all builds to a superb crescendo and is pure entertainment. True, the cover of the dvd fails to adequately portray the gothic big castle scale and isolated Rumanian chill of this movie. However that is a small marketing mistake.

There are moments here that would be more at home in a zombie flick, believe it or not.On the positive side. the movie doesn't drag after its somewhat slow beginning; it doesn't linger long enough to be boring. Taissa Farmiga is as watchable and likeable as her mom, and really carries the movie.

Simple is better & how all films should be. The scares were done well & the visuals were perfect, the grim & dark tone of this film really finished it off & the ending was pretty satisfying too!The film was overall enjoyable & much better than that of the Annabelle spin off counterparts, which in comparisons aren't nearly as satisfying or even scary in the slightest, that's why I preferred The Conjuring 2 over the first, which although didn't focus on Annabelle like what Valak did for The Conjuring 2, was still good, but not as gripping & terrifying!Roll on The Nun 2, The Crooked Man & of course, The Conjuring 3!

The attempt to inject humour into the film with the frenchy character falls flat. He's not funny and this isn't a comedy.

That it is set in 'The Conjuring' universe only makes it look even worse. In fact, the scenes involving Valak were the best thing about James Wan's The Conjuring sequel. And when the makers decided to spin off the character into a universe of its own, I wasn't expecting this bad a movie.'The Nun' begins well - it gives you hopes for a thrilling backstory to be told regarding Valak. Disappointing to say, there's absolutely no real development of the Valak demon character in this film. It almost feels like this was the filler-sequel to some other Nun prequel. We have a priest who conducts investigations for the Catholic church, a to-be nun who doesn't have a clue why she's asked to accompany the priest on his expedition, and a flirtatious guy who supposedly handles supplies for the convent as protagonists.The first 15 minutes do manage to set things up quite creepily, but the rest of the film barely delivers. Much of the atmospherics feel set up just to forcefully invoke terror, followed by stock jump-scares. Also, for a movie that is supposed to provide insight into Valak, the character is hardly present. All you get to see is a bunch of badly-choreographed scenes sprinkled with jump-scares.Storywise too, the protagonists don't strike a chord with the audience since we barely know (or get to know) about them or their motives. Director Corin Hardy tries to give some of the characters 'The Conjuring'/'Insidious' treatment - the priest has his own inner demons to deal with, the young to-be nun has had her share of nightmarish visions (that eventually 'point' to something - ugh, what a cliche!), and the amorous dude, as expected, happens to be the comic relief.While I wasn't hoping for this one to be as good as the original Conjuring (I didn't enjoy the sequel), it made a mess of what made the sequel at least watchable - the demonic Nun.

It's probably my 2nd favorite film in the 'Conjuring' universe after the original. The plot was intriguing. I was never bored with it. The characters are interesting, the scares were good and creepy, the setting and cinematography were beautiful, and I absolutely loved the gothic atmosphere. Some of the imagery felt like it was ripped right out of a classic Universal monster movie from the 1930's and 40's, like the fog in a cemetery on a dark night. I just love cheesy stuff like that.

Over the next few days, they are tormented by visions, ghosts, creatures, and an evil demon named Valak, who has taken the form of a nun.This movie is just in time for Halloween, and I honestly thought it was better than Hereditary.

80,educallejero,Don't let the disappointment turn into hate!,5,12 September 2018,"Yes! The movie is way worse that it could've been.The story is fragmented by a strange decision of giving equal time to both, the nun (Farmiga) and the Father Burke (Demian Bichir). It was weird. You are waiting for Farmiga's nun to be the protagonist, but the first half of the movie makes Father Burke the most important character. Then the movie turns, the Nun gets the spotlight and Burke gets sidelined a bit.Other big fail its that Valak's powers are unexplained. Which is not that important until the plot dances around the extent of these powers and the conditions needed for defeating or get defeated by it.There a lot of jumpscares, and thats fine, but as the movie progressed the movie got sloppier without building enough tension for them to land. At 1h 36m you could add 10/20 minutes explaining more about the demon, or showing his first apparition, putting some of the jumpscares there and pacing them better.Having said that, its not a hateable movie. The story is conveniently loose, but it makes sense (it just lacks details that could elevate it), Farmiga is good, the set is cool, the atmosphere on point, and there are some jokes that mostly land.Its not good, but its not a piece of crap.

81,rockman182,The Nun (2018),6,10 September 2018,"I'm not super crazy about this Conjuring Universe, but I have seen all the films in the series. The two Conjuring films are decent, and Annabelle: Creation was quite a fun film. The first Annabelle was trash though. The trailer for The Nun was fun to watch (also to see friends jump when watching it the first time). I had fears of the universe of this films running dry at some point, and I kind of feel like that was the case with The Nun. It seems lax in its plot and like it doesn't know what its doing. Its not a completely bad effort, but one that was unnecessary.The film takes place in 1952 Romania, where nuns in monastery mysteriously die. A man from a village witnesses one of the dead bodies and then gets help from a priest and a young novitiate to uncover what exactly happened to the nuns. They soon realize that a portal has been opened and a demonic presence haunts them and this presence likes to assume the form of a nun to blend into its surroundings. The trio must overcome the horrors brought upon them and find a way to stop the nun. Interestingly, the film stars Vera Farmiga's (Conjuring star) younger sister, Taissa.Positives first. The film has moments of good atmospheric scenery. It looks nice at a lot of points and the score isn't so bad. The nun and other monsters present throughout look the part, so visually The Nun has that going for it. Taissa Farmiga was also perfect for the role as she is believable as a novitiate starting out who tries to keep faith in adversity. Unfortunately, the plot of the film is a bunch of things. Its messy, boring, and doesn't always come to fruition. Its the case of a good horror character in the Universe who should appear in the Conjuring films but didn't need its own film.The jump scares in this film are predictable. Every single one horror is set up in a way where you know exactly what will occur. It'll please general moviegoers I guess but for me The Nun was a disappointment for the most part. Many may disagree but I think this series needs to wind down and stop with its prequels. The prequels really have only worked once with Annabelle: Creation. Of course, I do expect this film to get a sequel, especially if it makes good bank at the box office.5.5/10",The Nun

People see this differently. Some see it as a happy place, knowing their family is with them while they go on Sundays to pray. Some also see it as a sense of dread, knowing their departed loved ones wanted to remain close to their church, even in death. I see it as a circle of life, with us occasionally looking at church to find answers about the unknown, with the graveyard telling us that we're all eventually going to be dead at some point. It's reminds us that time is short and we have to figure out things ourselves.A graveyard and a church play big parts in today's movie, which is also a part of The Conjuring universe, which also seems to be the only successful movie universe along with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This may be one of the biggest surprises in Hollywood; of all of the mass media and major series that studios have tried to steer into large universes, it's an original movie, The Conjuring, that has found a path to something bigger. As was hinted in The Conjuring 2, we get an expansion story of The Nun. In 1952, after a spirit taking the form of a nun spreads her terror to a monastery, a nun takes her life by hanging herself. The Vatican learns about it and sends father Burke (played by Demián Bichir) and also brings a ""nun in training"" Sister Irene (played by Taissa Farmiga). They meet up with a French-Canadian farmer ""Frenchie"" (played by Jonas Bloquet) who was the one who found the body of the hung nun. Things already look eerie when he takes the Father and Sister to the body, only too see it been moved into a sitting position.Burke and Irene are given permission to stay to investigate. They discover that a Duke obsessed with the occult built the Monetary during the Dark Ages. The Duke had also summoned a demon called Valak that haunts the place as a nun. Sister Irvine also discovers that the nuns constantly prey to keep the evil in balance. The battle is on with Father Burke seeing if he can rid the abbey of the evil spirit while finding a way to close a rift so that it cannot come back. The marketing for The Nun did not impress me. The previews made the movie look like a very standard horror movie...and that's what this is. The story is like a lot of haunted house/exorcism movies that tell the same idea that there's a big mystery to it and the evil must be eradicated. Though the nun itself is scary, I don't feel like we learn much about it other then it's evil. I don't understand how this adds to The Conjuring Universe, as you could cut this out and not miss a thing. A spinoff isn't a bad thing, as long as the characters feel strong enough to carry their own story. This doesn't.As far as the other characters go, they're your very standard hero, sidekick, and church types that try to exemplify ""there's more you don't understand"". And yet given how large this church is, you'd think the villagers would have a larger role here. Why couldn't they have their voice and the impact it's had on their town? That's a trope I actually enjoy from horror movies, especially the classic Universal Monster movies.Speaking of which, if there's anything nice about this movie is the look and design. Unlike the previous Conjuring movies set within the US and UK, setting it in Romania did make it feel like an older horror film. It has your creepy church, graveyard with fog, the stuff that makes this fun. While I can't say it's a scary movie in tone, it has a scary look that I can imagine will make a mainstream audience feel unnerving. I just wish that more work could have been put within the story to give it more originality and more impact within the world of The Conjuring. I'll give this four evil nuns out of ten. This is neither good nor bad in an enjoyable way. It's your typical kind of bad that makes this more boring then anything. I'll be waiting for The Conjuring 3, but The Nun is nothing to pray for.",The Nun
83,Anurag-Shetty,Not as bad as people say it is.,7,11 September 2018,"The Nun is a spin-off of The Conjuring 2(2016). Father Burke(Demian Bichir) & Sister Irene(Taissa Farmiga) travel to Romania, to investigate the suicide of a nun. They have to face something much more sinister, in the form of a demon nun. The Nun is a good film. It doesn't deserve the universal bashing it has received, from critics & moviegoers alike. Director Corin Hardy maintains a Gothic & eerie atmosphere throughout the movie. He has given us a worthy addition to the Conjuring franchise. This film matches up to or maybe even surpasses Annabelle: Creation(2017). It doesn't quite match up to The Conjuring(2013) or The Conjuring 2(2016). However, it is much better than Annabelle(2014). There are three or four well executed jump scares in the movie. The ending is a bit silly but, effective nonetheless. The connection to the Conjuring universe is awesome. The cinematography by Maxime Alexandre is fantastic. Demian Bichir is brilliant as Father Burke. Taissa Farmiga is spectacular as Sister Irene. Jonas Bloquet is awesome as Frenchie. Bonnie Aarons is outstanding as The Nun. Ingrid Bisu is great as Sister Oana. Charlotte Hope is impressive as Sister Victoria. The supporting cast is brilliant. The Nun is worth a watch in theaters. Just lower your expectations & you won't be disappointed.",The Nun
84,fernandoschiavi,"It's a classic horror story, reinterpreted from the perspective of modern horror. But the lazy, predictable and limited script put limits to this highly potencial spin off",6,17 June 2021,"Narrative repetition is the film's most disappointing aspect as it drastically limits novelty. Not just in terms of mythology, but Valak's creatures and forays are little varied. In many ways, it looks like a structural reproduction of The Conjuring 2 in a new context. Fortunately, the change of scenery prevents this from happening and adds a different taste to the adventure. The idea of an isolated ancient convent in a village in Romania's countryside is very interesting and the director and screenwriter know how to explore the mysterious dungeons of the place and its surroundings (some of the best scare scenes are in the cemetery on the outskirts of the place).Romania's castle brings an air of classic horror, which the direction works well through the use of light and shadows to baffle the viewer. It's not quite perfect: occasionally there's exaggeration to the point where the darkness of the scenes gets in the way of the action. When it works, it creates beautiful shots that highlight the grandeur of the scenarios or the threat of the antagonists. It helps that photography also invests in some shades of blue and red to lighten the sets - something the director has already admitted was inspired by the gruesome castles of the Castlevania games. In many moments, it gives a claustrophobic feeling in many moments and this gradually suffocates the viewer.It could even prove an interesting exercise to analyze The Nun from the perspective of how the Catholic religion is conducive to the most diverse types of malignant manifestations. The entire film, after all, takes place inside a 'holy house', and the purpose of the investigating parish priest's visit is, according to him, 'to determine whether the place is still blessed or not'. Well, it won't be long before everyone draws their own conclusions about this question. And that's because, if there's anything missing in Hardy's film, it's subtlety and creativity. To give you an idea, practically all the scares you try to impose on your narrative are basically the same way, with the unexpected movement of some object composing the background of each frame, followed by scandalous sound effects that only serve to point out: ""look, this is the time to jump on the chair"". Maybe it works the first, second, even the third time. But after 90 minutes, all that's left is fatigue from excessive repetition.The impression one gets from watching the film is that there was an excellent idea to be explored by the directors, which was completely wasted. There were all the elements to build a truly unforgettable film that would fit into the The Conjuring universe, but that would have the strength to follow its own path, but the result is far from being a patchwork of the genre. If the film's religious aspect turns out to be weak - the origin of 'evil' is explained in a flashback shameful it's so quick. The devil's origin and his connection to Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) were high expectations for the film, but they are delivered quickly and even a little sloppily. Perhaps it was purposeful to focus on the new characters, but not even Taissa Farmiga's charisma makes the story more attractive than the Warren couple.And in summary, what you see is a horror movie that doesn't scare and that at all costs tries to join the haunted castles subgenre, but not even using such geography competently can, summing up to clumsy runs through corridors and to doors that open and close without much explanation. The nun can even cause some imagistic impact, more for the symbol she emulates than for the scenography she bears, but she doesn't resist any closer observation, sinking in any of her intentions, either as a hobby for the most aficionados or as the beginning of a new franchise.The script is a bunch of ideas that don't connect, generating a chaotic whole that often doesn't make sense. For example, the monastery is on top of a portal to hell where Valak left, and it is up to the nuns to pray tirelessly to keep the portal sealed. This, in theory, is a very ingenious idea, but it falls to the ground with some neurons connected: why the monastery, isolated from the rest of the world, doesn't call the Vatican and say ""so, we're here holding the gates of hell, could you send a crowd here to try to solve this""? What is the point of seeing nun after nun die and doing nothing to resolve the issue?In addition, and wanting to have a historic air, there has been since the Second World War intervention, which accidentally opens the portal with a bomb (?) - it's funny that the monastery is still standing with the bombing, but the gates of the underworld open easily; even the blood of Christ, the only weapon capable of stopping Valak (?) - being that in ""The Conjuring 2"" you only had to know the demon's name to defeat him. Another misconception, common in ""period"" films, is the lack of a study on how people from the chosen period behave, behave, communicate. ""The Nun"" is in the mid-1950s, however, its characters walk and talk like modern people. Names that care about this characterization, both inside and outside of terror, summarize how this not-so-small detail makes all the difference: ""The Witch"" (2015) and ""The Stranger that We Love"" (2017) exercise these subtleties that take the audience to a different time, enriching the work.Even though it has absolutely nothing innovative, the film ends up guaranteeing itself based on a construction of tension and atmosphere. The director Corin Hardy knows how to effectively command the camera, fully aware that not showing the ""monster"" often ends up being more frightening than actually seeing it, a technique that is repeated many times throughout the 96 minutes of projection. In addition, Hardy also knew how to work with symbols that, for psychological and emotional reasons, can cause fear. This is the case of one of the first scenes in the film, which shows an open door and complete darkness on the other side, raising the old idea that the fear of the unknown is one of humanity's greatest fears. The very figure of the Nun (Bonnie Aaron) dialogues with these primitive instincts by presenting herself as a human figure, but she also brings some supernatural traits in her features (the completely white face and yellow eyes), causing a strangeness that turns into discomfort over time.Even without abandoning the already-clichéd high volume jump scares, Hardy doesn't use them for free most of the time. There is a whole construction with silence and claustrophobia, but that plays with the public's expectations by holding surprises until the last minute. In a certain scene, for example, Father Burke is buried and knocks on the coffin lid for help, which prompts Irene to go to the rescue and start digging him up. The sequence - with a scare already spoiled by the trailers, unfortunately - contrasts the man's suffocation with the girl's task before presenting a physical attack from Valak. The result is genuine agony in the viewer throughout the action, not just a momentary bang designed to cause jumps.But Hardy, as much as he manages to build a really dark environment, doesn't seem to care enough about horror, making plenty of room for Jonas Bloquet's character, Frenchie. The young man ends up stealing all the scenes with his charisma, softening every dark feeling that the film tries to generate. What could have been a more than successful comic relief becomes almost the central character of the story, displacing the viewer from moments of tension in several passages. Meanwhile, Father Burke seems useless, Irene has a past of visions that is poorly explored (additional: Taissa Farmiga is exceptional in the role of a novice about to take her vows and become The Nun. Her naive expression contrasts with yours. Faith which, in turn, encourages her to go on and fight evil) and cannot help her in her irrelevance. We still have Valak's underutilization, which appears much less here than in ""Summoning 2"" - even the little boy demon who plagues the priest has more screen time. There's plenty of room for zombie nuns (?) to infest the session.Also, Corin Hardy fails to repeat the same techniques over and over again. The camera goes one way, goes the other, creates a certain suspense and, finally, a scary element emerges. It's functional, but it gets boring if used dozens of times in a row. It can work the first time, the second... and it is successful when the jump scare (the scare based on the sudden sound) comes from above - which happens after a comic sequence starring Frenchie -, but it gets tiring and makes the scares predictable. The terror, which exists only in supernatural elements and in the bizarre (in a good sense) practical and digital makeup of those who assume the demon Valak, gave way to an investigative suspense that deserves credit for precisely taking risks outside the domains established with the previous films. So much so that, in the end, when you see the characters of Vera Farmiga (Lorraine Warren) Patrick Wilson (Ed Warren) in a lecture commenting on what happened to Frenchie, the mood seems to change completely, returning to the origins of The Conjuring.The Nun's many successes demonstrate how the shared universe of The Conjuring has potential, delivering an experience that's familiar but fresh enough to hold attention. It's a classic horror story, reinterpreted from the perspective of modern horror. If it didn't suffer from such a lazy, predictable and limited script, the film could clash with the main characters in its franchise for its strong identity.",The Nun

This one is barely passable. It has some good things like a great location and overall setting but that's about it.
It is not creepy, scary or frightening, the acting and the story are not great either. The dialogue is not good and sometimes the humor is really out of place. The ending is stupid and you never feel like you've experienced something together with the characters. It just doesn't feel.
This could've worked if they would have made it more subtle and less in your face. No need to have evil spirits physically attack people all the time. They also misused the catacombs . Could've been a great place for good scares yet it's so bright in there it just never works. I know they made this so you can see everything in the theater but I'd trade being able to see clearly for some good subtle movements back in dark catacombs any day.",The Nun
87,Hayden-86055,Jump scares: 1 Plot: 0,4,4 July 2020,"I was really looking forward to this film, unfortunately it was disappointing.The acting was fair, Taissa Farmiga stood out as good but not great and the locations and environments deserve credit for being suitably lavish and creepy. The monastery is fantastically designed and the costumes are nice to look at. Colour wise the contrast between the town and the monastery is clever, and the school at the start was very bright and colourful, starkly different to later on.But the plot fails on many levels after the first 40 minutes or so and literally just becomes a jump fest, some films have too many jump scares but are still ok. This just goes totally overboard and becomes repetitive and predictable.4/10: Good locations and fairly decent acting with a massive budget can't save this jumpfest. Not horrendous but no where near good",The Nun
88,msbreviews,Rating: C-,4,7 September 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)2018 is being a year of extremes for horror movies. A Quiet Place and Hereditary are both original and incredibly suspenseful, while Slender Man is probably the worst film I've seen so far. The Conjuring Universe is a surprisingly entertaining horror franchise that no one really expected it to be hugely successful. I love The Conjuring series and the second Annabelle movie is also pretty great, so my expectations for The Nun were, at least, hopeful.Unfortunately, The Nun not only proves that its marketing was false and misleading, but it is also such a tedious, lazy and generic horror flick. I didn't watch a single trailer, I only caught a few clips here and there. However, I couldn't escape the constant polemic news about how ""too scary"" this film was. Trailers being banned on particular countries and theaters forbidding the release of the movie ... Honestly, that has to be all fake.Fear is subjective. Every person has different fears so it is understandable that some people can get scared by something easier than others. Nevertheless, I don't understand how people can get genuinely scared by an obvious jump scare and a shaky close-up of a demon's face ... Repeatedly. Basically, this is The Nun. Every scare is based on a cliche fake-out of where Valak might be so he can appear somewhere else or through ""on-the-nose"" foreshadowing.I can barely find an original or creative scene. Everything in this film is inspired by other movies that did the stunt better. The Nun fails on what it promised the most: being scary. On top of this, the story is another major problem. Every piece of information is given through a lazy exposition scene accompanied by some flashbacks and these moments are oddly fast. Literally, in one minute, everything the audience needs to remember about Valak is explicitly said by a random character. The same thing happens when it comes to developing Father Burke's (Demián Bichir) past or even when the film tries to connect with the others.In addition to the dull screenplay, Gary Dauberman gives close to zero characterization to the main characters. They are all horror stereotypes, so expect people making stupid decisions or following silly trails. Logic is not a strong attribute of this movie since the presence of some characters in certain places remains unjustified at this moment. With such a short runtime, it is baffling how little effort went to the script. This spinoff could have been a great popcorn film, but instead, it is just a mess.There are a few saving graces. The cast is really great, and Taissa Farmiga (Sister Irene) completely carries the movie. If something captivated me during these 90 minutes, it was Farmiga's brilliant performance. Her character is the only one that actually receives some good development with it coming from various sources, instead of another exposition rant. However, I'm perplexed at the choice of Vera Farmiga's sister to portray Sister Irene. Since the characters they both portray aren't related, it is at least doubtful how two unrelated persons can be almost identical. Definitely, a nit-picky thing from my part but I couldn't help to find it a bit confusing.Demián Bichir is excellent as the priest, but his character is ultimately flat. The biggest surprise is Jonas Bloquet as Frenchie since he portrays the comic relief character. Yes, you read it right: The Nun has funny moments. For a lot of people, it might be an issue since they want to see a horror film, not a comedy. However, Bloquet's script is just funny enough and I never felt that there was an exaggeration of one-liners. I consider it a breath of fresh air in an otherwise weighty horror tone.Corin Hardy undoubtedly struggled to be imaginative, but technically his movie is pretty okay. Some cool set designs, a touch of good cinematography here and there, and a chilling score that, unfortunately, falls into the cliche of announcing an eventual jump scare. He is able to provide a consistent tone with an occasional joke, but he couldn't handle the story the way he should have, so the pacing ends up suffering a punch, even for such a short runtime.All in all, The Nun is just forgettable. It is just another horror flick that follows every generic plot point, it is filled with cliche characters, and it possesses uninspired not-that-scary sequences that other films did way better. Corin Hardy lacks the mindset to direct a successful horror movie, and the screenplay is evidence number one since it is an explicitly lazy exposition party. In the end, the cast saves the day with Farmiga delivering a fantastic performance, plus some technical attributes worthy of some merit, which help the film to perform not as bad as it would.",The Nun

A priest accompanied by a young nun, who has yet to take her own vows, are sent to the abbey by the Vatican to investigate the reason behind a suicide there. What they find out will test them to their very limits as they battle against a force so evil, it will take all the faith that they have to survive.This movie relies heavily on atmosphere, visuals, and shadow - trying to elicit scares using jump tactics and camera movement. The plot is rather weak and subdued with little narrative or back story. Some of the twists are confusing and hard to follow.There is plenty of your typical horror film fluff here. For example, a character turning slowly to look one way and then turning back to have someone or something standing right behind them in the dark. There are some other usual little gimmicks employed here, such as little ringing bells, eyes glowing in the dark, a radio that turns on by itself, hands reaching out of dark places, and a religious relic needed to save the day ... etc etc etc. These are things we have already seen, and used again here.This wasn't a bad movie per se, but it really wasn't good either. It is pretty generic, worth watching once. Maybe even entertaining enough to keep. It's good enough to keep as part of the Conjuring Universe of movies if you are into collecting.

You'd think that if your god needs you to talk to them 24/7 to keep the demon away, you'd seek out other methods. But no, that wouldn't be appropriate in a movie clearly not targeted at the faithful, would it?When The Conjuring 2 first came out, there was a lot of buzz on the nun. It was a creepy character with a lot of potential and, like the rest of Hollywood, Warner Bros. jumped on the bandwagon to make an origin story.
And I fully understand how redundant it is to watch a film called The Nun and complain about excessive use of religion, but it's such an integral part of this film that it needs to be mentioned. None of the other films in this universe thus far relied so heavily on religion to the point of turning off viewers, yet this one doesn't seem to be able to survive without it. At the very least the writers could've given us some subplot - throw Ed and Lorraine Warren into the mix! - to break up the constant praying and sitting around waiting for a god that clearly has no intentions of moving in on the situation.This is the first major dud in the universe so far, and it's a shame because it had such a nice streak of success going for it.

105,sweidman-28016,Not Very Good,4,28 October 2018,"The Nun Review:The Nun is the origin story of the demonic nun, Valak, and first in the timeline for the Conjuring movies. I had really high hopes for this movies because all of the movies in the franchise, excluding Annabelle, were pretty good, especially The Conjuring 2 where Valak was introduced. One word: disappointed. This movie had so much potential to be good, but it decided to throw that idea away and not break itself away to a typical modern day horror story. The story wasn't even that great. A nun who hanged herself is found so the Vatican send Father Burke, Demián Bichir, and Sister Irene, Taissa Farminga, a practicing nun who hasn't taken her vows, to investigate and find out what caused her to be hanged. I've seen Bichir in only a few movies, Alien:Covenant and The Hateful Eight, and enjoyed him in those movies. He was enjoyable in this one. He played a priest with a bad experience with an exorcism in the past that didn't work so well so he has to live with the guilt. That whole story was so unnecessary, only there for some jump scares. Taissa's sister, Vera, is in both Conjuring movies and did well so I thought she'd do well in here. After all, she has played great characters in American Horror Story, Violet bring one of my favorite. She was good in here. She didn't have much of a past. Just a random sister who was chosen to help investigate. A guy named Frenchie, Jonas Bloquet, was the one who found the body of the dead nun. He felt wedged in there just for a bit of comic relief, only at the end though, and for a ""plot twist"" at the very very end. The ""plot twist"" was so unnecessary and only there to tie in the other Conjuring movies. The scares in the movie were simply not that scary. It was a whole bunch of predictable jump scares. The structure was literally this: a sound, camera pans away, nothing, goes back, there's something there and a really loud sound. It wouldn't be anything really scary but just a loud sound to make people jump and look at their friends and laugh about being scared. Also the ""scary"" stuff in it most of the time didn't make much sense. For example (this is in the trailer and many promos) Father Burke gets put in a coffin underground. There was no reasoning for it but so there could be a claustrophobic scene. It was the nun just playing pranks most of the time. Also you didn't really see the nun much. It was either just the silhouette or something else. Not a big spoiler but if you want to know nothing this is a really minor spoiler. The convent they're at us evil because some guy way back when did evil stuff and tried to summon evil. It kind of failed and the church thought it would be fine to put a convent there so it could be holy. I literally chuckled. It was so dumb. There were also lots of typical bad decisions made. Overall it was a typical disappointing horror movie with many many jump scares (I started counting but lost track).My Grade: C-My Top Conjuring Movies:1. The Conjuring 2

What I was met with was typical Hollywood rushing out something they thought would be a hot commodity without putting any thought into it.

108,nikola17,Whatever you do Don't Stop Praying,7,12 September 2018,"I Do Respect People Who Hated Movie That Is Fine, But I Liked This Movie a lot more then to Annabelle Franchise I Liked First Annabelle not Annabelle Creation witch i thought everyone likes it i am like what ? really i thought it was almost 2 hour long boring takes so much time just to know what is going to happen next until end i am like this is boring. The Nun In Another Hand set before Annabelle and Conjuring this was one hell of ride of Scary and Darkness full of it i like it that way i thought characters in this movie were better, i thought it's Slaright Forward Movie not a 2 hour long just to know what is going to happen just Slaright Forward Simple Plot THAT'S IT. i mean come people how much do you want more of story to be 2 hour long plot people say oh it's almost like they just threw it Together in 5 Minutes of Back Up Story of Nun ? i am like how much their is to Know More About Nun ? She Is just Demon Turned Possessed Into Demon as a Evil Nun ? i mean how much is their to know about ? it's good that they did it slaright forward or else it's boring as hell, witch they want to do Nun 2 to show Valak back story a lot more like Annabelle Creation. I Thought this was one of true horror movies then to Winchester or Slender Man, this is better horror movie. story follows Father Burke (Demián Bichir) know for Machete Kills, Hateful Eight, Savages. A priest with a haunted past and a novice on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate the death of a young nun in Romania I Thought Priest is a great character in movie he is in it the all time. Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) know for The Final Girls. Burke and Sister Irene were sent to Investigate and go travel to Romania and meet with Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) know for 3 Days To Kill. Frenchie who was French and Canadian saw Nun Hanged her self, he saw it happen, they went in to Church where all Nuns Live In. they just investigate about Place, Now they show Nun their and their but it builds Suspense but it doesn't take awhile to get to Jump Scenes this movie is very scary when i say Scary it's full on Darkness and Haunting and Terrifying The camera work is great and with very little use of CGI, it makes the film feel even more dark. One things for sure, the nun will give you nightmares, full of it
Don't convince your self that you won't get scared or that you won't like it. YOU WILL, after that. This movie has excellent sound effects, great soundtracks, good sensation and a lot of scare. i really enjoyed Conjuring 1&2 great movies first Annabelle is good and Annabelle Creation i didn't like, but for those and horror fans this is one hell of ride of darkness for you to watch it's worth it for money and ticket it's worth it, those days with Horror movies aren't good as any more i hated Slender Man or Ouija 1 & 2 witch i had no idea why they got a franchise, Gallows Hated, i loved It Follows but when it comes to the conjuring films they had something special here for Conjuring Universe. It's Not Based true events, but they have that psychological element that makes a film truly frightening, it's just Non Fiction Connected with Conjuring Movies. The acting seriously makes the film believable which adds to the frightening scene where you're wanting to hide, your heart is pounding like you just ran a marathon, this is how the film makes you feel with unexpected jump moments that make you jump out of your skin. i thought i loved some of ideas of movie and there's no cheap jump scenes i am tried of Jump scenes but movie does have it but it doesn't make me to hate movie, their is scenes that are scary witch it doesn't not all of them involve jump scenes. i thought their are scenes of movie that little look like to Winchester witch movie i hated so badly this is much more scarier then to Winchester a lot more. i give this 7.10 it's good movie this kicks Devil Inside in Inside right in Butt, Corin Hardy is new director the Nun he made was good he made only one movie this is his second movie he did a great job as a beginner director whatever he is but he done a good job of this project, i mean this is one of better horror enjoyable movie right edge of your seat the most terrifying movie of all time, and it's worth it.",The Nun
109,SkullScreamerReturns,Cool gothic scenery with a too loud evil nun,2,15 April 2021,"I really liked the beginning of this film. Nuns, the catholic church, an old castle (in Romania, of course!), gravestones, crosses, lanters, candles, fog... I became excited, yes, this is the return of gothic horror! But when the movie went on the atmosphere was often spoiled by the monster (the evil nun) who was too loud, roaring like a lion and looking too cheesy with the sharp-toothed grin. The horror was best and most spooky when the nun just sneaked in the background, but the ""scare"" moments weren't really scary. Actually, they were annoying. I mean, the sound design of this movie is terrible. I tried to put enough volume to hear the speech but then the jumpscare sounds were just absolute thunderous. You can't watch this movie late at night unless you want to scare your next door neighbour as well.Taissa Farmiga is nice as the younger version of Vera Farmiga's character in The Conjuring movies. This might not be the strongest of franchises to tie movies together, but the similar looking actress in the role was a good cast, and she also does play the part so that it feels like the same character. That's one of the better things about this movie. The priest (played by Demián Bichir) was also a pleasant character but I felt like he has too little to do in the actual story. I would have liked him being more involved.So, I liked the beginning of the story, and some scenes very very beautifully shot, but towards the end I started to hate the movie because it became the same old noisy and aggressive Excorcist ripoff as so many other movies. Why is the evil so loud nowadays?Let us pray to God that He will redeem us of these mediocre noisy demon movies, and that He will allow Bela Lugosi to rise from his grave so that we could have good atmospheric gothic movies again.

114,Mike_Devine,Not in the same league as 'Conjuring',6,13 April 2019,"As the universe of Ed and Lorraine Warren continues to expand, fans are taken to the forests of Romania for additional backstory on familiar characters - this time it's that creepy ghostly demonic nun.It's mid-20th century, and Father Burke (Demian Bichir) travels with a pre-vows nun candidate named Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) to investigate an apparent suicide by another nun. Of course, we soon find out there's a lot more going on within the abbey. But aside from a few frightening moments, 'The Nun' is a lot more bark than it is bite.There isn't really a whole lot of original content in 'The Nun,' instead director Corin Hardy and writer James Wan rely on old, tired scares rather than trying to recapture the magic of the original 'Conjuring.' Farmiga does well, no doubt, but Bichir comes off as very forced. Meanwhile, country boy ""Frenchie"" (Jonas Bioquet) is intended as comic relief, but he ends up sticking out like a sore thumb among the darkness surrounding him and his comrades. And while you really can't tell it's her, Bonnie Aarons does a respectable job as the title character - she is truly terrifying.After a somewhat boring but mildly scary first two-thirds, the final act really devolves into chaos, but not in a good way. And despite a pretty clever twist in the final minute, 'The Nun' ends up feeling like a film that was created out of necessity rather than because it should be made.But of course, a sequel has already been announced. Hopefully the follow up to 'The Nun' isn't just more of the same.",The Nun

But panned by critics upon release, I lost interest and only got around to this today. What a disapointment this was. Initially, with the first twenty minutes being full of dread and atmosphere and building a decent story with good characters, that all quickly went downhill once the main characters reached the abbot in Romania. From here on in there was far too much telling rather than showing, cliche-ridden dialogue and extremely lacklustre and predictable set-pieces.

The fact that the actors were decent and some of the scary moments were effective, can't save the stupidity that's called a script.When your build up is created by having people walking backwards and than falling, or by looking away from the danger, to focus on something trivial, and than discover that the danger has disappeared, than your attempt at creating atmosphere fail.This movie is nothing more than milking a genre and even for fans who are just curious, this movie has nothing good to offer.",The Nun

The Carta Monastery in Romania. A creepy and eerie setting. The atmosphere was spot on. Out of the three main cast, I only liked Taissa Farmiga character. I like the way it ties the Conjuring and gives an explanation about Valak the Nun. Didn't really like Father Burke, his character was to weak. He makes the most ridiculous decisions. After being buried alive outside in the cemetary and saved by Taissa Farmiga, wouldn't you just get the hell out of dodge? No he wants to re-enter the monastery. Thats dedication!

123,patriciogl10,A wasted opportunity.,5,11 September 2018,"I have to be honest, my instincts told me this movie was going to be awful and my insticts didn't fail me. Same old cheap jump scares used in every modern horror flick, a cliché at this point. There were a few scenes which were decent: the whole sequence in the graveyard with Father Burke (Demián Bichir) and the demonized boy from his past; and when Valak moves as a shadow through the wall until it enters the mirror and then appears behind Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga); I thought that scene was scary, but that's about all I can rescue from
this otherwise worthless movie. I fail to see the need of having that snake-spitting boy appearing like twice more since his first encounter with Father Burke, it didn't add anything to the plot, by the third time he appeared I was thinking they should give him a rest already, for good! Valak barely appears in her own movie, I can't stop thinking how many great things they could have done with this character and this was the writers and filmmakers chance to put it right there next to the two The Conjuring installments, but failed miserably.
I remember being so scared by the Nun's subtle appearence in the Conjuring 2, and later going full blast at the end of that film. Those scenes alone are immensely better than this entire film. Another issue, the resolution
of the plot was just laughable, so incredibly ridiculous I can't believe I spent money to watch this.The acting is decent enough, though is not like the actors had much to begin with, the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired. If this movie spawns more sequels I hope it's an improvement from this, because I want to see this character put to a good use, in a decent setting, with a coherent plot and not resorting to cheap resources everyone can see coming from miles away.Anyway, I'm not going to end this by saying 'don't waste your time on this'. Go, waste it, watch it, you may like it nonetheless.

Everything else. Movie was actually boring, which consisted often of people walking into dark areas and a jump scare. I never got invested in the story or even care what happened to the characters.Decision making--Horror movies are predisposed to have people making wrong decisions, but there should either be a few dumb decisions, or you should set someone up as not being smart that is making the dumb decisions. Here you are presenting people as smart and very intuitive constantly doing the opposite of what any rational or (irrational) person would do.

I had to read the story of the castle, unholiness and Valak from the internet after the movie, because the movie just never held my attention. (Fell asleep once). The backstory is handled super briefly with one flashback and most of the stuff seems to happen in somewhat random fashion.I like the original Conjurings and like my medieval castles and religious horror (which this really isn't tho), but to me this was a huge let down.Reviewers have said the cinematography and atmosphere are good, but I can't fully agree. While the sets are somewhat nice and authentic, I felt the lighting and cinematography were very studio like, I was never properly dragged into the atmosphere of the movie.Acting was ok, but also not very engaging. The ""Frenchie"" character was very much out of place as a kind of comedic relief, even minor love story.

131,FelipeCarrillo,"""The Nun"" is a black cat for James Wan's fairly immaculate ""Conjuring"" cinematic universe",4,25 November 2018,"Still unconvinced James Wan is this century's big studio horror maestro? Here you get a further reason- at this point, a needless one. -Like most filmmakers, he started out making indie films, like just a few, has ended up sitting on the most prestigious Hollywood thrones by personal projects that get better as get older. Since his directorial debut, each of his offerings has strongly resonated either during or after its release among film lovers, proof of this can be found in his very first feature-length motion pictures that indisputably become part of this modern horror renaissance (""Stygian,"" ""Saw,"" and ""Dead Silence"").His future looked promising, until April 2011. Joining forces with his inseparable fellow-writer Leigh Whannell, this sinister haunted house chapter starring Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson was the definitive momentum to get a shot of stardom. That movie was a big step, but what was to come was inexplicably bigger. Sometime later, Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema embraced the Australian director because of a vintage mainstream horror hit based on the real-life case files of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren; a modern/old-school masterpiece now in the annals of contemporary horror genre.
At that time, no one expected a new moneymaking cinematic universe was about to be born following the tremendous success both at the box office and among the critics. In the form of a spin-off/prequel, ""Annabelle"" hit theaters getting impressive dividends but poor reviews. Three years later, Wan came back into the world that gave him worldwide glory and took the helm again in the third entry into the franchise, based on another real-life file of possession and paranormal events that terrified the Hodgson family in Enfield, England; however, the big difference was creative freedom over the facts, that is, Wan and his screenwriters created brand new content about what happened back in 1977.
Among the above ""intellectual properties"" was the movie's antagonist, Valak, a character completely added during the reshoots. Valac is, according to several the goetic grimoires, an angelically winged boy riding a two-headed dragon who leads thirty legions of demons. Re-imagined as a Marilyn Manson-like '90s depiction, he adopts a more macabre and shudder-inducing façade, a creepy white-faced nun. It's a valid adjustment as this diabolic force is able to change in appearance to deceive his victims. Looking at the powerful effect she caused on the audience in ""The Conjuring 2,"" Warner Bros. immediately gave the green light to produce two spin-offs that consolidate this horror series as a true ever-expanding cinematic universe interconnected with each other: Valak would be the first to release; The Crooked Man, utterly CGI-conceived creature, has no release date yet but is in the works.
Attempting to get the same box-office phenomenon status as last year's highest-grossing R-rated horror movie of all time, ""The Nun"" landed in September, a strategic month that, once again, worked out wonderfully for the company. Far from reaching the mammoth numbers of Andy Muschietti's ""It,"" this spin-off prequel, set decades before the rest of the movies, is the highest-grossing installment in James Wan's universe, who receives producing and screenwriting credits, but gives the helm to a remotely experienced director; a movie that, like John R. Leonetti's ""Annabelle,"" mess up the movie, especially storytelling part. It could have been a whole different thing if a filmmaker with better narrative control had directed the project. The same doesn't apply to the 2017 prequel of the prequel ""Annabelle: Creation,"" since Swede David Sandberg got good, juicy experience directing also for Warner ""Lights Out,"" a feature film that was born from his homonymous short film.
Until just a few years ago known for his shorts, Corin Hardy made his directorial debut with ""The Hallow,"" a little 2015 horror film that convinced a few by means of its solidly effective imagery and the loaded, mossy aura conjured by Martijn van Broekhuizen. As a visual artist, it seems that his talent is crafting stifling atmospheres, environments expelling discomfort, frames breathing perversion. Set mostly in an Abbey outside the city of Brasov, Romania in 1952, the monastery- a mix between C.G.I. and studio sets -was an open world to terrorize, at least, in terms of atmosphere. Suffocating hallways, super dark rooms and the surroundings of the church plagued by crosses and a lush forest are key tools used to create an environment of heaviness which, as the story unfolds, strengthens the sense of unsteadiness and dread.
In contrast to its well-achieved atmosphere, the Gothic style coming from inside the abbey makes the pictures an overshadowed, campy, over-the-top Hammer mosaic. Striving to provide scenarios never seen before in this vintage-packed franchise, Maxime Alexandre's cinematography (Alexandre Aja's 2006 remake ""The Hills Have Eyes"") comes up short of delivering scenes with diminished visual power, evocative and, at the same time, frightening production designs. Better films have greatly benefited from the medieval period, displaying imagery as unique as arresting (""The Others,"" ""Crimson Peak"" and even ""The Woman in Black""). Leaning too heavily on light and sound games, there are few overwhelming settings. It cried out for more gorgeous shots like that stunning overhead shot of the nuns begging for their lives.
Hardy, doing his best to live up and pay homage to the previous entries, ends up reproducing several techniques and gimmicks not only from both chapters of ""Conjuring"" and ""Insidious"" but also ""Lights Out"" by Sandberg. The expertise to terrify even the bravest viewer was an important part for success, a disturbingly effective blend of atmosphere, surgically pulsed tension building, skillful camerawork, use of memorable props and a musical accompaniment that makes the effect stronger. Here, there are many proceedings the director borrows, damaging significantly his oppressive atmosphere. Smashed scapulars, upside down crucifixes, devilish shadows, on-and-off demons, trickery with darkness inspired by that ""there's someone behind the door"" unforgettable sequence, sinister children running around, millions and millions of black-faced nuns - for real, it's unbelievable - and a myriad of clichés adding nothing this special universe. Worse still, the most frustrating and infuriating is how filmmaker Hardy turned this auspicious project into an artificially cheap jump-scares rip-off. ""The Nun"" is a superficially crafted suspense string that puts it as the worst of the entire franchise.There are only two masterful sequences: the first takes place in the first act and involves Father Burke, bells and a graveyard; the second, the aforementioned overhead frame in the third act. Beyond DC and Marvel, many film buffs- including fervently myself - consider this universe their favorite and it's sadly outrageous to see how, if you don't get it a proper treatment, it could be mutating into a series of soul-crushing, dump-months-released-like flicks; it's not a disappointment, it's a red-light warning sign for us, horror lovers.""Horror factor"" played a part in success; yet, the true reason was the nearly flawless characterization, characters worried us, we were involved in their lives, we lived in their haunted worlds. Generally, innocent, upright families are the target - ""Creation"" is an exception, -this time, a soon-to-be-nun sister, a Catholic priest and a charming French-Canadian man dealt with evil forces. Despite the trio delivers good performances, thinly-sketched characters and formulaic encounters don't set up a solid connection with the audience.Abel Korzeniowski composes a score in keeping with the genre, the era, and the nerve-racking atmosphere. Oppressive compositions, nourished by suspense and uncertainty, which aren't scared off by sudden loud sound effects. Likewise, the terrifying design of the titular nun, played by Bonnie Aarons - yeah!, she got a supporting role in ""The Princess Diaries,"" - is phenomenal, her presence, tested with diabolical cleverness in ""The Conjuring 2,"" is uncomfortable, makes you look away from the screen and disturb those dark nights, she'll make you wonder twice if that whitish complexion and those shiny eyes in the corner of your room are or aren't real.Gary Dauberman delivers an effortless, messy, predictable yet entertaining writing, a plot fueled by the final turn leading to the very first film as a whole, cohesive universe. The introduction is derivative and short of style beginning with a clip from ""The Conjuring 2"" with a careless editing work. Alas, the origins of its demon and what it involves later is extremely laughable, as fictitious as inorganic.Burying the soft, pointless plot, Taissa Farmiga and Demián Bichir play their characters with gusto and credibility as ever; they aren't characters open to true dramatic developments, but their committed performances help the film not being the fiasco it was destined to be.""The Nun"" by Corin Hardy is the most exasperating, skin-deep and - literally - darkest installment of the entire franchise; a clumsy prequel that sacrifices two great actors, a well-achieved atmosphere, an exponentially effective score and a dangerously promising villain. Dragging this auspicious cinematic universe through the mud, Hardy understands the equation that meant success for the previous films, so he misuses his tools and techniques to end up crafting a strange loud ride with some so-so Gothic-Medieval shots and recycled ""booh!"" moments extracted from the most bothersome, cheapest horrors of modern cinema. Noting its financial success, this universe's future could be at risk in the event that New Line keeps on fissuring it with films devoid of any efficient, original and moving motor hitting theaters year after year.

The film follows a priest and a nun who arrive at an Abby in Romania after a suicide, to find out that the abby isn't as holy as everyone thought it was. The film stars Taissa Farmiga and I haft to say, despite some negative reviews, I liked The Nun. I didn't think it was perfect like the first two or Annabelle: Creation, but The Nun was a very good horror film and I enjoyed it. The film probably is slightly better then Annabelle which I personally enjoyed, but still, it did have flaws as critics pointed out. Th ending and twist leading up to how it connects to The Conjuring worked very well and I didn't see it coming at all and was very cleverly constructed. I advice you definitely to go The Nun but don't expect as a masterpiece as The Conjuring 1 or 2 or Annabelle: Creation.

First, it is in the conjuring universe which has performed fairly well, especially with the latest installment of Annabelle: Creations. Second, the trailer opting to show a single drawn out scene that culminates to one of the best jump scares I have ever seen. Unfortunately, that scene was the only thing that The Nun did right. Bravo to the marketing team to make this film seem watchable.",The Nun

and what's that red light all about? how can that place have that kind of light? unless the building is set beside a traffic light.Frenchie was bring a good role in the final part, it would be bad if he wasn't there. here's a thing,when you are devil you just have to curse to kill people not drown and choke them. and the water scene, come on Frenchie was dive to save suster Irene and suddenly he stand up right away. that not a even deep ..there are a new things that this franchise been try to put in and that become strength and lack at the same time but it's good move tho. i agree that this is not just jumpscare kind of movie but it can be more than this remembering this is not a first movie from the franchise.",The Nun
135,Gresh854,"There's Some Merit To It, But It's Evidently Uninteresting",3,7 September 2018,"The Nun is by no means abominable, it's just-put clearly and quickly-evidently uninteresting. It's a competently well-made, empty shell of tedious horror cliches that we've seen numerous times throughout the ages. This includes-but is not limited to-stale jump scares, formulaic scenarios we've seen plentiful times within Conjuring/Devil-Themed movies, cringe-worthy comedic levity (?), and even MORE crosses turning upside down!The cinematography is pretty bleach and artificial especially in outdoor sequences. Keep your films dark and dim Conjuring series, or do the outdoor scenes without making it look like a foggy CGI cartoon.The film's story alone, kind of just relies on being spontaneous-meaning nothing logistical happens, it just ""happens"" for reasons unheard of. The only somewhat fearsome feature in this movie is the Nun character, who has some of the finest prosthetics/makeup-design on and furthermore, when there's lighting/cinematography brought into the portrait of her presence, it's striking. There's some sturdy, adequate moments woven in every once in a while, but the final product is conclusively just a dull, snoozy case of mediocreness. The Nun-put simply once again-is meatless; there's absolutely nothing supporting it up besides the fact that it's in the Conjuring universe so people will go pay money to experience it for (grievously) that reason alone-or because they saw those controversial ADs on YouTube which stirred up the intrigue-pot-plus Warner Bros Studios wants to make an extra, quick buck off of their property's superfluous cinematic universe. Sinful. (Verdict: C-)",The Nun
136,mattiasflgrtll6,They ain't got nun,5,23 September 2018,"The only thing that makes this movie the darkest in The Conjuring universe is the cinematography.It opens with two nuns walking at the lowest part of a monastery until they reach a sign which translated to English says ""God ends here"". Knowing what a risk it is, they still open the door. A nun shows up bloodied and panicking, who warns one of the nuns (the other is now gone) what she must do. The warning nun then gets dragged away and the other nun kills herself so a demon won't take her soul.Conceptionally, this could make for a good, creepy opening. But there is so little sublety involved and so much bombasity right away that it just feels over-the-top. Even the opening to It '17 (which is arguably one of the only creepy parts of the movie) doesn't blast the loud music until you see Richie get dragged away. In this movie, it gets loud about a minute in, so I'm going ""Wow, bringing out the big guns right away, huh?"". I just miss the very calm openings old horror movies tend to have, where everything seems so safe and sound, until suddenly something really horrifying happens. It makes the actual intended terror much scarier.But let's not get stuck at the opening only. Let's get into the story. Father Burke is brought on to investigate not only the suicide, but also the monastery itself. Is it really as cursed as people say? (Short answer: Yes.) He brings with him Sister Irene and Frenchie as help. Frenchie hesitates showing them where the monastery lies, but is persuaded into taking them there, probably partly because of a hot nun. We get some very cliché attempts of flirting from him, including suggesting that maybe it's better she doesn't become a nun at all.
The dialogue is pretty awkward already, but at least we get to enjoy some nice outside scenery. When they enter the monastery they are confronted by Mother Superior, who does have a good, creepy voice.But while the set-up is fine enough, you soon come to realize they don't really don't do much with it. As you'd expect, there are jumpscares. A LOT of them. And they almost always have the exact same lead-up! Some ominous figure stands behind, they turn around, they turn back and BOO! Or maybe they turn around just one more time to make sure there won't be a lousy jumpscare. The point is, it's s'hit that we've seen a thousand times. The one attempt to have the monster come from a different angle fails completely since it was spoiled in the trailer. It's not like jumpscares can never work, but there has to be a decent amount of build-up before trying to scare you, if you wait only five seconds after you expect something scary to happen, it loses all impact. The Conjuring movies had jumpscares, but there were fewer of them, and you actually got enough time to feel some chills down your spine. How am I supposed to feel the uncomfortable dread if I've only got seconds on me? Are they so damn impatient to scare their viewers they can't hold off a little?Not just the jumpscares are repetitive, the structure of the plot is. You get see the characters walking, and walking, and walking, and walking... I swear at least an hour of this movie probably consists of people walking after something. These scenes are so freaking pointless and irritating since you could spend that time on developing the main demon nun's backstory. You know, the nun that the movie is about??? You get some info about the monastery's history, but why the nun is evil, why she wants people's souls? Nothing. You come to a prequel movie about a minor The Conjuring 2 character, and you learn nothing you didn't know before already.Let's talk about the nun, by the way. How does she come across in this movie? Overdone. People have debated about the nun being shown too much or too little, but I don't think the amount of screentime she has is the problem. It's the way they use her. Mostly she was an ominous painting standing in the background, which would then slowly move closer in a way that's really eerie. This time we get close-ups of the nun laughing, saying cheesy one-liners, and show off the dreaded CGI teeth. Oh God, how I can't stand that. ""Less is more"" is certainly something that movie hasn't employed. Bonnie Aarons still does a good job as The Nun, but the director just didn't know how to use her correctly. When the nun is defeated by Irene spraying blood at her (I'm not kidding, that's all it takes), she collapses into a pool of dreadful CGI effects.Now, there is one more redeeming feature about the movie: the acting. Even though there are a few weak spots, like Ingrid Bisu's overacting with Sister Oana and Jonas Bloquet as Frenchie really not coming across as charming as he hoped, most of them do a decent job. Demián Bichir is believable enough as Burke (even though he does kinda use the same facial expression a lot) with Taissa Farmiga as Irene being the true stand-out. She seems to have inharited the talents from her sister and looks like a promising new performer. She made her character Irene easy to root for, and even though the suspense for reasons I mentioned isn't well-done, you care about her character making it out okay.The ending ties the movie together to The Conjuring, where it turns out that Frenchie (after saving Irene and Father Burke's life) got bit by the possession bug and is shown 20 years later on a tape where he's screaming in agony while priests perform an exorcism on him, indicating that the danger is never really over. I think I spotted a small cameo by Vera Farmiga, which if it was her that's cool. If it isn't... well, at least she was wise enough to stay away from this mess.The Nun is not good. It's boring, it's predictable, it's not scary, which wouldn't be as much of a problem if it at least had atmosphere, and even though it's only 1 hour and 37 minutes, it feels like it will never end.
It's not the worst thing ever, but it's very mediocre. As a huge fan of the Conjuring movies, this is a serious letdown. Unless they get a really talented director, it seems like only James Wan can make a movie in the Conjuring spirit work.",The Nun
137,tfminfl,272. The Nun.,1,27 September 2018,"A very bad movie. It kind of looked like this was supposed to tell us the origin of the nun, no, it does not. Matter of fact the nun rarely appears. To me it felt like a whole bunch of random scenes from other movies of the same genre, redone with new actors, to tell a boring tale of two church folk going to investigate the suicide of a nun, no not that nun, a different nun. And what they find is this a french guy who looks suspiciously like Nic Cage, well he found the nun hanging, clutching a key, but where does it go to. And the truth is, I already didn't care. The entire movie is just scene after scene of bad acting/writing, and very cheap jump scares. And in the end, the nun is defeated, until the rest of the Conjuring movie timeline begins. And if you listen closely The Nun is a big of a ripoff of IT. We get the impression that the nun doesnt always appear as the nun, and lives off peoples fears, and even gets sucked down a well, sorta, this one leads to Hell, oh thats where that dumb key goes.

141,Jared_Andrews,A Steady Stream of Predictable Jump Non-Scares,3,24 September 2018,"What had me most excited to see 'The Nun' was its trailer. The trailer is terrifying in the best way, which is a combination of fun-terrifying and terrifying-terrifying. The mysterious figure lurking in the background, the creepy whisper, a well-executed jump scare-it's all there. Such an auspicious trailer seemed to promise an equally fulfilling feature film, but that was most definitely not the case. This one is a giant miss. 'The Nun' tells the background of the haunting and horrifying demon, Valak, who poses as a nun. It's a brilliant idea. Turning one of most trusted and purely benevolent entities (nuns) into a mysterious demonic form is pure nightmare fuel. Aside from blatantly looking creepy, part of what makes the demon nun so scary is the mystery of it all. A backstory detracts from that. Once we understand more about this demon and know how to defeat it, we're that much less afraid. With that in mind, a story like this, which spends a lot of plot time on exposition of Valak, seems doomed to fail.Other poor choices also doomed this movie from the jump. There's a character in it named Frenchie, who is funny and charming and comforting. All of the qualities are wonderful in most movies but completely out of place in this one. The movie takes itself extremely seriously but is constantly undercut by how funny this guy is. With his effortless (and possibly unintentional) humor he hijacks any chance this movie had of successfully scaring its viewers. I don't blame the actor for this, and I think he could thrive in the appropriate film. Casting him was a filmmaking mistake.Not that the movie would have worked that well with a more serious character replacing Frenchie. All the jump scares are carried out in a familiar, predictable pattern. The camera follows the main character, then she hears something, then the camera pans to the sound but there's nothing there, then the camera pans back to her and something is behind her. Boo! Then repeat this sequence 30 more times until the jump ""scares"" did nothing more than elicit a yawn. There's virtually zero effort given, and the demon nun is used to about 30% of its potential.Similarly, the CGI did nothing to aid the scares. It too often looks too fake, almost cartoonish. The further away from reality that the movies takes us, the less scary it becomes. If the demon looks obviously fake, then we start thinking about how all of this is obviously fake, and we become less afraid. Practical effects are much more effective in these instances. Overall, this movie left me massively disappointed. A creepy character is misused, another character is miscast, and I felt misled about this movie's potential. 'The Conjuring' universe has some excellent films and some duds. This one is a dud.",The Nun

147,Fields201,A Horror Movie For Religious Nuts,5,8 September 2018,"I wasn't going to see this but this was the only semi-decent movie playing and my mom and nephew had another outing. We like horror films even though I never thought the nun from Conjuring 2 was remotely scary. Laughable, actually. She's not much better in this one.The Nun follows some nun in training going out to investigate the holy grounds with some priest and some world traveler guy. Things happen, people pray, and the movie isn't that much interesting. I must admit, I didn't pay much attention to this one. However, I did have a bad cold during it, but that still doesn't excuse the film.The worst part was we brought my nephew's girlfriend who hates horror films because they scare her. Well, this one didn't scare her at all. What does that tell you? My biggest problem with this one is that there is nobody and nothing to really relate to. I didn't care about anyone in this film. The final act of the film was somewhat amusing, but it still littered with cliches. When you finally get to see this nun in action, she never really does much except choke people and use her powers to throw them. Again, I never found the nun to be quite scary so it ruins most of the scenes for me.Both Annabelle movies were better than this one, sadly. The performances were fine, but the priest was useless when you actually think about it. All he did was get saved through the whole movie, and thinking back, did he even contribute anything to the movie? I think he got injured by the end of it. I think they are setting up a sequel but I'll skip out on that one. I'm pretty sure that one will be set in modern times or something, but hopefully there will be some effort put into it. This one felt like they shoehorned a spinoff because word got around that people liked that nun character. Whatever.",The Nun

149,hunter-friesen,"""The Nun"" is an Unholy Abomination",3,27 September 2018,"Over the last five years, the ""Conjuring"" Universe has taken the horror genre by storm. This has been made possible by having great directing and inventive scares that defy expectations. ""The Nun"", the newest film in the series, has none (pun intended) of those quality traits. Instead, it ends up being one of the most generic and forgettable horror films in recent memory. Set in 1952 Romania, the body of a young nun is found outside a monastery. The nun committed suicide by hanging, but the purpose is unknown. The Vatican sends Father Burke and Sister Irene to investigate the nun's death and find out if the monastery is still holy ground. Once there, Burke and Irene are met with many different types of supernatural evil, all of which spawn from a spirit that has been recently awoken. Marking only his second feature, director Corin Hardy fails miserably to make this film different than other supernatural horror films. He relies way too heavily on jump scares and doesn't establish a creepy atmosphere. Despite having only a 96-minute runtime, ""The Nun"" is surprisingly boring. Hardy keeps the pace very slow and doesn't allow for anything interesting to develop. Not much really happens until the very end when we get a quick final showdown that ends in the campiest way possible.Speaking of campiness, the film tries to interject the scares with a few slight one-liners. They make no sense in the context of the story and always fail miserably, invoking groans rather than laughter. One slight nod that can be given to Hardy is his average camerawork. Some of the overhead and pan shots are interesting to look at, but that's about it. Written by Gary Dauberman with help from James Wan, ""The Nun"" could already take the cake for the worst writing of the year. The overall premise of the film is decent, but any resemblance to a story after that is downright terrible. Important elements have very little background and anything that happens is given no reasoning whatsoever.Each character is very dull. They have tragic generic backstories that try (and fail) to make us connect with them. They also make some of the dumbest decisions, such as splitting up multiple times and trying to fight a demon head on. Similar to the directing, the writing fails to make the film scary in any way. Almost every ""scare"" is a jump scare that just startles you. After that, nothing really happens as the film cycles to the next jump scare. It's very predictable and restricts any element of surprise. Completing the trifecta of horribleness is the acting. Demián Bichir plays Father Burke. Just like his character, Bichir is very bland and lacks any trace of personality. All he does is have a concerned look on his face and barely makes any meaningful interaction with the other characters. Taissa Farmiga, sister of franchise star Vera Farmiga, plays Sister Irene. Unfortunately, Taissa shares no quality acting traits with her superior sister. She constantly looks out of her element and isn't able to be more than a one-note character. Last, and certainly least, is Jonas Bloquet as Frenchie, a local farmer who acts as a guide to Burke and Irene. Frenchie is the arrogant tough guy in every horror film that you just want to punch. He's the source of all the painful one-liners and is just flat out terrible to watch.""The Nun"" is a boring and frightless mess that fails on all levels. By the time the credits roll, any audience member should feel insulted that they wasted both time and money on this pitiful excuse of a horror film.",The Nun
150,keelhaul-80856,"Decent, but extremely forgettable...fails to meet the high bar set by the franchise.",6,8 September 2018,"Just got back from the theater. My wife was really excited to see this, and it wasn't a total failure--it was exactly what I expected. Living off the reputation and the high from the Conjuring films, Nun turns in a somewhat respectable performance, but this is basically a ""paint by numbers"" horror film. My wife even fell asleep during several slow parts, and my experience was somewhat ruined by teenagers with cell phones having conversations, until I asked them to kindly shut the hell up. This one reminds me of a watered-down exorcist, with a smorgasbord of horror themes and settings-- in fact, the only things missing were a chainsaw/knife-wielding maniac and some little girls with a ouija board. We have priests, Romania, nuns, graveyards, upside down crosses, the blood of Christ, WW2, French Canadians, possessions, suicides, jump scares, ancient rituals, pentagrams, hauntings, and darkness--- Did I mention jump scares??? LOL. Although, some were quite good, and the plot isn't as terrible as some led us to believe. I found it odd that the demons know every fear and past deed of the protagonists, though, and yet they never see simple stuff coming-- like shotguns and spitting magic blood in their faces. The plot actually had good stuff to build on; it was the character development that I found tired and cliche, spinning its wheels for money. The Priest who can't forgive himself for letting a boy die, that drinks whiskey and trudges on. = Yep, seen that 100 times.The tiny but faithful nun that must overcome things that the men can't= Yep, been there, done that.The funny guy with a semi-romantic attachment to the girl, who gets the short end of the stick= Yep, seen that one.The monster that you make the mistake of showing way too soon, and way too much= Definitely have that one on file here. The Catholic Church being presented as the only group that can deal with demon possession= Done to death, though history shows us that they spend way more time and money on molesting boys and killing people. Seriously, the Catholic Church has more plastered-over paganism and wacky beliefs than the devil worshipers they are sprinkling water over. I find it hilarious that they are always the go-to guys for any sort of demonic possession or ghostly troubles. Can't we have a Protestant deacon or a Buddhist monk for once? This reminds me of the remake of ""It""-- it isn't really scary. It is more funny and theatrical rather than horrifying. A couple of loud jump scares, and 30 mins. of ugly powdered doughnut faces floating around grabbing at people.Overall, a fun outing and worth a watch, but very forgettable film-- Which is why they will be making more sequels soon. This was a great franchise, but will probably follow the rout of Disney with Star Wars, trying to milk every dollar until they have nothing stylish and scary to produce.",The Nun

You know how a lot of times comedy films get criticized and people say it would be a great sketch but it was a lousy film cause it was basically one joke? The Nun is kind of like that. It has a couple good scenes and it is non stop with the scares after a short set-up, but man it is basically the same scare done literally 40 or 50 times. There is only so much you can do with a scary Nun and 3 main characters. But again if you are going to see it, and I would not recommend it, see it in a theater.

Her horror is both captivating and spine-tingling. Bonnie Aarons as The Nun, first introduced in The Conjuring 2, is the perfect actress for this role. This story, itself, is done in classic gothic horror-like fashion similar to the old classics like Bram Stoker's Dracula. Naturally it is very atmospheric with a setting like Romania; most of the film itself takes place in a medieval castle built by a Satanic Duke, which was later converted into a Convent (Best idea EVER, Vatican!) but it also contains alot of classic horror imagery like a foggy cemetery, old ruins, decrepit chapels and sanctuaries, etc... I was also surprised to see some horror-trope creatures but it all fits together nicely in this gothic horror package, which is clearly what they were aiming for. It certainly hearkens back to the old black and white Vincent Price films I watched as a child. I am sure that if Vincent Price were here today, he would be very thrilled with The Nun, and possibly the direction of The Conjuring franchise in general.

The setting is fantastic and there are a few shots set up in such a way that you know the director was reaching for memories of Dracula in the cultural unconscious. It's a shame so much of the film was shot in the dark. For every great shot of a narrow road in the forbidding Romanian forest, you have at least three shots where you're squinting at the screen trying to make out what the characters are looking at. Just because there's a lot of darkness in the frame doesn't mean it's scary. I don't hate this movie, though.

There are moments you think it can't get any worse for our adventurers and then it does. Our heroes naturally wait until the most inappropriate time to go their separate ways.

It's not as good as that movie obviously but I appreciated a lot of the extremely dark imagery, it seemed knowledgeable about the catholic faith and using the inverse of actual Christian imagery to scare.

The Nun was hinted at in two different movies in this franchise so when it came out you think it be amazingly good but its just so so. and why it's so so is because of the same reason as the other movies. The movie relies too much on special effects and action instead of building suspense.Poltergeists, The Exorcists and even the Conjuring had that going for it. These movies had a slow build up and got ever more creepy as the story progressed. The scares were subtle and that actually made them more frightening. This movie just starts out at 10 and stays all the way through. It doesn't give the viewer room to take in the story or to even comprehend much of what's going on.

169,gerry_barnaby,"Masterpiece of Horror, Truly Frightening and unneiving",9,6 September 2018,"I'm a big fan of the conjuring film as they had that edge of over every other horror film in the past 20 years, It seems for a while that Horror film has been lacking lately with the aspect of what actually makes a good horror film work.Sad this 12A generation of horrors just isnt horror at all, so when it comes to the conjuring films they had something special here, not only based on true events, but they have that psychological element that makes a film truly frightening.Going into this film The nun I knew that film would be frightening but I was worried that it might fall to the same old cheesy jump scares. Well, I can honestly say this raised my expectation to a whole new level, Not only does this film feel like the old Hammer horror style films, it twists it into a whole new style of terror beyond imagination.When I said I knew this film was gonna be frightening, what I didn't expect is the film to actually frightening the living hell out of me to the point I nearly passed out, im not joking! This film has so many elements of unnerving moments with the dark atmosphere you don't need cheap jump scares to frighten you, the film isnt self is truly frightening in every way possible.The acting seriously makes the film believable which adds to the frightening scene where you're wanting to hide, your heart is pounding like you just ran a marathon, this is how the film makes you feel with unexpected jump moments that make you jump out of your skin. The thing isnt self the design and the way it moves and the way its manipulate it surrounding, show just how powerful this thing is, this couple with the backdrop of dark monastery Abby in the middle of nowhere, with the dark light tones, really set the atmosphere for the film, especial at the begin.I can honestly say this is one of the best Horror film ive seen in a long time, that I can honestly call a true horror film that has so many parts to it that all comes together to make one of the scariest films around. Even though the film is directed by Corin Hardy who done a fantastic job with this film not only is set design but direction, you can tell this film has a lot of Jame Wan influence with the very nature of the film having this extreme dark psychological feel to it that will have you leaving the cinema in shock.This is true is one of the most unnerving films ive ever watch, that doesn't rely on cheap scares to frighten the audience, this is one of that rare horror that is naturally frightening with a lot of twists that you may not see coming. What's perfect for this Origin story is it given a background that perfect for the story on how this thing came to be, which worked for the film.If there was a True horror film to watch it would be this one, outstanding in every way",The Nun

I have become quite aggravated when so many horror elitists constantly rip on the ""over abundance of jump scares"" within these conjuring universe films. You should know what you're getting and honestly these are still more well done jump scares than pretty much any other modern mainstream horror films because James Wan has a brilliant vision and unique style even when he's not directing the film itself. The glaring problem with this film that holds it back slightly is the bare-bones story which does not offer much of anything other than setting up very foreboding settings and ominous atmosphere before jump scaress you see coming. Annabelle creation as well as the conjuring films all have very good story/character development which compliments the scares successfully. I thought this one lacked a bit in that aspect as I didn't really feel for sister Irene, the priest, or the Frenchman. The way they tied in the ending to the conjuring is a pretty nice future and was well done. I quite enjoy the innovative lighting utilization as well as the fantastic set pieces as they were a perfect backdrop for all of the scares and sinister moments. Overall I'd say this was an enjoyable horror film that I think has been a little bit too criticized, but it does have its flaws and like I said is the least inspired film in the conjuring universe other than Annabelle from 2014.",The Nun
172,TerribleKatherine,"The poster child of modern, boring horror",5,20 September 2018,"The thing that bothers me with most current horror movies is replacing plot and true horror with mindless jump scares. It's a cheap way to make horror movies. Unfortunately this whole Conjuring/Annabelle/The Nun- universe is very predictable and safe. Also, an extremely prominent feature is the lack of any rules. It's also a huge problem with the Nun; there are no rules to what's happening, what Valak can do and what is it incapable of doing. People just run around, sometimes the demon is behind them, sometimes not. Am I supposed to be scared?
liked the overall atmosphere of the movie. The scenery was dark and beautiful and the cast did an okay job. And still all those things mentioned before dragged the movie in to oblivion.

175,ccamp89,Strong 2 // A scaffold on which to hang jump scares,4,8 September 2018,"Much like last year's Anabelle: Creation, The Nun is a hollow and tedious horror film that lazily attempts to capitalize on the success of the original Conjuring films without putting in any of the effort or care it took to make those films great. The Conjuring is a broad, accessible horror film that employs familiar tropes and scare tactics, yes, but it's executed with a finesse and attention to craft that elevates it above its derivative elements. It's a propulsive, well-paced film that's shot in a consistently dynamic and interesting way. You can feel James Wan's vision and creative energy behind each finely-tuned scare sequence and it's anchored by endearing characters whom you genuinely fear for.By comparison, The Nun feels slapped-together and vacuous. It comes off like a bored Hollywood executive hired a bored screenwriter who whipped up a script and passed it off to a bored director, all of whom punched the clock, collected their checks, and moved on. This is a film driven not by creativity but by supply and demand. The characters and story are given the bare minimum necessary to create a scaffold on which to hang jump scares, most of which feel blunt, quota-filling, and lacking in any of the inventiveness of the original films. And things wrap up with an appropriately slap-dash and forced tie-in to the previous films in an attempt to remind you why you should care about anything that just happened.At the very least, this is great to watch next to a film like The Conjuring as a case study in the importance of good direction and craft in filmmaking. It's becoming increasingly clear that, without James Wan at the helm, the Conjuring universe lacks its beating heart.Strong 2/5",The Nun

178,saint_brett,Just Use Garlic or a Flame Whip,3,25 February 2019,"For the record - I borrowed my copy of The Nun from the library.
I'm tired of forking out good money on modern day movies as its pretty much potluck what you get these days. (More than likely it's garbage in the lucky dip.)
But, follow my lead, people; join your local library today - it won't kill you and neither will this movie if you see it. Yes, your local library has all the latest releases and you can borrow them for free. (It won't hurt you to become a library member, you know?)
With its poor reputation and low scoring ratings on IMDb I didn't know what to expect when popping on The Nun. (So I kind of sat on the fence with this one out in left field between somewhere and nowhere.)
Did I like it? No. Did I hate it? No.
It warrants 3 or 4 out of 10 in my books. Won't hurt you to see it once in your lifetime, I guess.
There are worse movies than The Nun.
Lead actress Taissa Farmiga presented well, (young fresh face.)
The bells in the graves were unique, (nice touch.)
They nailed the flat creepy atmosphere & Transylvania type building.
Um, yer, did it not cross their minds to just walk out of the convent and leave the premises altogether? After being attacked on your first night and being buried alive in a coffin wouldn't that be enough to warn you that you're not welcome? Just walk out the front door and head back to town - you're not welcome take the hint. It's called common judgment - use it! (God people are dumb in movies.)
My approach to the movie was that it was going to be an Exorcist rip-off. I mean - any movie based on exorcism one automatically assumes that they got their inspiration from Linda Blair's performance & premise, right? I made an assumption, you see? But, in saying that, I'm wondering if the makers of The Nun were inspired by American Horror Story Asylum? There's a riveting performance by Lily Rabe in that which was well executed. That was genuinely scary and came before The Nun.
But in all seriousness I found the character of The Nun laughable. Literally laughable. Every time she appeared on screen I started giggling & chuckling to myself. Was it just me or did she look exactly like Marilyn Manson? On the cover of one of his CDs he appeared as a demon of some variety and I couldn't help but compare him to this big boss devil thing in The Nun.
There's something offensive about making religious movies with horror themes which cross the borders of decency. It's almost like these film makers mock certain aspects of one's faith & beliefs. I guess you'd have to be an atheist anyway to be making such dark themed movies based on this subject to even begin with? The Exorcist was so well filmed that I find it offensive to watch. Rarely do I watch it anymore.
And I guess the people who rated The Nun very poorly on IMDb were all Christians? Ask yourself, what other religion, bar from Christianity, is mocked in film or horror movie? Why is it okay to present Christianity in this manner when no other religion is mocked with ghost & goblins and the like in movie? Between me and you - there's no such thing as possession, werewolves or Sarlac Pits! It's all man made! Just like Santa and the Tooth Fairy.

182,richarddillomes,"Okay on it's own, weakest compared to other TCU movies",7,7 October 2019,"In case you didn't know, we now have the Conjuring Universe which is bannered by the Conjuring series (a third movie should be out by 2020), Anabelle series (a third movie movie should be out by 2019) and now we have The Nun joining the fold marking it's commercial success amidst mix reviews and should have a sequel out soon as well. It tells the story of a priest and novitiate called in by the Church to investigate the suicide of a nun in an abbey in Romania set in the 1950s.The Nun, also known as Valak made it's first appearance in The Conjuring 2. As explained by the great James Wan (Conjuring, Saw, Insidious), Valak's appearances to Lorraine Warren were merely premonitions and not necessarily that it was following her. Partly, that's where the problem starts. While the Marvel Cinematic Universe has established that anything can happen in the their comics and movies, the TCU doesn't have that much leg room to stand on because the Warrens and their ghost-hunting are well-documented and while they can take a few liberties here and there, they would still need to come back to their original source. They did not anticipate Valak to become a fan-favorite and now they're trying to fit it in their timeline and it comes across as forced (I hope they still change their mind on the Crooked Man spinoff.) If you take the movie on it's own, it's a fairly okay effort but if compared to the other TCU movies, it's the weakest by a mile.Strong performances all around, kudos especially to Taissa Farmiga, younger sister of Vera who plays Lorraine Warren in the Conjuring. What her sister did was a tough act to follow, but she held her own and it did help that she was in a couple of seasons of American Horror Story. The scares were mixed, some getting the right reaction from the audience while the others were only so-so or you've seen somewhere before. I mean there were a lot of unknown elements they could've worked with: they were in a storied and secluded abbey in Romania and all they could give us were mirror reflection ghosts or the spinning camera shot where there's suddenly someone behind you. I believe this could've been a great movie if it was given the right treatment, but I guess we'll just to wait if a sequel will be greenlit and hopefully they can tie it up nicely, maybe add some real-life elements to get it back grounded to what the TCU is all about: the movies aren't scary because of the effects but because they possibly happened, and could happen in real life.",The Nun

If you were fearing that it wouldn't be scary for the average horror fan, then you'd be right, but at least it's worth viewing. It's fun, has a story worthy of attention, and some good effects and scares. It's nothing outright special now is it anything original nor groundbreaking. It's a good popcorn horror. But it plays on the whole Catholic vs Evil storyline, which most people with a Christian background most certainly would scoff at, since if it was anything that horror movies have taught us, is that the Catholic authority is almost useless against the forces of evil (or that Catholic authority is the ONLY force against evil, which to anyone outside the Catholic faith probably thinks is false), thus already setting a pre-determined assumption of the outcome of the plot. But, nonetheless, on a bored night when nothing else else in the streamable selection of online features looks appeasing, this movie should nonetheless satisfy a natural curiosity of spooks and thrills. Just once again, abstain from thinking authoritative figures within the Catholic church are the only source against such evil.",The Nun

And so has The Conjuring and The Nun crap also come full circle.I wasnt expecting much from a movie, that is clearly just made for sheer profit. But this was way worse than I could possibly have imagined.Its not scary, just boring. It has every horrormovie cliche. And just like The Conjuring movies, it relies on jump scares rather than psychological horror and a creepy atmosphere. James Wan was able to create real horror with Insidious 1 and 2. But failed after that. To his defense he didnt direct The Nun. But I'm sure he somehow made money off of it anyway. Im just glad I dint threw money down the toilet, paying to watch this travesty of a movie at the cinema.
Besides from being boring and predictable it has bad acting and several plotholes.*SPOILERS AHEAD*For instance Frenchie, ineptly played by Jonas Bloquet (a european version of Jai Courtney) a french-canadian, who has lived several years in Romania is completely oblivious of all the deaths that has happened in the village he has lived in. Deaths happening, because of the cursed abbey. A possessed body of one of the already dead nuns in the abbey, can be killed by a shotgun. Were talking about a supernatural creature here. And anybody who is familiar with horror knows that a posessed vessel can be severely injured without actually killing the vessel, untill an exorcism has been performed. But I guess the director knew how bad his movie is, so the last part had to be more action than horror. To keep the audience awake. What could have been interesting to watch is only dealt with at a lecture 20 years later. It turned out Valak, the demon, that apears as a nun, posessed Frenchie. Only to continue to try and kill Sister Irene (Tessa Farmiga) in its Nun form and be revived by Frenchie who was the posessed by Valak. Confused? So am I. How can Valak be in two bodies at the same time?? Also, it is never explained where Valak comes from. This was suppose to be an origin story, yet were never being told who Valak might have been. If it was ever a human. The priest is buried alive. Yet seems completely calm, after being rescued by Sister Irene. Bad acting and bad directing.The truly scary part of this movie is the actress that plays Valak: Bonnie Aarons. Because besides from some creepy makeup and contactlenses, she looks pretty much exactly like Valak in real life. I dont wanna bad-mouth her, but she could easily play female monsters in horror movies, without wearing any makeup. So good call, casting her as Valak.So as always, since IMDB, demands one star, no matter how bad the movie, reviewed might be, that one star goes to casting
Bonnie Aarons as Valak.Avoid this crap. It really isnt worth it, despite being only 96 minutes long.",The Nun

Don't watch it at night!,8,22 March 2019,"I'm not an easy person to scare, ar least not by the supernatural to which I'm completely esceptic; however I've always found nuns, specially those of closed cloisters, odd persons --not so active nuns like those in orphanages, hospitals and other charity activities, which I find worthy. Thus, I had a reluctant disposition to the theme. I also find horror movies childish and simple, so I avoid them.
In any caes, I made the mistake of watching this late night after a bad case of jet lag that kept me awake well after midnight.
The cinematography is haunting; you seldom see daylight and normal environments for more than a few introductory and closing scenes. The rest of the movie is carried in an opressing darkness that in itself is overtaking. The plot, while not by far the most ingenious one and absolutely predictable, makes space for some of the most shocking and haunting scenes you can imagine.
The ambience of the edifice --abbey- contributes to a tense mood that will make you cringe with every scary situation.
Performances are solid and show the Farmiga kid as an extremely good actress who follows in her sister steps. Bichir has been a deliverer for a long time and doesn't falter here. The rest of the cast delivers as well and direction and editing are first class.

That actually impressed me in every way, everything in this movie was just amazing, the horror scenes terrified me, maybe not that much I was expecting, but it worked with me in so many ways, the story too was very good, and performances.. oh, the performances were talented in every single possible way especially Taissa Farmiga, she's the BEST!I can talk about this movie for years, it's full of awesomeness! And as I said this is because I have another opinion that I think that it's right, and I hope everyone to see it as I do.This movie is underrated and underestimated very much, and it's unfair, I will always be waiting for the day that everyone said that this movie isn't good to say ""Hear us out, we've been wrong about The Nun!"".One more thing people said about this movie, they said that it's noisy -they mean the soundtrack- and when I watched it I found it amazing and I bought the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack the following day. It was very very good, especially when The Nun shows up, it made her great, dark and scary, beside the OST was incredible in every single way!I loved everything about The Nun, it's my second favorite horror movie of all the time, it comes after The Conjuring 2.. this franchise is keeping impressing me in every movie they make.. and now it's the best horror franchise of all the time and one of the best franchises at all! I think that I'm the biggest fan ever of this movie and the entire franchise!I'm gonna give The Nun an A+.Thank you, guys for reading my review and I wish to get your comments about my reviews to get better.",The Nun

197,seige-hound,A fun but odd entry to the Conjuring Cinematic Universe,5,6 September 2018,"This film serves as a prequel telling the origin story of Valek, the demon antagonist in The Conjuring 2. Set in the 1950's, we follow a priest and a nun-in-training who are tasked by the Church of investigating a mysterious monastery in the Romanian countryside. With the help of a traveller from French-Canada (for some reason) they enter the large castle-like monastery to find it haunted by the demon, and the ghosts of the Sisters who once lived there.The film is tied directly to the Conjuring films, and expects the audience to be familiar with Valek before seeing the film. However, the film fails to be as scary nor as impactful as those two films. While there are some moments that gave me a bit of a jump, for the most part the film relied more on loud sound effects and CGI special effects.One sequence in the film involves a character opening a portal to hell to summon the demon, and the ground cracked and opened up like it would in a much more silly film like Drag Me to Hell. Unlike the Conjuring films which are very closely tied to actual Christian theology and at least somewhat based on true events (not really, but you get what I mean) this film abandons any sense of real world logic, and becomes something only a few steps away from being pure fantasy. This film is not at all subtle, and there are several sequences in the film that involved literal zombie nuns.Another thing, which is a bit more of a nitpick, is to do with language. The film is predominantly set in Romania, but there are scenes in London and the Vatican as well, but everyone speaks in English, and there is little reference to whether there are any translation issues between different people. My guess is that this was a creative choice in order to make the film appeal to a broader audience (by not having the audience have to read subtitles) but it made me question the logic of the film more than the zombie nuns or the portal to hell.This is a fun but mediocre offering. Some good scares and an overall excellent tone, with great cinematography and lighting, but this doesn't outweigh the issues with plot, character, and internal logic within the universe the film is set in.",The Nun

199,neener3707,"Solid Technique, But Scares Aren't As Good As Previous Conjuring Films",5,8 September 2018,"There was a lot of hype surrounding this one, which often results in over-expectations, and that happened to me. The scenes with Valak in the Conjuring 2 were very well done and highly effective. So I was pretty excited to see this one come out, and with the trailers, I expected a lot. But thats not to say its a 1 star film. The tone was great, kind of felt like an old Hammer film, the mood was good at the beginning but it was kind of derailed by terrible writing. I'd say out of the dozen or so scares, only 2 actually got reactions out of me, and to be fair they were not very intense reactions. Though its predecessors used many jump scares, there was just something that didn't work this time, and that was very disappointing to me. So I did enjoy some of it, some tension and scares worked, but most didn't, unless you are 14 and new to horror, but this horror veteran was not totally impressed. Also the film didn't represent the religion well. Many of the nuns talk about feeling spirits, visions, divination, all things that are said t not exist according to the tradition Roman Catholic religion. So heres hoping the next one is better.",The Nun

201,hamidullahgenc,"Valaks of Modern Age May Use Instagram, too?.. Oh.",6,9 December 2018,"In every religious culture, there is the balance between the forces of good and those of evil.In Islam, between the Shaytaaneen (the Satans) and the Saaleheen (the righteous ones); in Zoroastrianism, between Ahura Mazda (the Wise Lord) and Angra Mainyu (the Destructive Principle) and in Christianism, between Lucifer and the Holy Trinity.And each culture tries to give meaning to the nature of good and evil to guide its believers to the blessing warding off the wicked.These ways are not of a scientific pursuit nor should they had ever been of.
To think of this; a nun walks out of a monastery and finds herself cornered by a fox near a waterfall... She immediately repents of her trespasses as it must happen because of her inefficacy. Or a Muslim walks through an alley in a neighborhood and hears a whimper near-by though he sees no one... He immediately says the prayer of Ayat al-Kursi (The Throne Verse - 2 : 255 in the Gracious Koran) in a low voice to take refuge in Allah as it could be the doing of a godless djinn.In this movie, we are not to experience some horror with casual link. In fact, this is not a horror movie but an anthology of, a requiem for the old ways and understandings in Christianity. So, I could not rate it as a horror movie.One can see the vividness concerning the movie set, as it speaks to us - to the modern people - in half decay, half promise. Because of this, I have felt the mournful horror; not the gory horror watching the movie.Science, as it is of comfort, strips us off the essence, the esprit... So, we can be stuck with the question of how Father Burke is buried, or how a ground is holy, or how Valak posseses Frenchie when it is seen fighting Sister Irene, if only ""the cause and effect principle"" is of our way approaching this movie.
That is why, I like this movie. Okay, its poster makes it seem like a mediocre horror flick; and its artistic execution might have been much better reinforced with some innovatory, epochal scaring tactics. But I don't think it deserves such low rating. Valak may be responsible. (What?.. I am modern enough!)There is the Verse of my culture here upon the matter:""Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak * From the evil of that which He created; * From the evil of the darkness when it is intense, * And from the evil of malignant witchcraft, * And from the evil of the envier when he envieth.""Allah wills so in the Chapter of Al-Falaq (The Daybreak) in the Gracious Koran.

I can't say it was ""scary"", but there was a few good jump scares with misdirection involved. Some what predictable at some points & some had me a bit off guard. One thing I do got to say that I think was a mistake in this movie is that the sacrifice the woman would have been decapitated jumping from that high up.
Acting wasn't to too bad, but could have been better. I think Fathers part was played a bit cheesy same with Frenchie who seemed to drool more than anything. If it wasnt for the whole series of movies playing into one big story I would have considered this movie to",The Nun

An old convent (or nunnery) where Nuns have lived for years where one of them is not all as they appear. ""Fantastic! Finally a theme worthy of being a horror!""... I thought to myself. However, as is the case with most horror's a complete porridge is made of it.So the good and the bad:
A setting and theme for the makings of a great horror - An ancient castle, now a convent (nunnery) put in place to keep evil at bay.The lighting and general atmosphere are done well.The film changes from feeling like a horror to something made by Disney film through the inclusion of Frenchie, played by Jonas Bloquet, who may as well have been Gaston from Beauty and the Beast.Very predictable. Unfortunately, the directory/writer(s)/producers followed a very standard format.Overall, The Nun (2018) is not terrible film as despite not being a 'horror' in the true sense of the word, it was still mildly entertaining.There are very few horror films worthy of being called a 'horror' and sadly The Nun (2018) isn't one of them either.",The Nun

208,dineshaishu,The nun,8,19 May 2019,"Good: The setting of an abbey helps create the dark and haunting tone of the movie. The creepy atmosphere built with dim lights and fog help set the mood. Because of the atmosphere and mood there is great suspense for the first few scares, but with too much repetition of jump scares, the tension starts to dissipate...Bad: This film is a jump-scare fest. The writing lacks substance and ends up being a poor origin story with: a rushed introduction that comes off as choppy, a messy middle with little plot consisting of jump scares that become exhausting and predictable because of its abundance, and a bizarre and over the top ending. The characters are wooden and over the course of the movie do not show much dynamic. Throughout the movie, there is cheesy comedy and forced romance.Overall: Bring James Wan back for even though this film could have no way been on the same level as ""The Conjuring"" and ""The Conjuring 2"" it still could have been fresh in the right hands. To me, Gary Dauberman's writing has not shined for I felt both Annabelle movies were subpar and I believe he is getting too much credit for ""It"" when he revised the script and the material was based on a book. The characters were underdeveloped, uninteresting, and lacked emotion. This movie is purely for those who only care about jump scares and have a lack of care for acting, direction, and a good story. This serves as a Halloween flick to entertain the squeamish teenagers who rate a movie based on jump scares and a scary nun.

I also think the design, story and jump scares are very clever and well done. This film is unpleasant as it is good, just how a film like this should be. Taisa Farmiga was excellent as usual and a great addition to the cast.

216,rustonreviews,"Dull and lacking innovation, The Nun is everything you predicted it would be.",3,14 September 2018,"I consider James Wann's two Conjuring movies to be some of the best mainstream modern horror films. Due to their popularity amongst both audiences and critics, it was somewhat inevitable that paranormal antagonists Annabelle and Valak would end up with spin off entries. I caught just half an hour of Annabelle (2014) on TV a couple years back and found it inexplicably terrible but found Annabelle: Creation (2017) to be a decent if not pretty forgettable affair. Shifting focus to Valak, the antagonist of The Conjuring 2 (2016), The Nun centers around the investigation of a nuns mysterious suicide in 1950's Romania at the Cârta Monastery. Upon learning of the incident, the Vatican sends priest Father Burke (Bichir) and novitiate Sister Irene (Farmiga) to investigate the suicide, where they quickly discover the sinister presence that lurks within the walls on the Monastery. Unfortunately (but not entirely surprisingly) The Nun is a boring, uninspired spin-off that fails to pack one single, genuine scare. It's a film insistent on delivering jump scare after jump scare in sequences that are awfully predictable in execution, and the script stretches a story line so thin (not to mention pitifully uninteresting) that it's a wonder they managed to milk it out for the 96 minute run time. Just about everything in The Nun feels uninventive and tired, and even Valak herself appears to have lost all the menace and terror she once possessed so brilliantly in The Conjuring 2. It's a real shame, because there is so much wasted potential here. Setting the film entirely within the haunting walls of the Monastery was a great idea, but the opportunity to explore Valak's backstory further is completely abandoned in favour of a cheesy plot and endless, irritating jump scares. Despite sitting through The Nun with a mostly disgruntled attitude, there were some small factors I liked. Some of the imagery was presented effectively, and there is a small tidbit towards the end that hardcore fans of the series will appreciate, but there is little else to admire here. The Nun will appease to audiences who appreciate mindless jump scares and horror clichés, but those really clued up on the genre will find very little to enjoy. Baffling as it is to see such potential squandered, the upside to all this is that The Conjuring 3 begins shooting next year, aiming for a 2020 release. In the meantime, I'd be completely content if all future ideas for Conjuring related spin-offs were put to rest. Honestly, they're not necessary.",The Nun

218,MplusA92,How did the Vatican approved such movie ?!,5,6 September 2018,"The most important question you probably ask right now is; Is The Nun really scary ?! Short answer would be not that much. Elaborated answer is the following.It follows the exact same style of The conjuring series, the jump scares which are not few here but some of them are expected because of the slow movement of camera. For example there's a scene where a character scans the area quickly with their eyes and noticed something weird so you can easily expect that the camera ""or the character's eyes"" will go back to that spot fast but no, they take much time that you already get ready for the coming jump scare.I hoped this slow movements of cameras continue to see more details on the nun or other creepy creatures but that didn't happen, you will easily remember the face of the nun because it's on the poster of the movie and it's already printed in your mind from previous Conjuring episodes, and anyways the scariest part of the nun is when she is hiding somewhere or moving in the dark, not with her wide open hunting mouth.The audio or the music here is good and can get you that creepy feeling, most of the scenes are dark and some of them are dark to an annoying level.Story wise, here i find the weakest point of the movie, the plot is very silly, the events doesn't push the timeline of the Conjuring any further which is understood here. But the end was rushed in a way just to keep the door open for more Conjuring episodes or in this case to justify or connect The Nun to the Conjuring.This movie includes the least number of actors, ""Demian Bichir"" did well but his reactions where quite fixed the whole time, the real creativity in performance was from ""Taissa Farmiga"" who was competent, funny, and did a great acting and appearance with her face that express a lot of feelings. ""Jonas Bloquet"" added the element of fun here from time to time just to relieve some of the pressure due to horror and he did well in that.Finally, it's a good horror movie that worth to watch, it follows the same concept of the original Conjuring of ""least blood possible"". You will not be disappointed if you are a fan of Conjuring sequel and no way to get bored here.",The Nun

The entire village comes to know of it and so does the Vatican who send Father Burke & Sister Irene to investigate the matter.All three of them, Frenchie, Burke and Irene reach the monastery and are confronted with all sorts of ugly demonic experiences! A monastery that is occupied by nuns who are always chanting the name of Mother Mary and Lord Christ will be infested by demons...? How come?Such images and films weaken the faith and belief of humans in God! Seems like the entertainment industry is basically working for the demons and devils and helping him (the devil) out to establish his reign forever on Mother Earth!The film has shown a headless statue of Lord Christ and also shown the cross inverting as the demon approaches the helpless nuns who are chanting the Holy name ceaselessly! Really! So what does it imply? Constant chanting of the name of God is not enough....in fact it is useless? If the chanting of Holy name cannot save you from the tortures of the devil...then why would anyone chant His name?Angry father or jealous husband?There is a scene when Father Burke and Sister Irene knock at the door of Frenchie - he opens the door and asks (glancing at Sister Irene) whether the lady has come with an angry father or a jealous husband!? What does such a statement indicate? That he was happily leading an adulterous & licentious life in the village...and also the fact that in his village there were ladies - both married and unmaried - who were sleeping with him for fun and lust.In a scene the village bartender tells Frenchie that the demons of the Abbey had started infesting the village as well....and that is why young girls were committing suicide and untoward incidents were happening in the village - really!?What about the 7th commandment ' Thou shalt not commit adultery.' (Exodus 20:14)Honestly readers, I have never read the Holy Bible fully - but have learnt things - basically the gist of it. Moses is one of the most revered characters in the Christian religious scriptures. (Moses, Hebrew prophet and leader who, in the 13th century bce, delivered his people from Egyptian slavery. ) Giving in to lust, greed, jealousy, anger, avarice etc...all lead you away from God and anything that is holy and takes you on the path of hell - the Kingdom of Devil! So humans who cannot adhere to moral and chaste values, get drunk and consume drugs, womanise and disrespect fellow human beings...cheat, murder, rob, betray.....are all already working for the devil....so why be so surprised by gory deaths and hideous endings!!?PS: I never watch horror films....this film I was forced to watch!! I wonder why!?I am sharing a personal experience here - I live in India and during the festive season, our Electricity board carries out some maintenance works and let us know beforehand about the date & time our block will have load shedding! In order to escape the summer heat, me and my friend in the same block, decided to catch a film ....we reached the movie hall and only this film ticket was available....very reluctantly I bought the ticket - because folks - I hate horror films...don't like the after effects actually - the ugly faces and sudden jerks!! But after watching the film I felt that probably Gods wanted me to see the film (I am a true blue devotee of God actually...cannot tolerate any nonsense in the name of God you see) - such blasphemy huh!?Sometimes I think the entertainment world is directly under the payroll of the devil! The things they show and the way they show it ...it has become pretty evident that their reporting Head is the devil himself!Finally- folks, if you all have alienated yourselves away from God - it also means you have decided to support the devil. The devil only knows to destroy and draw sadistic pleasure upon watching the suffering of human beings.An example here - suppose you open up a night club with strip tease shows and free flowing alcohol with complete adultery full on...what kind of visitors do you expect to come to your club? Only losers, cheaters, frustrated fools, sex starved creeps, thieves...and other degraded souls.....similarly folks, Frenchie (Maurice) in the film was a womaniser - he was breaking a father's trust and a husband's love, he was luring women into lust and making them unchaste - he was already a supporter of the devil...why would the devil not possess him huh?! Devil found an ideal house in his body after all.....ever thought about this?",The Nun
220,influxtwo,CHEESY! Comedy Gold.,3,10 September 2018,"*DO NOT* expect this movie to scare you. At your own risk of disappointment. Heed my warning. I am writing this to FULLY PREPARE you of how exquisitely cheesy this movie instead is. One of the cheesiest movies I have EVER seen. I'm talking laugh out loud. The word ""Cheese-Tastic"" literally appeared vividly and sparkling in my mind while watching this third act and beyond. It's almost on the so-bad-its-good made-for-tv-80s-movie level of bad. Almost. (And I LOVE the 80s). I was lit up with inner glee at how bad it was. Seeing a franchise that's taken so seriously fall so hard face first in to a bucket of cheese is a treasure to behold. That was what was astonishing about it, and why It was a surprisingly guilty pleasure. I felt compelled to write this review due to that process. However, that's not to say the film doesn't fall short. it certainly does. But I saw it with a glass half full attitude in order to save this dreadful experience.I am alarmed by how the marketing did not suggest such a cheesy film, but instead a brooding, serious, & terrifying one. Very far off the mark. I used to be unable to tell if I liked these ""Warren"" Family inspired movies or not. Now I understand I do and for all the wrong reasons. It's quite clear and obvious that these movies are made to troll their audience. Period. End of story.This time, the cheese, is slathered on so thick it's incredibly hard to miss if it wasn't already. Only, I can't tell if they were trying to be serious or not. It would appear they are. Horror movies are usually supposed to send a wave of chills down your spine and then you know damn well a creepy scene was effective. Not once did this film ever achieve that and it actually seemed like it was intentional that it didn't want to.If you want a ""scary"" movie this is not the film to pay for in theaters, you've found the wrong film for that. If you want a hokey nonsensical religious fantasy you came to the right place. If they exposed how cheesy it was in the trailers, people would not have shown up to see it, and that's where the marketing was a brilliant sham. They are laughing to the bank and it was easy money. I have never seen a film dupe with their marketing as hard as this one. I got to see it for free and my expectations were so low that I still managed to enjoy the experience though. The only reason due to a morbid fascination with bad horror movies, and this one turned out to be a crowned queen. The cheap jump-scares were more funny than anything. and hardly effective again after the first cheap and premature one. This was made to be a ""fun"" kind of horror movie, akin to films like 'Drag Me To Hell'. Unintentional comedy. This did not seem scary nor serious. The writing was very immature. Now for the spoilers. During the ""scary"" action of the third act our fearless nun-in-training halts all horror chaos, to get her vows of nunhood prayed upon momentarily, as a way to become a real nun, and complete her nun training. Meanwhile chaos lurks around them but no, let her nunhood thrive.Apparently, being french-canadian is a demonic safe word and can inflict nun damage. The whole fragile plot was held together by a special vial of Jesus Christ's own blood. It looks like a christmas ornament. and spitting it's blood on the nuns face is the straw that stops her. At another hilarious moment a demon licks a priest with a wildly large, fast, bendy, snake-like CGI tongue. People were wincing with awkward giggles through out the theater and not for ANY of the right reasons. The cgi demon tongue action literally came out of nowhere. and no the visuals are not as cool as they sound.It was so silly and cheesy that I'm glad I saw it with my own eyes. But do not in any way shape or form expect this movie to be scary or a serious venture. They were trolling HARD. Don't pay for this in theaters unless you are fully prepared for a comedy.",The Nun

The Nun is really about 15 minutes of story with the remainder filled by convoluted jump scare nonsense.This movie seemed like it was written and directed by a dozen different people who didn't communicate with each other. Then, the result was stitched together and delivered as a final product.What was the purpose of the soon-to-be Nun? Because of her visions? Did the visions actually help or just add to the meandering nature of the script?The priest falling into the open grave and ""Sister Irene"" finding him was a roll your eyes moment.Blah, blah, blah.

The sets and cinematography- good
Everything else - BADWhy is this the highest grossing film in the conjuring! Why is it even part of the conjuring universe?!
My GOD I felt like saying a prayer during this film and not because it was scary but because it was so awful!
I spent a pound ($1.29) on this film and found it in the charity shop the opening week it came out on dvd and wondered why it was in there so soon.
Well this is why.
The films plot is complete garbage in a bin bag that keeps spilling out more rubbish to keep you invested, some of these sub plots are so disposable you don't even bother to pick up on them.
All the Nun does is stand there like a stature whilst her wwe entrance theme plays.
Funnily enough in the conjuring two I found her pretty scary because she actually did stuff, now I don't and I'm also immune to jump scares.
Overall this film was created for twelve year old boys to find scary but they couldn't even go and see it.
Don't watch this film it's amusingly bad, go watch the original conjuring movies and don't watch any and I mean any of the spin offs.
Thank you 🥂

230,pedroquintaoo,The Nun: The origin movie of a character that only has 2 minutes of screentime,4,6 September 2018,"My expectations for The Nun were high, they became low because of the marketing, only had 1 teaser and all tv spots showed the same scenes and spoiled almost all jump scares. It made me wonder if Warner Bros was hiding the best parts or already knew they had a bomb in their hands.
Anyway, the plot is basically the same of any paranormal movie (an evil entity, protagonists with a dark past and a lot of jump scares), all the movies of The Conjuring Universe were equal in this aspect, however added other elements that made them good and gave them a certain identity.The Nun doesn't add anything really good, just bad choices. As the case of the ""zombie nuns"" and the possessed child created with bad CGI. These elements destroyed the film and overshadowed the real villain, Valak, who appears around 1 or 2 minutes just for jump scares.
I wasn't expecting to see to much of Valak because the fear which it transmitted was entirely based on the mysticism that enveloped of him/it. Would be better if they ignored the other creatures and used Valak less in jump scares and put it in other scenes as a detail or something like that.
The plot is cliche and without surprises, each scene has a jump scare and after the first part of the movie I didn't jump with the scares because I could already guess the moment where they tried to scare the viewer. Not even the main cast can save The Nun's awful plot! They are good actors, however they can't do anything to help when they have to play bidimensional characters that we've seen in hundreds of other films of this genre.Fortunately, The Nun has positive aspects, the soundtrack is AMAZING and CREEPY, just like the scenarios and other technical aspects! I also loved the small twist at the end, it's extremely clever, although is quite similar to what we saw in Annabelle 2. Almost made me forget that hilarious and cringe moment when the protagonist spits in Valak's face.Even having low expectations, I expected more from The Nun! The zombie nuns were a huge surprise (in a bad way, of course) and sometimes they made me wonder if I was watching the origin movie of The Walking Dead. I hoped to watch the darkest chapter of this universe created by James Wan and see the nun becoming one of the most frightening villains of recent times. Maybe will happen in a sequel.Rating: 3.5/10",The Nun
231,SeamusMacDuff,Throw Horror Movie Ideas Against the Wall,4,20 October 2020,"...and see what sticks.The film seeks to tie together elements of the Conjuring movies - but it's all glue and few parts. The Vatican summons a troubleshooter priest and novitiate nun to Romania to investigate the death of a nun at a convent so remote that no one seems to know its there. Why the Communists would allow this isn't explained? The French-Canadian (?) handyman who found the body becomes intimately involved in things.There's little attempt to build suspense or terror, with telegraphed jump-scares all over. The plot is a muddle, and there are so many elements that turn out to be dreams or visions or who knows what that it's hard to buy into what's happening. (Was the mother superior alive, dead, a construct of the demon, or what?) The CGI kicks in too early and not particularly well. How the priest ws suddenly buried in a coffin deep underground - with a convenient bell! - and just as quickly dug up buy a 110 lb girl is never explained. He'd have suffocated by then. The setting is good, if overdone. It needed about 15 minutes of editing.If the demon jumped into Frenchie, then how did it still manage to act on its own for as long as it did? This was a real stretch to get things back to the Conjuring. Not sure if the Farmiga sisters appearing in both helped. Her acting here is good, but I was almost expecting that somehow she'd morph into Lorraine Warren.Set expectations low and you'll be okay with an, at best, mediocre horror flick",The Nun

I felt like it was inspired by Evil Dead (which is in fact a good movie, and a movie I like a lot.) it just didn't match this film and story.

How can the demon be in two places at once? The nun was killing the girl but the demon was actually in Frenchie. Then she seals the gate but it remained in Frenchie? I don't understand.
Too many zombie type scares. Cgi was over done in my opinion. Just make up would have been scarier. The nun moving slow and not speaking was what made it terrifying in Conjuring.

Settled in 1952, in Romania, a priest and a nun are sent to investigate a serious case of suicide in a church, where dark demons are awaiting them. Coming from The COnjuring 2, i was expecting a lot from this movie, but sadly it doesn't deliver. Though it can be scary at times, most of them are cheap jumpscares with no buildup whatsoever, and the scary atmosphere is non-existent. Also, the story can be confusing at times and sometimes there are scenes that don't go anywhere. The acting is really strong, especially from Taissa Farmiga, but in the other hand the characters are really underdeveloped and sometimes feel bland. Overall, you will enjoy this movie if you are just looking for a couple of scares and some laughs, but if you are expecting the quality of the previous movies in the Conjuring Universe you might not enjoy it.Final Grade: C",The Nun
243,jerralagbayani,Better than Annabelle but yet a major step-down,6,26 September 2018,"When I heard they were making this movie I was pretty interested, especially because The Nun seemed so creative and tormentful, but when I saw the trailer I sort of gave half of my hopes up. The movie didn't help though, either.I'll start with the goods and then the bads.
I must say it did have a few good jumpscares and moments that leave you on edge, especially the beginning of the film that had attempted to set the standards; and the entirety of the movie felt mystical in some ways. And I understand why it had seemed so different from the other Conjuring Films, it had more spirituallity which meant we'd be diving deeper into the realm of darkness than a haunted house, possessed doll, or possessed girl. It was Valaks realm, which meant she could tamper and play with them all she wanted, and all I can say in the least context is that it is later revealed exactly what went down.What I very much was displeased about is how and why the woman has her powers and the origin story of Valak. I can't say much about the origin story but it seemed to much in fantasy than reality, also in the film the main woman protagonist has a supernatural ability that isn't explained. And overall a lot of the film felt dull and slow and lacking a reason to keep going with the movie, presenting us with a constant message that ""she is there"" but only showing us glimpses of her from time to time for no reason until the climax(so I guess that's a little on the bright side).By the way there is quite literally almost no bad language like all the Conjuring Films, no sexuality or nudity, brief violence/gore, and a jumpscares warning for those of weak hearts.I believe this film can learn from it's mistakes like Annabelle did and move on with another sequel focusing on a new cast of characters with a new problem to pose. I will be waiting if a Nun sequel ever hits theaters and hope to see more from The Conjuring Universe.",The Nun

Of course, this speaks more of a distrust of economic activity, and a veneration of the religious life. With ""The Nun"" however, we have an abbey of nuns, in Romania no less, that has definitely been corrupted by evil. I'm not familiar with the ""Conjuring Universe"" franchise, nor am I a frequent viewer of horror films like some reviewers on this site, but ""The Nun"" was reasonably well done, had the appropriately gloomy sets, and had a pervasively ominous atmosphere. True, there were logic pitfalls in the plot, and the ""Frenchie"" character was somewhat anomalous, but I enjoyed this movie.Admittedly, cliches abound in this film. We have somber music, a darkly-lit abbey, fleeting, indistinct images (to heighten our imagination), superstitious, frightened townspeople (not unlike the usual peasants), an abbey that totally locks up at night and stays that way until sunrise, Latin incantations, and the usual revelation at the end that maybe the evil is not completely vanquished after all. We find these cliches often in horror filmmaking because, let's face it, they work (again and again) for most of us. One cliche I wouldn't mind being altered is the ""character,"" both physical and spiritual, of the evil demon(s). Instead of physically repulsive creatures possessed of violent fury, why not have an evil being who is coldly austere, strictly self-contained, totally amoral, and cunningly manipulative. Now he / she would be dangerous in a different way, not unlike Satan and his temptations.",The Nun
252,Kristamw,Good Beginnings of The Nun's story,8,10 September 2018,"Another winner from producer James Wan (Insidious, The Conjuring, Annabelle). This is a serious dark film that explores the origin of the nun, whose likeness we first see in Ed Lorraine's painting in The Conjuring 2. The Nun is set in 1950's Romania, twenty years earlier, with the main setting in a monastery. A priest and a young nun have been asked by the Vatican to investigate the grounds after an apparent suicide by a nun in order to determine whether the abbey still sits on holy ground.
Character Development: This movie is plot-based rather than character driven. Sister Irene, the young nun, is played by Taissa Farmiga (of the awesome comedy pledge to 80's horror The Final Girls). Her character is the epitome of humility as she assists Father Burke on this treacherous journey. The young man, Frenchie, who discovers the deceased nun, plays a part in their navigation and offers some comic relief in the midst of a dark and faith-challenging venture.
Pacing/Writing Quality: Well done. This a rare horror film that addresses the name Jesus Christ and His power.
Content (sex, language & violence): No sex. Minimal language. Lots of scary violence, though mostly dealing with sudden lunging and snatching, typical of horror films.
Spirituality: Unique to horror films, The Nun acknowledges Jesus Christ multiple times and uses His ultimate sacrifice in a spiritually compelling way that is quite amazing to see in Hollywood.
Scare Factor: 8/10 I did jump a couple of times, but the scares are more about situational context rather than outright jump fests. Other scary movies offer more frights, but the ones utilized here are of a different variety, so, they are unique in many ways; there is one scene reminiscent of Insidious.",The Nun

The subtle scares, the ones that really build tension, were few and in between. They were scary, but the scenes didn't last long enough to leave any lasting tension. The jump scares happened way to often, and it's one of the bullets in the gun that killed this movie. A character like The Nun needs to stay in the shadows, creep behind your back, and be the presence that you feel less than you see. Movies like this also need some sort of comic relief, but the comedy was just a tad too much. It released too much tension. If you want to make a true scary movie, don't give people time to recover from one scene to another. Or, give people false hope and then lay it on them again. This movie felt like it was made for people who want to see a scary movie, but don't love being scared. The acting was good, and so was the story. In the end though it failed to deliver the one major thing it was supposed to: Scares.",The Nun

It is pretty good. The main problem is that there are story flaws, elements in the plot that need to be explained but end up not being explained.

275,jpasols,Not Scary in the Slightest! But Not Bad Either!,8,10 May 2019,"The Nun (2018) is the spin off movie to 2016's 'The Conjuring 2' which introduced audiences to the demonic nun, Valak (Valac). Now they bring us her own movie titled 'The Nun' which is overall the 5th Conjuring movie in The Conjuring Universe. I gotta say, this film is nowhere NEAR scary like The Conjuring 1 and 2 and Annabelle Creation. This film had no scare factor to it what so ever but that doesnt stop it from being an entertaining horror flick! This film really reminded me of 80s supernatural horror films like Poltergeist, Pet Sematary, etc. This film had many elements that those films did. But those elements didn't work for this film if you wanted it to be scary. Because it isnt scary. But it is entertaining! Entertaining because it keeps you engaged with the story and easter eggs to other Conjuring movies, it also has a lot of action in it. This movie isnt a slow burner like The Conjuring 1 and 2. This movie jumps right into it and you're entertained and engaged since the opening scene to the epic finale of the film. Dont really have much more I want to touch on with this film besides what I already mentioned. I do love how the ending of this movie tied in nicely with The Conjuring 1 where we show Frenchie possessed by Valak and Ed and Lorraine Warren trying to exorcise him (like on their video they were showing a class in the first movie). Very nice easter egg right there. This film wasnt worth the watch for theaters but makes for a perfect indoor Friday night thriller movie. I'd say check it out if you dont have anything else on you're schedule...or TV. Not a bad movie but not the best either. I didn't catch this one in the theater so I just waited to the bluray to come out. But in my eyes this is a highly entertaining horror flick with some cheese. I recommend to hardcore horror fans like me, not so much for regular movie goers though.My final rating for The Nun: 8 out of 10",The Nun

But even by my low standards ""The Nun"" was a great disappointment. Every bit of the film was predictable and cliche (even then one French guy was named Moris...) and to be honest in many cases I didn't like the lights that were used.On a positive note ""The Nun"" was very atmospheric and most of the time the sound effects were pretty much great!

The first five minutes or so of the film are incredibly good, it really pulls you in, sadly after that opening, everything starts falling apart, due to badly placed comedic moments that end up border lining with parody. Music was great, scenery too, nontheless, when a viewer notices and only cares about such details, then something must be amiss.

281,ksharath1999,Satisfying but could have been more Horrific,6,26 September 2021,"Spinoff of the most creepy character from Conjuring Universe centered around a death investigation was personally satisfying. It deserves praise for its spooky catholic church setting and its outskirts on which the story progresses. Dark and gritty opening sequence that connects directly to the credit scene of Anabelle creation adds to the major highlight of the movie. Jump Scares are the core of the movie and all the horror aspect is centered around it especially the ones after 40 minutes was shocking. Suprising twists, BGM and efficient usage of its short runtime adds to the pro factor of The Nun. Last but not the least the solid acting performances of the lead actors Taissa Farmiga and Demian Bechir succeds in carrying the movie.There are no particular cons worth mention in the movie other than over reliance of jump scares for horror sequences and the last act ending that is bit of B Grade sequence compared to rest of the movie. Underutilisation of Bonnie Arrows figure too adds to the movie's small list of cons.The Nun in the end feels like a satisfying movie from Conjuring Universe which still could have been much more.Rating:66%",The Nun

290,brandon_veracka,A Watch-Checking Sleep Fest,5,14 June 2019,"This film looks great, the sound is very solid, and the set pieces helped add a nice atmosphere, and most of all, Taissa Farmiga's acting was excellent. These traits couldn't save it from poor execution though, and it's just not a movie I'd recommend to anyone aside from the most dedicated fans of the ""Insidious"" saga. Although the beginning is pretty strong, the predictability of the story and how it unfolds is just awful. Before anything happens, you see it coming a mile away. Jump scares are used to a fault. The CGI castle-convent looks very silly in some scenes, and since this is supposed to take place in the real world, it's not a believable locale.On that subject, the fact that they chose to have the film take place in Romania was a cool idea (if not very unoriginal), but the execution was awful in that respect. They went out of their way to go to Romania, yet they did not cast a single Romanian, and nothing in the film took advantage of the natural beauty of the country. Almost the entire film takes place in a fairly small set with no dynamics - it's all forcefully dark and dreary, and in a very fake way. Romania is a beautiful country, and they blew a great opportunity to showcase some beautiful architecture and countryside.To make the long review just a little longer, this movie was a big disappointment. The demonic nun in the painting in the previous film ""Insidious: The Last Key"" (?) was scary. That character could've been used to great effect in combination with the naturally mysterious and enchanting backdrop of Romania, but it wasn't. Even Taissa Farmiga's stunning beauty and talent as an actor couldn't save this film from a total lack of visual dynamics, good supporting actors, a decent setting, and most of all, creativity.",The Nun
291,sbulgacs,Don't think some of these negative reviewers saw the film.,8,4 November 2018,"Having been a horror movie fan all my life I'm not understanding the negative reviews. What we have here is another big budget movie in the Conjuring universe. The Conjuring movies are all well thought out layered films, which achieve different levels of success with the effectiveness of the delivery of the horror. With this instalment they build on the ""action"" aspects served up at the end of the Conjuring 2. The second half of the movie is basically exorcists having a punch up with the demon. Or an extended version of the final scenes of the Conjuring 2. Now I acknowledge the first half had a lot of jump scares but it was all building up to the 2nd half action showdown. It's my opinion if they had gone for a protracted build up, say more like Annabelle, the 2nd half quite simply wouldn't have worked, as the atmosphere change would have been too jarring.There's so much bad budget horror done on a shoestring nowadays I don't even get why fellow horror fans would be disparaging this superior effort. The cinematography is fantastic as is the soundtrack. The first half of the movie makes several nods to other films the most noticeable being both versions of Nosferatu. Out of the Conjuring movies I would say this is the 2nd best after Conjuring 1. If you think this movie is terrible. you aint no real horror fan.",The Nun

I liked the characters and would have like to see them in other movies! The scenes were cool and didn't rely on gallons of blood or lame CGI effects.The Bad: the plot. What exactly was the demon's plan exactly? Bore us to death with jump scares? It worked.The Ugly: I know the director wanted build up the symbolism, but a license plate on the truck? Why? Did the demon go down to the Romanian DMV, stand in line for a license plate? The upside down cross us a lame trope. The so called upside down cross is a a St. Peter's cross or the Petrine cross. With all the talent couldn't they think of something new? At the end of the movie the demon nun possessed Frenchy. He jumped into the Holy water filled with Jesus's blood (no problem), then her gave the nun mouth-to-mouth (who still had the blood in her mouth)...so how was he still possessed?It's an okay movie as long as you don't think about the plot holes.",The Nun

294,zanghi_james,"Not sure if I liked it or didn't, but it was entertaining",2,16 October 2019,"For those who don't know, The Conjuring horror cinematic universe is a horror franchise that is considerably popular and considered to be one of the better horror franchises that came out of recent years. This is technically the first film in the franchise.True, it does get a little heavy with the Religious Messages, mainly saying that Jesus and his father who art in heaven are the only way and that if you don't follow the teachings of the Catholics, you're screwed. Nevertheless, I enjoyed about 90 percent of the film, and yes, I agree, there are quite a few horror movie clichés packed into this film. But, I like cliché if it is done right.Much like the other Conjuring films, this is a time-period piece instead of being set in modern day like the majority of Blumhouse's films. I've always enjoyed horror films that are set in different times, so that's a victory for the Nun there. I also think it is cool that they actually filmed in Romania at an actual castle. Nice touch there, too.The acting is nothing to crow about. Don't expect Oscar-worthy performances, but there is a bit of chemistry between some of the characters which helps. Also, I like how they tie it into the main Conjuring films with cameos by Ed and Lorraine Warren at the end and the beginning of the film.The imagery and camera-work is one of the major things I loved about this film. Usually these days, horror films are made as found-footage or with handheld cameras. The Nun seems to have camera-work that has a distinct Kubrickian feel to it, most notably in his work in Clockwork Orange and The Shining. There are some really iconic shots in this film.The score by Abel Korzeniowski is nicely atmospheric, as well, and fits the heavy feeling of dread in the air over the Saint Carta Abbey.Finally, there are a lot of Jump Scares in this film. If you like them, then this might just be one of the better jump-scare movies for you. I knew they were coming, but they still made me jump a little.I'd say all in all, I'm divided about the Nun with its slightly conservative Catholic Propaganda message, but the camera-work, music, and scares seem to make up for it. At any rate, the year of 2020 seems to be shaping up to be the year of the Conjuring since here on imdb it claims that there will be at least three Conjuring films out in the same year (The Crooked Man, The Nun 2, and The Conjuring Three). Don't expect Suspiria or The Exorcist when watching this film, but don't expect it to disappoint at times, either.May the Force be with you!",The Nun

This was never marketed as anything other than a scary movie so as a scary movie freak this was completely up my alley and I came away more than satisfied. I loved the simplicity of the plot: basically a very powerful demon named Valak previously sealed by the blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ, after being conjured up by the original owner, a baron who practiced witchcraft, was accidentally released during WW2 because the monastery was bombed. Valak was able to take any form and that's why it chose to be a nun. The scares were in all the right places and were enough to make me think 'awesome'.

Some scary scenes are predictable, if you've seen Conjuring, Insidious, and Annabelle.Confusing genre-inconsistent tone: the pace and scenes juggle awkwardly between slow, suspenseful psychological thriller, and random gory jump scares.

309,LegendsofHorror,Movie Review: The Nun (2018),4,14 September 2018,"I just got back from seeing what I thought would be a great and scary addition to THE CONJURING series, especially considering how
they introduced her charcater in the second entry in the franchise. Even though the nun herself was a fictional figure it was definately
one of the great scare points of the second film. That being said, I was looking forward to her first stand alone film, I even had high 
hopes when I heard that Corin Hardy was directing it & James Wan was attached.Corin Hardy wrote and directed 'The Hallow' back in 2015 which was a great original piece of horror cinema. That wasn't the case in this film,
Hardy only directed which was a waste due to his writing talent would have benefitted this film. The writing was the only problem I had with this film, it had some great elements of dread in it as well as great theological aspects to add to the story. The characters were introduced 
and were placed nicely and were cast in my opinion perfectly, but for a film that carries such horror and dread the humour was spread a bit much
so much in fact that it detoured and took away from the horror of the film. Speaking of the horror or I should say lack of, that was another issue
I had problems with...that being said:The film starts off superbly atmospheric and very dark, as you would expect considering who the film is about. It opens in the mountains of Romania in 1952, the dilapidated 
gothic nunnery is where we are introduced to two nuns who willing unleash THE NUN'S unholy wrath for some reason which we are never explained. This ritual leads to the death and suicides
of the two women which attracts the attention of the Catholic Church who send off a investigator - Father Burke (played by Demián Bichir of Dom Hemingway) and a postulant, which 
is a nun who has yet to take her vows - Sister Irene (played by AHS's Taissa Farmiga). Once in Romania, they meet our comedy aspect of the film ""Frenchie"" 
(played by Jonas Bloquet of Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets) who is the young man who accompanies them into the so-called pit of hell which sadly never rears its ugly face. 
Thankfully, we are blessed with the return of Bonnie Aarons (who originally played The Nun in the Conjuring 2), sadly though her part is short due to we don't see much in her in 
the film but the scenes that she is in she does her best as a daemonic nun that we all loved so much. I feel that they focused more on the other characters and not the nun as much 
as they should have.Another thing was the various cliched jump scares and the humour that sorely was not needed, like I said before the film itself could have been a full on in your face scarefest 
but it was as if the writer wanted to play it safe. I will say this there is a nice lil twist about midway that was somewhat enjoyable and added much to the film, but the ending 
once again was textbook and downplayed. There was so much potential and direction that the film could have gone in, THE NUN could have been another horror icon of this generation...Sadly, she'll never wear her habit again....unless you watch The Conjuring 2.",The Nun

312,rolandjordaan2,The Nun - Spoiler Free Review,4,14 September 2018,"'The Conjuring' franchise has been very hit and miss, with the original still being undoubtedly one of the best horror films of the last decade, with none of the sequels or spin-offs coming anywhere near the quality of that film; actually, most of them have been pretty awful. For 'The Nun' though, I had a little bit of hope, maybe I'm just becoming soft in my old age, but there was something about the marketing that drew me in and made me believe that this might be the spin-off to recapture that raw and original feeling of the original. And you know what, for the first act of this film, I still believed that, I was actually feeling very involved in this film, the back story was interesting, the scenery was atmospheric, the pace was steady and intense...and then it continued... (insert Markus face here). The basic plot is simple, the year is 1952, a nun in Romania is chased by a demon and hangs herself to escape getting possessed. Her body is later discovered by a French/Canadian man who calls himself 'Frenchie', portrayed by Jonas Bloquet. Hearing of the suicide, the Vatican sends our Father Burke (Demián Bichir) to investigate the suicide, for reasons never made clear, they con him into taking along Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), a young nun who has not yet taken her vows. The casting of Taissa Farmiga is an odd choice here; the first and most obvious problem, she looks almost identical to her real life sister, Vera Farmiga - you know, the woman who plays Lorraine Warren in 'The Conjuring', this was ridiculously distracting. I actually spent the majority of the film believing that she's simply playing a younger version of that character, and you cannot believe how annoyed I was when this resemblance turned out to mean nothing more than Vera obviously owing her little sister a favour. What's more though, Taissa simply doesn't have the acting chops to pull off this character, don't get me wrong, I find the actress charming, loved her as the average American girl in 'American Horror Story' and I felt that same charm when her character is first introduced here, giving a rather insightful debate on how people view The Bible. Unfortunately though, the second act requires her to carry several scenes all by herself and she just isn't a strong enough actress to pull that off. You might recall that in my 'Annabelle: Creation' review, I mentioned something about the lead child actor taking obvious lessons from 'The Shawnee Smith School of Acting' where the actress portrays fear on screen by constantly bulging her eyes out...I guess I now owe an apology to her, as this just seems to be how this franchise directs young actresses into looking scared - stop! The one thing that does work with Taissa in this role is a pretty decent chemistry with Jonas Bloquet - this guy is by far the best part of this film, the character is fun, some of his one liners work, this was a character I actually cared about...then comes the second act and they send him away to wait in a pub until they need him again (no seriously, that's literally what happens); so Jonas leaves and the movie falls flat, leaving us with only Taissa and Demián Bichir, whom I really wanted to like, but his character just felt too wooden. The titular nun is there too, but is given almost nothing to do and, regardless of what the title suggests, this really isn't her story. And therein lies the biggest problem with this film, I'm sure as a two line synopsis, this concept could have looked rather appealing on paper, then someone started writing a script and realised that a demonic nun simply isn't enough to write a whole movie around, and trying to fill that gap, they simply lose the plot - you want to know what 'The Nun' really is? It's 'Supernatural: Season 5' without Sam and Dean, that's this movie, and 'Supernatural' just did it waaaay better. Although the film gets the majority of the first act rather spot on, it loses it's way rather quickly, the second act is slow, rather tedious at times, filled with fake out jump scares and there is simply no chemistry between the remaining characters. The third act gets even worse though, with the slow pacing of the second abruptly replaced with so much happening on screen that it not only becomes hard to follow, but actually just becomes absurd and borderline unwatchable. It made me sad, because I actually did want to like this film, and, like the 'Annabelle' movies, there were still certain moments I quite enjoyed - a scene with a character getting buried alive is very intense - but those are lost in an ocean of overdone cliches, boring characters and a plot that simply isn't compelling enough to carry an entire film. Disappointing effort, only recommended to die hard fans of the franchise or those who mistook 'Annabelle' for being a quality piece of cinema.",The Nun

316,pinemaples,"Not bad, but still ""nun"" too special.",6,7 September 2018,"As a big fan of The Conjuring, parts 1 and 2, it makes me sad that the spinoff movies never quite live up to the main titles, and The Nun is just the latest example. Taissa Farmiga (interestingly, the sister of Vera Farmiga, one of the two main characters in the proper Conjuring series) plays a great, believable lead character, as do Demián Bichir and Jonas Bloquet. I'd also like to recognize Ingrid Bisu as a standout actress for a minor role. The cast is largely very good, even if almost every other character appears in only one scene. While most of the scares in the first half of the movie largely consist of done-to-death tropes (no pun intended), they fortunately saved their best for the second half, with a few truly unique and unsettling moments, especially at the climax. While said scares can be hit or miss, the visuals and imagery are consistently fantastic and creepy.The biggest problem with the movie, unfortunately, is the plot. It's clear the actors did their best with what they were given, but the behind-the-scenes crew largely did not do them many favors. I don't know whether to blame the director, writers, or editors. Some camera cuts and story moments made no sense, some outdoor scenes were dark when I was sure it was supposed to be daytime, and many scenes just left me in utter confusion. One element in particular felt entirely out of place in a Conjuring movie, and would surely have been more at home with Indiana Jones. Two more revelations were completely shoehorned in, leaving me with my head in my hands - not with my mind blown as it should've been, but in disbelief that the writers would set them up so poorly. I can't help but feel like some of the script was rushed and/or edited on the fly, long after shooting had already begun.Despite my complaints with the story, I can't honestly say I didn't enjoy The Nun. No, it's not near the quality of the primary two Conjuring movies. It's not quite up to the standards of Annabelle: Creation either, but at least it's far better than the first Annabelle. You could do a lot worse for an early fall horror movie.",The Nun

What I should have feared was the zombie-like snoring eminating from my fellow patrons, who like me, were casualties of the boredom this film inflicted. The plot is shoddy and if you are hoping to see the nun in her uncorrupted form and learn her back story, forget it. The cloister setting is good and it had all the ingredients for success but was let down by poor writing and a rush to cash in on what is arguably the most frightening film character this century.

While it took place in a monastery, nothing that took place had any biblical significance. Rather, it seemed more video game based.

It´s horror story of demonic nun which was in film the Conjurning too. She is now in the Romania monastery. Nuns which live in this monastery has one scary secret. Romania need help from American church.
The character of priest Bruke is interesting because he is very brave, inteligent and he knows about lots of examples like that. Irene is intelinent and brave too but I think that really young for fight with ghost. And Frenchie he is funny and liar but he is helpfull too.

I don't mind the jump scares found in popcorn horror, but there is very little creativity stringing the scares together. In my opinion Frenchie and perhaps even Father Burke were so underwritten they became unecessary. It would have been interesting to see the young nun try to solve the mystery completely alone from within the convent. The other characters add very little interest and contribute even less to problem solving, only in superficial ways that could have easily been written differently.

It also had a hold of our young lady hero numurous times but never just killed her .. Shes was thrown or had her face massaged .. It was so lazy..

I loved the eerie Darth Vader like theme everytime Valak entered the scenes.It was dark, eerie, and did it's job in telling what Valak was and did in the past before the events of The Conjuring tho that part of the movie admittedly was a bit weak it more then made up for it with atmosphere. I'll ignore a few plot holes and the Priest wasn't much use for someone that was supposed to be a kick ass Excorcist.

You'll remember her from 'American Horror Story', and her older sister is Vera Farmigo from the Conjuring films. There were plenty of jump scares in the film, and I think that's why most people go. But the hardcore horror fans have already deemed this film as boring, so you'll need to decide if you should see this based on people you've met and trusted on the internet who evaluate films. I'm easy to please with horror films, so I'm a happy customer. This film reminded me of the Christopher Lee 'Dracula' films from the '60's.Other actors you should watch in this film include: Bonnie Aarons who played the demon nun, and Ingrid Biru, who played Sister Oana.

354,drhoads-93743,Borderline Straight to Netflix,3,9 September 2018,"I didn't say it was straight to Netflix. I said borderline.First, too many 40-year-old clichés to count. -Something vaguely scary pops out and attacks someone; close-up on their face; they stumble backwards into another monster-type of cliché, like into some pit or against a door where...monster arms break through the door and grab them. Painfully cheesy.
-Monster growls loudly at someone...so it magically knocks them into the air and against the wall.
-Monster pops out in some scary sequence and protagonist wakes up with a gasp.
-Fake-looking fog on the ground in some scenes for no reason other than to make it look eerie.
-Jumps scares (that weren't scary.)
-Totally Hollywooded Catholic stuff. Compare this to the far superior cousin film The Conjuring, where the protagonists are Catholic but much more realistic people. By contrast, the characters in The Nun are generic Hollywooded versions of religious people.
-We see the monster in the mirror or behind someone, the person turns around and the monster is gone. WooooOoo. Scary.That's just a small handful.The directing was really bad. Acting was below average. The pacing was terrible. No build-up. And here's the worst part: the surprise scary monster that's supposed to terrify us...WE ALREADY HAVE SEEN CLOSE UP ON THE PROMO POSTER FOR THE PAST YEAR!!! It's like... uhhh, yeah, we've seen her. Yeah. We know what she looks like. She roars, knocks the person backwards or tries to strangle someone and that's it. There were also some really cheesy lines that were meant for comic relief, but they ended up just being laughably stupid.There were a couple upsides to this film:-If you're a fan of the Conjuring, you'll have a nice little aha moment at the end. Not amazing, but still kinda fun.
-There were a couple shots of the monster that looked good. It was hard to tell if it was CGI or good makeup.Overall, just save your money and don't see it. If you really like a few cheap jump scares and typical ""monster battle"" at the end, just rent it.

365,Yee_Reviews,Horror Film for Amateurs (Teens),5,5 September 2018,"Good: The setting of an abbey helps create the dark and haunting tone of the movie. The creepy atmosphere built with dim lights and fog help set the mood. Because of the atmosphere and mood there is great suspense for the first few scares, but with too much repetition of jump scares, the tension starts to dissipate...Bad: This film is a jump-scare fest. The writing lacks substance and ends up being a poor origin story with: a rushed introduction that comes off as choppy, a messy middle with little plot consisting of jump scares that become exhausting and predictable because of its abundance, and a bizarre and over the top ending. The characters are wooden and over the course of the movie do not show much dynamic. Throughout the movie, there is cheesy comedy and forced romance.Overall: Bring James Wan back for even though this film could have no way been on the same level as ""The Conjuring"" and ""The Conjuring 2"" it still could have been fresh in the right hands. To me, Gary Dauberman's writing has not shined for I felt both Annabelle movies were subpar and I believe he is getting too much credit for ""It"" when he revised the script and the material was based on a book. The characters were underdeveloped, uninteresting, and lacked emotion. This movie is purely for those who only care about jump scares and have a lack of care for acting, direction, and a good story. This serves as a Halloween flick to entertain the squeamish teenagers who rate a movie based on jump scares and a scary nun.

367,meganmarie-19902,Deserves NUN of the criticism,5,18 November 2018,"After hearing that The Nun was the fifth instalment in The Conjuring Universe, I was excited to see how it would relate to either Annabelle or The Conjuring. This time around we are blessed with the ""Demonic Nun"" Valek, that haunted us in The Conjuring 2. The Nun is a spin-off from The Conjuring 2 but the ending of the film links heavily to the first film that kick-started this billion-dollar franchise. The film doesn't deserve the negative reviews it has been given, okay the jump scares are lame but putting those aside it fits in nicely with the franchise. Set predominantly in darkness, among graveyards, catacombs and churches give it the tense, deep dark suspense alive, especially with the lack of narrative.
Set in 1952 Romania, an abbey is being haunted by a demonic presence, leading to a young nun taking her own life. Troubled Father Burke and a nun in her training, Sister Irene, are sent to Romania to investigate the situation and the pair team up with the merchant, ""Frenchie"", who found the body. The trio begins to notice the nuns are acting strangely within the abbey and soon realize that an evil spirit is trapped within wanting to take human form to escape. Father Burke, Sister Irene, and Frenchie put their lives and souls on the line to rid the abbey and save the nuns from the powerful dark forces. Yes, the film is missing the sprinkles of delight James Wan gives us, but overall it is a decent horror and shouldn't be missed, especially if you have seen the first four.",The Nun
368,flyswm,Pretty bad movie but still kinda fun,5,29 June 2020,"This was fun but there are definitely some issues.1) acting bad. Acting real bad. The main 3 characters are not believable at all, but especially the main female. I think she was only hired because her sister plays Lorraine Warren in the other movies.2) plot? No. No plot. What is the purpose of this movie? Backstory for the creepy nun? Doesn't really deliver on that.3) scenery and aesthetic? Best part of the movie. Very creepy, very atmospheric. Well done.4) scares? Predictable and not really scary. But honestly do you come to the conjuring franchise for the scares? Cause they used them all up about halfway through the first movie and the rest is repetition.Overall it was pretty fun but not a great movie by any means. I don't regret watching it, but it's unlikely I'll see it again.",The Nun

370,Sky_Flowersoul,The Nun,3,18 October 2019,"There are seemingly stuffed animals in the film, but they are not scary for two reasons. First, there is no plot and emotional attachment, so what is happening on the screen is the same. The second - literally after each frightening scene, you can insert the phrase ""so what?"". The cross turned over 180 degrees and caught fire - so what? A snake crawled out of the girl's mouth - so what? A crowd of nuns was thrown on the wall - so what? The sinister nun prayed, then disappeared - and so what? Any nonsense that should scare can be described by this phrase, so it does not scare.

I believe that movie may have been one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The Nun, of course, being a sort of prequel to the Conjuring. Before I get to the horrific nature that was this movie. There is an interesting trivia fact some may not know about the main actress in the Nun. She is the daughter of the woman who played in the Conjuring. She played a younger version of that character in the Nun. I honestly don't know how to start describing how truly awful this movie was, however. First of all, the actual character of the Nun was about as scary as the Easter Bunny. They make her look and act so much scarier in the trailers than what she was like in the movie. The storyline really goes nowhere. Farmiga does her best, but only comes off looking like a deer in headlights for most of the movie. The set design was way too over the top. It was like they were trying to hard to make it scary, but it just came off comical. I actually found myself dozing off a few times during the movie. I am a huge movie buff and sleeping during a movie is not something I ever do. Believe me, I was being nice giving it a 3/10.",The Nun

Later I realized that everything about this movie is wrong, wrong cast, wrong characters, wrong sound effects, wrong score, wrong cinematography.The only thing they got right are the end credits.Note to the directors/casting of the movie: If you're going to cast a French Canadian character, hire a French Canadian actor. Regular French (or in this case Belgian) people can't nail the accent quite right and specifically this guy was hilarious to the point that about 20 minutes in we were wondering if it was a comedy or a horror movie.Neither his French, nor English accents are credible but my favorite part comes when he says ""French Canadian"" before imbibing the ""nun"" with a relic.

376,masonbingley2000,"Jumpy, tense and sometimes predictable.",7,21 September 2018,"The Nun was a film I was most excited for since last year and although it wasn't the best film of the franchise, it delivered scares, thrills and action like I expected. First of all, I feel like the cast was well-suited to the film. I appreciated the relation of Taissa Farmiga to Vera Farmiga and automatically thought that this could've been something they used to their advantage. The rest of the cast was decent enough, but nobody really offered a spell-binding performance, and nobody had a particularly strong/well-developed story. Having said that, I didn't expect very detailed character arcs anyway because I simply wanted to be scared and as I sat in a surround sound cinema with a wall to wall and ceiling to floor screen, this was quite an easy triumph. I definitely recommend paying that little bit extra to get the best experience out of this if at all possible. After all, the scares are what keep it going as it does seem quite predictable as the story develops. It isn't quite as shocking as it wanted to be. There are some twists however, ones more significant than others that really do impress.As far as The Conjuring franchise goes, The Nun is definitely not the strongest, but probably on par with that of Annabelle. It is a good film if you want to jump a lot, but not if you're looking for an in-depth psychological horror. Fortunately, I wanted the former.",The Nun

380,diaju_vampprincess,Hollywood has lost its taste,3,8 September 2018,"The Nun, a supposed-to-be spectacular spin-off prequel from the Conjuring universe, but failed miserably.
The movie lost its identity. I don't really know what's the genre. Yes it contains ghost or devil or evil spirit, yes the ambiance is dark, yes it involves priest and church, but what is it really? As far as i know, a spirit or a devil or a ghost is nebulous, so it won't affect anything when you shoot or stab them. But, here, you can shoot it to death. I mean, a ghost - who already a dead form of a living - would be dead. A dead who die. And the form of the ghost or the spirit is more like zombies or monster, who had a solid form where you can touch and stab them, again, to death. The genre perhaps horror, but although it tried to deliver the thrilling nuance with a lot of jump scare, but it wouldn't be a scary surprise anymore if you meet ""the nun"" in every corner you take, and the jump scare is too much. So yeah, it fails to be horror. The movie is not scary at all. Not even once. The plot is cheesy, try to give a riddle and a little twist but it's easily predicted. The scenario is cheesy, you'd know what's gonna be the joke. This is a disappointment, with such a hype from the Conjuring universe, especially with all the positive review about spooky Valak from Conjuring 2.

385,somlaign1,Don't understand the hate.,9,8 September 2018,"I went into this movie not expecting much due to the overwhelming gripe about it having too many jump scares. I don't find that to be true at all. As a matter of fact, there were many tense moments leading up to the real scare. The only thing I do agree with is that the Nun could use a little less growl and a little more ""ghostly"" element. And there were one or two scenes where the CGI was obvious. But otherwise, it had plenty of scary scenes, not just filled with uneventful moments. Contrary to what others are saying, Conjuring 1 and 2 had way more jump scares and loud obnoxious sounds, so I don't really know why people are comparing this to the number of jump scares that Conjuring 1 and 2 ""supposedly"" don't have. Overall, I liked this and thought that it was scary enough. I really wish that Hollywood gets that jump scares are so overdone and lame, and that they would start taking notes from The Ring and the first Michael Myers where he just stalks you and gets up from behind you while you're not looking, those types are things are way creepier.",The Nun
386,blatherskitenoir,"Gorgeous sets, oddly action-y",6,8 September 2018,"The closest I can get to describing the type, tone, and feeling of the Nun, would be to say it's as if the films Solomon Kane and Black Death (2010) had a child, and then they dipped the baby in horror and wrapped it in a nun's habit of Catholic mysticism and ritual, then sent it to day care in a freaky, Romanian castle.
The Nun is definitely reminiscent of high fantasy/ medieval au, action-adventure type films, despite being set in the 1950's. The protagonists rely more on weapons, like axes or fire, than on exorcisms and faith, and the enemies more on physical force and numbers, than whispering in your ear. There are occasional funny bits and flashy, dramatic demons. Why have everyday, creeping horrors, when you can have a teeming portal to hell in the catacombs of a Renaissance-Gothic castle, opened by a mad man and mass human sacrifice eons ago during the Dark Ages?
This is not to say the Nun isn't scary. It is heavy on the horror, and heavy on the terrifying atmosphere, nearly choking on the gorgeous, gloomy visuals of the setting. The setting is every horror film's dream. There is something innately frightening about cloisters, and the silent sisters gliding through the shadows are deeply disturbing. There will be moments when you are truly scared. However, the barest drops of campiness tend to pollute the gloom at the worst times.
All of the actor performances are well done and enjoyable. Taissa Farmiga and Jonas Bloquet are particularly charming. 
The film's biggest flaw is the presence of multiple story threads, all of which wear thin in places, and none of which are brought together make a fully satisfying whole. There are plot holes which, while not egregious, will niggle and annoy, and many things aren't explained to complete satisfaction, or make full sense. For example: if an entire cloister of nuns, a medieval Vatican army, a priest trained as an official exorcist and miracle hunter, and the blood of Christ combined aren't enough to permanently destroy the demon (not a spoiler, you know the thing is in the other movies), how in the world did Ed and Lorraine Warren manage it alone decades later in the Conjuring II?

Was there a story that needed to be told? The best part of the whole movie was the ending scene where they showed Ed and Lorraine talking about this curse, because it reminded me of what a decent movie actually looks like. And also it made me realize that The nun just did not need to happen at all, there was absolutely no value in this film, no new and interesting information etc. Even the nun itself wasn´t scary anymore, it roared for pete´s sake.The actors - uhm yeah...maybe sister Irene was kind of okay. But as I said - the nun itself was absolutely horrible and not in a good way. I mean I laughed when there were close-ups of the nun. I think you´re not supposed to laugh during a horror movie unless they intended to make a joke.And the scare-factor? Well unless you are totally new to horror movies then I just can´t see how you could´ve been scared of anything they showed in that movie. To me most of the ""scary"" parts were laughable, unlogical and very poorly executed. I am truly sorry I ever saw this movie at all, it ruined the ""nun-factor"".",The Nun

so that's the time which you feel some fear and more attracted in the movie and that's really amazing...But, beside them, sometimes somethings go wrong and make these kinds of movies to experience an unwanted lacking...The Nun is one of them, which made me really amazed and I liked it, but there were lack of something in that, like ""not having a unite storyline and jumping too much for some scenes....but totally That was a good experience!",The Nun

390,davidsaid,Oh dear,6,1 November 2018,"When they announced this movie i was hoping that it would be a corker. I thought this has to be the ultimate premise for a horror movie. The image of the demon nun in The conjuring 2 (which i believe to be an incredible horror movie) was so gut wrenchingly scary that i couldnt imagine a film with this character could be any less that terrifying. Yes its the perfect evil character but it will only stand if the film gives it the platform to thrive in.Im not entirely sure why it didnt work other than the editing felt poor, the characters didnt move from scene to scene smoothly, there were too many jumps; as if there were shots missing, elements removed. It could have done with a heftier backstory, perhaps we could have witnessed a bit more of the terror the nuns had been through while guarding the abbey.The ending sequence was certainly gripping and visually effective but the drive towards the climax was insufficent and it felt like ones of those endings that arrived before you realised it and was gone in a flash. In other words a lack of tension to leave me gasping.So in conclusion a very disappointing and truly forgetful film, perhaps when i revisit it in a few years i might find something more to enjoy. However it felt like a film with great potential but not enough vision to capture the entire story.

I am one of the few peoples, as I see, who really liked all of The Conjuring series but the NUN most of them. The NUN has a prehistory, this is one of the characteristics of the horror movie that catch me from the first minutes of it. It is interesting, It is mysterious and in the end, when the flipped cross appears on the Frenchie's neck has a deep meaning on it. That while there is a god no one can stop the devil's existence no matter how hard one tries or whose blood uses. also, the appealing thing for me was that the well known Warrens, who were real life living exorcists, were performing the exorcism ritual after several yers on Frenchie. Besides all of the mentioned, movie has many interesting and historically true things in it. after this movie you have the feeling that the probability of such things to be true and real is very high and all those legends and myths created during centuries have a base to be created on.One of the best horror of 2018 !",The Nun

Great sound effects throughout the movie, it's not that scary of a movie, but still the lighting and sounds will get you deep into the movie, I would give it a thriller more than horror, as it depends on jump scares, and the thrill to know whats happening next.",The Nun
417,Reelnerd,And then there was Nun,5,11 September 2018,"Reel Review: The Nun
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by Corin Hardy
Starring: Demian Bichir, Taissa Farmiga, Jonas Bloquet
This review is dedicated to my ONT 8 buddies whom I saw the movie with. I had a lot of fun guys. 
 The Nun is the latest chapter in The Conjuring franchise focusing on Valak the demonic entity that (spoilers) is after Ed and Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring 2. This film adds a bit more back story to Valak who is roaming the halls of a Romanian Abbey in the 1950's. The Vatican enlists the aid of a disgruntled Priest Father Burke (Bichir) and a Sister Irene (Farmiga) who has had visions since early childhood to investigate the suicide of a Nun at the Abbey. There is a vague distrust and animosity between Burke and the Vatican hierarchy which is never fully explored.
 In Romania they encounter a guide in the form of a French-Canadian transplant named aptly enough ""Frenchie."" Frenchie serves as the comic relief to an extent in the film and is sort of the stand in for the audience in the film as he tags along with Sister Irene and Father Burke on their investigation. I must say in comparison to the other films in the series this The Nun was a bit of a disappointment. The story was a bit on the weak side and and left a lot of plot holes and questions unanswered. Director Corin Hardy does a nice job of setting up the atmosphere and there are some nice visuals in the film but overall it wasn't enough to elevate the film beyond the by the numbers horror plot and jump scares which weren't all that scary. 
 James Wan as a filmmaker has elevated horror to a new level of respectability among the mainstream populace due to his level of storytelling and creating compelling characters in Ed and Lorraine Warren based on the real life couple who have a historied career in the field of the paranormal. 
 I think ultimately what was lacking in The Nun was the heart and soul of the main films in this shared horror cinematic universe. The Warrens love story drives The Conjuring films and we are invested in what happens to them and the families that they have helped along the way. In The Nun this connection among the characters is missing mainly because the main characters are strangers to one another at the start of the film. 
 The film goes around in circles in terms of its storytelling in terms of certain plot points and character arcs that ultimately go nowhere. I enjoyed the performances of the actors in the film such as Demian Bichir whom I have been a fan of from his work on the FX series The Bridge where he played a Mexican police detective. Taissa Farmiga provides charm as Sister Irene and Jonas Bloquet as Frenchie adds the humor.
 While Wan's Conjuring films takes standard horror movie fare and makes them feel fresh and clever and scary The Nun takes those same tropes and makes them feel like the standard fare that they are. I think Corin Hardy did the best that he could with the script that he was given. There is some pretty cheesy dialogue in this film and the pacing of the film for the first two acts drags a bit. The action picks up in the third act but the film also takes a complete tonal shift from horror to something else altogether. 
 If you are a Conjuring fan then some of the easter eggs and nods to the other films will be fun to lookout for. If you've never seen a film in the franchise then you might get lost and not really be invested in the opening and ending sequences that ties this film to the greater shared cinematic universe. Can I fully recommend this film to a non horror/Conjuring fan? No. If you are a fan on this franchise or horror in general then my answer changes to a maybe. I'm a big fan of The Conjuring franchise but this film fell short of the mark.",The Nun
418,Silvermoviewild,Missing the Wan magic,6,9 September 2018,It's good but could have been better. The Nun is very eerie but the jumps are very predictable and the story drags it's heels. It's almost like dream state due to the girls visions it's hard to get a smooth flow. There are lots of elements that could have worked but didn't and the story became patchy and misguided. It definitely needed a little Wan magic behind the camera. Some really good Easter eggs but fell short off the great ghost stories like The Conjuring.,The Nun
419,fat3773,I really liked it.,10,5 November 2018,"I just dont understand the 5.6 rating, the movie just took a different approach from previous (kinda getting more and more boring) films, i love the choreography of the nuns, it was really scary for me.I like the jumpscares in this movie, which was somewhat kept to a minimal, they were intelligently placed and never been seen before. Unlike james wan's that could lead me to heart attacks.This movie definitely deserves more than 5.6, I even slept in the last conjuring movies, (forgot the title, story about the old lady's childhood). But in the nun, i eagerly watched it until the end.The end.",The Nun
420,ashleyryan-36896,Mediocre at best,4,11 April 2019,"Huge fan on The Conjuring and II, and had the biggest anticipation for this. I'm so glad I didnt go see it at the theater though, as I wouldve left super disappointed. Decent for a regular family movie night after dinner though, curled on the couch. Other than that, dont put much investment in it. However, the best part was the ending. The circle plot was awesome!",The Nun
421,CoffinVideo1983,Good Demonic/Religious Horror Film...,6,18 August 2019,"Preface: I'm not the biggest fan of the Conjuring series as a whole.Overall, The Nun was a pretty good movie. The film was shot wonderfully, locations were beautiful, color was perfect, and FX were spot on. That being said... for a demonic style horror film, I really prefer a little more background. With films out like Hereditary that are based in real, historically accurate lore, the bar has been set higher in that genre. The Nun's plot seemed rather thrown together to me.On the plus side... Taissa Farmiga is an amazing actor and was brilliant. I almost give her full credit for me liking the film as much as I did. I really believe she is a staple to the horror genre. Bonnie Aarons is amazing as the Nun as well. I do wish they would use a little prosthetics on her to keep the nun from looking so much like her. After her role in these films I don't know if i'll ever be able to see her as anything but an evil, demonic nun.
Overall... I give 6 out of 10.",The Nun
422,MrsOrange,Bava Back on the Big Screen,7,18 October 2019,"I don't like using the world underrated but this film is UNDERRATED! Sure, the story is not great but the atmosphere is rich in gothic detail and the camera work gave me the chills that the old maestro Bava used to deliver. Combine that with charming lead performances and a lean/mean runtime and you've got yourself a solid modern horror movies.Folks are way too hard on this movie and I've got some sneaking suspicions that it's because it's a period film with religious elements and we live in uneducated and godless times.",The Nun
423,nayachanda,The worst of conjuring series,3,31 October 2018,Wow!!!! This was really bad. I thought the 1st Annabelle movie was worst this beats that out. Not scary and no story. Waste of 1:30 min. 😩😩,The Nun
424,sinister_prog,Boo! The movie,3,14 February 2019,Half way though this movie I got the impression that the writers just ran out of plot and filled out the rest of the run-time with horror movie cliches. There's only so much creeping-about in the shadows or slow camera movements around a room while an apparition patiently waits off-screen to jump in on cue that should fit into one movie. By the end I expected the entire building to vanish.,The Nun
425,simonpersson-91016,not scary but nice story.,3,9 September 2018,"Not even scary. I was at the cinema and most of the jumpscares , noone even flinshed. This movie was very predictable and I give it a few stars because of the great story and nice screenplay. Btw you should not waste your time and money watching this at the cinema just wait a few months until it's releases online. They should not make a part 2 of this movie just saying.",The Nun
426,simonpersson-91016,BIG LET DOWN!,3,28 May 2019,Not even scary and a horror film gotta be scary! Horrible story and horrible effects and jump scares I guess many people over hyped this movie and thought it would be great but it sure wasn't. Decent ending tho but it won't do for my taste of movies.,The Nun

428,tuckfinite,More Language Culture Barrier Eploitation Flicks aka Will It Sell In China,1,27 September 2018,"Stripped down themes, plots, characters, techniques but a surfeit of cgi to avoid language and cultural differences that are too difficult to bridge. What do you think all these super hero(or virtually so)movies are really about? Good guys vs bad guys and wish fulfillment fantasy. Easy. But how would you convey moral ambiguity and moral conflict to a Chinese audience? Or character development, subtext, nuance, subtle humor? Not only might a foreign audience not get it, it might be interpreted as highly offensive. Hey the greed machine requires constant feeding. Man doesn't live by bread alone? Forget that. And where is all this debased degenerate wallowing in fantasy crapola leading. I can't help but think this fantastical political hit job on Judge Kavanaugh is a symptom. Let's think. Nerdy over achiever whose life has been an open book since school and intensively so considering the professional positions he's held, is actually a sex predator. But wait there's more. He's been part of a gang of sex criminals not operating secretly but having rape parties. Pretty sophisticated teens when most teens have trouble sneaking in beer without getting caught. North America is going to be the new Middle East when the shooting shifts from sporadic. The people who should have known better will ask what went wrong while the majority will think it's normal.",The Nun
429,jpsimmons-72015,Extremely cheesy...,4,10 November 2018,"The first 20 minutes were good but the movie got cheesy very fast with the poor writing and cliche horror movie themes. Now of days these movies are more along the line of A Nightmare on Elm Street or even Van Helsing. They just overdue it with the supernatural/fantasy aspect and neglect a good storyline. At this point they are just doing these movie for money. I won't pay to see another insidious, Annabelle, or conjuring movie again.",The Nun
430,pratham048,Does not live upto the hype,6,9 June 2019,"After reading lot of negative reviews i was confused whether should I watch this movie or not but then i finally give it a try and i felt that the story was weak and nothing in there and i am very diappaointed with that.I think this movie had a great potential to tell the story about valak but it fails very badly. I think it is the poor writing which made this film look dull but i would like to admire that with this poor story they executed it quiet well. I think it is the actor's good acting which binds u to the movie till the endIn trailers they r say THE DARKEST CHAPTER IN THE CONJURING UNIVERSE but it does not live upto the hype.But, i do like the jumpscares and the valak scenes with great visual effects and at the end it smoothly blends and connect with conjuring universe but it kept me wondering about the valak interest in the Warrens. Atlast, good movie but it may disappoint u.",The Nun

433,northernlad,Not That Great,4,24 August 2019,"First of all, I'm not the biggest fan of this franchise to begin with...when people tell me they're horror fans and proceed to list The Conjuring movies as examples of good horror, I mentally dismiss them and their opinion right off the bat. That said, there must be people out there who do like them because this franchise has exploded. Not sure if it's because these stories are based on the so called research and investigations of Ed and Lorain Warren and therefore people think this stuff is some how true...which is ridiculous. Then again the general public has a knack for eating up the ridiculous and the mundane.And that brings me to The Nun. Not sure where the plot was in this movie? Was this supposed to be an origin movie? Still not sure on that one either. If it was an origin movie, I'm still scratching my head over it. Why is there an Evil Nun/Demon haunting this Abbey? That's not explained. The writing does explain why the Abbey is haunted...but again, no explanation over why an Evil Nun/Demon exists.In general, this movie like much of the rest of The Conjuring Franchise is bland and uninteresting as mentioned earlier. It has Hollywood's boring little finger prints all over it and for some reason, the mundane public just eats it up.",The Nun
434,ZivoradZPFK,Wasted time,1,27 April 2020,"Nothing special, good story, good actors, nothing more. And one of the biggest mistake, the most important mistake, because of that only 1 (i want to give you -10, but it isn't possible) is that that Romania is Orthodox not catholic country. Ortodox. Don't waste your time.",The Nun
435,misslilia84,creepy but made little sense,5,7 April 2019,"This movie was creepy and got me with a few of the jump scares, but the plot was thin and made little sense. i kept thinking how stupid the main trio was bc they didn't think it was odd that the abbess was being weird when they 1st spoke to her. or how it took valak 7-10 years to kill these nuns after the bombs from WWII dropped on the building. or how the 2 nuns at the beginning said they needed the relic to defeat the evil, but didn't have it when they opened that door. or how it took frenchie 20 years to become fully possessed. or how i thought sister Irene was a young version of the wife from the conjuring since the actress is vera farmigas sister in real life but no, just another person with visions.",The Nun
436,TheSmallDeth,I got 99 problems but a good film ain't 'Nun',3,8 September 2018,"So today i saw The Nun,I gotta admit it was quite enjoyfull at the beginning. For the ones who've seen the other 'The Conjuring- Universe' films, you get a little flashback and a little explaining so you're right back to where they left you. Then the characters are being introduced and that's where it all pretty much goes downhill. It's mainly about 3 key figures; sister Irene, father Burke and one french-canadian local guy called Frenchie. The characters lack a little bit of charmisma and especially the guy playing Frenchie acts like he's in some sort of Jumanji adventure movie instead of a Horror. But hey guys we're watching a horror so we shouldn't be so hard on 'em right. We're coming for the Nun! Well i can tell you the Nun is more funny then she's scary. Jumpscares are nothing you haven't seen already and the origin story is pretty rushed too. The story has some holes in it too; and sometimes it ignores events that have happened way earlier in the movie. In the end you'll get a little cliffhanger which will get you hyped up for the upcoming conjuring movie which is nice but let's hope they are going to spice things up a little more.All by all: not a great movie but still enjoyable, i'll recommend every conjuring-universe fan or just mainstream horror fan to go. Just don't expect anything great.",The Nun

440,StrifeLeeSimpson,Meh,5,17 February 2020,"I was excited for this after Annabelle: Creation was surprisingly awesome. I watched these Conjuring films out of order, watching the first film I mentioned, then followed by the nun. Then watched the two Conjuring films afterward and saw Annabelle Comes Home in theaters. So when I saw The Nun, also in theaters, I was not aware what was done with the character in Conjuring 2, where the nun was basically the main antagonist. I am not sure if that would have changed my opinion of this film though, while some scares do land and there is good tension at times, it was an overall flat film with no real takeaways from it. The Conjuring 2 already did it better and all in all feels like an unnecessary entry in their universe.",The Nun

I am sure its all about the money and somewhere, somehow, someone has determined that this type of nonsense, that is The Nun, will bring in much more money as the simpleton masses will gobble it up like sweet buns.The fans who just love the scary suspence horrors that are The Conjuring movies done in great story telling, wonderful acting and great camera work...should stay away from this movie and hope this is just a failed abomination and not a perspective of what the future of this franchise will bring.For those who enjoy empty VERY predictable forced (failing) jump scares..without decent story telling. The Nun is for you!Personally I was left stunned..and highly dissapointed that this garbage was produced for this amazing franchise.",The Nun
445,J-odishaw,Easily the best movie I've ever seen that relies 100% on jump scares,6,7 September 2018,"Movies like Hereditary and Babadook create tension and horror through mood and suspense, The Nun does none of these things. Every single scare is predictable. The Nun makes up for this massive shortcoming by being horrific. The demonic forces are well designed and above average for a horror film.If this film wasn't a part of a bigger world it wouldn't make any sense. Structurally it's a mess and its edited poorly. The characters are good enough. Frenchie is highly amusing and Taissa is an obvious choice to play a young Vera. I saw it in IMAX so even though the scares could be seen coming a mile away I was genuinely frightened if for no other reason than the booming sound.",The Nun

447,nimdude,"Technically decent, narratively ridiculous and unconvincing",4,5 September 2018,"The Nun is another chapter in the marvel cin
... conjuring cinematic universe that for some reason keeps expanding.
The jumpscare plagued, unexplained and way too over the top plot is such a waste due to the fact that technically, this movie is the best in the conjuring universe. The cgi, production design, cinematography and the haunting soundtrack are all very very decent. However none of this can make up for the nonsensical satanic mess that this movie turned out to be.
Virtually completely non frightening, the Nun itself as a presence loses its ominousness very early into the second act. It is always shown in the same way as in the trailer. A creepy choir and a floating nun. 
It gets very boring after a while, and even when the atmosphere starts to seem somewhat decent, you get taken out of it even more when the misplaced and useless comic relief character opens his mouth.The acting is mostly passable but the actors aren't given much to work with in the first place.
Most of this film is just a continuous barrage of ""scary"", meaningless scenes that add up to nothing but cheap jumpscsres.As a part of the conjuring universe it does NOT IN ANY WAY explain the origins of the Nun.

There was nothing wrong with the story,wrong was the way they executed it.

Lame dialogues and characterplay throughout the movie.Learned from the previously installments that the character development is very important in such movies. Show some background stories, make an immersive ambience and so on.

464,ed321,Piece of garbage,2,13 December 2018,"I gave this 2 stars for the performances of 3 main actors and the scenery. But apart from that there's little in this to praise.The longer it went on the more boring and stupid it became. Villagers in rural Romania 1950's all speaking perfect English? Yeah right. Lost all reality straight away. Why not set it in rural England? It just got dumber from then on. Just a silly narrative story, over reliance on jump shocks which quickly became predictable. You know the writers have run out of ideas when they rely on ""BOO"" device.Some people walked out of the cinema with 30 mins to go, others were checking their facebook on their phones. I was pretty bored myself. How did it do so well at the box office being the weakest in the series?? Now that's biggest mystery of all.",The Nun

I also really enjoyed the connection it made to The Conjuring.",The Nun
467,Constantine306,Same problem as Annabelle Creation,6,4 April 2020,"While I found this film slightly more entertaining than Annabelle Creation. The problem with the prequels is that the Conjuring films exist and establish rules which these prequels completely break. I discussed this in my Annabelle Creation review as well, but when you create a universe and rules for your villains and heroes to exist by then you should follow them. This is pretty basic to all story telling, but especially true for horror films. However, the biggest issue these prequels have is that the demons are disproportionately overpowered compared to their later selves when they face the Warrens. For example, The Nun wipes out an entire convent without a problem and lives on consecrated ground like it's Spring Break in Tijuana. It has no problem screwing with a Priest and Nun for kicks and giggles, but when it meets the Warrens it somehow meets its match. Then it's defeated by NOT an ordained person, but by Elizabeth Warren because she knew its name? -___- Really? Come on. Do you see what I mean? The Conjuring clearly establishes that the faithful and pure of heart hold more power and ability than these demons, but in these prequels they're juiced on spiritual steroids with the ability to defeat nearly anyone and the endings to these prequels have to end with the demons escaping so that we have the Conjuring connection. This is why prequels don't work for this series if the writers and studios aren't going to follow the rules why bother? And if they did follow the rules they'd have to be a lot more clever about how these demons persist to encounter the Warrens later on. Anyways, this was at least a little more entertaining than Annabelle Creation in my opinion, but not by much.",The Nun

478,jahnu-14536,Could have been so much more,6,15 September 2021,"The most terrifying part of this film is the opening scene. So much is unknown, and yet what we know and can see is truly terrifying. From there, the film goes downhill and stays there; characters stupidly and slowly walking around places they really shouldn't be, confusing plotline, and most of all - a complete and utter exposure of the main villian, the Nun. There is little chance at horror when you know exactly what the monster in the darkness looks like AND that she most likely will just scream at you.If the filmmakers had just shown less of the Nun, kept her in the dark like in the Conjuring 2 (or even more in the dark), and just made everything more mysterious and unknown, this could have been a 7 or even 8 out of 10. Sadly, it's just disappointing, and by the end you will wonder what emotion you are supposed to be feeling - because you won't be scared.

Stop being lazy James Wan",The Nun
483,BassLightyear,It had every possibility to succeed - what happened?,5,4 October 2018,"As I'm writing this, The Nun lies still very fresh in my memory from watching it in theaters just about an hour ago. Unfortunately, I have very little nice things to say about this film, but nonetheless (or should I say nuntheless) I think it's important to bring up all aspects of a film in a review - both good and bad. With that said - let's dive into it!First off, as a fan of both ""The Conjuring"" films, I - like many others - was very hyped to go see this very much anticipated film. I wish I could say that maybe it was because of the hype that was building up towards it's release that made it disappointing, that it was still good, but just not able to live up to it's hype, but I'm afraid that's just part of it. Ever heard the expression ""show don't tell""? Well, this film is the opposite of that. From the very beginning the writers feels the need to tell everything and show very little, meaning that I, as a viewer, have very little room to build my own interpretation and guesses about where the plot is heading. From the very beginning we are entering a scene with this demon - Valak - and the only two nuns left at a Romanian convent, or abbey. And right off the bat I can't help but question the film maker's choice here - why, for the love of authenticity, are the Romanian nuns, in a Romanian convent, in Romania speaking English to each other?? It doesn't make any sense! The film actually loses a lot of it's credibility because of that; I can't possibly believe that the film is telling me the truth when presented with such a contradiction. The story, sadly, becomes unbelievable before it even starts. Next, the nun who ends up biting the dust in the beginning is explicitly telling the other nun that the demon needs to possess a human soul to free itself. Upon receiving this information from the dying nun, the other nun proceeds to commit suicide before the demon can get to and possess her. Why the demon does not possess the first nun, but instead kills her and goes after the second nun remains unclear throughout the rest of the film. What follows are 1 hour and 36 minutes sets of three's: explanatory conversation; dragging; jump scare; repeat! It's very tiring to be subjected to the same scene in different settings over and over again. ""Searching with a light in the forest, music stops, jump scare"". ""Searching with a light in the halls of the convent, music stops, jumps scare"". ""Walking around with a light in the supply cellar, music stops, jump scare"". That's basically how the movie is structured. There's no room to wonder about the solving of the mysteries of the plot (I'm not even sure there is a mystery or anything to solve since the one nun in the beginning already explained everything to us (in English too, may I remind you of)). Now, if you remember from the second film in the franchise, ""The Conjuring 2"", you can control the demon by knowing it's name, right? ""Valak"" that is. Well, they figure out the demons name within (what I believe to be) the first 30 minutes of the film, but of course that has no effect whatsoever. And neither do they adress why it has no effect (they don't even mention anything about the controlling of the demon by the use of it's name. I tell you, if I had been working as a writer on the franchise I would've killed off Lorraine and Ed in the ""Conjuring 2"" as a result of they never finding out the demon's name and then making ""The Nun"" about finding out it's name and not finding the ridiculous ""Blood of Christ"" (that's never really explained either)). This inconsistency can be found throughout the film. They just jump (scare) right over plot-holes without even trying to fill them with substantial story structure. Next I'd like to discuss the actual atmosphere that surrounds the film, the overarching mood that serves to capture it's essence. Is it a horror or a comedy? Because they seem to not be able to make up their minds about this. The scariest parts of the film are instantly followed by a cheeky comment from one of the characters; not just once, not twice, but a lot! Sometimes it works, but equal amount of the time it doesn't. And why do this? To lighten the mood for us, the audience? We don't need mood-lightening in horror films - what we need is suspense! But ""The Nun"" fails to do this. Horror films are supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat with your hands covering your eyes! They are supposed to make your heart beat faster and maybe even force your body to produce a little bit of adrenaline. Instead ""The Nun"" follows it's darkest bits with it's lightest; to serve what purpose? It's just serves to further create an unbelievable and contradictory story. In my opinion it works against the core purpose of any horror film - to inflict horror in the audience. A couple more things before I move on to what I think is good about the film. The hallucinations: It turns out that Irene is just hallucinating about the nuns in the convent during the first hour and twenty minutes of the film. Okey? So... what does the film makers want me to do with that information? It's not like it changes the story or anything - no wait! That's right - it leads to the realisation that the nun who commits suicide in the beginning of the film does it as a sacrifice so that the demon can't possess her and set itself free. That's why! But wait... if that's the great turning-point realisation of the film - why is it explained by the dying nun in the very first godforsaken five minutes of the film!? We already know that's why the other nun killed herself! How could the film makers make such a huge blunder?? Second to last (before I get into the good aspects of the film): Why does Father Burke have to tell Irene about the Mother Mary statue that's reflecting this absolutely ridiculous stream of light off of it's finger? And he points it out to her within less than 10 seconds of entering the room. I'm going to recall the films ""tell don't show"" policy here. Why can't we, the audience, get a chance to discover it for ourselves through Irene's perspective before Father Burke decides to point it out? After the disappointing revelation about (the already known to us) nun's death, this feels like it is supposed to be the pinnacle turning-point of the film and instead it is eschewed by a mere impatient ""hey look!"". I feel like because it's her visions - it's her discovery to make. It would at least serve the story better, in my opinion. Last thing before getting into the good bits of the film. The showdown: why is a mighty demon using it's mere hands to strangle a girl? Earlier in the film the demon showcases it's supernatural talents by burying Father Burke and filling the grave with 12 cubic feet of hard packed dirt instantaneously without even touching him. So why use it's hands now? Wouldn't it be easier to just put the girl seven feet under the surface (they were in a pool of water for some reason) and drop a stone on-top of her or something? Once again, the story is not believable. Now, finally, I can talk about what I actually like about the film. First off - the actors. The actors are actually quite remarkable in this film, especially Taissa Farmiga who portrays Sister Irene. I've said this before in this review (if you remember) that the story is not believable in the slightest, which I still hold to be true, however - the actors did a very believable job with an unbelievable script. It sounds paradoxical, I know, but I can't possibly attribute the films unbelievability to the actors - they actually made the movie semi-watchable! Second, I enjoyed how they tied it all together at the end with the lecture from the first film ""The Conjuring"". It almost gave me goosebumps. With that said it is still a poor consolation for what is simply a bad film.I can't possibly cover all my thoughts in one review - I could go on for days. But to sum it all up: there's no substance to the story whatsoever. It's simply not believable. The jump scares from dead nuns, snakes and various dead, tangible things are just empty threats - they never cause any real harm and only serves as time-fillers in a story that's lacking just that - story. After a while (sooner than after a while really) you get used to them and you anticipate them. The story was the one factor that broke this film. It had every possibility to succeed, but unfortunately the writers made bad decision after bad decision and the film suffered as result. Without taking anything away from the actors' performances, I'd like to conclude this review by saying that this film could have been a hell of a lot better.",The Nun
484,gkukumakov,"Even ""Truth or Dare"" was better..",2,14 September 2018,I just came back from the cinema. This movie wasn't scare at all. It was boring with nothing spacial to offer. The moment I left the cinema I forgot about it.,The Nun
485,jessfaith-45971,"Must Watch for All Horror Fans and Fans of the ""Conjuring"" Universe",10,8 September 2018,"By far, ""The Nun"" is one of the scariest and most satisfying horror movies that I've ever seen. The characters, atmosphere and score are outstanding and the cinematography is amazing. The characters in the ""The Nun"" are funny and very memorable, especially Frenchie who act as the comic relief. In some movies, the comic relief can get in the way or just be annoying. However, ""The Nun"" does an excellent job of balancing out the comedy. 
Sister Irene is also spectacular. Taissa Farmiga does an incredible job bringing her to life. Irene is smart and caring but also vulnerable and you really feel that throughout the film.
Father Burke, while not the most interesting at times, is wise and fun to watch as well. His relationship with boy who died is very intriguing and you really see how it affects him.
For me, I really liked all the characters and cared for them.As for Valak herself, Bonnie Aarons did and outstanding job bringing the demon nun to life. Valak was creepy and mysterious at the same time. I loved how menacing she could look. The camera work and lighting were also phenomenal. They created a creepy, gothic vibe that haunted every scene with and unsettling presence. It was beautiful and it helped create many of the scares in the movie.Let's talk about the scares. While there were one or two scares that didn't work, the rest had me covering my mouth so I wouldn't scream. The suspense before each scare had me on the edge of my seat since I didn't know when they were coming. The part where all the nuns are praying is chilling to watch and the part when the Nun's shadow walked slowly to the mirror had me wide eyed with fear.My favorite part though was the music. Oh my god the music was amazing ranging from calm silence to ominous dread. My favorite scene in the movie was when there is a shot of Valak standing in a room and the music creates this eerie, but powerful vibe that showed me just how evil Valak is. Overall, I loved this movie and would definitely see it again. It is an amazing horror flick that all fans of the genre or ""Conjuring"" movies should see.",The Nun

Instead, Im concentrating on the denouement.We see ""The Demonic Nun"" pictured in early scenes. This thing has been in the novice nun's dreams and visions for apparently all of her life. Its a combo Wicked Witch of the West and really bad Halloween decor at Home Depot in the fall. So, we already know what's coming. Like Pennywise in ""IT"". The film gets the monster front and center for whatever purpose the director is looking for.The Nun has come through a crack in the Abbey Floor to destroy the Abbey with its evil. The Novice and the Exorcist must find a way to send it back to the bowels of hell - or wherever demonic nuns go when they are sent back through the crack they crawled out of. To accomplish this, The Novice and The Exorcist have discovered a glass Faberge egg sort of creation in the Abbey - which contains - wait for it - the sacred blood of Jesus Christ. The Novice, who has just recently taken her vows, is allowed to wear the Faberge egg as a necklace because she is a new Bride of Christ, and the only soul pure enough to handle the blood.Now we come to the hilarious scene: the one thing that beats them all. The Nun costume or special effects or whatever that was, has an enormous mouth full of gnarled yellow teeth. At least twice the number one would expect to see in a normal mouth - but hey, its a creature. One has to wonder why it would need so many teeth. Does a demonic entity actually eat anything, that requires teeth to masticate? Most amazingly, we see people walking the streets of Anytown USA missing MANY teeth - which is the result of poor dental hygiene and deficit dental care. Yet this thing has seemingly not 32 teeth, but possibly twice that many. There is no way The Nun is brushing and flossing and pursing 6 month dental checkups.Now, back to the dumb story. The Novice finds herself in a room filled with water. The Nun follows her, and proceeds to drown her. Keeping in mind that the Novice is wearing the blood of Jesus Christ, which apparently The Nun isnt concerned with, or is too busy drowning the Novice to care about. We see the Novice under the water, with the last bubbles of life escaping her mouth. Suddenly, and miraculously. the Novice emerges from the water and spews the blood of Christ into the face of The Nun. As with the Wicked Witch in The Wizard of Oz, this decimates The Nun, then spins the water and The Nun out of the room through the crack in the floor, and seals the evil from the Abbey.Oy.

2. Unusual Sound Effects
3. The Role of Dark Nun, too weak, not upto the mark of The Conjuring 2
4. Since The Nun was barred to Hell, then how the creepy Nun showed up again in The Conjuring 2??
5. All other Nuns were alive till the end came and all died? or something happened to them all.
6. non required lengthening of the story line without any purpose somewhat like some Indian Movies, sorry, they're somehow better.
I am sorry, but this movie was way below my expectations of what i expected from the Conjuring 2. James Wan, a request, please when there are certain movies like this which deserve your attention, dont ignore please. You ruin a very good movie flick. I hope my message goes to him. Otherwise, the character of The Dark Nun is very strong to rule the whole movie but was not capitalized properly.

Title: The Nun
Format: Cinema Language: English Released: 2018
Director: Corin Hardy
Starring: Demián Bichir, Taissa Farmiga, Jonas Bloquet'The Nun', a spin-off from the 'Conjuring' series of horror films, has been placed in the hands of Corin Hardy, director of the rather excellent, 'The Hallow'. I had high hopes for this, hence spending the small fortune to watch it on the big screen; sadly I was not impressed.Kicking things off, we are shown a little of the back story and the history of the Nunnery in which the film story would take place. The whole thing finishes with the suicide of a young Nun (no, it's not a spoiler; it's the opening). Said Nun's body is found my Jonas Bloquet playing what can only be described as a one dimensional and highly annoying character called Frenchie.The action then cuts to the Vatican, where Father Burke (Demián Bichir) is instructed to go and find out what is happening at the Nunnery. He links up with Sister Irene and they set off together. The problems for me, start here. I've got to wonder, after getting to the end of the film, and once you are shown the so-called twist and have the complete story, how the Vatican found out about the suicide in the first place? It just makes no sense. Also, why has Father Burke been teamed up with Sister Irene? Again, there just isn't a reason for this. Sadly, it's a dilemma that's repeated throughout the film, the plot really doesn't fit together well. I would say that it's just a series of stuff that sounded like a good idea at the time, half-heartedly slapped together.'The Nun' bumbles along with pointless sequence following meaningless section until the twist comes near to the climax. If you haven't left by then or fallen asleep (we'll come to that in a minute) you are treated, for lack of a more pertinent term, to an uninspired, colour by numbers, ending.That's really all I can say about the story! There is some good stuff here, the film is well made, looks amazing, sounds amazing and it's edited very well, it's just so very boring. On a number of occasions throughout the film, I found myself almost falling asleep, totally uninterested in the events onscreen. Add to this the mediocre and disappointing performance from the actors, I just couldn't find a reason to care about any of it. There is little that warrants my time, or money, spent watching 'The Nun'; and that is disappointing at I do love the 'Conjuring' series.",The Nun

Father role-very good acting
The horse guy-average acting but not funnybwhen supposed to be.

513,tonyjcole94,Very VERY VERY cliche. Lots of jump scares. Dragging plot.,3,7 September 2018,"This film is OBVIOUSLY missing the James Wan touch that we loved in the conjuring universe films. Even when Wan used jump scares , it worked bc the atmosphere was tense and creepy . In ""The Nun"" they're overly planted everywhere in the movie to make up for the fact that the director couldn't keep the audience captivated any other way.The plot is basic to say the least, it's almost like they just threw it together in 5 minutes to make up a back story for The Nun. The film had so much potential to give the audience a interesting creepy back story to one of the conjuring's iconic villains. Instead we're saturated with filler for the 1st and 2nd act , and FINALLY get something going on the final act . Up until then it's nothing but jump scare city . So if that's up your alley for horror movies then you'll love this . I personally think the brief amount of time The Nun was in the Conjuring 2 was 100000x better than this full length film.They also tried to go with this new trend of adding some comedy into a horror film and it's just badly placed and awkward . The acting is okay . Taissa Farmiga & Demien Bichir are the main characters and give pretty good performances. Anyway, Overall this movie could've gone straight to DVD or Netflix . Don't think it deserved to hit the big screen if it wasn't going to be directed by Wan . There's some creepy/scary enjoyable moments but overall it's very cliche and downright boring at times. Watch when you're at home on a rainy day with nothing do. Don't waste ur money like i did",The Nun
514,andiesikes,Better than I expected!! SPOILERS BELOW!,8,10 September 2018,"I was honestly surprised. Now don't get me wrong, I LOVED Taissa Farmiga in American Horror Story (murder house.) Not only was she a great actress, but she did very well in a horror genre. Not every great actor can pull off a role in a horror film or series, but she can portray sadness and anger and fear in a a way that seems so natural in a horror setting. That being said, I still didn't have too high of hopes for the Nun. While I love the Conjuring 1 and especially 2, I felt that they were really reaching here trying to pump out another film as a part of a popular franchise. Now the beginning was slow for me and the story a bit off. It was a creepy castle. A demon. The usual for these types of films. They really didn't give you much backstory which is something I LOVED in the conjuring films. I really connected with the Warrens and was rooting for them. Bus of course, just like all of these films, it definitely had atmosphere! But what I really liked was the ending. Right after I got home from the movies, I looked up the scene where they discussed Maurice in the first conjuring movie and I can't believe I missed it! I really enjoyed how they wrapped it all in together! It made it worth the watch.",The Nun

517,vanilla_vintage,The Nun had so much potential to re-create the experience like its franchise but failed to do so.,6,5 September 2018,"A Conjuring Universe fan will still enjoy The Nun because the Conjuring has built the hype for Valek. The evil was too pure Evil. It lacked of mystery/background story that dropped audience's hope to feel empathized. The characters have weak motive to drive and develop the story and came of as cliché and predictable. The Father wasn't scared of spirit but at least he should have had some deep guilt ( I just hate the Daniel kid who appeared several times and didn't give any impact) Sister Irene actress actually pulled it off through her acting, her eyes which conveyed some troubled past of having a vision. But the character development was still flat in terms of experience at the end of the movie. The props have been mentioned multiple times and used but weren't impactful enough such as the mirror and the ghost or the bell nearby the tomb. The comical relief appeared from time to time but sometimes decreased the tension in some scenes. The Nun had so much potential to re-create the experience like its franchise but failed to do so.",The Nun
518,OvidiuStoin,A great disappointment,3,6 September 2018,"I am Romanian and the entire audience in the theater was mostly laughing through the most part of this movie. At times I thought I was in the wrong hall, watching a comedy or even worse, a parody. Of course there was a remark sounding something like: ""Here in Romania we live in the Dark Ages""...Well sc**w you Hollywood for distorting reality and misinform people, thank you for the nice advertising of my country...So just to sum it up, in 1952 most likely in France people from mountain villages also used carriages to travel to the woods, ah and we do not spit on the ground every time someone mentions an 'evil' place or whatever...But leaving all these things aside, the movie was plain horrible. I had so high expectations for The Nun as Valak was beautifully portrayed in the previous installments, it was one of those non CGI entities that gave me the chills (and I must mention that this does not happen too often) - pretty much like the bride in black from Insidious chapter 2. What I like about these kind of 'monsters' is that they are insanely creepy without doing much, but merely being there and staring into the camera, without having to show teeth or a gross tongue, 
just displaying the evil and pure cruelty in their eyes being enough. And all this by only using real people and make-up, to me all the CGI monsters are cheap and laughable. And what did I get in this movie? Most of the times a badly rendered CGI Valak... What a big pile of c**p...Oh and wait, there's more, I was actually expecting Valak to be the focus of The Nun, but no, I mostly got some lame zombies delivering cliche, childish jump scares... I thought it would be an origin story, but they didn't bother for more than 2 minutes to explain how and mostly WHY did Valak came into our world. So I was watching another movie with a villain whose motives are shady - doing evil just for the sake of evil...The characters/cast? I felt that Taissa Farmiga had no idea what was her purpose most part of the movie, like she was there only because her big sister is beautifully playing Lorraine Warren in the Conjuring movies. Of course we have the usual comic relief which was in far too many scenes, having cheesy cliche lines. Ah and of course, the big expert, the veteran with plenty of experience, one of a kind in the world who got played by the demon on every freaking occasion. I was under the impression the he had no idea what he was dealing with and how to defeat it (come one, he found out the name of the demon very early in the movie and that's the hardest part of an exorcism).I gave it a 3 star rating only for the beautiful shots, ominous soundtrack and creepy atmosphere. Besides that, the acting was terrible, the script must have been written by a 6 grader (""Holy s**t"", ""The holiest..."" was the character's reaction upon seeing the blood of Christ - I must mention that I am not religious, but come on...), there were plenty of inaccuracies (Romanians are Orthodox, yet the abbey was Catholic - otherwise the Vatican's implication makes no sense; none of the nuns were praying in Romanian, but in Latin - ok maybe since they seem to have been an illusion created by Valak, maybe Latin makes sense, the demon does not speak Romanian I guess).In conclusion, should you watch this one? Well that's none of my business, but beware as it is a very bad movie (I found Slender Man to be better than this one), the weakest in this franchise. I really hope they will make it up to Valak in the next installments and make proper use of his huge creepy potential.",The Nun

I love jumping out of my skin and screaming :""dont go in there!"" (In my head of course)
One thing i also love is having a moment to take a breath and relax. A soft spot in the movie that allows me to get comfortable.
The nun, imo, didnt have that.. that is the reason why i wasnt able to give this movie the full 10 stars.

521,bowo_trahutomo,"Poor scenario, acceptable cinematographic art",5,8 September 2018,"There are two major weaknesses of this film.
First, the Blood of Jesus Christ in the container of relic. Every Christian who has read the Bible knows that when Jesus Christ was arrested, tortured and crucified by the Roman Empire, all disciples of Jesus' followers fled in fear. Around the Cross of Jesus Christ, were Roman soldiers who ridiculed him, and the Pharisees who were grudgingly against Jesus Christ, and Mary the weak mother of Jesus was frightened by John the melancholic disciple of Jesus. No person at the time of the crucifixion of Jesus who thought could accommodate or take the blood of Jesus. When the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, no one believed that Lord Jesus Christ would rise and rule over Satan and death. When Jesus died on the cross, the devil and all the political enemies of the Lord Jesus Christ thought they had won. No one thinks that the Power of Jesus' Blood defeats the devil.When the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross, He died of blood. Out of blood from being tortured by Roman Empire soldiers. The Lord Jesus Christ ran out of blood when the whole body of the wound was whipped, lifted the cross, and then hung on the cross for 3 hours. That is the original idea of the death penalty on the cross, that prisoners will die of blood when crucified. This is evidenced by the Bible record, that when the Lord Jesus Christ died, the Roman army thrust the spear into his stomach which came out was no longer fresh blood, but blood mixed with water, which indicated that Jesus Christ had died, the cause was run out of blood.
Second thing:
The Pastor figure who should have the power to do an exorcism, just screaming in panic when there was a demon attack. There is no spiritual authority displayed in this Pastor's figure.This film is very weak in terms of spirituality. The director and screenwriter did not know the process of exorcism and the power of the priest's ritual. If the film director wants to make a Pastor's character against Satan, watch The RITE movie first, which is based on a true story.The NUN film is only good in terms of cinematography because of Romanian nature and monastery buildings that are spooky, but the scenario is very bad and the story is too weak",The Nun

542,skjoe-1,Starts promising but ruined by bad writing and lack of scares.,3,7 September 2018,"As a huge fan on the conjuring universe and the Insidious films I was extremely eager to watch this prequel about one of the scariest horror characters of recent movie history. For its brief appearance in the conjuring 2 the Nun was terrifying, I remeber the first time she is seen on screen I was truely scared.
This film starts off well, a nun at an abbey in Romainia takes her own life to prevent an ""evil"" from having her. We cut to the Vatican who send a ""miracle hunter"", a British (soon to be) nun and a local who found the body. The scene is set, I was intrigued, the atmosphere was eerie the location was perfect for a horror film. This old almost abandoned abbey was ideal.
However, it comes apparent early on that this film isn't going the tension soaked, creepy build up of a horror film like previous entries. Cheap jump scares, zombies, bad CGI and confusing, weak story ruin this film so quickly. The film to me, just was not scary, I didn't feel any dread or tension at all with this, I know horror can be subjective but this became silly very fast.
SPOILERS
For example;
The Vatican personally want the girl to assist the priest in his investigation because she ""knows the land well"" yet when he asks her about this she claims she's never even been to Romania, this was never again mentioned or brought up.
Right at the start of the film the nun sacrifices herself to prevent an evil from taking her body, yet near the end of the film it's a big reveal that it's not a suicide but a sacrifice. We know this!!! You told us at the start!
Zombies! Think your going to get Valak stalking the characters, cool shots of it haunting them? Nope! Well maybe for a minute or so. Zombie nuns attacking our characters and a zombie child, almost like The Evil Dead style.
The blood on the steps of the abbey. The blood that came from the nun who hung herseld at the start of the film never fades over time, which the characters notice and is initially creepy. This blood then increases over time to which the priest says ""it's abother part of the puzzle"" this is never again brought up.
The French Canadian. This kind of comic relief character who assists them feels out of place. He claims to be here because he wants to help these poor people of Romainia but never explained why. Perhaps the natives are all so helpless? The demon whilst it possesses our main character when attacking him growls ""the village will looses its idiot. Youl let them down like you let everyone else down"" what? I know using a characters flaws and history against them in horror is a great tool. If we knew what it was!!!
The link to the conjuring franchise. The big reveal near the end? How this film connects to the Warrens? While after Valak is defeated the French Canadian guy has a small cross stuck to his skin. Doesn't explain why or how really. This is apparently the exact same guy years and years later who Lorraine Warren tries to save (which we see in the conjuring as a flashback/video clip) that's it! Oh and a quick flash of Valak a couple of times during the same old scene!
The ending! Oh god the ending. So at the climax of the film Valak is trying to drown out protagonist who is holding a large glass sphere containing the ""blood of Christ"". She almost succeeds, well I thought she did until our hero suddenly spits the blood into her face. How? Under water, almost dead yet she managed to break open this thick glass container, swallow blood from it whilst submerged and avoid dying.
The story in general, some parts of it seemed good, I got excited at certain sections. Using history, the crusades and religion, the blood of Christ this immensely powerful relic of fighting evil to stop Valak, I was hoping for a deep story about Valak's past.
Nope, want to know about Valak, well so do I, big reveal some spooky sorcerer who dabbled in black magic wanted to raise the demon (no idea why or how). The abbey with the nuns was just there to pray and suspend the evil from returning, apparently a bombing raid made the demon emerge. 
The only good parts of this film were the setting and initial atmosphere, the soundtrack is haunted and wonderfully done and when you actually see Valak herself (very rarely) she is terrifying.
Overall? Avoid this film, don't let it sour your experiences with Valak from the conjuring 2. Rewatch that instead it's a better nun film, her small role in that was much more impactful than this. Watch insidious watch Annabelle (the second one) James Wan helped write this apparently I don't know what he was thinking.

547,jrugg19,A Massive Disappointment for the Conjuring Franchise,6,12 September 2018,"The Nun is the third spin-off in The Conjuring Universe, and is centered around ""Valak"" the demon we've seen in The Conjuring 2, and Annabelle Creation. It is directed by Corin Hardy, and stars Taissa Farmiga and Demian Bichir as we follow what is supposed to be the origin of this popular demon nun.
Let me start off by saying that I am a massive fan of both The Conjuring 1 and 2, I think James Wan is currently the pioneer in modern horror filmmaking, and even though he did not direct this movie, I was excited to see he was a writer. Unfortunately, this movie is not nearly as scary or even remotely entertaining as either of those movies. 
This movie was a complete cash grab, from start to finish. How can you name your movie ""The Nun"" and have this character hardly be in the movie?? We learn next to NOTHING about this character, which makes the entire movie pointless. 
Farmiga and Bichir are fine in their roles, they're both accomplished actors and I've enjoyed both of them in other projects, but the characters they play are so beyond flat that it is obvious this movie just needed two people to wander through an old castle just to get scared. The film has almost no plot whatsoever. It's just jumpscare after jumpscare after jumpscare until it is time to fight The Nun and wrap the film up. I don't believe for a second that Wan had much to do with the screenplay because he is so, so much better than this. I'm giving this film a very generous 6 because I enjoyed the set pieces, music, and Farmigas and Bechirs attempts to make the film more lively. It also ties into the series nicely towards the end. Otherwise, there is no real need to see this film. It feels like a studio driven movie and is presented as such. If you really want to see it, just wait until its on Netflix or HBO. Complete disappointment.",The Nun
548,hancifatih,This really needs a vessel.,4,31 August 2021,"Many questions.1. Why did the Duke of Saint Carta want to call upon the forces of hell? What was his benefit? Or was he just a lunatic Satan worshipper, and that's what lunatic Satan worshippers do?2. How could man-made bombs (which have no spiritual, holy or unholy aspects as they are basically pressed explosives) cause the portal (which took the man who built it write and read books for years, sacrifice people, and do a ritual to open it, while it also took nuns to use actual blood of Jesus to close it) to break, from where the evil started to ""leak""?3. If sister Jessica and sister Victoria wanted to put an end to the evil spirit that is Valak, why did they bring the key that opens the wall-cabinet in which Jesus' blood is hidden, instead of bringing the blood itself? What did they think the key would be useful for? Did they think they would be just fine entering the premises of Valak who killed ALL of the other nuns?4. If the aim of Valak is to possess soemone as a vessel and ""deceive and corrupt"" people, why did it kill the first nun it met, sister Jessica, instead of possessing her? Or did it possess her? I don't think it did as it went after sister Irene and marked her... Also, Valak had MANY opportunities throughout the whole movie to possess someone and use them as a vessel; but it decided to scare them with jazz music, broken arms, hanging images of sister Victoria, appearing in the mirror, posing as the abbess of the church, posing as Daniel to lick father Burke's face, making hands appear out of the walls, burying father Burke alive just to poke his face and then let him go... All instead of just attacking them. It is said repetitively the whole movie that Valak is very powerful; so why didn't it just kill them, or attack them, or possess them, or whatever? Did it need its victims to lose their strength and faith in order to claim them? Then how could it attack sister Jessica, who seemed pretty confident and sure of what she wanted to do, in the first place?5. Why some of the ghost nuns didn't want the ghost of sister Oana to tell sister Irene the truth about the church and Valak? Didn't some of them sacrifice their lives to stop Valak? And if they didn't trust (or whatever) sister Irene, why did they form a circle around her and prayed with her? What changed their minds?6. The ghost of sister Oana tells sister Irene that sister Victoria caused the portal to hell to open again when she killed herself (as it's the ultimate sin); but wasn't Valak already back, and hadn't it even killed sister Jessica (who actually opened the door after saying ""We have no other choice."") before sister Victoria killed herself? And wasn't that exactly why sister Victoria killed herself? Or did the ghost of sister Oana not know the truth?7. How did sister Irene know it was father Burke who rang the bell from his coffin, when all she could hear was the bell? Why did the evil spirit try to confuse sister Irene by ringing all the bells instead of just attacking her to stop her from digging father Burke out of the grave? Why was the spirit able only to play with father Burke's face and scare him, but not just kill him while Irene was digging? Was she not ""powerful"" enough yet? Well she was powerful enough to lure and put a grown man in a grave..?8. After just being buried into a grave and coming to the conclusion that there was a ""very powerful evil spirit"" in the church, why did father Burke still need to talk to the nuns? Wasn't what just happened already enough proof to, say, perform an exorcism, or whatever fathers do?9. If the evil spirits that Valak masquerades as (or ""controls"", or ""puppets"") can be beheaded with an axe or shot with a rifle as Frenchie demonstrates, why did the nuns, father Burke and sister Irene bother with prayers in Latin, holy water and stuff? Btw, the ""comedic relief"" moments of Frenchie and the small dialogues this caused ruined the whole atmosphere of the movie.10. How did Frenchie get to the delivery room? Why didn't Valak stop him? Was it because it was busy ""scaring"" father Burke?11. Why did Valak give the trio enough time to even perform a ritual for sister Irene to take her vows? What did it wait for?12. Why was the trio able to go through ""the door"" like it's nothing, after the movie showed several times how anyone that even got near it got killed by Valak itself?13. Why did the trio think it was okay to separate in the premises of Valak after each one of them was attacked when they were alone even when they were away from there?14. As it's shown in the final scene how powerful Valak is even without possessing anyone, why did it need a vessel? Why did it waste so much time? Why didn't it just possess sister Irene after killing the other two if it's a ""spirit"" that's powerful enough to blow a grown man across the hall with just her breath, and attack three people at once without a vessel?15. Why does Valak need to be so extra and emerge from the water like that? Why doesn't it attack sister Irene right away? Does it feed on fear like Pennywise? And why did it have to first choke and then drown sister Irene when it can do everything it had done throughout the movie?Apart from all of these nonsense; the aesthetic, the Valak, the visuals, most shots, and some elements of the story were great. I miss the times when horror movies had masterful stories with villains who had actual motives. Now it's all about the ""scary cool visuals"" and ""shock value"". Nun is just another movie for people who are in for the jump-scares and thrilling, vague entertainment - not for horror fans who crave a subtle story that slowly and cleverly carves what it wants to say out of the viewer's mind and subconscious.",The Nun

564,hudson-todd,"Scary Images, Stupid Script",4,14 May 2019,"This movie had potential in terms of its setting and its relatively good cinematography. It does accomplish a few scares in terms of some truly ghastly images, namely the demonic nun. Also, Taisa Farmiga gives a credible performance and, let's face it, is adorable as the young mousey novice. However, the appallingly bad script makes some of the dialogue and some of the acting almost worthy of MST3K. (Fr. Burke strikes a pose in one scene that almost made me spew coffee from my nose, it was so cheesy, and nearly every line spoken by Frenchie is moronically misplaced). For a movie in The Conjuring franchise, which takes place in a world steeped in Catholicism as its basis for reality, it portrays a surprisingly weak Catholic Church. It is equally ignorant of Catholic teaching. For instance, they have to retrieve a relic containing the blood of Christ in order to seal a portal, but they seem to forget that, according to the Catholic Doctrine of transubstantiation, consecrated wine literally becomes the blood of Christ, so all the priest in the movie needed to do was consecrate some wine and they would have all the blood of Christ they needed.

This movie is definitely weak, it isn't a great movie. The acting is alright, the reason on why I think it is better than Annabelle is that it isn't nearly as boring as Annabelle. Annabelle was a slog to get through, this not so much. It isn't anywhere near as good conjuring 1, 2 or Annabelle creation, but it also isn't anywhere near as bad as Annabelle. The nun can't carry a movie, she was scary in the conjuring cause she was just pulling the strings and just spooking people. You can't have a movie where the main antagonist is legit doing nothing for 2/3s of the movie. I know it sounds like I'm being harsh, but overall I think I liked the movie, I had lowered expectations since it is supposed to be the worst conjuring, but it simply isn't that. It's the second worst. I think the worst part of this movie is that they take what was a spooky character from conjuring 2 and somehow make her not scary. Idk how they did that but they did. I love how bonkers the story is, I'm a sucker for these crazy stupid stories, I loved A Cure For Wellness for how it goes insane with its story. If you are expecting a scary movie, don't it isn't scary, but if you want a dumb fun movie that is so bonkers it's funny with some great locations and set designs along with a few good performances then watch this.

Acting was decent, but the storyline was replaced by a series of jump scares that fail miserably due to the fact that no tense atmosphere was built whatsoever. 
Additionally, the movie relies too much on ""scary"" visuals, which are so abused that in the end they just stop being scary. Just think about the Nun itself, whose creepiness wore off even before the film was released. 
Also, the comic relief... It is so brutally misplaced that it kills the very very few moments of suspense. It almost seems like the creators of the movie were boycotting themselves. I mean, you don't insert a joke in the middle -or right after- an important (and supposedly scary) event happens. It's Writing 101.

I do not want some spoilers in this review but to say that there is a monastery with a creepy nun could everyone have guessed by looking at the poster.

They want a creepy setting in the country of Dracula, and they want to go back in time to embrace that feeling of ""original"" horror.But when it all comes down to it, they do not succeed. The setting is great. But the characters are dull and when the film tries to be funny it is not. When the nun finally is introduced, she is scary, but I just waited for them to pick up the pace.
Even though they had some good actors in Demián Bichir and American Horror Story-star Taissa Farmiga who has the potential to lift the movie, they do not convince.

599,kulaivadiraj,A scare filled roller coaster,9,7 September 2018,"Well I have to say...
This movie freaked me out.
I'll go step by stepStory: Father Burke and Sister Irene go to investigate a suicide at the Abbey. What happens in their investigation forms the storyline.Acting: Teissa fermiga was good. Demian Bichir was good. But the best was Jonas Bloquet. He stole the show and Bonnie Aarons as the Nun scares you very much.Technical: Corin Hardy's direction was very good. Music by Abel is still haunting me. The cinematography was a highlight. Editing was crisp. I do have some problems about a few scenes (things) in the movie like a shotgun can stop a ghost? It didn't make sense to me, but hey, it's a horror movie, and as long as it's scary I don't care. So they were negligible.Plus points: Acting, directions, music, jump-scares and the climax link to The conjuring movie was amazing.Minus points: Too much comedy scenes in between, it kind of spoils the mood. One or two to give a relief is fine but not too many, which is the case here. My final verdict: Go watch this movie if u want to be scared, scared and scared.My rating: 9/10",The Nun
600,robinalers,Not what you want it to be,6,6 September 2018,"Let's begin with saying that the movie is definitely still worth the time to see. As there are a few moments where The Nun is portrayed in such a way that you do feel how great and powerful it is, and the music during these scenes (trust me, you will recognise them when you see them) is incredible. You'll feel hopeless, just as the characters at that time, but unfortunately these moments are scarce.As human being, we find darkness scary, we hate it because we cannot see properly and thus find ourselves in the unknown. This is what drives a good horror movie, it is why the first Paranormal Activity was such a success for example. The horror of things happening, but not knowing what it is or where it is. The Nun fails to deliver this horror of the unknown. As we, in almost all scenes, see what it is that should terrify us, in great and gory detail. And while I love a tip of the hat to a more old school type of horror (more gore and monstrous feelings), I do not like how The Nun delivers it.The amount of times we see a close up of the face of the nun is insane, and takes away the fear that this character had left us in during the Conjuring movies. It was the lack of screentime and the darkness surrounding this character that made her so extremely scary and interesting in those movies. It reminded me of the Devil's face in the original Exorcist movie. We don't see it often, but when we see it it terrifies us, because we cannot quite tell all the characteristics of its face, and it is always surrounded by darkness. The Nun is blatantly obvious, and her screaming in the camera makes it feel more like you're watching The Mummy, than The Nun.Then there's the writing, the addition of comic relief is a good idea, but the timing is always off and rarely funny. The storyline is a bit basic, a gateway to hell, again, a demon needs a body, again, our past haunts us, again; it delivers nothing we haven't seen already. And I don't mind that, but then at least deliver it with tenacity.
The jump scares feel as though they know that the audience knows its coming, so they just try to come at you from a different position than you expect: e.g., camera does a full 360, we expect something to happen, it doesn't and then something drops from above. No, the movie disappoints. The story is basic, the timing of humor is laughable and the excessive amount of screentime - for that which petrified us with hardly any in the Conjuring movies - makes the Nun into something we hoped it wouldn't be. And unfortunately the great scenery, actually horrifying scenes and amazing soundtrack just can't lift this movie beyond 'just another horror movie'.",The Nun

605,selaromyar,Nice! Addition to the Conjuring Universe.,8,8 September 2018,"Have to say that even though I watched this feature as a matinee, and it was still scary. It is not for the weak of heart. I went in with the expectation of a good entertaining film that will flesh out the origins if Valak and where it fits into the whole Conjuring Universe. I have to say that it did not disappoint at all. Not only was it photographed beautifully, the sound effects on point, and the music matched the scene perfectly, the story was perfect and it answered all of the questions that I had about this very important character. Sorry for those that want the movie to think for you, if you are, then this movie is not for you. If you find yourself as one of these types of movie goers, then this film is not for you. You are going to need to use your imagination, and think about what you are seeing in order to understand it. It is great roller-coaster ride, it adds to the Conjuring Universe's back story that is needed to make the other films connect with each other. This is film is most defiantly a standalone film; it is that complete in story and plot. Please no kiddies; this is defiantly an adult movie.",The Nun

It's derivative, predictable and resolutely not scary, unless perhaps you're 9. The dialogue is appalling - every clichéd Hollywood phrase is here - and the plot makes very little sense. The director tries to cover this by hurling a barrage of nonsensical set pieces at the audience, producing a film which manages to be too full of action and yet terribly boring at the same time. Really - avoid this. Unless you have a thing for wimples.",The Nun

611,linoayumu,Huge Letdown,4,14 December 2018,"Definitely not what I was expecting. The plot seemed to be hashed together in a time crunch- there was no substance, nothing to take away from, as if it was put together just to have something to fall back on. Most of the jump scares were unnecessary. They were there to fill in the empty space left by the lack of plot. And it's really a shame because the first Conjuring was amazing. It had everything a true supernatural horror should have. The Nun, however, seemed pointless.There were also so many instances where it felt like I was watching some low budget film. And those ill timed comedic one liners- what was that all about?Overall, if you haven't watched the previous Conjuring films this one might be not be so underwhelming. Or if you want something that doesn't require you to use any brain cells then this is what you're looking for.Not a horrible movie but I could have done something more entertaining with my time other than watching this mass collection of jump scares.",The Nun

613,hayovanderwolk,Despite huge potential to become a classic it didn't even come close,5,7 November 2018,"This movie is terrible. I hurts me to say this but its true. I love horror movies and I am a big fan of the Conjuring Franchise and James Wan. Wan already made the Nun so amazingly scary and populair that this should be a piece of cake for the director. I mean I didn't expect it te be as good as the Conjuring movies but hey what could go wrong?...... well apparently a lot. This is the first time I actually was sitting in the movie and thinking: this director is a true amateur. He doesn't understand anything about building up tension and definitly not about story telling. The movie is wayyyy too funny and that makes it already lose it's serious tone by the audience. But I also never even was scared, he shows the Nun so much that the element of mysterie is gone. And that is arguably the most important element of horror moviemaking. By making people see things that they do not understand or completly see, that scares people the most. Cause people fear what they don't understand. James Wan is the king of building tension, the scene of the Nun in 'the Conjuring 2' in the painting room is a brilliant piece of scene making. He builds the tension by having a cold and almost silent music in the backgroud with just a sound of a nun covering it. Then the shadow appears, again a lot of focus on the character till the jumpscare. This is just an example that shows how to make a scary scene. This movie on the other hand is full of clishé's and loud not scary music. The only good thing to say about this movie is that the cinematograpy was pretty good. There were some nice shots that were original, and the Nun was played well, but it couldn't save this movieI truly hope James Wan returns for the sequel.",The Nun

617,tjlisson,For Teenagers,3,16 September 2018,"OK but ultimately run-of-the-mill horror. The budget theater I saw this flick in was filled with noisy teenagers yacking and reacting throughout, which would have been a lot worse if I really thought I was missing much. There are a couple of other annoyances that seem to have gone over other people's heads here. For one, although the movie makes much of this being in Romania, and indeed it was filmed there, hardly anyone seems to actually be Romanian. What's really a bothersome anomaly, though, is that the convent and the people involved are Roman Catholic. Certainly there is Roman Catholicism in Romania, but generally only amongst ethnic minorities, especially Hungarians. Actual ethnic Romanians with any religious affiliation, however, almost always identify as Romanian Orthodox, and that is a very important distinction that any Romanian will immediately notice. People elsewhere may think that's no big deal, but just imagine you have a movie set in Italy and every one there is an Episcopalian. Don't you think those in the know would find that ridiculous?",The Nun
618,giaourti,It takes effort to be so ignorant.,1,15 December 2018,"I stopped watching the movie after the first 20 minutes.There are catholic convents on most countries around the world. Romania in the early 50s was NOT one of them. A little background: After WWII Romania became a Socialist Republic under the initial leadership of Gheorghiu-Dej. The Stalinist-minded regime that was established was extremely hostile to any and all religions. While they were somewhat lenient to the local orthodox church (which was merged with the church of Russia in an effort to control all religious organisations within Eastern Block countries), they were extremely hostile to all catholic institutions,, closing all schools and churches, while the Vatican itself was an enemy of the State.in the movie a Catholic priest goes to investigate the suicide of a nun in a CATHOLIC convent in Romania in 1952.I am not Romanian and therefore did not know all this background . It took me less than 30 minutes to find all the information on the matter and understand that the setting of this movie is not improbable, it is IMPOSSIBLE.

619,sycik18,All hype! Left swype!,5,5 September 2018,"Before you wonder why the title. To clarify the movie to me felt like a over hyped tinder profile, which on seeing more seems cliched and boring. I hate to be paying alot and having to force myself to liking a movie. This expected just that. A big let down to tje franchise and the director himself. It starts off with introducing the situation. Followed by the entrance of our 3 main characters. the first 20 mins seemed really slow and dragging. The movie lacked light! to the extend i got bugged with the screen. Hiding under the advantage of the dark the director tried to spook the audience but seemed to fail. It had a few moments that were nice and obviously jump scares that were good. But overall seemed like a rushed project. The graphics of the nun and the boy seemed to fake to evoke any fear. The environment and the nuns had a nice intense eerie feel but the biggest let down was the lack good cinematography and back story or premise to make a it a classic. The characters seemed half heartedly done with no depth except for the girl. James Wan seems to be cashing out on the conjuring movies only on the basis of hype. And is only in the cash than creating a classic. Which it could have been with such a good story. Such regret paying for this. I recommend you wait for it to come on tv if you are a die hard horror fan. This movie is for the masses who enjoy cheap thril and jump scares rather than a good story n depth in the premise and characters. Ill still go back to watching the Excorcist any day.

621,Chris_Cy,Good Conjuring Universe story but not really scary,6,7 September 2018,"In general the movie is a very good conjuring envolving story. The jump scares are not too scary because of the lack of suspence. They did not manage to build up suspence and a climate in general before the jump scare. When you wait for it and you know it's coming, you will not really feel scared at all. The best scary moment it was shown in the trailer. If this scene was kept in secret for the movie, it would have change my opinion a little bit. It was the best scary scene to show it in the trailer.
I am rating it 7/10 overall as a movie and 9/10 as a conjuring universe story. We learned a lot of details about the characters in this prequel which it was a very addition to the whole universe.

629,debrecenisrac38,"Et ressurexit tertia die, secundum Scripturas... or let's hope it happens",6,21 April 2019,"I rarely do reviews anymore, since most of the time I just watch movies for fun. I go so far to the wall that if a plot and execution generally captivates me, I can give them a pass on such arthouse solutions, like the two protagonists watching literally an empty wall for the last five minutes of the movie. This might gauge how patient I am.Then, along comes this movie... In the '70s and '80s there used to be a trend called mondo filmmaking that capitalized on the duality of the Western world being physically cut off from regions they were familiar with (Soviet satellite states) and being in one camp with former colonies they didn't care to learn. That's how when Cannibal Holocaust advertised animal cruelty, the filmmakers had to testify that it was actually just fiction.This is where the story's first cardinal sin comes in: if you claim to write a story based on actuality then you can't have it both ways by setting in the Transylvania most only know from Bram Stoker books. That's an insult to the intelligence of people from there, who used to live and the moviegoers too.The second cardinal sin comes in the form of a missed opportunity. The communist secret police in 1952, when Romania, like any other country under Soviet occupation, was totally cut off from the Vatican (oh hai nonsensical plot, you're my favorite customer), committed so many unspeakable horrors that the story was practically a low hanging fruit: make the villagers authentically hate outsiders, so that the protagonists can't decide between being spied on, followed and attempted to be turned into their agent, what are genuine human mind games, and what are works of a demon?Before I venture onto the third point: the argument ""just enjoy the movie for what it is, lay back and don't think too much"", I present this counterargument: because during writing The Conjuring 2 the authors were more familiar with England, they went to painstaking lengths to recreate it. Bear in mind even though Sokovia doesn't exist, the MCU pulled off a convincing generic Eastern European country.Maurice Theriault...in today's world where immigration has become again a political tool used to stoke fear into the hearts and minds of people... the only way a Westerner was allowed to move as freely as he did back then is that he was a confidential informant on the outside (and on the inside, sister Ouda). American Catholics don't care much for this since they've not yet given a pope, but the appointment of the later John Paul II caused concern the Soviets are just playing a long con by keeping opposition alive (a tactic used under Stalin after the war), so the Vatican was well aware that the Soviets will turn local churches into spying servitude (and they were right). Pretty much the basic premise doesn't make sense, it should have been set after Billy Graham held his crusade there.There are two factors for a big anti-American sentiment in Eastern Europe, one's economic, and less grounded than the second which is criticism in the lack of agency. Heck, Comrade Detective was a comedy and that was way more authentic.The only thing this movie has accomplished that it has shown the medieval infrastructural beauty and the picturesque landscape of the region.",The Nun
630,j_glentzes,The best Hollywood horror film in years.,10,25 March 2019,"I can't help but smile at some of the negative reviews. Let's get one thing out of the way....""the nun"" is not like the conjuring films. In fact it bears no resemblance to most American or Japanese (some folks even compare it to...Ju on loooool) horror films. This is a film strictly inspired by eurohorror , mostly Italian horror films of the late seventies/early eighties. There is a very dense and creepy atmosphere that uses every cliche in the book, foggy cemeteries, creepy castles, scary woods. The whole movie feels like a Fulci film , even some scenes are straight from ""city of the living dead"" like the hanging of the nun in the beginning or the coffin scene. There are no real jump scares, the movie shows surrealistic monsters and entities without trying to make you jump scare through fast cuts, the scenes with monsters are drawn out and intense not ""blink an eye and you will miss them"" jump scare scenes. The movie is like an American version of ""dark waters"" (like another reviewer correctly points out the Russian-italian film not the Korean one) or ""the church"" but since most people haven't actually watched these films they don't know what they are talking about. If your definition of good horror is lost footage movies like ""paranormal activity"" (like many people are mentioning this atrocity as an example of...good horror) or pseudo ""artsy"" stuff with trash stories like hereditary then stay away from the nun. If you want a nice homage to the surrealistic/nightmarish atmosphere of Italian horror films of the past with good production values and jaw dropping photography then this movie is for you.

The things I liked in this film was the premise; it had the best premise of the franchise, Wonderful Music and the portyal of The Nun. The story of the film is very decent and straightforward due to which it doesn't create a tense situation and fails miserably. The direction was average as the movie went on a rampage of loud jump scares. Surely horror fans will love it but it has no sense in it. What I could have wanted more was the more running time. This film is very short but it's scale is enormous. I think Corbin Hardy could have used the Abbey to make it more scary and could have given some more time in the history rather than running of people all around. Also the thing i hated was use of the funny element in this movie which makes it a horror comedy rather than a serious horror film.This one gets 7/10 for its premise, music, acting and just ok screenplay.",The Nun

This movie uses witchcraft and the pentagram as symbols of evil, which is furthest from the truth in real life. This movie had no plot, nothing exciting or scary. It used jump scares to try to provoke scare in the audience. It failed miserably.The sad thing is that pestle watch these types of movies and believe that demons are real.

The beginning is very promising for a dark horror movie.but then story lacks something. it is huge.then it became a low budget 90's horror screen play except the background.they make The Nun into a Screaming Zombie Ghost. WTH was that?The trailer was hyped for see this movie and they let me down.

651,carlos-glz026,Worst entry in the series by far,4,10 September 2018,"The Nun, the most recent entry in The Conjuring universe is bad, terrible i'll dare to say. I always go to the movies with an open mind, i mean, i never go in expecting to love or hate a movie. But honestly, after the dissapointing Annabelle Creation, my expectations were kinda low.On the good side, the movie's setting is pretty great, but sadly they didn't take advantage of the site. They decided instead to fill the movie with ""shocking images"" and lots of very cheap and forgettable scares. Also, showing the nun standing like a dummy in a dark hallway it's just not scary by itself. It gets old fast.Demián Bichir and the lovely Taissa Farmiga are very well in their roles, but sadly their performances can't save a lazy, predictable and suspense-free script. And by the end the movie gets completely ridiculous; demons and possesed nuns getting blown up with a shotgun and everything. And there's also some bizarre and cringy humor in some scenes that feels completely out of place.At the beggining of the movie they state that ""the following events took place in 1952"". Really? Am I supposed to believe this happened? I mean, come on, i i know they will always take liberties with stories ""based on true events"", but this is just ridiculous.I will rate this even lower than the first Annabelle, which was pretty bad.

 Nothing but jump-scares, a really messy story and cliches-a-plenty, this film really could have been great but isn't. Even the few ""cool"" moments seem out of place and scares and suspense is all over the place. How many times do we need to see the scary shadow of a nun walk somewhere and disappear?

The Nun is one of the best horror movies necessitating jump scares in the past few years. Jump-scared scenes are necessary in every horror movie, so when I saw one of the lowbrow review on this website saying ""too many jump scares"", I laughed loudly, almost making my condo collapse. Too many ? Really ? OK, even if there are too many jump scares (which is not), they are good and reasonable jump scares.The settings of the film are holy great that it can attract audiences' attention on every moment in this movie. The only problem in this movie is, unlike the other movies in Conjuring Universe, the ghost, the Nun, is somewhat corporeal but she can do something incorporeal thing can do. In this case, the Nun is different than other ghosts in CU ,which makes me feel she is not a part of enemies of Mr. and Mrs.Warren.",The Nun

However, the film was a bit of a disappointment for me. The Conjuring franchise is fantastic for horror fans, and this is a disservice to the world. The film had good sound and was shot quite well. I thought the special effects were done very well too. However it is one of those releases that fails to meet expectations and falls into the category of just another mediocre and cliched horror release due to the overuse of jump scares and a weak story-line. Also I don't feel as though the comedic relief worked in the film.",The Nun
667,chelsietristany,When Devil Meets Zombie,7,9 September 2018,"First of all, I want to state that this is a personal critics. You may agree or disagree with me. 
Since Conjuring 2 where we can catch a glimpse of Valak from the photograph, I was really excited for The Nun. But after I watched it in the cinema, I'm a little bit disappointed. The Nuns' ghosts looks like zombie apocalypse. I mean it. The first thing that came to my mind when I saw their ghosts are, 'what? Are they zombies?'. 
The jump scares are predictable too. We can predict when will the jump scare happens. And even though some makes me 'jump' a little bit, but it's not that scary. The thing that made me 'jump' isn't how scary the jump scare, but how loud the audio is. 
It turns out to be very comedic whenever Maurice a.k.a Frenchie is on the screen. I like him though, I think he's (apart from being hot and handsome) but also loyal and brave. No matter how scary the things they're going to face, he never left Sister Irene and Father (I forgot his name, sorry). It's such a shame that in the end he's possessed. 
Next, some things are still confusing to me. Well, they make some facts unpredictable and it is fun to discover it. For example, the key. I've always thought the key is used to open the door to 'other world a.k.a the spirits world whatsoever', but it turns out that they key is used to take Jesus' blood that will be used to defeat the devil even as strong as Valak. The thing that puzzles me is about the crack that is claimed to be the gate to hell and the spirit world. If the crack is existed, then what is the function of that door? How can the door appears? The crack existed because a duke opened it. And that's another thing. I was wondering why the duke opened it. Some things are left untold. I don't know whether they're going to make a next movie or not, and if yes, whether they'll answer these questions or not. 
The conclusion is, this isn't the type of horror movie that will make you scream. It does make you jump a little bit if you watch it in the cinema because the audio is awfully loud. And it won't give you the 'scared-to-go-to-bathroom-in-the-middle-of-the-night' aftereffect like some real scary horror movies. Some movies leave you aftereffect, but The Nun? I felt nothing. It's good, not bad, but it's not satisfying enough for me who have waited for it for so long.",The Nun
668,theisland2,What a letdown!,2,15 September 2018,"I hate that this lacks the James Wan vibe, which we could find in the Conjuring series; The build-up to nothing for example, or the completely random jumpscares. For me, they just didn't work. At least most of them.The jumpscares (which were the only way to make this movie somewhat interesting for the majority of viewers) make up for the fact that the plot doesn't go anywhere, nor making any sense at all.Some scenes were interesting however, for example when the nun hangs herself in the beginning of the movie. The intro was actually not bad at all in my opinion.
There were some very cringeworthy moments in this movie as well, for example Frenchie. His small cheesy jokes out of nowehere appeard all over the movie, for no reason at all. The jokes were bad as well :(I did have hopes for this movie, but it didn't work out at all.",The Nun

Are you serious? I literally jumped out of the chair more than a few times. I am a true horror fan and I don't get easily scared by horror movies. Trust me, I'm the type of person who watches horror movies just tp relax. The film was scary, James Wan delivered what he promised. Great prequal (or spinoff) of the conjuring movies. Taissa Farmiga was great as sister Irene. And the actress playing the nun? Oh my God, she did such a good job on scarying the s*** out of her audience.

The shots are often very bad and the scenography does not make the idea of the horror setting in which the facts occur. Good interpretation of Taissa Famiga (but it's obvious: she is both a veteran of the series ""American Horror Story"" and the sister of Vera Famiga aka Lorraine Warren) and the ending that provides a clearer light on the two chapters of The Conjuring. The reason that led to the success at the box office? The enormous success of The Conjuring 2: the audience liked Valak and did not hesitate to go and see a film focused on her (but it seems all a mockery: the demon does not appear much more often than in The Conjuring 2 and the few scenes are clearly inspired from the aforementioned film).",The Nun

One of my favourite movies.
I forgot to mention that this movie is pure horror. You need to be a true fan to understand it. Also, the fact that valak had so much power even though the demon was surrounded by hundreds of crosses gave me chills. What i did not like is that the juat contained the evil and not lock it.

The atmosphere of the romanian landscape is haunting and beautiful. The Abbey itself, hidden away in the forested mountains is a hauntingly beautiful character on it's own. The story though simple has enough promise and should have been entertaining. However the movie falls flat each time the Nun starts to haunt and harass the main cast. It reminded me of Evil Dead 2 a lot. The encounters are simply over the top and laughably noisy with the Nun always growling and the protagonist screaming all the damn time. However where Evil Dead 2 did this on purpose, in the Nun it's simply bad directing and in my opinion a gross misunderstanding of what makes a movie scary. LESS IS MORE!! It feels like the movie had everything going for it, great antagonist, great setting, beautiful visuals and a decent enough story. Unfortunately it fell into the wrong hands and I can only dream of how it would have turned at the hands of a more capable director. I give it a six for effort.",The Nun

The setting was perfectly historic and creepy and the novitiate was utterly convincing, but a sizable amount of potential was left sorely untapped. Why was Valak chosen to be summoned from hell? What is his story? The investigation into the suicide and subsequent findings seemed fractured and hurried, and parts near the end should have been spread out earlier in the movie. For example, the unholy army of faceless nuns in the passageway that was disbanded by the priest lighting a burning cross on the floor scared me. They absolutely shouldn't have been saved that long when the movie was sorely lacking other-than-jump-scares. Also, it would have been far, far scarier for Valak to enter the priest's coffin from the bottom and slowly crawl up his body, than to have it simply show up behind his head and start strangling him. It seemed like The Nun showed up too often and too predictably, yet not enough and too randomly. An eye peeking around a corner would have eventually been scarier than knowing he would show up whenever there was a mirror nearby. And, the demonic child attacking the priest was just distracting and annoying.

The director even messed up the day/night cycles, which just makes the story even more ridiculous.The character Frenchie leaves at night, then we are given day time with the other 2, then it goes back to Frenchie like it was that same night, then a new night comes, but the 2 treat it as the first night there, and then Frenchie comes back like it was all in the same night. No explanation or words are given from the characters to represent any time anomaly, so it falls on just piss poor writing/directing.We all came here for an explanation on the demon known as Valek. We are left still not having any knowledge of this demon, and even more questions.
Things in the movie happen in a way that says Valek is 10x stronger than Satan himself, but again no reason as to why.The scares are all cheap jump scares that are telegraphed so slowly they lose all effect.I gave it one star. For the massive budget they have, and a healthy series with the Conjuring one would expect something much better. I have seen horror films with a budget 5% of ""The Nun"", and they are much better.",The Nun
704,hudsonmichaud,Scary but could have been even scarier.,7,5 May 2021,"I will say the nun is absolutely terrifying. The plot in general is a little scary but I feel like it's a little thin. The movie relies on loud jump scares with a terrifying nun. Not much else is that scary. It doesn't have the same scares as the other conjuring films, but I would watch it again. I don't get the 2 or 3 star ratings, it deserves at least a 6!PROS: Creepy nun, decent jump scares, average acting, good camera work and nice special effects.CONS: Thin plot, mediocre movie compared to other the conjuring filmsI would suggest this movie, but it's not something I could re-watch a lot of times like the other films from the conjuring franchise.",The Nun

706,martitah_1,Less is more,3,7 September 2018,"I don't know what's wrong with horror movies lately but I feel that the directors feel the need to exaggerate when it comes to jumpscares and near ridiculous scenes where the visual effects are way too much and eliminate the creepy atmosphere that a horror movie is supposed to have. You end up saying things like: ""What in the world did the guys who made this movie smoke before doing this?!""
Anyway, the acting could be a lot better. I feel like the only decent actress there was Taissa Farmiga. The lines/script could also have been a LOT better and we could have done well without the humor and silly jokes that they tried to fit in...It was lazy writing! Even though it was mostly a bad movie for me, there are still positive points to be made. The visuals are very good as well as the sound effects. And honestly, the Nun character (Valak) is still pretty awesome even if the rest of the movie failed when it came to do its job which was to scare us.",The Nun

708,walk929501,Realistic rating,6,18 December 2018,"Why are IMDB reviewers so extreme? Is it an attempt to balance out the other extreme? One and two stars should be reserved for movies with the absolute worst acting, writing, effects, and production values. This movie doesn't deserve that. Nine and ten stars should be reserved for the absolute best achievements in film. This film clearly doesn't deserve that either. Six seems about right at barely above average. Since the number on IMDB currently sits at 5.5, maybe the two extremist reviews do cancel either other out.The Nun is no Conjuring/2 and here's a simple comparison: in The Nun, the nun opens her mouth wide a lot, blasts people against walls by doing so, and physically assaults people. That is supposed to be scary. In Conjuring 2, we see a dim image of the nun combined with camera motion and music...and it sends a chill of dread down the spine. That's the difference.",The Nun

You would never imagine a theatre full of people laughing at the climax of a horror movie. that's what exactly happened with The Nun. Some 10 minutes remaining in the movie and Frenchie cracks a joke and the whole theatre bursts out with laughter! amazing!

However, younger Farmiga is a natural I think. She played her role very well. I'm a big fan of her older sister. It was refreshing to see her younger sister play her younger character in this film.

720,ymandayawon,The Nun Review,4,18 December 2018,"The Nun is directed by Corin Hardy and is the new addition to The Conjuring Universe. It stars Taissa Farmiga, Demián Bichir, and Jonas Bloquet and tells the story of Father Burke (Bichir) and a nun in her novitiate (Farmiga) as they uncover a secret involving a demon nun lurking around a monastery in 1952 Romania.As unsettling the title character is as she was introduced in The Conjuring 2, the film doesn't offer much to keep us on the edge of the seats. The over-reliance on jumpscares and a weak narrative really bogged down the film's potential. Inconsistent logic is present throughout while following almost every horror trope we've come to know and expect.The use of jumpscares may be startling for some but it's so reliant on it you forget you're watching a movie and not a bunch of 20 second horror videos in YouTube. Most jumpscares used involve a build up, such as a pan, and startling sound effects rape your ears along with the supposed ""scare"" showing on the screen. The plot is also very predictable I don't even have to tell anymore. There's also an exposition scene explaining how the horrors began for the sake of the plot. It's exactly how you think it will be. Just with some surprising scenes.Speaking of surprising scenes, there are some that actually work. The cinematography is good, creepy atmosphere done right, and the performances are really praiseworthy. With those positives, certain scenes in the film tend to give you goosebumps.The cast performed well but the characters aren't really developed enough. The most compelling character present is sister Irene, played by Farmiga. There's also one character who's only there for comic relief. Sure, he helps drive the plot along but that's only it. His character is so flat he's mostly just there for humor, which at times work. Father Burke is also an interesting character. We learn about his past through exposition and we actually tend to care about him.This film is just bad and an unworthy entry to the franchise. It had so much potential but got severely wasted due to reliance of jumpscares and poor writing. The title character wasn't even intimidating, and that's saying something.-Yman Dayawon",The Nun
721,wayofthemetal,Spooky and toned fun,8,14 September 2018,"Overall I liked The Nun it was a spooky fun movie with some pretty good shots and scenes (lighting, camera angles, and such). The transitions from one scene to another was a bit off and the story overall had a more fantasy tone over the more grounded and realistic tone The Conjuring and Annabelle movies had. Much of the story felt like it was just forced to setup a shot or scene which does hurt it. It isn't a perfect movie but I'd watch it again. It is like Indiana Jones meets Silent Hill. None of the character actors felt out of place or superficial either, I really appreciate that. Everyone felt believable and natural to their roles and environment, not forced.",The Nun
722,adventure7,Pretty average...,3,8 September 2018,"I really like The Conjuring Universe. The first Conjuring i think it works on some levels, but at the end it's just another film about a family moving in a creepy old possesed house. The second one i think is the best of all. It had a great story, creative scares and all around great atmosphere and good characters. The first Anabelle is trash, the second one i would say is a little above average. It had something to offer, but it wasn't horror triumph.And now we come to the spin-off to the great The Conjuring 2 with the creepy nun Valak. I wasn't very excited about that movie, although a saw it based on what James Wan did as a producer with his other movies, the Nun as a character as i found her very effective in The Conjuring 2 and all around just because i am a horror fan. I am very dissapointed to say that this movie was painfully average and boring. It's very repetitive. A shadow! Lets follow it through the dark hallways with a candle. Boo, jumpscare. That's the whole film. At one point it just became a cliched exorcism jesus-christ-yelling extravaganza.It had great atmosphere, good acting, some great shots and visual effects, but that's all.

729,A-G-Deac,"Clicheic, Predictable, Uneven...",4,6 September 2018,"Corin Hardy's ""The Nun"" represents an uncreative mess of modern horror clichés. Everything from inverted crosses to bloody pentagrams is present in the prequel to the popular ""Conjuring"" franchise. 
Don't get me wrong; it would be absurd to expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece of cinema. But this is not the case. All we wanted as cinephiles was a movie which did not insult our intelligence. What did we get instead? Spit. Yes, we got ""spit"".As a movie-goer I can accept many bad aspects of a movie and still appreciate the final picture as long as there is entertainment value. We can ignore the fact that the people from a Romanian village all speak English (also in the year 1953), sure, but can we also ignore how the blood of Christ is involved in ""ritual"" which is not even fully explained? That's a little too much to ask from your audience. How did the original owners of the artifact get the blood? Why wasn't the castle guarded? Why would 2000 crosses be more effective than a single one? These are questions which will never be answered, and I'm pretty sure nobody really has the answers.""The Nun"" also has little to no value as a prequel to the original franchise. The movie has too much ""Nun"" and not enough ""Valak"". It speaks too much (well, not that much really) about the new characters and too little about the central figure of the story. The plot got boring very fast because it did not contain what everybody hoped to finally find somewhere, hidden in all the unnecessary humour which destroyed even the smallest track of gothic atmosphere.It wasn't an all terrible experience though. I laughed. I laughed because of the brainless characters and their predictable actions. I laughed at the mirrors because I knew there was a jumpscare just around the corner.

The whole story with the blood of Christ was simply to much for me. I actually expected a lot more from a movie which saga had such a great reputation in the horror movies world, in my opinion, the fact tha Wan was not the director of the movie this time has a lot to do with the final perception the people get from the movie, somehow I was used to the smooth sequences with the grand finale Wan creates.

The Nun starts really well. It was good enough for the first 15 minutes. It's a shame the movie getting worse as the time goes by. 
This movie depends a lot to Valak's popularity and jumpscares. She was iconic character from The Conjuring 2 and people are curious enough about her story. She left a good impression in the previous movie but not on this one. 
And the jumpscare(s).., are too easy to be predicted. Just as the usual cliche horror movie.

756,willismagilous,Absolutely no plot whatsoever,1,21 February 2020,"The whole movie is nothing more than an accumulation of ""spooky"" camera angles and jump scares with a plot twist that makes no sense.Most notable is the inconsistency and ambiguities behind the Nun's abilities and motivation. She epitomized a handlebar mustache antagonist who does scary things to be scary with no real reason behind them. The ""plot"" alludes that her goal is to rid the chapel (I forget it's technical title), yet there's a scene in which she teleports him into. She offers him means of escape tho, by tying an outside bell to his finger/to a (I don't recall which). Further more, his company somehow hears him screaming and the bell ringing from thousands of feet away, inside the large chapel. If she has the ability to literally alter space and matter, what possible threat do two mere humans pose? Why not just kill them with your clearly unlimited power and be done with it? Yet, somehow they priest and the accompanying, human nun (who's purpose for being present is simply to be a plot device) win.Or so you think...? After tussling with the Nun and some peasant boy, another plot device who's absent for so long I forgot he existed, the Nun is defeated when the human nun spits Jesus' blood (which is a wholly other, dare I say stupid backstory). Immediately after, the movie reveals that the Nun possesses the peasant boy during the scuffle, despite a super, overdramatic death scene the Nun displays.Is she physical, or not? If not, then the whole goal of splashing Jesus' blood means nothing, which means the whole main plot is a waste of time. If she is, then it shouldn't be possible for her to dodge the Jesus Blood spit, and frankly, the film mostly alludes to her being a powerful, physical entity. If she has the power to be either, unbound by the laws and restrictions of either side, I say again that the two/three humans shouldn't have lived for an hour, let alone days and enough time to discover her weakness.Frankly, I don't think even the writers know the answer to these questions. The whole movie feels like they wrote a very broad, generic outline of ideas and didn't bother writing a draft before filming. The characters are flat and boring, and the antagonist feels more like an ugly prankster than a menacing, demonic entity. I feel I have to admit that I actually find the Nun's design scary at face value, and I like the idea of a conjoined horror universe, but these movies ruin the possibilities the designs and ambitious ideas offer. I feel they could improve the conjoined universe concept by perhaps employing a more cosmic or monster horror instead of paranormal, and it is imperative they replace they enlist better writers if they want the Conjuring universe to survive.",The Nun

Some of the scenarios in the movie, (without going into detail) are very well done and genuinely scary. The scares are also a bit unpredictable and led to some nervous laughter in the theater I watched this in. Having said that, the plot could definitely could have been better and the entire movie could have been tightened up in the editing room- a lot of the time was spent waiting for something to happen. Some of the decisions the characters make are also not entirely logical (splitting up instead of staying together while entering dark spaces).

775,sara-rn,Nun's cameo in The Conjuring was Scarier than the whole movie,3,29 December 2018,"I was mega hyped for this movie, religious figures terrify me and the nun's appearance in the second Conjuring movie left an impression on me.To get to the point, this movie has all the ingredients to be scary. The setting, a monastery in the middle of nowhere, a powerful demon, ghosts, forests, cemeteries. Yet it chooses to rely on jump scares. The whole time. It becomes exhausting after half an hour and I was more annoyed than anything else.There are also so many incoherent moments. It's in the middle of an obscure European village in the start of the 20th century and yet everyone speaks English. There's a running joke about French Canadian people throughout the whole movie, this attempt at humour worms itself in scenes which are supposedly tense and left me confused. Was I missing something?The nun herself makes very small appearances and since I was tired from the chaotic built of the jump scares, it wasn't even effective. She gets hyped up to be the ultimate form of evil yet the ending makes me think of her as nothing but pathetic lol.Also, like I mentioned before the movie is incoherent. At times it crowbars humor where it shouldn't be. Other times it tries to be Indiana Jones or a Medieval Templar adventure (I actually couldn't believe the shift in tone).Oh, also they missed a chance to explicitly establish a connection between the character Taissa Farmiga plays here and Vera Farmiga's character in The Conjuring. They never explain how they're connected or how one character develops into the other...?The last scene killed it for me. Whoever thought that was a good idea, you need to be fired. Screw you.Don't pay to see this movie. Please.TL;DR It's exhausting, cheap jumpscares, nun is weak, weird humour, shifts in tone. Nonsensical.",The Nun
776,jakem376,"Not what you'd expect from a ""Conjuring Universe"" Film",6,14 May 2020,"The Nun is chronologically the first time in the ""Conjuring Universe"" I had such high expectations for this film as ""The Conjuring"" is one of the best horrors I've ever seen! However The Nun was a little disappointing.Firstly I feel that Nuns are way to over used in horror films nowadays and it would have been nice to see a difference antagonist that your average nun. The character of the nun is physically scary, the makeup and overall look is very good for a horror and they could have done so much with this film and could have made it one of the scariest films ever but it seemed to just be a little meh. The jump scares are very predictable and the lead up to the scare takes so long you know exactly when it's going to happen. If you're like me and have seen hundreds of horrors this film will be very easy to predict.The acted is very good and all the characters are played well, I do feel that the male priest is a little redundant as he didn't have much of an influence in the ending of the film.The ending is okay, I like the idea of using the blood of Christ To kill her is very good but it just seems a little... far fetched. Now I know the whole idea is far fetched but for a film based in ""The Conjuring Universe"" which is supposedly based on true events I don't think it suited the aesthetic very well.As for the nun itself, she is pretty rubbish. She doesn't really have much of a physical presence in the film and all she really does is scream and stare at you. Then when she attacks Frenchie she starts to speak perfect English and then calls him Frenchie, now I'm not an expect but do ghosts normally make conversation? I prefer for ghosts to not talk at all It shows they're more inhuman.Overall it's definitely a film to watch if you want to understand the whole universe but if you're looking for a film for fright night then this isn't the one.",The Nun

780,orale_kapow,"A Sincere, Yet Atmospheric, Mess",4,7 September 2018,"Storyline was incredibly rushed and it felt like the final showdown between the Nun and Sister Irene was just tacked on in order to wrap up the movie. What made the first Conjuring film so amazing was its focus on the characters. Like the film The Exorcist, the storyline focuses on the love and trust in ones faith to overcome the evil that entrenched their lives. You cared about the characters and believed in their redemption. The Nun, on the other hand, tried to use this plot device when discussing Father Burke's past and tried to make us sympathize with him this way. It failed miserably. It didn't work and the scene meant to give context to his demeanor and approach to the Nunnery was too rushed. Although Bichir and Farmiga gave good performances, it was the lack of a coherent narrative that really killed the film's potential. The jump scares were predictable and the only chilling scene would have to be the one where Sister Irene is in the chapel praying with the other nuns. I don't begrudge horror films that rely on jump scares - some movies effectively use them to their advantage. However, this film was just too jumbled and the character's quick one-liners were expected to be the foundation by which their personalities and dimensions were built upon. Just really disappointing. Save your money and wait to watch it at home.",The Nun

787,resident_evil_freak,"Ehh. Not good, but not bad either.",5,8 September 2018,"What an unnecessary movie. Its the 5th film in the Conjuring franchise and is set 20 years before the first one. After a Nun in Romania commits suicide, a Priest and a Nun in training are sent there to figure out what happened. This film had a great and interesting idea, with a pretty creepy atmosphere to it, but honestly. This film did absolutely nothing for me. It has a very strong, disturbing, and good start to the film, but after that opening scene, it drops, and gets kinda boring for a while. It builds the movie up which is fine, its just not interesting. Like alot of stuff in this film i didn't care at all what was going on. Its got some good creepy imagery in it, and the after they get to this castle (or whatever it is) i found it to be pretty solid, but again it just got uninteresting to me. Theres also some comedy thrown in there, which I'll admitt worked for the most part, but it hardcore felt out of place. Its not scary at all, not even a little stressful. Theres a couple of moments that kinda got to me, but other then that it wasnt at all frightening. Theres also a good amount of jump scares. None of which worked, and they were all 100% predictable. The three main characters were all okay. The priest is like any other priest in a horror film. Sent in to investigate a demon and has a dark past, not very original. Sister Irene played by Taissa Farmiga is probably the most interesting character in the film. She tends to have visions and i guess thats why she was sent there, but other then that shes again just a basic character, with little to no backstory. Then theres the guy who took them to this place and orginally found the dead nun. They call him Frenchie, and hes the comedic relief, and he at times resembles Brandon Frasiers character from The Mummy. I again didn't really care all that much for the characters, but ill say the acting was spot on. Perfomance wise they all did a really good job. I also have to praise the set design and the cinematography in this. The movie visually looked so damn good. It gave off this really dark and creepy atmosphere. Oh and the Nun demon.. ehh. I'll say in The Conjuring 2, her little part in that was damn stressful, and creppy as hell. In this shes kinda all over the place and you see her alot, and it really takes the scare factor out if it after the first 30 minutes or so. Overall, The Nun had a really good idea for a film, soild performances, and super creepy visuals and atmosphere. Just with average characters, some out of place laughs, very boring and uninteresting story, and not scary at all, with extremely predictable jump scares. I didn't hate this movie, i wouldn't even say its bad. Its just okay. Im gonna give The Nun a 5/10. If your keeping up with the franchise then yeah go check it out.

The nun's full face was seen too early and so there was no mystery left for the rest of the movie. It would kind of attack people sometimes and then would disappear until suddenly the humans banished it or whatever happened. Considering it's meant to be this real powerful evil force it was quite easy to kill.HOWEVER. There are lots of jump scares which if you enjoy them (which I do, even though my friend sat next to me hit me every time it made her jump) it is a plus and there are some moments where it is genuinely scary. It also links up very nicely at the end to the first conjuring which I appreciated.

Having the filming take place on location in Romania definitely added something special, and the setting was something we haven't seen in the franchise so far. But unfortunately that is where this The Nun's uniqueness ends. The plot teased a lot of exposition, but seemed to breeze past it in order to get to the next predictable scare, (and they were very predictable). Almost all of the scares were either something we've seen elsewhere in the franchise, or something we've seen elsewhere in this movie. I was really hoping we would get some serious lore on both the setting and the villain, but it was far from the focus of this movie.If you are a fan of the series, or enjoy the Wan/Flanagan brand of horror, don't skip this more than mediocre entry in The Conjuring franchise.

But it leans on an overkill of spectacle and on the way I became less invested and lost track of the story.The Nun feels like a fun thrillride in a ghost house on a fair. But the kind you wanted to get out of much earlier than possible.",The Nun

The key to keeping the Nun mysterious and frightening would have been to keep her at a distance.

813,terrencej31,Disappointing,3,10 September 2018,I wanted to explain my poor rating of this movie in detail.I was disappointed... The score was amazing as well as effects. The end of the movie explains everything but this film was a brutal film for me to watch. I purchased the D-Box seating and it did help the experience slightly. Also there was no explanation of how the gun came to be. SPOILER ALERT The nun from Annabelle Creation was running from something. She knew about the nun and yet they did not tie the story in with her which I felt was a big mistake. This movie would have been so much better if she played in this film. It would have tied Annabelle Creation together.Even if she had a small role it would have been great to find out why she left and eventually start helping the girls that played in the movie. Also any short back story on how this none you came evil would have been nice but there was no creativity or thought. Just a rush job with a ton of jump-scares which only a few working in the beginning of the movie. Least favorite of The Conjuring franchise.,The Nun
814,tyrael84,Loved the Conjuring franchise - super excited despite reasonable expectations - very disappointed.,4,8 September 2018,"The title says it all. I loved the Conjuring franchise. Their weakest link was Annabelle due largely to bad acting and general boredom and lack of continuity. The two Conjuring movies and Annabelle: Creation, fantastic fun. If you agree with that baseline opinion of the franchise then you should probably continue reading. If not, you probably don't care about my opinion.I put a lot of stock into IMDB ratings. I check every single movie on IMDB for ratings and reviews before even entertaining the idea of watching it. I have been excited for The Nun ever since I knew it was a thing especially given a couple names associated with it such as James Wan. I was skeptical of Annabelle: Creation initially because you just never know at what point someone is going to make a crap money grab off the coattails of a successful franchise but with Annabelle: Creation I was very delightfully pleased. All of these movies deliver jump scares - it comes with the territory. The most redeeming aspects of these movies is of course the acting and plot lines but what's more is setting a general mood of terror and suspense. Outside of the jump scares you should be WANTING to see what happens next. You should feel uneasy and creeped out. A perfect recent example is Hereditary. At a point, at least halfway through this movie none of those feelings were there for me.This is absolutely a money grab. They inserted comic relief into the film in not only a very boring and lacking way but inserted WAY too much. It was very clearly excessive and wasn't even clever writing. The comedic timing was way off. At a point it felt like they were trying too damn hard to be an Army of Darkness but without all the redeeming qualities. The last 1/3 of the movie was largely riddled with out of place, unfunny lines delivered by a character I'm not even sure should have been in the film.The jump scares were at best average due to the high predictability. I was genuinely surprised at how many people jumped at these scares in the theater. I realized after the lights came up that it was largely due to the inordinate amount of parent-supervised teenagers.Lastly, what positives I walked away with regarding The Nun were few and far between. The Nun received a good amount of screen time relatively speaking, but somehow they cheapened the entire facade of the demon nun by HOW they presented her. They made her very 1-dimensional and as opposed to expanding on the demon's powers and history they instead decided to show you basically what you've already seen of her but more of it in an unoriginal fashion to the point that just seeing her face began to get monotonous. It was cheesy, campy and didn't take itself serious at all unlike the fantastic other films in the franchise (except Annabelle). I gave it a 4 only because I still love the idea of the demon nun and I'll hold out hope for some sort of re-imagining though I won't hold my breath.",The Nun

816,Randy_McNab,It is 'nun' too good. (none too good),3,8 September 2018,"First off, I will explain something about my preferences for horror movies. If it is heavy CGI, overly 'made up' demons or just silly, then I am not a fan - think the Darth Maul demon from Insidious or even Pennywise from the 'IT' remake. 
I prefer a good plot that causes the viewer to think or realistic horror - Jack Torrence with an axe. Around 20 minutes into this movie, we have our first heavy CGI 'scare' and unfortunately it is not the last. Each is worse than the one it succeeds. The movie is filled with jump scares. Jump scares have their place but they do not last. If they are used well and sparingly, they are good; this movie relies heavily on them and it is not to build tension or keep the viewer guessing.If it were not for the ending, Frenchie's character would be considered a pointlessly overused character. However, they have a decent answer for his involvement so it could be forgiven. What cannot be forgiven is his character's traits and the attempted use of humour. This movie had potential. A priest sent to investigate a suicide in a secluded abbey in Romania during the 1950s. It could have been so much more. Maybe I have lost touch with horror movies; when The Conjuring 2 received a 7.4 iMDB rating, I think I have.",The Nun

818,myrdhen-37-848248,Boringly numbness,3,8 November 2018,"I've have a thing about looking for IMDB and the rating when I watched a horror movie. I love the genre but it is a genre with a lot of terrible movies. I use to go over 5 or more if I should see a movie at all. Ok, so there are many movies that are worse than this one. But when the movie is about one of the horrific characters in the stories about the Warrens (the couple comes from real life and the conjuring movie and also amityville are from supposedly ""happenings"" they encountered) this movie doesn't even make a five for me. The music and sound is cheap and rings falsely in my ears. I was a bit tired to the James wan thing even before but this one is only waste of time and money. They were milking everything about conjuring and insidious and Wan were doing the same thing over and over again. I almost get the feeling of hubris from the director. In this movie, well he's not doing a big part but still got a hand in the story.
The story was nonexistent and boring. The actors were a snore pill. I'm a big fan of AMS. The first season were amazing and I loved everything about the series. Beside Taissa. I found myself getting irritated over her way of overdone everything in her way of acting the role. And she's not doing it again. Acting. Zzzz

834,thats_just_like_your_opinion_man,Disappointing.,2,22 September 2018,"'The Nun' is the 5th film released in the growing Conjuring universe and features the scary antagonist Valak from 'The Conjuring 2'. The Conjuring films are some of the most refreshing horror films in years executed with great craft behind the camera. I could not wait for this movie. However, as the credits rolled I began to think back on the film and thought how unbelievably disappointing it was.The movie feels so plotless. You don't care or get invested in the characters and what their goal is. The film essentially boils down to numerous scenes of demons just bullying the characters. A character will be walking around, all the sound drains from the film, and then your ears are blasted with an un-frightening jump scare that you can easily see coming. Hardy's flat direction doesn't help either, where at times the camera moves so the scares are for the audience and not the characters. Everything was rather cliche and it's a film we've seen many times before. Pros? Taissa Farmiga, and most of the performances are fine I guess. The sets and lighting can feel somewhat eerie at times. Valak's theme is there but it owes that to 'The Conjuring 2'.
 
And that's what the film feels like...it's just riding the successful coattails of the 'The Conjuring 2', a movie that Valak is way scarier in and probably has more screen time...At so many points, I would just think to myself how they could've done that way better. But they chose the worst decision at every turn. Also, it blatantly tries a little too hard to connect things to the larger universe.This isn't the worst film in the series, that title goes to 'Annabelle'.
'Annabelle: Creation' was an enjoyable flick. So who knows? Maybe when The Nun 2 comes out (and it will come because of cash money and teens who are looking for a spook) it won't be as much of a let down.D = 2/10",The Nun

Granted, the story may feel weak and yes, there were more jump scare than what I would have liked but they were overshadowed by the brilliant direction and editing.Score was creepy, cinematography was excellent and the way they have used the 'Chekov's gun' device just tingles my movie senses.

The long awaited world of the conjuring series film about its key villain is a colossal flop. The mighty rekindling of great horror storytelling is once again a world of B-films turning a buck off its audiences and lacking in storytelling. It is a weak tissue of connectivity to the Conjuring films that rewrites key characters in the first Conjuring. It's only saving grace was it's attempt to keep it in the Conjuring world while the production value was amazing, the acting is a B+ and the writing is a goal D-. You will spend the hours of this film watching them take cheap jump scares writtten by those who bring Knotts Scary Farm and Universal Horror Nights to life and watch them walk around for most of the movie doing nothing that contributes to the story.

The film is filled with cheap jump scares with only one or two getting me like when Maurice is leaving the Abbey to see the nun which killed herself at the start of the film hang and kill herself again. I LOVE the conjuring however the spin offs have all seemed slightly off the pace and not as good story wise or scare wise. The final battle against Valak is quite predictable you knew what was gonna happen and we all knew that Frenchie was Maurice before it was even announced.

What's most disappointing about it is the fact that it does nothing to set it apart from other typical horror films. You can see most of the jump scares coming from a mile away and the film is full of them. Which is annoying because the conjuring films thrive on using little to no jump scares and frightening us with genuine horror and creepy imagery.The 10-15 mins that the Nun had in the conjuring 2 were scarier than this entire film. That's not to say that this film is all bad. I don't think it deserves all the bad reviews its getting, it does have some set-pieces that work pretty well. The acting and atmospherics were really good, but that's all it has really. If there is one reason why you should see it though, is how it ties into the previous films. I thought that was really cool.Unfortunately 'The Nun' falls flat for me.

861,CrookedStairs,A CROOKED STAIRS REVIEW: THE NUN,4,7 February 2019,"Well, we were all waiting for this one to hit theatres for a while weren't we? From the moment I heard talk that this unholy veiled spectre was to be given her very own movie to conduct her ghastly business I had mixed emotions. Having thoroughly enjoyed the character in The Conjuring 2 and admitting that she certainly gave me a few hair raising moments in some scenes, I was eager to see more from the ghoul. But if, and ONLY if, it was done correctly. There in lies the rub...BASIC PLOT: A young nun apparently takes her own life at a remote convent situated in an ancient castle in Romania. A priest with a dark past and a young girl on the verge of taking her vows to becoming a nun, travel to the site to investigate and find out that more than a few things go bump in the night at this castle.REVIEW: I can only be honest and speak from a personal standpoint... this film just didn't pan out. At all. I always tend to come back to a similar standpoint when reviewing movies, especially horror and that is that you HAVE to get people caring about the characters early on. You have to achieve this through a strong script so that audiences can identify with the characters, emotionally invest in them and THEN they are worried for the characters in the film and the fear & tension can start.
This film for me just did not make me want to really connect with anyone. I just didn't really care. So after a loose start to the film more airing on the side of comedy than horror, by the time the characters reached the castle, I just didn't have a sense of dread for them going inside. Once they reach Romania, the script just goes completely off the reservation and reads more like a child writing a scary story more than a horror movie from the same universe that brought us the Conjuring tales. The plot holes start and just do not let up. I found myself shaking my head and laughing at numerous points which let's be honest, is just not really the emotions you want to be feeling during a horror film.
Positives, they were scare but there were a few. On the technical side of things the film was very polished and slick. It did look gorgeous at points, some wonderful shots of the old castle, very Transylvania like. The sound and music also preyed upon certain scenes nicely, building crescendos and unnerving sound effects working in harmony with the visuals, everything employed that was successfully learnt in the Conjuring series.
Acting was lacklustre overall, although I almost don't blame the actors themselves as with a script and dialogue as it was, it must've been very hard to find any true depth to these characters and get in the role. The only mention I really feel I could give is to Taissa Farmiga yerself, who does do well and keeps up her characters conflicted and unnerved persona decently throughout.VERDICT: For me, a colossal disappointment and failed attempt on what could have been a interesting and terrifying offshoot from the franchise. The fear and scares just never materialised and when they did, they somehow felt more comical and over the top than true horror. I feel this movie got green lit before any story was penned and the entire project was built around money, money going into the film with no real direction or strong plot with the hopes of a lot of money to be made at the box office simply because it rides on the coat tails of its successful Conjuring predecessors. A sad miss.",The Nun

My whole body jolted in my cinema chair a few times. A teenage friend of my daughter called it ""unrelenting."" I am a hardcore horror fan and I don't get easily scared by horror movies. But this film was scary!!James Wan did an awesome job once again. Also, no spoilers, but this movie has an interesting connection with the first Conjuring. Taissa Farmiga was great as Sister Irene, and the actress playing the Nun...wow!!! She did an amazing job scaring the audience. How this movie has such a low rating is beyond my comprehension.

867,lynnbarr-99398,Worth a watch,6,16 September 2018,"This movie, although I enjoyed it could have had so much potential to be very scary, take the Nun from the second Conjuring movie, sent shivers down your spine. In the Movie, The Nun, she wasn't as scary. The acting was good but the story could have been a lot better by delving into the story of Valak a demon who takes possession of a Nun when an exorcism to seal a portal to hell ( in a monastery) goes wrong.
The ending is not very clear, we thought the demon was sent back to hell at the end of the movie after a fight with our lead character sister Irene and Frenchie a man who helped her and father Burke defeat Valak, however, we see as the trio ride away from the monastery Frenchie rubs his neck and a upside down cross is embedded in his skin. The movie moves on years later to the Warrens giving a lecture and showing the class a movie where Frenchie is possessed by Valak who wasn't sent back to hell. It does make me wonder how could Valak use the Nun's body in the Conjuring 2 when the demon jumped into Frenchies body the Nun ( the host body) died, the demon needs a living host, however, it is certainly worth a watch.",The Nun

The Nun was much better than Us. They make all these horror movies too dark you can't see whats happening. Besides that, the forced humor that didn't belong, and the okay acting on the lead girl nun's part, it was pretty decent. Glad I watched it. The Nun is an awesome horror character- taking the sanctity and grace of being a nun and then messing with it by having a wicked demon in the habit is smart. I will definitely be seeing The Nun 2 when it comes out. I don't understand all the negativity about this first one. If you like horror, you should like it just fine. It was better than Us!",The Nun

Many unnecessary elements with mommy/zombie like characters out of place and some absurd claims such as having the blood of Jesus Christ on hand.One of the things that horror movie directors need to learn is that Less is More. In some scenes, the Nun looked like a monster with shark teeth and not like a demon as it should have been portrayed.

Typical jump scares throughout the movie you can literally see them all coming, crusafix turning upside down, it's just more of the same stuff. The acting was good, there is a particularly over dramatic character who did a pretty good job. When James Wan created this universe of horror and paranormal it was fantastic, I honestly feel that the director Corin Hardy done a half assed job. This movie could of been HUGE! But he failed at being original and instead tried to be comercial. Literally nothing amazing or worth remembering comes from this movie. You will forget 99% of it by the time you go to bed. I actually think Corin Hardy may have just ended the conjuring universe. However we do have Halloween soon.My opinion keep Corin Hardy away from horrors and leave him to his fairies and more.

In that moment, holding back tears, he noticed Valak's yellow eyes staring at him silently from the far corner of the room. An opportunity, he thought to himself as he approached the poor demon and shoved a laptop into his claws, demanding that Valak fill the substantial gaps in runtime with jump spooks or he would be fired without pay. Of course Valak capitulated to the fuming ape and I'm sure he's never been paid the overtime either; that's the real horror I think.",The Nun

It's not..The intro of the title is put together with a horribly planned jump scare with horrible graphically designed bats. Bats? Really? It's 2018 people...The next few scenes play through with some horribly placed jump scares with a rip off shining scene with blood and stairs. Just stop already.The scenery is pretty well done. I give some credit to the cinematography. And cinematographers that worked on this slapstick of a horror movie.The next few scenes play on as the movie gets more boring as you can go. Help me.The nun appears through a window. Spooky...For some reason this nun they meet in the chapel has her own throne cool. Is this plot good? No.As the rest of the movie plays out it still fails to deliver any sort of amusement. The jump scares are still the worse.Although some of the scenery is a very good set for a good horror movie. Which this isn't.
It reminds me of some bram stoker's Dracula, which is a better movie.I'm turning the lights of to see if I can get a better horror movie experience..No. The part with the Mirror was possibly the most horrible jump scare I've ever seen in my life.The nights of the round table arrive.
And at least the nun knows how to close doors.. cool..As the rest of the scenes play out the screams and jump scares with the nun just keep going on and on.Towards the end a hero appears and saves the day that disappeared at the beginning of the movie. Where'd he go? Nobody knows. Probably just standing around on set.Some of the nun makeup is pretty good.

892,boycalledmullins,"Heavy on Style, Light on Substance",6,12 June 2021,"Technically, most of the components that make up The Nun are pretty darn good. There's some great acting performances, the lighting and cinematography is fantastically eerie. The sound design and score are genuinely fantastic throughout, and the gothic horror setting in an abandoned Romanian abbey can hardly be beat when it comes to creepiness. However, there is simply nothing substantial enough to tie all of these features together.The plot is rather thin even for horror, and at times teeters precariously on the border of unravelling too much of the mystery behind the Valak demon (thus rendering it less scary). On top of this, while the film has some amazingly crafted set pieces and well designed monsters, the jump scares are very by the book. At least with Annabelle, another film in the Conjuring franchise which lacked a strong foundation, there were some truly memorable and inventive scare sequences. The Nun's efforts tend to feel either recycled or a little too over the top (the buried alive scene being a good example).It is hard to call the film particularly bad, however. If you go in expecting something with the nuance of the first two Conjuring instalments, you will certainly be disappointed, but compared to your average haunting movie, it is hardly the worst of the bunch.",The Nun
893,coach150,Cheap jumpscares and a disappointing addition to an accomplished cinematic universe,5,10 September 2018,"Evaluating this movie one can see that money has been sparred for the latest addition of the Conjuring cinematic universe. From its online promotion to the CGI and from the production design to the cinematography and sound score one can see that the production made a considerable investment for a non-canon addition to the cinematic series.However by increasing the production cost of a film that does not necessarily correlate to making a good movie. In this instance the aforementioned correlation never even hit the ballpark.The film is basically un-scary, there are no core frightening aspects and it solely utilizes sound mixing and editing to produce a continuous series of cheap jumpscares. Do you get scarred? Of course, who wouldn't... But is this scare is superficial and unnecessary? Definitely yes..From very early on the presence of the nun gets demystified and loses any scare value as the mystery is gone and its replaced by the boring reality of an actor behind a scary face.A weak addition to an otherwise strong horror cinematic universe",The Nun

Jump scares that became obnoxious and nothing too surprising happened. The priest who is supposed to be some badass they call in for these special cases was a little baby who fell for all of the demon's tricks and literally didn't help anything! The foreshadowing was overtly obvious which felt so much like a plug it took me out of the immersion of the film. Oh yeah all you could think of was Mary points the way, and you didn't think to look at Mary statues in a Catholic Convent? Yeah, okay. Last, and probably most irritating... WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU CHOOSE THE SISTER OF THE MAIN CHARACTER FROM THE CONJURING AND NOT MAKE THEM RELATED??!!

898,nimrod-rokach1994,A huge disappointment,2,8 September 2018,"As a fan of the series and the stories of James Wan, I must say i'm very disappointed with this one...
For start, it's lack of storyline, it tells the story of the nun in just two sentences, everything that is happening is by ""just accept what is shown"", for instance the movie doesn't tell how the portal got opened again, the viewers just have to take it as a fact...
The story about Daniel, the boy who was possesed, seems forced and out of nowhere, and doesn't relate to the scene or the question of Irene, who just asked if he chose this profession or not, and nieher his other answer: ""I'm a part of elite group""... dude just say if you chose it or not.
In addition, the nun is shown way toooo many times it got boring, like they had no other ideas to make the movie scary.
There is no reason for the two nuns at the beginning of the movie to enter the catacombs without the ""blood of christ"", that as the movie show us is the only way to banish the demon.
Sadly the movie also missed an interesting story with the books Antony found in the grave, and just forgot about them, showed them for one scene without telling anything about them.
Also, the whole fighting the demon scene seems too easy without sense, even for a horror movie.
Further more, the other nuns that popped up out of nowhere, looked at first as spirits who was trapped inside the monastery, and helped Irene, but at the end the movie says they are just visions... so what the hell, visions that are too lively in my taste.
Lastly, the blood of christ...? really...? how is that even possible? doesn't make any sense at all.
In conclusion, this movie is one big failure that destroyed every good thing i ever thought of the movie, the music and sounds always repeated themselves again and again, there were always thunders but no rain, it's as if every maker of the movie didn't want to invest any thought in this movie..

But it really felt so ludicrous that I lost all interest almost immediately.The Nun herself appears all the way through the film and either jumps out at you or stands creepily. But the film is so boring that you feel no suspense or fear and can time ever scary moment to the second.So the Nun is actually a demon from the Nunnery, which used to be some satanist's castle who had a portal to hell in his dungeon and so on... Honestly I rolled my eyes just typing that out. Could they really not think of anything more original than that.Everyone spouts one-liners. The priest is a bitter old man with a troubled past - because of course he is. The french peasant looks like a model.

I went to the cinema with a double feeling. I was very excited to see another part of the Conjuring series, but on the other hand I didn't like the Conjuring 2 as much as I did the first one so I was somewhat afraid this one would be at about the same level as the Conjuring 2, which is ""ok"" but not ""amazing"". I was utterly disappointed when I left the cinema. It has been years since I have seen such a bad horror movie. The plot is nearly non existant, the character depth is laughable at best and, most importantly, the horror is just pathetic. It's all about visuals and jump scares, there is no suspense whatsoever. Some of the scenes were laughable, especially at the end of the movie.I strongly advice not to watch this movie in the cinema, it's a waste of money. I would rate this a 7/10 ....... If it was a comedy. It made me laugh more than anything else. 2/10 is my verdict, the acting was acceptable, which is why I don't rate it 1.",The Nun
919,spyroskalis,A mediocre film,6,6 September 2018,I just watched this movie with 3 of my friends and I have to say it was not what i was expecting entering the the movie theatre. The movie as a horror film lacks on many parts because it really isnt that scary at least it did not scare me nor did it make me care alot about the characters entering the movie if any of them would die later did not matter to me neither if at the end anyone died. However the movie does keep you engaged I wanted to see what would happen next what something meant and how characters would get out of a certain situation. The plot was lacking and was a bit idiotic however it did make sense. The part that I really liked was the humour of the movie because in my opinion it was qute funny and I loved the jokes maybe it was my friends that mare it more fun but the whole crowd made jokes and was laughing it was indeed a funny. Overall I wouldnt watch it again and I would ave preffered not paying 11 euros for this film if you would like to watch it I would recommend watching at home with some friends and would really enjoy it then - as I should have done -,The Nun

This movie is definitely not for the people who absolutely dislike cliche ""jump scares"", in the movie theater I was not scared by a unsuspecting jump scare because they were oh so predictable. Technically this movie was made to give The Conjuring fans the solo film of its scariest character. The thing is that it wasn't scary not even a bit, this movie had so much potential but like I said they rushed it just to make money.

I am a huge James Wan fan, so I was also a little nervous that he didn't direct this, but when I read that he was partially involved as a producer, I almost knew immediately that it might possibly stand a chance at being good.

I found the Nun to be adequately scary, myself. At least physically.I agree that the scares are repetitive and often boring, but there is something to be said for the story itself, and the situational horror of it all. I mean, we are talking about a complete story here that is largely well told, and well-steeped in genuine lore.

951,weetomboii,Not that scary... Entertaining and funny at best,3,21 September 2018,"This film is a let down for sure. It fails on so many levels that the entire movie becomes funny and suspension of disbelief flies out the window. For one, the plot is weak as hell. A lot of it doesn't make any sense, and because of that it's hard to feel motivation behind the characters and story. It's hard to immerse yourself in and take seriously. It feels so loose and stupid. The characters are all boring with no backstory or development. They are acted decently, but I absolutely promise you will walk out thinking 'What was that guy's name again?' They are all just dumbasses who are completely oblivious to oncoming threats like standard horror movies, like oh a door suddenly opens behind me here I'd better follow the demon on my own and not do something logical like call for help/arm myself. This really impacts how scary it can be cause you think to yourself how dumb could they be? The scares are predictable and just jump scares that are so telegraphed they aren't scary, and they wear off quick once you've seen them a few times. During the scares it feels like the demon gives them way too many chances to escape and is more interested in messing them about rather than actually trying to accomplish anything... which basically results in you knowing that every scary sequence will happen you 100% know they will get away for stupid reasons.The Nun herself also doesn't make sense and this hurts the legacy it left behind. It can seemingly exist as multiple forms and attack 3 characters at once, which is stupid and shifts the focus on horror between characters and doesn't offer enough threats individually. Also, by the time we see her face it's not even scary in the slightest because you know she's just gonna scream and lunge at someone. The conjuring 2 captured the nun in a really scary way with it's subtlety and mystery combined with effective scares which is lost in this movie. Finally, the ending is weak and doesn't provide a good backstory for the nun and feels cheap as hell... She gets sealed back into the portal by the Christ blood, which was also an equally stupid plot device and then for no reason explainable other than a really stupid gimmick comes back 20 years later. The movie doesn't really explore the father being attacked by his son and what becomes of that either it's just there because why not and it has no impact on the plot other than extending running time. This isn't the movie for you, but if you like to watch horror movies and laugh at how bad they've become with mates, then work away. The movie is full of over exhausted techniques that we've all seen before, with a crap plot, finale, and cast. Just really bad and disappointing for even the biggest horror movie fans and a let down to the conjuring series.",The Nun

The lead was great too. Really a waste!",The Nun
957,poonamloveskanwar,It could have been so much better,7,4 July 2019,"I waited almost a year to see this movie. I couldn't make it to the cinema last September, even though I was desperate to watch this movie.
I've seen all of the movies from the Conjuring universe that have released so far, and the character of 'the Nun' intrigued and frightened me in equal measure. You can imagine my delight when they started to promote this movie! Now it is showing on Sky Premiere, and I finally got to watch it.
So...after reading the other reviews I would say that it's not as bad as some people are making it out to be. It held my interest and there were a few genuine creepy moments, the location was stunning, as well as suitably eerie. The movie has a simple plot, regardless of what other reviews may say. A priest and a novitiate nun travel to Romania to investigate the apparent suicide of a nun, who hung herself from a window in the convent. The priest is haunted by a failed exorcism that resulted in the death of a young boy, and the novitiate has not taken her vows yet, as is pointed out several times throughout the movie. They are guided by a Frenchman who discovered the nun's body, and who informs them of the 'cursed' convent. What ensues is a battle between good and evil, with the protagonists racing to discover an ancient relic to send the demon nun back to hell.
What was wrong with the movie? Well, I feel that it should have been better than it was. There is a solid antagonist, a demonic nun is so original and roused many a person's curiosity after appearing in the Conjuring 2. This movie should have cemented Valak (demon nun) as the ultimate evil entity in recent times. Instead we have an overly CGI'd nun who has lost the shroud of mystery that surrounded her in the Conjuring 2. She still has a strong presence, but I didn't like the story of the portal from hell, I think that a simple tale of a haunted convent would have sufficed. There were too many comedy moments for my liking too, they were a bit out of place in such a dark story. The story moves at a very fast pace too, with a lot of events that happen being imagined by the characters. I didn't really like this as it made the storyline a tad confusing, 'who's who', 'where did they go', 'where are they now' etc. It was hard to separate the reality from the character's imaginations.
I must say that I expected a better movie, but I still found the Nun entertaining and suitably creepy. Glad to have finally watched it, I hope that they fix these errors for the sequel.",The Nun
958,nawex,Awful,1,13 May 2019,"Just a bunch of jump scares - rubbishThis film is OBVIOUSLY missing the James Wan touch that we loved in the conjuring universe films. Even when Wan used jump scares , it worked bc the atmosphere was tense and creepy . In ""The Nun"" they're overly planted everywhere in the movie to make up for the fact that the director couldn't keep the audience captivated any other way.The plot is basic to say the least, it's almost like they just threw it together in 5 minutes to make up a back story for The Nun. The film had so much potential to give the audience a interesting creepy back story to one of the conjuring's iconic villains. Instead we're saturated with filler for the 1st and 2nd act , and FINALLY get something going on the final act . Up until then it's nothing but jump scare city . So if that's up your alley for horror movies then you'll love this . I personally think the brief amount of time The Nun was in the Conjuring 2 was 100000x better than this full length film.They also tried to go with this new trend of adding some comedy into a horror film and it's just badly placed and awkward . The acting is okay . Taissa Farmiga & Demien Bichir are the main characters and give pretty good performances.Anyway, Overall this movie could've gone straight to DVD or Netflix . Don't think it deserved to hit the big screen if it wasn't going to be directed by Wan . There's some creepy/scary enjoyable moments but overall it's very cliche and downright boring at times.

962,pdori,How to create a bad horror movie,3,20 September 2019,"1. Use every cliche there is in the genre
2. Make the characters act in an impossibly illogical manner, and generally make the movie utterly devoid of logic
3. Rely entirely on jumpscares
4. Have the main antagonistic demon-entity do nothing else but stand and look scary and maybe frighten the characters for seemingly no other reason than its own amusement, but refrain from actually trying to kill the characters until the final act.The Nun follows these steps with magnificent accuracy. It is incredibly annoying to watch that totally kills any 'fear' you should be feeling while watching a horror movie.
I rated it three stars mainly for Taissa Farmiga and the general acting, and also partly for the setting, a beautiful medieval castle in the middle of a forest, but I'd give a star at least for any movie that features a medieval castle :D (I liked this one specifically because my people, the hungarians have built the castle that is seen in the movie and it really is a magnificent gothic castle).
I also liked the featured romanian village and it's interesting to note that many poor romanian villages do look exactly like this today. (I've been to some). Time really stopped there somewhere at the end of the 19th century :DThat was my review in a nutshell but I'm going to elaborate in detail, mainly because the movie was so infuriatingly bad that I have to write it out of myself.What bothered me the most was the utter lack of logic and a comprehensible storyline. The main action in the movie takes place in mere two days, and basically all that happens is that the two and later three characters run about the castle and ground like headless chickens, than one of them gets crucial plot points from her own visions and then there's a big showdown which is rendered totally meaningless a minute later (when we discover that Valak didn't go away or die but simply posessed Frenchie/Maurice).
There is no point to this movie, no edification, no interesting mystery. It's just stupid every step of the way.
LIKE:
the demon is portrayed all-powerful but it doesn't do anything to the characters, save scaring them for the audience's sakethe demon is said to have to posess a human in order to... ? but we see the demon wreak havoc merrily without posessing anyonethere's a door saying 'god ends here' that leads to the catacombs, or I don't really know where, but we see the demon wreak havoc merrily all over the grounds and even in the villagein the end showdown Valak posesses Maurice, and still strangles Irene in its nun form, than pretends to die, I guess? WHY?apparently the Blood of Christ and a monastery of constantly praying nuns can barely stop this particular demonic entity but a whack over the head with and axe works just fineValak apparently leads them to a coffinload of books that help defeat it (seriously, what's with that??? In the Conjuring II we learn that Valak can be defeated if they call its name to its face... and it TELLS its name to Lorraine earlier... Is this a demonic entity that secretly wants to be defeated or what?)Valak can conjure up all sorts of horrific visions, be in several places at once, cause bad stuff to happen in the village miles away but can't kill three humans?Sister Irene and the priest meet the 'Abbess' and it's GLARINGLY obvious that something is really wrong with her, but of course they don't notice any of it, not even the second timesimilarly, they find no issue with the fact that a sister hung herself and no one took the trouble to take the corpse off and bury her or clean the blood up from the stepsIrene's visions work differently depending on what the plot needsthere is an incredible amount of light several stories under the castle in the dead of nightblatant, ridiculous overuse of fog machines, and similarly ridiculous amount of crosses everywherein the guesthouse with candles and gas lamps and torches there is a working electric radiothe romanian people apparently put all their signs up in the Queen's englishI'm sure I could write more if I cared to rewatch the movie, but one time was enough, thank you very much :D
On a side note I think it would have been a much more interesting story if we saw how Valak killed all the nuns, how it began to haunt and infect the monastery, stalking and terrifying the nuns, picking them off one by one.

There's also a scene where a priest is freed from being buried alive, which references a scene from City of the Living Dead.In the Nun, EVERYTHING is a jump scare, and Jump scares are out of favor lately, but the jump scares aren't discreet moments, they're carefully woven into the action. It's not just about the jump scares. It's about the suspense of dreading the NEXT jump scare.Visually, this is a great movie, with gorgeous spooky sets, and lots are carefully composed detail. Not much of a plot, but when were horror movies about plot?",The Nun

I love horror movies but so sad that the most of it is just bad like this movie here. No story, cliche of 30 years, no heart and no evolution...

They get better every time. I love that the movies correlate which each other. I really enjoy Ed and Lorraine very much in the Conjuring, they are my favorite characters. A very entertaining film from beginning to end, plenty of chilling parts, loved the camera work, costumes & makeup. I enjoyed all the scary scenes, plot was perfect, story line is always perfect.

The spooky locations, scary atmosphere, grotesque ghosts, jump scares, you name it and the movie has it. The scares are placed strategically such that you can feel the uneasiness while watching the movie. The movie has the timeline in 1952, much before the conjuring movies happened.

976,addi-shastry-3,I gave it 6 stars only because of Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet),6,8 September 2018,"Such wasted potential! Director Corin Hardy had to just take the same formula other movies in the franchise have been using and the movie would have turned out to be okay. Instead we get a movie whose parody will be more scary. The Nun was the single most reason why the Conjuring 2 was scary! How can you take a character who has already been established and screw up? James Wan frightened viewers more in just a couple of scenes than what this movie manages in its entire runtime. Heck! Even Annabelle Creation had a few scary scenes even though it shares the same stupidity of characters. The Nun is supposed to be a demon who is malevolent than anything witnessed. But all it does is scream at characters and choke them. I would understand if Valak was intended to mirror what the viewing audience was feeling at the moment about character decisions. But sadly, the scares fall flat even before the jump. It's sad to see Valak being wasted away like this. This is a scary movie that is anything but scary.",The Nun
977,Symbiossys,Not sure what everyone is so pissed about.,9,17 September 2018,"I just saw the movie this weekend, at 4DX 2D, and I can tell you truthfully I had tons of fun. 
 We went with some friends, after ignoring all the negative and bad reviews over the web. We even heard some of our friends who had already seen the movie, bashing it with negatives, but we decided to go anyway. I am not a sucker for horror movies, let's just sort that one out, but I loved the previous two Conjuring movies, and had also seen Annabelle. I didn't like Annabelle as much as I did like The Nun. It was something new, a new touch to the story, and although it wasn't directed by James Wan, it was still good! Yes, it has a lot of jump scares, sometimes predictable, sometimes not, but it's still fun. The rush you feel when the chair you're sitting in starts jerking chaotically and the characters in front of you scream in fear, that's what I was looking for. After all you go to a movie to have fun, not to judge and analyze every bit of it. What would it become of a movie, if everything would be perfect and carefully thought through. I enjoyed the story, even if it felt a bit rushed in the beginning. The eerie feeling the movie gives you, represents a big plus as well. 
You feel isolated and alone throughout the whole experience, and it makes you feel better when other characters join the action, and the band gets back together. I mean, a priest, a nun who hasn't pledged herself to becoming a full nun and a farmer, well. How bad could this trio be? Let me tell you, they fit perfectly. Although the Nun herself, or let's say Valak, didn't have much screen time, except toward the end, you still felt her/his presence throughout the movie. Overall a fun and enjoyable ride. A few cliché moments, but still good toward the end. Great effects and a total blast seen at 4DX 2D. So, if you enjoy horror movies, and you're not one of those fellas who goes to the movie with a pencil and a notebook in his hand, in order to analyze and criticize everything he sees, you're good to go.

I'd say, this movie is the stupidest chapter in THE CONJURING universe!THE CONJURING I & II directed by James Wann, set a bench mark in horror films with a good story, genuine scares and of course, superb acting. The makers however, instead of focusing on the franchise, started deviating to spinoffs ANNABELLE & ANNABELLE CREATION. With the moderate success of these two films, they did a grave mistake of attempting one more spinoff, THE NUN. The result is a big let down right from the word go! I am wondering as to how the talented director James Wan, who is the producer and co-writer here, has green lit this insipid piece.Except for the beautiful Romanian plateaus at the beginning of the film, the film offers nothing exciting or thrill which you expect from a horror thriller. Morever, the film is unintentionally funny at times! And NO! Just because of that, you shouldn't be watching this!Keep away from this NUN!AMEN!!",The Nun

It was actually decently scary to me at times, and I even had a bad dream afterwards!It's got more of a classic horror feel to it, which will bog it down for a lot of people, and don't get me wrong, it's definitely a little trashy, but it's my kind of trash. The way it was shot, paired with the music at times, made me feel like I was watching a 50s Lord of the Rings knock off, which was hilarious yet delightful to me.If you're looking something a little cheesy to start getting you into a Halloween mood, I 100% recommend it.",The Nun

My short review will be to avoid watching this movie in the theaters to save your money. Go eat outside, visit some place with that money.This movie is full of jump scares, unnecessary sounds, showing the horror figure for so long that it doesn't even look scary, just a hero trying to rescue a heroine from the villian.
Some scenes are so stupid and illogical that it doesn't even make any sense.Ok so imagine one scene, where a character faces some of the most disturbing thing he must have faced in his life and in the very next moment, he is alright and behaves as if nothing has happened to him.And they literally added scenes from cartoon films, ""that gravestone scene"". There is a saying that don't judge a book by its cover, similary don't judge a movie by it's trailer. The trailer is 100 times better than the movie. Avoid it. You will thank me later.",The Nun

995,Ancient-Gamer,BOO!!... No it didn't work.,3,19 October 2018,"**This review contains Spoilers**Horror used to be one of my favorite genres, and actually it still is. The sad thruth is that most horror movies nowadays are just bad. Filmmakers rely heavily om jumpscares with any real tension or terror. I have seen my fair amount of horror movies and it takes a lot to make me really feel creeped out in my seat. But i can appriciate a good jump scare if it really catches me off guard.The Nun also follows the BOO princible instead of providing a real haunting atomsphere. Problem is that the jump scares in the Nun are just plane boring, when you are familair with the gerne you can see them coming from miles away. There is no originality whatsoever. Everytime you expect something to pop out of the dark, it actually does. Leaving the viewer with no tension at all. Sadly The only jump scare that might have worked was already spoiled by the trailer.The setting of the Nun was not very interesting either. Sure the monastery kinda looks creepy, but an old castle with a creepy cementary has been done so many times already. It gave the impression that the makers of this movie had no idea what to do with the character, so the gave us a really basic and boring backstory. In short: Evil man summons evil spirit, other man stop him just in time and nuns are needed to keep locked away forever. The movie is full with illogical actions and errors (English music on the radio in middle of Romania during the mid fifties?).To give an example in the opening scene we see two nuns who go to confront the evil in depths of the monastery. With them they have a very important key... Later on we find out that the key has no use whatsoever in the area that the nuns went into, and they knew this. Making you wonder why they even tried it in the first place. The backstory for our main heroes are also paperthin and make less sense the more the movie drags on. Take Sister Irene, who has visions which eventually turn out to be the key to defeating the evil Nun. And somehow the vetican knew this all along.The weak story and silly actions would have been forgiven if the movie was actually scary. But like stated before, it's not. Even worse is that the forced humor is actually the most entertaining part of the Nun, and it's not even that funny. It seems to be some kind of trent to make horror movies light up with a sense of humor and stupid one liners. Maybe i'm alone in this, but i don't need a horror movie to be funny, i want to be scary! If i wanted to laugh i would have gone to a comedy.When meeting the Nun for the first time in the Conjuring 2, it was a genuine frightning experience. So the idea to make an entire movie about this mysterious entity was an intriguing one. Sadly this second encounter is far from terrifying, with pretictable jumps scares, bad character devolpment and a boring backstory for the persona. When the best thing about a horror movie is it's forced attempt at humor, you know there is something fundametally wrong with it.",The Nun

But I just wanted to say that these scares are done so well and so terrifying on the big screen that this movie is worth going into the cinema and spending some cash on. Take a girl or boyfriend with you... you will need them.
There was a point where I actually shivered and 2 moments where I just couldn't keep looking on the screen and slightly shifted my head for a few seconds and I watched a lot of horror movies by now.When watching this movie you WILL get shocked and you WILL be disgusted by some scenes and yes there are a lot of ""no...no...no...please don't do that"" moments there as well but goddamnit guys this movie won't allow you to sleep tonight (if you are alone) and isn't this what a horror movie is all about?
This here is not the ""shinings"" slow horror - this is fast paced ""I-give-you-barely-enough-time-to-calm-down-again"" horror starting from minute one and even though you totally know by just listening to the music alone that you will be scared soon it gets you every time. Therefore the nun is different from Conjuring and Annabelle who both needed to be set up by their plot before scaring you more and more. By the way the scare ideas aren't new at ALL but the execution of these is really good. To name a few who are in it:
Mirror Scares, Behind you scares, alley scares, graveyard scares, below you scares, above you scares, dead person grabs you scare, monster under you(r bed), behind the glass scares, ""light on"" scare, rise from the water scare, shadow is alive scare so many old and new ideas - I liked it.Give this movie a try.

1028,soonyoongkit,Frightening - is this the future of Conjuring universe?,2,8 September 2018,"10 minutes into the movie, I realized this will not be the ""Conjuring"" type of movie. Conjuring succeeded in keeping the audiences in suspense. In ""Conjuring"", you did not know what was hiding in the dark. In the darkness of the room, you thought you saw something but you didn't. The creepiness was there. The pace was intense. The nun in Conjuring 2 was scary as you were not able to see It in full but it lingered in the dark and appeared mysteriously. It kept the audiences to the edge of their seats. But not this movie, everything was revealed and very predictable. Yes, audiences were screaming by jump scares but too much of the nun appearances damaged the eeriness build up. If you are not going for any depth but just scary moments, yes, this will be your movie. Only the last 5 minutes saved the movie when it linked back to The Conjuring 1. Very disappointing!",The Nun

In my opinion they should've never done that kind of advertising and I wouldn'nt have a higher expectation. And my score for this film would probably be higher but who knows now!

1035,dano-47967,Truly a disappointing prequel.,2,6 September 2018,"""The Nun"" is a prequel to the first two Conjuring movies, and while those were pretty good overall, this one fails at almost everything that makes a good horror movie.One of the very few positives about this movie is the setting. The abbey looks great, as do other locations that this movie takes place in. There was also one praying scene in particular that was well done.Nevertheless, the negatives do outweigh the good things about this movie by a large amount. There is very little logic behind some characters' motivations, the story lacks coherence and it way too reliant on cheap lazy jumpscares rather than making an eerie atmosphere (they literally made a jumpscare out of blood dripping, that should be enough to tell you how uninspired this movie is). There is also one sub-plot that just gets forgotten for some reason. Movie also wants you to never use your brain throughout its runtime (when Irene hears the bell from the graveyard somehow she instantly knows that the priest has just been buried there, despite having no reason to believe this). Sister Irene is somehow also able to swallow Jesus' blood while being choked by a Nun underwater. Movie also adds a funny character (spoiler alert: He wasn't funny at all.) that is one of the links with the other Conjuring movies that just serves as someone hitting on Sister Irene and occasionally being deus ex machina incarnate. If you're ready for a movie with very little substance and logic as well as cardboard characters, this is the movie for you. However, if you're looking for a scary, decent horror movie, I'm afraid you're going to feel disappointed.",The Nun

Movies main problem is the fact that the Nun is barely in it at all. We only ever see her when the camera pans to another direction, and she's there, just standing there. That use of a jump scare is the worst cliche that you can use in a horror movie, and here, it is the only scare factor that they chose to use, which makes it not very enjoyable. The only part that I would consider scary is the scene where the Frenchman is in the room with all of the people and the bloody bags over their heads.

 The suspense and scares are definitely there, James Wan has his mark all over it. The plot was fine, not too farfetched, and it offers at least a decent backstory of the creepy nun, and I can appreciate that. 
 However I did find myself asking ""Really?"", after one too many classic B-movie mistakes made by the characters. There are a few light-hearted 
moments, but some of them seemed a bit untimely, emphasized with sudden comedic musical overtures, taking away from the overall moment.
 It's not a bad movie at all to take in, but it probably won't win any awards either. It could be worse, and afterwards, I find myself satisfied that I watched it as opposed to not going at all.",The Nun

I like cult classics, silly attempts to bring a book to the big screen, and even cheap jump scares in the newer age of the horror genre. I went to see The Nun because I am a huge fan of The Conjuring franchise. I was curious to see how all of this was going to fall together. Plus, you can pretty much put religion in anything horror related to add a creep factor other topics simply do not bring to the table. There are a few things I liked. The music for The Nun is efficient. It does a great job at balancing emotions as things happen on screen. The build up music and the main ""gong"" music that happens when the nun is present is effective. The film is dark pretty much from start to finish. The use of lighting and even things like fog and dust are utilized to create the 'uh oh' atmosphere needed to prep the viewer for that inevitable jump scare. The Nun also had a really good balance with timing. They wait until that last second where you can't hold your breath any longer before that jump happens. It was well done in those elements. There were, of course, also things I did not like. I felt that a lot of some of the ""scare"" scenes were not only cheesy, but borderline silly. Some were fine, and others really good. Because I don't want to put a review with spoilers, I won't be giving examples. There is a character whose soul purpose, so it seems, is comedic relief. Comedic relief can work in the right circumstance in horror films. However, some of those attempts here were awkward and bumpy. You'll likely chuckle a few times, but other times think to yourself ""Yeah, that was poor placement."" From a story perspective, there was a lot of build up around this character for not much back story. It was a pretty typical demon story. Someone made an effort to bring something up and then things go awry. It was a bit boring in that way. I was hoping for a story more surrounding an individual nun or something along those lines. Not a generic demon story. What I can say, as a fan of The Conjuring, is that the ending was pretty cool. The way they tied The Nun into that universe was pretty well done and I honestly didn't really see it coming. Is it worth paying a bunch of money in a theater to see? No. Is it at least slightly entertaining and maybe a good Redbox film? Yes. It does entertain, even the cheesy parts. The acting is medicore, but some of the spooks are pretty good.

It had plenty to live up to from it's previous instalments that enjoyed enormous success.This was a film made up of some truly marvellously executed moments that are quite chilling at times. However the overall storyline really felt compromised at the cost of much of the time and attention clearly put into the moments that have you on the edge of your seat. If you enjoy jumpy horrors(like 'cabin in the words'), then this is prefect. But if you prefer more depth to your story, and a horror that you can still actually 'get into'.. then this one won't make you happy. I enjoyed it as a horror effort in its own right. I do think however it's previous excellent instalments are almost to its detriment, as expectation to be similar to them when even the tone of the film is entirely different hurts its score out of 10.

There's a useless priest and a guy whose whole personality is being Frenchie, who at one point speaks entirely fake French. Nothing happens for 2 hrs except running, screaming, and being chased by Marilyn Manson in a nun outfit. No plot, terrible dialogue, no scares, makes no sense, no back story, no resolution, no point. You'd have more scares and plot if you got completely wasted and ran through a local carnival's haunted haymaze come October. Way more fun.

He had made the Conjuring 1 & 2 successfully scary and quite frightening. But, I am kind of disappointed with this one as it is so predictable, using the same-old jump scares tactics in every other horror movies and lack of good dialogs. Actors and actresses are okay, but not that impressive, either.The actions and the designs of how to do the plots of this movies has lost its charm the moment the priest and the nun were locked inside the abbey. That is when the whole incidents that has been created made it look too-Hollywood-like kind of horror action movies as any other. Somehow, the hanging part one that had simply killed off my mood as that was the same thing that had happened in Conjuring 1. So, it was more like a copied version of a familiar scene.Still, this movie still does not really tells the ORIGIN of the demon that has been decades haunting people from generation after generation. They should have perhaps do an older research on the Valac demon as it was actually originally being mentioned in the Bible that it was one of those demons described in the goetic grimoires the Lesser Key of Solomon.
Well, I am kind of disappointed, actually. They should have leave it in the hands of James Wan. Sorry, guys ...",The Nun

I was also excited to see that James Wan wrote the story. However, this movie turned out to be little more than dark hallways and jumpscares. There was very little in the way of plot, which is surprising considering this was supposed to be a prequel of sorts. An origin story for the title character. The pacing was painfully slow, but I held out hope that it was just going to be a slow burn with a great final 30 minutes and some sort of revelation. The conclusion was underwhelming to say the least, leaving most of your thirst for answers and back story unquenched. In the end, I couldn't help but ask what the point of the movie was. Overall, this was a very mediocre film in all aspects. Even the acting felt forced and unnatural. None of the characters were very convincing in their roles, which could have been the one saving grace for the whole experience.

The Nun in The Conjuring 2 was by far the best thing about the film; it sparked a lot of scares and peeked the interests of fans wanting to see more. She was not a throw away character in The Conjuring 2 neither, she was a pivotal story point that moved the story along; and with the title of this movie being named The Nun, she's hardly in it! It Should have been named The Chapel because all this movie does is play tricks with the characters.SPOILERS!!!A soon to be nun and a priest visit a chapel to investigate where a nun from said church hanged herself, and are there to determine if the church is damned.
The first night the priest is tricked into a coffin and miraculously is buried in an instant. the next night they brush off, wouldn't you think you are already damned by then!?!?! On another note, where is the middle of this movie? They took no time to develop either the nun or the characters that whatever happen happens you don't care. What made it worse is that everything is predictable. Super cliché, you can name everything that is about to happen: upside down crosses, in your face jump scares, checking out random noises in the night. It was extremely disappointing for an antagonist that held such a presence in the conjuring 2, be diminished by its own stand alone movie. There was so much room for creative ideas and a story that would have been great; yet we got an undeveloped story that led to cheap scares that could have been this generations horror icon.",The Nun

Yes, there are some typical horror film plot devices (jump scares are so overdone, especially in a ""vibe"" movie such as this wanted to be), but I didn't find them overly obvious or annoying. Until the end.The ending, the denouement of the Demon Nun herself, was a total letdown, both from a believability standpoint, and also, from a near ripoff standpoint. Let me explain. Demon Nun. Demon Nun? Demon Knight?!? Yes, Demon Knight.Anyone who has seen the Ernest Dickerson-directed classic ""Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight"" - a far superior film to ""The Nun"" - will clearly recognize a scene flat-out ripped from Demon Knight and fully borrowed and reproduced in ""The Nun"". Billy Zane's hilariously idyllic ribaldry and chortling in Demon Knight aside, the ending of ""The Nun"" was identical to Demon Knight. I'm not talking similar. I'm not talking close. I am saying it was identical - same character analogies, same premise, same objects, and same methodologies.Listen...I'm all for a nod. A tribute. An homage. But this, in ""The Nun""? This is as much of a lazy, infringing ripoff as I've ever seen. And it largely ruined the movie for me. If you've never seen ""Demon Knight"", do yourself a favor and see it.

It has a strong start, and powerful climax, but very lacking in between. Aside from the little history lesson, there is just a mishmash of jumpscares that do not contribute anything to the story.I still enjoyed watching it because the movie just looks great, but I admit I rolled my eyes quite a number of times, mostly if not all during the random unnecessary jumpscares.

Maybe the terrible leading performance from Taissa Farminga (that I can only describe as colder and more lifeless than the main villain of the piece the undead nun) no it couldn't have been that. Or maybe they spent all that money on the utterly terrible CGI but if that's the case a lot of people need to get fired. Oh no I remember (how could I forgot) almost the entirety of that money must have been spent on the non-stop, shameless shove it down your throat marketing for the film. But fair play as that marketing scam is what made me part with my hard-earned money, and I can only assume it duped many others as the film went on to gross $365 Million.This brings me on to my main point yes, the nun it terrible in almost every conceivable way the acting is modern and honestly feels like it's out of a local drama school. The CGI nun is so laughable it honestly makes you laugh (there was one scene where I could hear the whole cinema laugh towards the end) and every 10 minutes the music cuts out until we hear a loud noise... how scary.

The nun herself was scary, now she is basically screaming on people, throwing them in the air and taking her time to kill people, as every dumb vilain. It is as easy to watch as all of the jumpscares are expected (and seen in the trailer).
Father Burke backstory adds nothing but a new not that creepy character (hope they won't make a movie about it), Frenchie is the funny one yet boring and Taissa Farmiga is good in the movie but her character is not related to Lorraine Warren, considering they look alike a lot I expected some connection between the two.

1140,ojsjlb,Ruined the best part of The Conjuring 2,1,12 September 2018,"Well this film managed to reduce the best part of the conjuring films into nonsense. The plot was very basic and the story was complete standard Drabble. I think the writers forgot what this demon is and does ... it's supposed to take on the form of things people fear but instead they filled it with all sorts of zombies and a lot of walking corpses.To the point where these zombies aren't manifestations or visions from the demon messing with their minds, but actually pyshcially present, to the point where they are able to chop ones head off and it splashed blood on their faces. A comedy moment if ever I seen one.Now ignoring the writers fetish for non scary zombies popping up at every moment, the horror was bland and unimaginative. The best scene was stolen and copied from the conjuring as a shadow creeping around the walls etc. The nun itself was scary visually until it opened its mouth and spoke utter crap like any stereotypical villain allowing time for its victim to fight back. It's a demon not a human villain it doesn't have to give a speech before an attempt at killing. A Basic basic villain trope. The worst scene ... the priest gets led out into the woods by a child who you ended up laughing at later as he pops up everywhere, and the priest falls into an open casket with his name already carved nicely on the headstone. Then a little bit later, or a few hours later he is 6 feet in the ground? I honestly can't imagine the demon carving the headstone or even picking up a spade and burying him for an hour of its time like wtf? (No actual nuns were present or aiding the demon... so it must have used the spade unless they honestly want us to believe it can do things with its mind, or think things into reality...you decide)This film kept getting lost between nonsense and what the demon should be capable of. At one point they did allow the girl to have visions that weren't there... but then the priest was actually buried with his name carved in stone and these 'zombies' actually exist so the viewer is left confused. It's like the demon can create different realities, and not create illusions.

Firstly, the screenplay is horrible, lack of story-telling, no connection whatsoever between the supposed-to-be-precious details at the beginning of the film. Due to the slackness of character buildups, it's hard to tell even they're protagonists in the film and at some point, it's dull. The inconsistency is astounding when some decent set-pieces including Valak is like zombies. The audiences feel like they watch a zombie movie instead of the ""darkest chapter"" of Conjuring Universe with the spookiest atmosphere or a big trick with spirituality with obsessive concepts. At some point, the thought of this film should be a parody dues to the fact it makes people laugh more than being thrilled. The poster is misleading (on purpose?!) and backfires. I really expected to know the original sin that being the premise of the powerful Valak.

1157,JamesCameronCroweCityofAngels,My Morher Had a Heart Attack at the Theater!!,10,7 September 2018,"I went to an early screening of this movie with my parents. Our whole family enjoys The Conjuring cinematic universe and we never miss a film! We enjoy the dark aesthetic and the way things jump out at you, often accompanied by a loud jarring noise that makes you leap in your seat. The thing that jumps out at you can be a disembodied hand or a creepy zombie, which is very scary, but it can also be a friendly dog or inquisitve child who enters the screen at just the wrong time, when the tension has been built up excruciatingly and the audience is expecting some ghoul to extend from the shadows, thus resulting in a pleasurable subversion of expectations. The loud jarring sound that typically accompanied these images of horror reminds me of the sound of a car horn blasted through a tuba. When properly deployed, such a sound can be quite discomfiting! Well, my parents and I went to a midnight screening of The Nun fully expecting such scares. My father bought a tub of popcorn and my mother enjoyed a large box of bears made of jelly and dipped in several kinds of sugar. I also have a younger sister, but she was not allowed there order anything to eat, as she suffers from what my mother calls ""fat girl legs,"" and therefore my mother severely limits my sister's diet to celery and one raisin a day. Anyway, at the movie, we were all enjoying the repeated image of a creepy ghoulish hand or a cute puppy alternately jumping out of a dark corner accompanied by the sound of a blaring car horn. Then, toward the middle of the film, my mother coughed up one of her sugar bears and began clawing at her neck and writhing in her seat, as if she herself were possessed by some dark spirit, and of course the rest of us took her to be fooling around, as sometimes she likes to play tricks on us, such as putting in my sister's bagged lunch what appears to be a Snickers bar, but which is really a wooden block wrapped in the wrapper of a Snickers bar with a note reminding my sister that she has fat girl legs. Thus it was not until the end of the movie that my father realized that my mother had not been fooling but had suffered an actual heart attack most likely caused by the insesant image of something ghastly leaping out of the darkness accompanied by the car horn sound. Imagine how miffed my mother was that no one had met her neck-clawing and writhing with anything but good-natured laughter. She was most mad at my sister, who she claimed knew good and well that she (my mother) was suffering a heart attack but still chose not to help, instead furtively dipping her hand into my mother's box of sugared bears. All of this is to say that The Nun is an excellent movie with enough jump scares to elevate the heart rate of a middle-aged woman to a dangerous level. Do I recommend seeing it ASAP? Yes I do!",The Nun

I think that's why people have been so harsh on this Nun spinoff movie. I wasn't shockingly terrified this time around seeing Valak but the nun sightings and scares gave me a sort of a deep satisfaction. I also loved the beautiful location and thought the story and acting on all fronts was superb. It definitely hit a little bit of the fantastical spectrum with this being the origin story but it was different from all other Conjuring movies and yay for the franchise for doing something epically different. Go see it with an open mind!,The Nun
1178,willutting,Doesn't live up to expectations,6,6 September 2018,"The Nun (2018), the fifth installment in the conjuring cinematic universe was good as a stand alone movie however did not live up to its predecessors. The scares were a little few and far between in the middle of the film (relying to heavily on jumps), however did pick up the pace towards the end. I particularly enjoyed Taissa Farminga's portrayal of Sister Irene however I felt the character Frenchie added little to he movie (if you've seen you'll know he did fill in a major part of the story at the end). His jokes often fell flat, other than his exclaimation of 'holy s**t' when Sister Irene discovered a vial of Christ's blood (I was the only one who laughed). The close ups of the nun herself were very good, I thought the effects/makeup of the veins were very realistic. The plot of the movie was overall rather good and I enjoyed the back story to the abbey. The abbey itself combined with the Catholic imagery did definitely make this 'the darkest chapter in the conjuring universe', not for the scares but for the theme. The tie-in to the rest of the franchise was very good and I definitely didn't see it coming. Despite the fact the movie was good, I did come away slightly disappointed. Overall I award 6/10 stars, it was missing elements which make the other conjuring movies so great and unique (awesome camera pans, final shot when nothing happens before the credits etc.)",The Nun
1179,PrattG63,The Nun Movie Review: Amazing Storyline but a Little Less Frightening,8,18 September 2018,"A Nun is a member of a religious community of women, typically one living under vows of chastity, and obedience. but The Evil ""Valak"" as The Nun in this movie is not obedient nor spiritual in any way shape or form.This Nun is shouting very loudly, killing and spreading the fear for straight 96 minutes on the screen. As of me I Love Old Cultic Horror Movies this movie is simply made to make you scare and during the movie the director proves that it is filled with a lot of unexpected scares and can make you chilling for bits and scenes. 2018 year has been a crazy one in terms of Horror Movies with John Krasinski's 'A Quiet Place' and Toni Collete's 'Hereditary' being the top 2 flicks in this Genre, The Nun deserves to be a part of this list as the Third.The Actors were Charming everyone did a perfect job as all they had to do was to be very scared. But the one and only beef i had with this movie was that during the whole promotion it is billed as the ""Darkest Chapter in The Conjuring Universe"" but in my opinion, NOPE !

This movie feels complete unnecessary and indicates that this franchise is dying in front of our eyes.
There is an effort to impress us with some effects or the dark atmosphere the visuals try to create. But the plot is too self explained to cross the boundaries of boreness, with a lot... A real lot of jumpscares that do not really work. I think is just a lazy plot trying to make sense out of something that shouldn't exist.
The nun was much more scary as visual detail on conjuring 2, but she does not have the strength to carry a history by herself. Not she, not none of the subplots, nothing is exciting about this one.

1185,darkartistmccoy,A Decent Horror Movie,6,13 September 2020,"Look, people get their expectations too high. This is horror, remember? If you go in expecting movies to be on the same level of The Conjuring or Hereditary, then you will probably be disappointed. Whatever happened to just throwing all preconceived notions out the window and just enjoying it at face value? Why does everyone have to try to rate movies as if they're Siskel and Ebert? Why not just let yourself enjoy something without picking it apart? Is it the best horror movie...no, but it was decent. The Nun herself is nightmare inducing, Taissa Farmiga gave an AMAZING performance as well. The plot could have been done a little better, fleshing out the story a bit more. I'd like to know what happened before The Nun. Anyway, it's just a simple review, with my thoughts on the horror genre. Fact is, there just aren't enough good haunted house movies, and demonic possession movies, such as The Conjuring. I'd been following the Warren's work for years before The Conjuring was released. I've read nearly all of their books. I find this subject truly fascinating, as it's my favorite subgenre of movies/television.

The Nun was terrifying in The Conjuring 2, and if you expect to be soiling your pants at this movie then change your expectations.The story moves quickly which is refreshing, although largely cliche, the main characters are fantastic and the Nun at times is scary. If like me you enjoy horrors and love the conjuring franchise, then give this a watch, you'll enjoy it.On another note, it was very well done at the end - linking it back to The Conjuring, and potentially setting up The Conjuring 3??

Even apon watching it this time , I was hesitant as the bad user reviews from back then just stuck in my head.Yet I finally went about watching it. What a pleasant and intriguing surprise. A decent horror flick in keeping with the series (the feel of it). I am not sure what people were expecting going into it, perhaps an exact replica of previous conjuring movies? If you went in with the notion of watching it for what it is, it is an experience, a worthwhile one. In terms of production and acting and just the eeriness it is all quality no doubt. Its not just a jump scare as others have said. There is just enough of a story as a backbone. just enough that's weird and freaky and haunting to feel like a new experience and keep u watching to the end. Honestly I didn find the nun character at all of a scary one in previous conjuring movies - this shed some more light , well rather darkness on the character created and adds more heft to the demonic presence- and demonic it is.

1199,sandracontreras-88427,Indeed the darkest chapter,8,7 September 2018,"Bear with me, this is a long review.First things first, the film's purpose was to serve as prequel to the conjuring universe, and it did just that. It connected the origins of the demon nun to the conjuring films really well, with a plot twist that I did not see coming. I'm guessing that most people who criticized the film were probably expecting it to be a full on jump scare fest, when they forget that a horror movie is a story too. Too much jump scares would have shrouded a good story and I believe that would have been the case had they did that with The Nun, so I'm glad that they didn't. They limited the jump scares to only necessary moments but still managed to keep the entire film under an eerily dark atmosphere, giving the audience the illusion that although you couldn't see the demon nun, but you know it is always lurking somewhere in the shadows. It was indeed the darkest chapter because in the end, the evil won. I interpreted in my own perceptive that perhaps it was an indirect message to the audience that evil has ways it can outsmart us, that fact in itself was what made this chapter truly scary and can even be related to real life situations. I also liked the humor put in, it wasn't cheeky or corny, in scary situations there would be people who would try to inject humor in an attempt to lighten the mood.High praises to the performances of actors especially Taissa Farmiga and Bonnie Aarons, the camera work, the cinematography, the story telling (although I felt at times it was a bit rushed), and the set design.

Sure, there are some jumpscares as are the staples of this genre but thin plots, shoddy acting and stupid decisions turned me away.

Nope.Being the earliest prequel of one of the more successful franchise, I expected more, albeit the casts are relatively unknown to me. A lot of the scenes didn't make sense, in fact they are the opposite of common sense (like most of lesser horror movies). The characters' motivations and reasonings are dubious at best and it was tremendously hard to love them. I know for sure that even if one of them was a victim of the script and died, it won't trigger any sort of emotion from me.My friends who watched this flick with me rated the movie as a '4', even though usually I'm the harsher one and them being the fans of the genre. It was a so-so experience for me and the movie failed to convert me into one of their fans.",The Nun

Every time she appeared, it gave me goosebumps in the theater. The story include a couple of amazing twists, as well, it certainly surprised me. The only negative side was the redundant ""one liners"" coming from the character, Frenchie. They could have done without that.

1230,Mira2018,People for sure dont know what is good,10,17 September 2018,"I do not understand what people are saying. The movie is pretty good for a horror movie. It has a good story and very well written, credible and well characterized characters, spectacular performances of all the cast and Valak is completely fantastic and incredible. The film long awaited did not disappoint, met the expectations and even surpassed. The whole movie is very good, with good progress, good atmosphere and an amazing and very good ending, which ends up making a brilliant connection to the conjuring. The movie has a lot of scare jumps, that's why it's called the horror movie. Are they privisible? Some are, but they are very well made and leave enough tension in the air. The main characters the priest and the nun Irene are very likable and have many layers of density, which makes them human characters with flaws, even though they represent the church. The French-Canadian is also very good, but nothing surpasses and everything culminates in Valak, best character of all time, better haunting, spirit of nuns of all the centuries. The scene in which she is coming out of the water levitating is altogether hilarious and one of the best moments of the film.
The movie is pretty good, one of the best horror movies I've seen lately. Much better than Robert, that's for sure.

To boot, it took place in Romania during the 1950's which was barely religious due to Communist rule and the dominant religion in the region is & had mostly been pre-Catholic Orthodoxy not Catholicism.

1234,zackbaillie,A completely mediocre entry in an otherwise solid expanding franchise.,5,8 September 2018,"Young Taissa Farmiga continues to expand her horror flick credits with ""The Nun"", a movie that takes itself far too seriously whilst simultaneously delivering no clear motive as to why it was made in the first place. The origins of this demonic spirit that can manifest itself into whatever it pleases is explained in a rough time of, like, two minutes. The rest of the movie is marred by confusion and extremely cheap jump-scares that don't take a clairvoyant to figure out.There is no tension building, no clear motive of any of the characters and the entire basis of the plot is pretty cringe inducing. The cinematography was great and the CGI was passable, but this movie offers nothing to me. Much like most modern day horror movies - there is a lack of truthful fright in this movie, no sense of dread. The Nun itself is quite an unsettling entity, but its mystic is lost barely 1/3 of the way into the movie as it appears over and over again. The acting was mediocre, but there was simply no investment to be done in any of these characters. A very forgettable performance by Jonas Bloquet who is otherwise quite solid. Overall, teenagers and children should enjoy this movie as it is action packed, with jumpscares that will get your heart racing, but beyond that it is simply not a scary movie. The concept is good but the character development, plot and script leave a lot to be desired.5.5/10",The Nun

1263,geekybar,The NUN is a journey to find the source of Evil Valak,6,11 September 2018,"With the latest thriller The Conjuring, the audience has the opportunity to learn more about the origins of Valak - the evil demon takes the shape of an early mother.The character Valak (Bonnie Aarons) first appeared on screen in the movie The Conjuring 2 (2016) has caused the fever just like the doll Annabelle three years ago thanks to the appearance of disgust, the same power of transformation inconceivableTaking on the role of cameo (guest) in Annabelle: Creation (2017), Valak continues to have his own film about origin with The Nun.The Nun scene was in 1952, which preceded almost every event in the movie universe The Conjuring.At a secluded monastery in Romania, a suicide nun. Feeling irregular, the Vatican immediately dispatched Burke's father (Demián Bichir) and Irene (Tessa Farmiga) to investigate.Having arrived in the mountains of eastern Europe, they receive help from Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) - the first to discover the body of a suicide nun. The trio did not know that they were prepared to confront the mighty demon Valak - who exploited the sin or vulnerability of each individual to spread fear.
Gorgeous atmosphere throughout, but less freshThe first big plus of The Nun is the film set the atmosphere of horror early. The film takes full advantage of the ancient, monumental backdrop of the mountain monastery to create a series of dark, dark vistas. Inside, light from the candles or oil lamps helps set the scene for a series of horror scenes.The Nun's background mainly takes place at a monastery. But, this is a very large place, even as lax as a maze. It also has certain rules when there are areas where only nuns are allowed to set foot.The monastery contains innumerable nooks, and Valak is free to direct ghosts leaping to scare the characters or the audience. It could be the long corridor of the monastery, the big mirror, or even the underground coffin. Devilish manipulation of all, and push the viewer into the atmosphere of fear.The horror factor in The Nun is dense, and will make many fans of horror films feel satisfied. However, for those who have followed the movie The Conjuring, they can see that The Nun has not made a breakthrough clear.As in The Conjuring 2, Valak is a cunning, evil-minded devil, having prepared a long-drawn plan to trap the Warren couple, to The Nun, it's just like a demon, to scare any human that you see.
Valak's origin is somewhat revealedIn The Nun, the audience is reminiscent of the events of The Conjuring 2 (2016) when Valak hatches Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) with a series of scary images, or even suddenly appear in The Warren House.Where did Valak come from, where did her grandmother shape come from, or how powerful was her power? A series of questions was asked by the audience after The Conjuring 2 closed two years ago. And now The Nun is supposed to deliver the answer to the viewers.It can be said, The Nun has somehow explained the question. However, it does not come from the fact that Burke's father or Irene's apprentice went to investigate, but simply through the narrative of a minor figure. The two main characters of the movie are no different ""prey"" for Valak hunting in the dark.Religious elements are mentioned quite a lot in the film, and are important details to help Father Burke and Irene confront evil. But the exploits are mechanical, and there is a lack of internal struggles needed to better define their psyche.The Nun focused on exploiting fear from the audience, rather than digging into human characters. And the film lacks a human story behind the fear - which The Conjuring 2 has done quite well besides the scare phase.In addition, the end of the film clearly shows the intent of the production crew. They may want to make a movie about Valak (like Annabelle), because the ending of The Nun is not directly connected to events at The Conjuring 2. There is still a gap in the timeline of The Universe. Conjuring for Valak so that the team can exploit.
Back to the group of human characters, Burke's father Demián Bichir presents are quite mysterious, and curious to the viewer. However, throughout the film, he always puts himself in the passive position, even making his companion in danger.Fortunately, Irene's practicing nun, Taissa Farmiga, has captured the emotions of the viewers. The 24-year-old has a bright face with a clear nail on her face. All in opposition to the devil Valak always waiting to invade her body.Considered as a separate horror film, The Nun can be quite good with horror elements are pushed up to full size. However, the film has not made a breakthrough compared to what the movie universe The Conjuring has done.",The Nun

Her design made me uncomfortable, she was a nun but she could also be a priest, two figures where we try to find comfort and loss (in the good sense) of God.
The way she moved left me trapped in bed with the feeling that I was being watched in the dark, but then she let me down in the end the moment she was defeated (her screaming teeth ended up helping in disappointment).
But when they announced her movie I got hype, nun / demon was going to have its origin.
The film started with her in action, one of the nuns entering inside that dark room (at first it was a room because we did not have much information), had the famous cliche scene of all the demons films (the victim being dragged to the dark), the younger nun to run and behind her the corridor with the candles fading, this moment was really beautiful to see because besides being much used never goes out of fashion, the calm and smooth way in which she walks the corridor showed how much she wanted to implement fear in the victim, an action of the type ""My simple walk makes you stay like a stone, terrified"" or ""i dont need to run"", and the moment that Sister Victoria opens the window, we are really waiting for The nun at least close the window or attack the sister but no, she did not, she left her commit suicide and miss the chance to leave.
The film features the three characters, The person with the dark past, the innocent and pure young woman, and the person who will be killed in the end.
The priest's past had been explored ""a little,"" the child who died was supposed to make us feel kind of pitiful toward the priest but honestly did not have an impact as it should have had, leaving then the question ""why using always a kid in a backstory?"". Completely unnecessary.
Father Burke is a character with no charisma.
Sister Irena, a sweet, sweet nun who has not yet made the official vows, her role was like a Disney princess in which she meets the wicked witch and in the end she is saved by the prince. How she managed to save Father Burke who was inside the box remains a mystery because without wanting to offend but the sweet Taissa Farmiga has a physical at first glance delicate like a flower.
In the middle of the night the priest burke hears the sound of the child, he sees the child and follows the child, in the middle of the night, in a cemetery in the middle of the night, a person in his perfect judgment would not go to a cemetery at that time and worse still follow a person who died years ago and eventually suffers the consequences. At that moment we assume that he will die there, alone, agonized in the dark inside the casket, being tortured by silence.
But who saves the day? in which case, who saves the night? The sweet Sister Irene in the middle of the night also decides to follow something and by luck besides to take a jumpscare she manages to save the burke priest using the byakugan.
Throughout the film the nun had the opportunity to at least kill the three characters but she preferred to play hide and seek with them while providing information about her past, attracting the characters, making them discover everything, the only way of escaping from the place would be to let them complete almost all the puzzles and then to attack and it was what the public had during the whole movie, it appears in the bottom of the corridor and then disappears, the scenes of jumpscare of the film were introduced in moments of pure human stupidity, they know that they are in a haunted place by a demon figure and decide to leave the group in various situations. It's a typical movie in which in every scene you scream ""WHY ?? WHY ??"".
Frenchie, the young playboy who tries to use the charm at first sight for Sister Irene has been in the movie just to make the connection with The Conjuring. Nothing important stood out in the character except for the fact that it had one of the worst decisions although cliche of all the movies of the genre, being in a dark corridor and then hearing a noise and moving away from the group.
The final fight was something of an action movie, the nun once again had opportunities to kill or own all but did not, this led to her supposed defeat.
Scenes to be highlighted in the film are the group of dead nuns, if the film had used them as members or disciples of the demon nun would be something that could bear incredible fruits in the Conjuring universe, but the film used them only as a type of flashback / body without. soul.
Another scene to highlight is the moment when Frenchie saves Sister Irene, typical of action movie / disney movie.
but even after all this The nun eventually manages to escape through Frenchie in the Harry Potter style and the deathly hallows thus creating the connection with The conjuring universe.
I gave the movie 7/10 although it had its huge flaws I liked the movie as a whole.
I would watch again without any problem.",The Nun

1272,luiandsa,It was a pretty good movie,8,10 April 2019,"To begin with, the Nun was a scare! I could feel suspense each time someone was walking down a hallway alone with the scary low music.There were also some times that there was obviously going to be jumpscare. So it wouldn't hurt to put unexpected jump scares throughout the movie. I also got into the plot (no spoilers), because of the mystery hidden behind THAT door. And what was unleashed by unlocking it. It kept me at the edge of my seat each time something mysterious was solved. Overall, it was a pretty good movie with a good plot. It could improve on how the suspense is built up throughout the story, but The Nun is still a good movie to watch.",The Nun

1282,Daliibor,Creepy movie with great setting and sound.,9,11 September 2018,"I thought this was the creepiest movie of the conjuring franchise as the setting of this movie made it all that much more creepier especially down in the catacombs. I did not find any comedy in this movie at all except maybe one line near the beginning other then that i have no idea how people are finding this movie comical. Great atmosphere, good tension in certain areas, and the setting for this movie make it the most freakiest movie to me in the conjuring universe and top 3 scariest of all time for me. The plot was good, not great but horror movies tend to have a simple plot in my opinion after seeing so many. I feel like the movie could have been better by having less jump scare scenes but those scenes I thought were great in my opinion. This movie deserves to be watched in absolute silence as theres only 3 main characters and not a lot of talking takes place. There is dialogue but not as much as you would think. You either will like this movie or hate it I feel like but to me I liked it a lot as not a lot of horror movies have great scenery and atmosphere to go with the movie and wow this movie definitely does in my opinion. The abbey itself is creepy and so is the graveyard plus the lack of lighting(candles basically) add more depth.

They just took something from The Conjuring the we found scary and went ""oH, here's that thing that scares you, with a lot of other things that can also scare you!""

1286,joaomonteiro-62823,The nun - bittersweet,6,15 September 2021,"The Nun was a long-awaited movie to come out. Who is the person who doesn't want to see the iconic demon from The Conjuring 2 back on screen? And when it comes to James Wan, meaning the script, everything turned out fine, not being a spectacular movie, but always being a little more interesting than a normal cliché horror movie.But here's the thing. I think James Wan, in the things he does in movies, only does one harm, which is the directors he chooses. When we have a movie directed by him, we have a perfect movie, when we don't, we have crap. I give you simple examples from this franchise: La Llorona, The Conjuring 3, the nun herself...
And Nun really has some editing issues. There is a part where there is a sudden zoom that doesn't make any sense, when the three go down the stairs to reach the body of the nun who had committed suicide, the priest goes ahead on the stairs, and then, when the scene cuts, he appears behind of Frenchie, and especially in the final part, where they finally fight Valak. The next scene doesn't have any quality, the special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen, it feels like I'm watching an eighties movie, and of course some quite cliché jumpscares.I rate this movie, unfortunately, with six stars, although I would love to give it all seven. The script is captivating, and it's one of those supernatural horror movies that I like. However, we have these editing problems that don't make my decision any easier. But this will be it. It's a shame, but that's what it is.",The Nun

Some of the comments are unnecessarily overcritical and seem to enjoy rating down a movie that is clearly better than the majority of horror movies available.A complaint overly available on this site is that the movie relies heavily on jump scares. In my view, without these a movie easily can become dull. I like to be spooked when I watch horror. Without these, a horror film seems very bland.Aside of the scares, the storyline has a nice buildup and to my taste manages to keep suspense. The movie does have a few things that come across as ridiculous. But for me, this wasn't disappointing at all. The movie provided a great horror sensation, even after watching it again after a few years.",The Nun

I love the conjuring movies and when i heard that the nun from conjuring 2 is getting her own movie, i was so excited. To be honest when i went to the cinema to watch the movie, i've never been so disappointed in my whole life. This character had huge potential but they ruined the movie. I don't know maybe i'm the only one but the movie's atmosphere wasn't just scary enough, they added a couple of jump scares but in the end the movie was just too raw and it felt like they made it only with 1 month. I love James Wan movies, because when there is supposed to be a jumpscare - there isn't one, like he adds jumpscares to unpredictable spots.

You've got the big nasty antagonist. And you've got a genuine eagerness from everyone that enjoyed all of the other films connected with this one. 
However, a jumpscare every 10-15 minutes doesn't necessarily make a horror film a good one. They massively overdo and rely on the jumpscares to keep the audience entertained and distracted from what is essentially a poor story. 
The acting is okay. The ""comic relief"" is diabolical and unnecessary. 
That's not to say I didn't enjoy the film. The majority of the scares were done superbly. It's just that I get the general feeling that this film was rushed so that the producers could piggyback the successes of the other films in the franchise.

The second Conjuring film had some good points, yet left me feeling that the fresh ideas were beginning to run dry. And then we have: The Nun.Despite it's great cgi, wonderful mood and cinematography, The Nun was in the end a pretty serious let down. In spite of what seemed to be a healthy budget, the writers forced otherwise decent actors to death march through a script, that missed dozens of opportunities for decent scares, and plagued the audience with numerous absolutely nonsensical sequences. And what wasn't written into the action was ham fistedly explained in a hopelessly forced discussion of the abbey's dark history.In the end the only thing keeping me up at night about this film was whether or not they'll beat another sequel out of this dead horse or, god willing, let the tired old fella die.",The Nun
1305,Chepech,Is funny in a dark way,5,9 September 2018,"The premise seems interesting for the first 10 min, the first scene sets a good atmosphere. Which is followed by a bad drag that some how recovers in the 2 third of the movie. I think what ruined the experience to me personally is that the theater was completely alone when I saw it, it was just me, my teen age kids and my wife. This enabled us to speak out loud which we never do when there is other people around. This enabled us to speak our minds on every scene which was very comical at some points, from pointing out absurd character reactions, recurrent gimmicks and plainly funny scenes. At the end we did enjoyed for the wrong reasons, my stomach hurt at the end from laughing so hard.I think the cast is solid, the story is somewhat coherent, the score is ominous, but it fails to stablish a truly scary atmosphere, miserablely. By the 3 or fourth time you see a dead nun turn to life and a forced camera pan that causes the grim figure to disappear and reappear in closer to the character it already goes beyond cliché into the realm of comedy. Added to that one of my kids yelled ""Fuz-ro-dah"" every time the evil nun sent some one flying to a wall which made us laugh a lot.I enjoyed the rest of the Conjuring's universe movies (except for the first Annabel which is plainly bad and boring) this surprisingly too but judging it as a horror movie certainly falls short compared to the previous ones.So shade away all good expectations if you plan to see it and you may happen to have a good time, probably for the wrong reasons as I did.",The Nun

It's well worth watching and is very obviously being review-bombed for reasons I cannot fathom.Setup: an apparent suicide at a deeply isolated Convent of vast Gothic proportions. Body is discovered by local French-Canadian farmer. A Priest with a history is sent to investigate, along with a pre-Nun who 'has visions'.There follow a load of set-pieces that are supposed to be scary, but really just add some flavour. All the 'jump' moments are clearly telegraphed with ground-shaking sound effects and they're mostly very predictable, but no worse for that. Crucially, there is an abundant lack of The Stoopid that plagues so many horrors. Everyone acts more or less exactly as they should in the given context. The characters are believable and likeable.The only thing I can really think of as a negative is the completely inexplicable splitting up of the three leads at the end, which serves no purpose other than to add drama (given that two of them can do literally nothing of any use without the third), but even that is forgivable since it gives each a chance to deal with their own respective demons.If you're a fan of The Conjuring series, this is a fine addition.

The NUN was just dead scary from start to finish and at the end we realized The Nun makes ANNABELLE look like Cinderella.This is a fantastic series and I can see in the future theaters having a conjuring night where all of them are shown as a package must like Harry Potter is doing now.There was a weird thing that happened after the movie I took a picture of the nun poster and there was no light on it and I used no flash but when I posted it on Facebook the light was over the Nuns head, and that's no lie.

Ed warrens sense of humour in the other films was well placed, and added too his character. This time, it was a little unnecessary for the character of Frenchie. Which leads me to my second and final gripe.... WHY... shoe horn Frenchie into this film! He is the subject of another of the Warrens stories, but I don't believe he ever went to Romania as he lived on his abusive dads farm pretty much all of his life before meeting his first wife ( if the book is accurate that is). Surely people who love these films would pick up on that. I find that creating storylines which people were never supposed to be involved in like this gives a dishonour to the Warrens Source Material and where possible... the film makers should stick to as much of the 'fact' as they can, even when it is surrounded by the artistic licence of films like this one, (which is very loosely based on a 'real demon'). It's what makes the stories more interesting, especially when you can make up your mind around whether you believe the Warrens stories or not.

But this film didn't meet the expectation and I doubt, is it a franchise of Conjuring? The film begins with a scary quote ""GOD ENDS HERE"" at Carta Monastery where two nuns attacked by runny goth ( unknown presence, you can only see a face wearing a worse makeup ). Things get serious when the Vatican learns and send a father and sister to investigate the incident of Valak hide and seek. Then follows usual opera of evil terrorizing good and later the father Burke finds the origin of Valak and leads to bring it down. The rest is a jump scare fest and obscure. The movie flows with few interesting frames as well as the ridiculous storyline. Inadvertently hilarious, the climax of a nun on nun, ninja face off. I couldn't watch a full movie on one sit up though I stay put during boring lectures. The nun should be the sequel of the Scary movie. The cliche and nebulous screenplay dissipate the expectation and tension. 
Good: Dark and haunting frames, horror comedy ;)
Bad: Banal screenplay, jump scares, worse artwork

The character of ""the nun"" was cleverly inserted into the universe and was actually more chilling in the small cameos she made rather than in her own movie. When you see her in the limited appearances in this movie, the CGI crew was hard at work and took away any realistic feel. The story was extremely predictable and dull, just like every other movie in this universe. No original ideas have come from this entire universe, and one could even argue that the ""demons"" that appear throughout this universe are ripoffs from the Sam Raimi world of demons. The only saving grace, is that the bring the universe full circle by the end of this movie and it gives me hope for future horror cinematic universes.",The Nun

At times it felt more like a zombie movie more than an ""haunting"" movie. Unless you're a bunch of twelve years old teens that scream at any obvious and boring jump scares, this movie will definitely let you down.It had a way better potential, and story elements to be better than what was delivered.

In all honesty, no other scene in any scary movies has scared me more than the scenes with Valak in The Conjuring 2. So naturally, I had really high hopes for this movie.
Well, sadly The Nun was nothing like what I expected. It was a total letdown.

Went with a friend, who is a fan of the Conjuring (I saw the first one and enjoyed it, too). This movie, however, by far exceeded all my expectations as to how bad a movie can get. The whole set up was laughable. Bad acting, stupid dialogues, not a hint of story line, and every single shock moment was completely foreseeable. I have no idea how anyone who is not possessed by some evil force can rate this any higher than one star. I would easily give this a zero, if I could. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but I value a decent one when I see it. This would have been an absolute waste of time, if I hadn't had some laughs about how dumb and cliche this thing really was. It is quite brave to call this a movie and admit to the public that you had a part in it. Really guys, this isn't funny.

1359,mithrilato,"Rushed ending, audience laughing at the end",6,7 September 2018,"Where to start this review. First of all, the film starts great, showing some footage from the past how the nun appeared. Great story, with good jump scares, good scary vocals and shootings. With all these previously mentioned, the music is flawless! It goes very good with the film. 
However, later at the end when the father goes down to the deliveries and then the dead nun wakes up; like what the hell? Does this film become a ""Walking Dead"" film? To make this worse, Frenchie shot it down with a shotgun!? Like you can shoot down a ghost, logic level infinity...
As the stor goes they find the relic with the blood of Jesus Christ, okay way too easy. Sister Irene gets captured, and many dead nuns appear, so Frenchie bashes the door to save her. As he moves further to find her, the dead nuns heads start to turn with a broken bone sound; that was the part when the whole cinema was laughing. Terrible disappointing storyline.When sister Irene gets possessed by Valak, Frenchie saves her with the blood of Christ. Sure, no problem, but even a single drop of the blood of Christ could have killed Valak. But, yeah, the story has to go on, it would way to easy.
When Valak appears from the water and tries to choke sister Irene, Valak later touches the relic that contains the blood. You don't have to be a Bible nerd, or be religious to know this, but Valak cannot even be close to the relic, as it is so sacred no demonic presence can stand near it.Overall, it was an okay movie till the end, as it became rushed, the audience were laughing instead of getting scared. I hope the next horror movie from Mr.Wan will be a better one.",The Nun

It's a mix between zombies (because the bodies crack a lot), some kind of weird ghosts that magically die by a normal, usual gun bullet and some dark comedy.

3. Re-edits of the best which fall short of their original issue (all zombie movies after ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""28 Days Later"" and so on)""The Nun"" marks the newly found fourth cluster, in which although the movie begins with a somewhat exploitative and promising reason to be (remember the painting in The Conjuring 2?) continues and ends up being as I rightly pointed out in the title an ""A** gravy of the worst kind"".Acting should have been suspended until actors were found.
Screenplay should have been done in a more imaginative and adult manner (how many more times will we have to reiterate Snow White before we fall nose first in some new ideas), therefore screenplay should have been given a chance for upgrade and be written by fourth graders;
Directing should have been done by an individual who either cares about his work and his work aftertaste to others or by someone who enjoys not turning an otherwise promising prequel into ultimately something which is abhorrent in any perspective available.I have ended watching the movie after 25 minutes and continued at home for a better formed opinion.",The Nun

Rule number one in horror movies: DONT USE A VERY SCARY SCENE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE. Rule number two: DONT MAKE THE SCARY AND JUMPPING SCEANS TOO OBSESSED.From a movie which was supposed to be, allegedly, on a scary nun, we got a movie on evil , Satan, and other 90's horror movies stuff.

For example the pope meeting was ridiculous. It seemed like the Grandfather mixed with End of Days. Father Burke looked like a mafioso. Sister Irene was the young, cute female surrogate with way too much makeup. And Frenchie? Was this some joke for comedic relief. No believable and strong correlation between Valek background, the Catholics in Rome, the nunnery in England and the Orthodox in Romania. Too many subplots trying to show character backgrounds and weaknesses. The jump scares have been heavily used and Valek's attacks became boring...

As I am crazy fan of horror movies my whole life, it is kind of hard to find horror movie that I love, that gives me unexpected jump scares, and that has a great story, and this movie gave all of this to me. If you have watched all of other movies from The Conjuring franchise, you probably will like this movie. It fits perfectly into all of the franchise. I have read that it is not original, that is already seen thing. Well out of over 500 horror movies I've watched in my life, I don't remember the stories similar to this...yes it is about possession, but not as it is usually done in the movies.",The Nun

Simple enough-and the backbone of any good movie. Unfortunately the writers, director and producers chose to give us neither. The result is an incoherent, confused, depthless, intelligence-insulting mess full of plot holes, cheap scares and underdeveloped characters.

I didnt know if this was about the Nun or the priest possessed kid he dealt with in the past. The humor they tried to achieve with the character frenchie was very lacking. This overall film sucked. I was really excited to finally know the story about the Nun. I went into it thinking it would achieve a story like Annabelle. That had me scared, and satisfied. That connected all the movies together. This movie sucked.",The Nun

From the biginning of the movie i didn't understand why they senf a nun that haven't finished her votes, that just dosen't makes sense, and it di looked like a zombie movie, there was a lot a dead bodies that jumped to the camera, unfortunately the character of the nun wasn't paied the respect and the horror from the conjuring 2, she just looked like a woman with bad VFX. The priest was the worst of the movie, he could not be in it and it was just the same, the characters were stupd, they did a lot of the cliches from the terror movies, at a point it was very predictible was going to happen, so in cloclusion the movie was very boring, it is sad that they had the potential to be one of the best, but they only dissapointed us.",The Nun
1404,supremeepcz,"Personally, it's not a good movie.",3,30 September 2018,"(All my opinion)I walked into The Nun expecting very little, and very little is what I got. But comparing it to other horror movies from this year like Slender Man and Truth Or Dare, it wasn't as terrible in my opinion. Let's get the obvious question out the way. Was it scary? Absolutely not, I don't expect everyone to feel the same about this but I found this movie to be very boring and very cliche with it's attempt of scaring me. Constant jump-scares were distracting, annoying and blew all tension it potentially could of built out the window. The lighting was very poor, I understand that it needs a dark, gloomy atmosphere but if you limit the light enough so it becomes hard to see, then that becomes a problem. Some shots have more lighting which ruins all contrast the movie was establishing, but I guess that can be faulted to the editing. Simple reshoots could've saved this.While the performances from the leads wasn't bad, the characters they were playing were not developed properly. I never found myself caring for these characters at all, anything we learn from these characters rarely relate to the plot at all, making whatever development pointless and lacklustre.It's really hard to point out positives in this movie, I can't really say anything was ""good"". The acting was ok, the shots were basic but not inventive or creative, the score was forgettable, the horror was non existent, sound design was very stock-like. I can't say anything positive, it's all really underdeveloped, bad or ok at best. However, that is my opinion, and that's why I gave The Nun and 3/10",The Nun

1424,rnahafahik,Another below average endeavor into the Conjuring Universe,4,7 September 2018,"With The Conjuring (2013), James Wan built upon his first outing with Insidious to make a modern horror classic. The way in which he earned his jump-scares and kept them relatively scarce when compared to other contemporaries was refreshing and it was well-executed. 
One thing that the studios most likely adored about the movie was the potential for spin-offs, prequels and sequels. However, as we saw with Annabelle, it takes more than just a premise (or in this case a doll) to truly make a good horror movie. Over-reliance on cheap jump scares with a clumsy attempt at building tension (with one scene that works quite well) added up to a lackluster entry into what is now called The Conjuring Universe.Fast forward to 2018, after sequels to both The Conjuring and Annabelle have released, we get another prequel, The Nun. Before going into the movie, I noticed that James Wan, similar to Annabelle, did not direct this movie. Instead we get Corin Hardy, whom I had not heard of before. To my knowledge, he has directed one other horror movie that did about average critically.
On to the actual review of the movie itself.In terms of creepiness, this movie is miles above Annabelle, though it owes a lot of that to the setting and personal taste. That's not to say that this is a particularly scary movie, though, as the jump-scares are laughably predictable at times, and only momentarily ""spooky"" at others. It never builds a steadily rising level of creepy tension as its mainline predecessors or even that of this year's Hereditary, which I find far superior to the Nun. 
The movie's most egregious sin, however, is reducing the fear the titular nun Valak evokes by giving her insane amounts of screen time, more than any horror movie demon should get. This familiarises the audience with her and thus weakens the fear she instills in the viewer. On a character level, the movie falters. Despite having distinctly fewer characters than the Conjuring, they also feel distinctly blander. We know less about their personalities and they have next to no time to bond with each other. This weakens the third act of the movie in the way that we aren't as invested in the characters as we were in Wan's movies, this can be attributed to both the acting, but mostly to the writing. Couple this with the fact that Father Burke added nothing to the movie besides getting Sister Irene to the abbey, and the movie's flaws vastly outweigh its positives, which can be summed up as follows:
1. The setting is interesting
2. The music, although not reminiscent of a horror soundtrack and rather sounds like a fantasy movie at times, was good and added to the spectacle of some scenes (note I said spectacle, not creepiness/horror)On a script level, there are some leaps in logic that the viewer will have to suspend their disbelief for in order to enjoy the movie, but overall it works well enough for what it is. What the movie also lacks is consequence. Besides Frenchie/Maurice being possessed at the end, no one died and it doesn't feel like the anything has truly changed for the worse. Even the reveal that Frenchie was possessed was undercut by the neutral/uplifting score, lighting and general mood of the scene. One thing that could have changed this is to have Father Burke die in the grave. It would give Valak a more threatening role, and it would also isolate Sister Irene even further, which would go a long way to making the movie more uneasy. Plus, this would not change the rest of the movie in the slightest, as Father Burke barely interacts with Sister Irene or assists in any meaningful way in ""dismantling"" Valak at the end. The B-story about Burke and Daniel was disjointed from the main story anyway. It would have increased the stakes and the tension immensely and left some screentime to develop Frenchie and Irene further. Alas, a missed opportunity among many.Overall I rate the Nun a 4/10, it can be enjoyable if you're easily scared or if jump-scares still get to you, or even if you're a fan of the Conjuring Universe. However, it isn't exceptional in any area",The Nun

Excellent setting that could have been an amazing spooky backdrop but a weak script that borders on silly many times and a shortage of visuals (a blacked out nun face in a habit can only be used so many times before we start sleeping) make this a flop. I'm a big reactor to jump scenes in movies so the fact that I didn't jump once told my movie seat neighbours this one was a miss.

1440,morten2,A semi good movie,6,7 September 2018,"The movie starts out looking very promising, with Valak as the main villain. Personally, I had been Looking forward to this movie ever since the premiere viewing of the second conjuring as I found Valak a very intresting and unnerving antagonist. Even though my initial high expectations, the track record for Conjuring spin offs is mediocre at best. However, I did find this movie to be better of than the first Annabelle and on par with the second one. The movie establishes the story in an excellent way and I was really looking forward to the horror movie of the year. However, the longer the movie ran, the more obvious the movies short comings became. Acting was a bit ""meh"", special effects that didn't quite satisfy and more than anything, comic relief that at some times ruined all suspense. In my opinion, the nun shares this problem with IT (the movie), although not as evidently. The movie is unnerving at times, but doesn't live up to the original conjurings scare factor. The story worked pretty good for me, and there was some twists that actually worked pretty Well. However, it is not scary, if anything a bit unsettling. For fans of the series, it is definently worth while, since it still is a pretty good movie. For the rest, the ones not familiar with the conjuring universe, I advise you to see the originals first, the consider this one. Also S/O to the gorgeous setting.

I've always found w both of the previous Conjuring movies, they start off well and then, there's a point where it starts to become ridiculous. In both films, the scenes involved Vera Farmiga.

If you watch horror movies to have fun then yeah this is great for you. This movie is entertaining and that's about all I can say about it. The Conjuring Universe has been a powerhouse of a universe ever since the first Conjuring movie. This movie is the origin story of a main antagonist from the second Conjuring movie. If you had seen the other movies then I would understand why you didn't like this one.This movie fell short in many ways. The jump scares and disturbing aspects of this movie seemed overly forced. The jump scares weren't creative, the disturbing parts just were cliche. Th dialogue wasn't the best but it was definitely better than I would've thought. You spend a lot of this movie rather confused. The tension that makes a horror movie scary just wasn't there. You got jump scares and then it flatlined until the next jump scare.Now with all that being said the movie was not terrible. Like I said before, the movie is still quite entertaining, but that misses the whole power that this universe had. The story may not be well executed but it's interesting. I sat waiting to understand what was happening and a movie should keep you interested like that. The cinematography was great, having filmed in Romania definitely added more to the aesthetic of the movie.

I still remember Conjuring 1 almost scene by scene. That's the kind of impact it had & still has. The Nun comes as a huge disappointment for this series loyal fans who've watched all the movies in this series, so far. 
Very predictable plot & presentation. The Nun was way more scary in its extremely short role in Conjuring 2. However, the full length movie made it look mediocre rather than scary. You just happen to know what to expect next. 
Story starts well but the makers failed to keep up the intensity. They just believed in jump scares every now & then. Probably, they should've made it a 1 hour TV show which would've been better
Few of the scenes are illogically funny
The Demon's diaolg 'from tomorrow this village...'Superstrong demon that can thrash people by just screaming or hand gesture, has to individually kill each & every main character to death by choking them. Really?All the priests & soldiers of the church had to put lots of efforts & put holy water etc. to shut the door to the gateway for Demon. And the gate got opened by bombarding during the war!!! Well..Can't share the complete story as there isn't much of story anyways.

Too much comic relief.,The Nun
1469,lm-70197,Deterioration of a Franchise,4,5 September 2018,"What makes a great horror movie? The subtlety and finesse in crafting tension and horror without revealing much; the gradual buildup of horror through the unknown; having the audience know that something is out there and not revealing it immediately. The Nun does the exact opposite of all of this.I was invited to an early premiere of The Nun yesterday and although I didn't have high expectations, I was still disappointed.I watched all the Conjuring and Annabelle spin-offs thanks to my wife's obsession with horror flicks, but for the most part I enjoyed most off them. Considering the success of the first Conjuring, I always hoped that the next sequel/prequel builds on the strengths of the first, where tension and horror is built slowly and gradually, culminating in tense and horrific scenes and a climatic finish. Unfortunately with each new installment, I found that the same narrative and scare tropes are implemented, making the movie more predictable and mundane.Unfortunately The Nun takes this to a whole new comical level. How can such a IP go so wrong?! Creepy demon nun? Check! Old isolated abandoned castle? Check! Pseudo-religious lore to build on? Check! Romania? Check! - The producers and director had all the ingredients to create a great horror flick. They ended up making a movie more tailored to a young adult/teenage fan-base, relying on cliche story-line, extremely dumb protagonists and never ending predictable jump scares. Don't get me wrong, I like a good ol' jump scare when used right, but this movie almost solely relies on them.But the worst part of the movie, and where I think it got it so wrong, is how it reveals everything way too much and way too early. Not only do you see the nun in the first 5 minutes and constantly jumping out every 10 minutes, you hear her screaming, attacking victims etc. repeatedly throughout the movie. By the time the third act takes place you already have seen all the scares on offer and it becomes comical. The entire theater was literally laughing throughout the final act. Overall it is a disappointing movie. There is not point in telling people not to waste their time watching it, as the movie will piggy-back on the success of it's predecessors and make a ton of money.and PS; what is the deal with all the demons growling and screaming like hungry hyenas?",The Nun
1470,monicasbnovais,Low ratings due high expectations.,6,24 September 2018,"The rating of The Nun is farelously low due the strong connection it has with The Conjuring. We also have to look at it as it is - a spin off not a sequel.
Conjuring is without a doubt one of the best/scariest horror movies of the last years and with this is mind you walk into the cinema with your expectation starting from this point. Fair enough since the scary-cannot-sleep-at-night-nun is a huge part of it. From this point of view the movie doesn't make any justice to it's antecedent with this zombie looking spirits.If you look at it as it should, a spin off, it is actually very entertaining. The Nun delivers quite a few jump scares - some of them quite cliche which leads you to close your eyes 2 seconds before they happen so you can hear the rest of the cinema going 'aaaaaah'. Overall if you have a good company and you want to do a typical movie night at the cinema watching a few characters to sleep in bed with their shoes (?) why not consider watching The Nun.",The Nun

The vatican heard about the abbey and about a suicide of a nun, and calls father burke a priest that specializes in Bad entitys and also the vatican calls a novice called Irene play by the beautiful Taissa Farmiga, younger sister of Verá Farmiga and they got the help of Maurice or frenchie like he like to call him.This movie i found it very entertaining, is not long with 96 minutes, it doesn't have many scares and tieds up very well to the Conjuring franchise",The Nun

A mysterious meeting in Vatican City, a trek through Romanian countryside during which local lore is discussed, and the arrival of our bland heroes at a castle straight out of Dracula.Unfortunately, the plot essentially dies on the vine at this point while the movie bumbles through one predictable horror sequence after another with no sense of pacing or subtlety.Clear talent on display in some areas, but this one should've marinaded a little longer.",The Nun

1550,acedillon,Messy Story Line/Terrible Organization - No spoilers,2,14 September 2018,"Where to start... 
Well if you're thinking that this movie will explain the nun from the Insidious movies, you're sadly mistaken. I went to see this movie because I have enjoyed the Conjuring, Annabelle, the Insidious movies etc. The 'Nun' that terrorizes people throughout the movies by creeping out of the darkness or attempting to strangle them was always a mystery to viewers. 
I wanted to see where the Nun came from, her background, and what her motive was - but they just brushed over this to make things pop out at you while you watch.
The acting was good, but the storyline was terrible. 
Characters would come out of nowhere, with not much of an explanation of where they came from, what their background was - oh but now they are one of the important characters...
In my opinion, the whole movie was just thrown together, where it leaves you confused and doesn't make sense from what they had tried to do from the beginning, the ending was absolutely terrible, and disappointing even for a bad scary movie. 
The ending shows you that they legitimately just rushed everything, maybe they had a time crunch - as if this is a school project and they had to come up with a quick conclusion for their paper that they BS'ed the whole way through, as they pulled an all nighter. Well, this student CLEARLY didn't read the book for their project, as this seems as if whoever created this movie had never seen any of the Insidious movies, Conjuring, etc.",The Nun

1555,daphnevrieling,The Darkest Chapter(?),6,6 September 2018,"*MINOR SPOILERS*Today I went to see The Nun. A movie that was really high on my list for most anticipated movies of 2018 as I am a huge fan of The Conjuring universe. The movie was unfortunately a bit disappointing, perhaps because of my high expectations, but let's take a look at what was good and what made it a bit disappointing without giving away too much. I have to say I loved the music. The eerie music from composer Abel Korzeniowski really sets the tone for this story. Music is key when making a horror movie, as they say: when you are scared during a horror movie, better cover your ears instead of your eyes.The casting was good, Taissa Farmiga was solid in her part as Sister Irene. It is a bit unclear however why novitiate Sister Irene is asked to visit the abbey alongside Father Burke, a man with way more experience than Sister Irene. Perhaps because of the visions she has regarding the abbey and The Nun / Valak, but it was never really explained why she has these visions. Demián Bichir Nájera plays the role of Father Burke. He is summoned by the Vatican to investigate the abbey and the death of one of the nuns. Valak torments Father Burke with images of an exorcism that went wrong in the past where a young boy lost his life.Overall, the character development lacked however. We do not really get to know the characters as well as I would have liked.The set design was good, perhaps a little too 'blue', but the eerie story does comes to life through the set design.When I look at the movie I had the feeling some scenes were rushed, like the scene when Sister Irene takes her vows, while other scenes dragged on for a little too long, like the scene where Father Burke is burried alive. I expected it to be a dream sequence, but it turned out to be a regular scene, which I thought did not really fit in. The movie was also filled with (cheap) jumpscares, which was unfortunate. This could have been a much better movie if it relied on better storytelling and building of tension like the movie Hereditary (2018). The Nun a.k.a. demon Valak did not have as much screentime as I would have liked her / it to have. Whenever The Nun / Valak was on screen, it definitely made the movie better. The character of The Nun was actually creepier in The Conjuring 2 (2016).There are some things I was (unpleasantly) surprised about, like the zombie aspect of the movie. For me, that part was not very fitting for The Conjuring universe.The runtime was about 96 minutes, but it could have been longer if some scenes would have gotten more attention. The Buildup and storytelling would also have been better. It did not feel like a well thought-out story.All in all it was a reasonably enjoyable horror movie for those who enjoy jumpscare horrors, but I did expect a better movie, especially with James Wan as producer and writer.~Daphne",The Nun
1556,buckt-50366,Jumps aside this is a good Horror Movie,8,7 September 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie, it was of course a bit predictable, but the idea of the movie should give you enough information to know this.The scene is well set in the Romanian castle and it was used to good effect, without giving any spoilers the use of the darkness, light and atmosphere was well executed.The acting was good and the occasional bits of humour did well to clear the palate of fear and reset for the next scare.Some people didn't like the jumps, well that is one of the things that happens in this film and it works. Some of the scenes caused me to get an odd shiver and that is something I seldom get from Horror movies any more - so for me - they worked!If you are a horror fan like I am, then I have to say this is well worth watching. If you prefer the psychological thriller types or those that you need to think through then you will likely still enjoy it, just not as much as I did!",The Nun

He was the one that put Jesus is blood on her so there should have never been anything with him being possessed because he didn't fall in the water he didn't fall in anything that would make that blood disappear.

The film is too fast pace in that it just goes from jump scare to another and does not allow for tension to build up and by the the final 1/3 of the film it is predictable and the theatre actually laughed at what is going on.

I can confirm that this person is wrong, Most of the scares utilized heavy CGI! In fact, there were only 2 or 3 moments throughout its duration that I believe it actually used real effects, make up and blood.I won't dig into the details because honestly, it wouldn't be worth it. It's a story about a Nun who isn't actually a Nun that is called upon by the Vatican to investigate an Abbey that has been taken over by a demon. That's about as much story as you get, then it's just jump scares the rest of the way. Even if you go into this expecting to jump out of your seat, you won't.It also treats the viewer like a moron. Protagonist goes into dungeon area, lantern runs out, oh a candle and matches suddenly appear! (which is the quickest camera shot ever, just to acknowledge how stupid it looks!)Oh and then there's a massive eye rolling moment about 3/4 of the way through, where the protagonist suddenly decides to take her vows.

1582,noraanabeth,Valak had better scenes in The Conjuring 2 than in his own movie,4,23 September 2018,"Let me start this off by saying that I do love The Conjuring films. They usually nail the paranormal horror genre and keep things, remotely, fresh. That being said, The Nun has been the biggest let-down in this franchise. Valak was barely in his own movie; if you were to combine all of his scenes I don't think you would even get 13 minutes of screen time. Instead, the focus of the film seemed to be on the secondary horror characters, than the actual titular character. Valak was scarier, and had more impactive screen time in The Conjuring 2. The Nun also relies way too heavily on jump scares, which is a major jab to many people as Valak is believed to be the scariest/creepiest villain in the entire franchise. Valak menacingly coming from the dark hallway in the trailer was way scarier than any of the actual 'frightening,' scenes. This movie does have some redeeming qualities though. Being shot entirely in Romania, the backdrop of The Nun is nothing short of beautiful. From the Romanian countryside, to the decaying, gothic convent where the bulk of the plot unfolds, there is no shortage of 'wow.' Too bad that the stunningly horrifying convent was let down by it's underwhelming demon inhabitant. The Nun truly let down fans. It had so much potential, working with the most terrifying character in the franchise, possessing an excellent idea for the film (demon nuns? amazing!), and having a hauntingly perfect backdrop to tell the story. Yet, it still managed to fall flat. Valak is a truly terrifying entity. Too bad his film couldn't live up to his potential.",The Nun

Instead of scaring me, it actually gave me courage, which was not bad at all because it was due to the great storyline.The Nun is very easy to enjoy as you're presented with just three characters that enter the catacombs of trial in a nicely-set Romanian castle (Let's just take a moment to appreciate the well-built setting here). It's very straightforward-people will say that a horror movie should be suspense-building, like a rollercoaster that's slowly ascending, but the plot and its twists certainly made up for the decreased scare. I think it /was/ meant to be straightforward and filled with action.It's a very epic journey as the struggle against The Nun has started since so long ago, and these characters were the perfect people to put it to an end. Their efforts are entertaining to watch and them overcoming each and every difficulty is faith-building. To top it off, it ends with an AMAZING finisher and the fulfilling reunion of the three characters.",The Nun

1614,macewhitehead,Cash Grab,1,30 September 2018,"It's absolutely disrespectful to mention ""The Conjuring"" and this joke of a film in the same sentence, let alone put ""The Conjuring"" on the same poster. This film contained none of the theatrical elements that makes ""The Conjuring"" as good as it is. This film is simply a hollowed-out cash grab. The director is simply taking advantage of actual horror fans. Firstly, the acting and character development were lackluster at best. There were actually times in the film where I was rooting for main characters to die. This is okay in campy/slasher horror movies where the majority of the characters are meaningless and much more focus is given to developing the monster/villain. However, in this film you learn very little about The Nun and her motivations while learning very little about the protagonists as well! Secondly, the use of ""jump-scares"" is extensive. So much so that I stopped being scared because I expected them so consistently. Cheap effects and unlikable characters made these scares even more underwhelming. I felt that the film was pandering to the ""scared teenage girl"" demographic and true horror fans are starved of actual tension and fear. Thirdly, the setting for the film is unrepeatable. How many nuns and monks are going to be watching this film? How many people have spent months living in a monastery? Fear comes from relatable and ""safe"" places becoming dangerous. Since I will likely never step foot in a monastery then it looks like I wont have to worry about any demon nuns coming to get me. Overall, this movie was a great disappointment. The director pales in comparison to James Wan and it seems he learned nothing from the previous films in the ""Conjuring Universe"". I slept like a baby after watching this hardly impressionable film and I will have to go watch a truly great horror film to make up for the time I wasted watching this tragic assembly.",The Nun

Why even set the event in a foreign country if you're going to get the facts wrong, and you'll miss all the authenticity of a culture?

1623,stef_nimmegeers,The problem,4,25 September 2018,"The problem with this movie is the expectation of the audience and the movie itself.This movie was hyped and so was I, I went with my girlfriend to break my one rule to see it at the theater (normally I would never do this because Horror movies never live up to their trailer/).
And I would say, my one rule still stands, this movie wasn't good enough.
It lacks what most horror movies lack these days, common sense and I don't mean common sense like ""ow yeah ghosts aren't real stuff"", I mean common sense from the people in the movie, the things they go true aren't that wicked but still, how could you not just leave the place, what logical mind would still go back after you got buried, after what you just have witnessed and STILL go back.But the problem I have, like most people is: the movie isn't scary at all, no originality. Only those hateful jump scares because the sound is way to loud, not because Valak or his Black Faced Nuns are. The storyline is for me a bummer as well. The blood from Jesus..? 
I mean, that is just far-fetched. The priest finds the name of Valak almost immediately and that doesn't contribute anything towards the storyline. 
And what is the thing in the movie with those bloody bags over their heads? 
It wasn't scary or funny and they cracked like what the hell? Why make it ridiculous.""Frenchie"" was the funny in guy in this movie and I personally enjoyed that. For what its worth, yes if you are a horror fan, you should go and watch it, but not in the theaters, just wait until it's out on DVD or Blu ray and buy it then or wait till TCU comes out in a box, and most importantly; don't get your hopes up to high, maybe you should but your hopes not.",The Nun

1639,carl_lewis,ALL HAVE OUR OPINIONS BUTT DONT LISTEN TO ALL OF THE CRITICS!!!,10,8 September 2018,"Where do i begin? Well the nun started well in my opinion, it was creepy and gave me chills. As the film goes on we start to see alot of jump scares and have to agree with haters on them as they actually was predictable. There could of been one good jump scare in the movie butt unfortunately it was shown in the trailer and that was the scene where famiga was walking through a dark corridor after she hears whispers to then hear a whisper behind her, so she turns around and theres a nun stood there (NOT VALAK) then there was a pause before suddenly valak comes from nowhere from the side and runs at her. This would of been a good jump scare as it would of been unexpected butt sadly i knew it would happen as i watched the trailer. The visuals and the soundtracks was impressive throughout the movie. Also noticed some haters criticising the movie for not having suspense, this shouldnt putt you off for the simple reason we already know what the nun looks like from the conjuring 2 and in a way weve already had that suspense because we didnt see much of her in the conjuring 2 so naturally in a second movie you will see the character more frequently. For example 2016 Godzilla was criticised for not showing enough of godzilla and in the upcoming sequel you will see alot more of godzilla, if they hardly showed the nun in this movie then the haters would be saying the film is called the nun butt dont get to see her enough. Alot of haters saying its not scary ether, name me a film that is that scary you cant sleep at night i bet you cant? And dont say the exorcist. The nun is creepy and lokks visually good. One downfall though whas the character frenchie, not the best acting and tried to hard to be funny butt didnt work. Sometimes people look for the wrong things in a film. Trust me ive seen bad films i could name quite a few them then compare them to the nun and youd see the nun any day.",The Nun

They tried too hard with the scares and the scares they did try we're weak. The only positives I will give this movie are the atmosphere and the tie in with the first Conjuring, other than that I wouldn't need to see it again.

The Nun starts as a terrifying introductory; whereby hinting a glimpse about the creature you are to suffer from watching was intimidating & exciting. Furthermore, I would have enjoyed it more if only a waging war occurred between the Father and his assistant against the Evil demon instead these stages apply later and pretty much short-lengthened. Thus, their hiding spots were obviously acted out and splitting away each time a sudden event happens was unnecessary, yet too conspicuous for any audience to notice these were only theatrically emphasized.

Personally I really enjoyed the movie, but I don't think it accomplished what it tried to do:I wasn't scared. And, sure, fear is subjective. But really, it felt like it was playing it safe. It's easy to anticipate how it's going to end from the opening scene alone. You already know what's going to happen, how it's going to happen, and every scare feels cheap and unearned.That being said, I really appreciated the humor in the movie. It was quite honestly refreshing in such a cliche setting. Tongue and cheek in a plot we've seen a hundred times? More of that, please.

I went to see The Nun hoping to watch a decent horror film following the success of the franchise., but I was very disappointed.
Why do producers keep lowering their standards and producing low quality fright jumps with little built-up macabre horror? I don't understand.
The Nun just keeps appearing throughout the film from everywhere she could possibly hide. She'll come out of the water, the ground, the walls, the floor, etc, etc, etc. The writers and director really ran out of ideas on this one.The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because I chuckled at a couple of jokes and because the movie casts Mexican actor Demian Bichir, who is really great, and the Fermiga sisters who are also good at horror, just not in this case.Please stop this franchise already before people start remembering the Nun and whatever may come next.",The Nun
1677,timhealy-07220,Does not live up to the hype,3,7 September 2018,"To begin with, I went into this film with really high hopes. I love the Conjuring films and was really creeped out by Valak in The Conjuring 2. I was looking forward to seeing his origin story. Sadly that's not what you get in ""The Nun.""To start, for a film called ""The Nun,"" The Nun in question isn't really in it all that much save for the end. You don't really learn why Valak came into our world, or how/why he took on the Nun persona. He just is. There's no real back story whatsoever.The characters for me lacked any real motive. They also weren't developed very well e.g Sister Irene was chosen for ""knowing Romania well"" despite having never been there. This then fact gets forgotten about and is never mentioned again. It's also never really explained why Maurice (the comedic relief) remained in Romania. In one of the ending scenes, Valak tells Maurice he'd failed, like he's done all his life. Using a character's flaws against them usually works, but we have to know something about the character for this to be effective. What has Maurice failed at before? The lack of character development meant I really didn't care one way or the other what happened to these people.In terms of fear, this film wasn't very scary at all. There was no sense of dread or tension and the film relies on jump scares to get it through. The problem was you could see when the jump scare was coming a mile off and the best ones had already been shown in the trailer.There were also things that just didn't make any sense. We are led to believe Valak needs a human body to possess. In the opening scene he grabs a Nun and drags her into the darkness still alive. Why not just possess her? Why did the other Nun need to commit suicide? Then there is a scene where Sister Irene here's a bell ringing in the cemetery and she instantly knows that it's the father buried beneath the ground. How on earth did she come to that conclusion? In the ending scene, she is being choked underwater but still manages to break a giant glass ball thing and suck up the blood inside. How? The film then shows a flashback showing Maurice being possessed by Valak prior to the final battle with Sister Irene. If Valak was supposed to be inside Maurice, how could he have been in the water outside of Maurice, attacking Sister Irene after the event? It just made no sense!I'm not even going to start on the zombie nuns, the ghost boy or the bad CGI used for Valak!In fairness to the film, the location was good and the music was ok hence the 3 stars, but ultimately I was very dissatisfied with this film after all of the hype and it was definitely the worst in the Conjuring series. Save your money and catch this one on DVD.",The Nun

It kept me on the edge of my seat and clutching my husband's hand pretty tightly most of the time. It's best if you watch the other movies (Conjuring, etc) first in order to fully understand, appreciate, and enjoy the creepy spookiness of The Nun. I personally LOVED it!",The Nun
1686,tanyalake,Best scary movie,10,8 September 2018,I dont get all the low reviews. I am a huge fan of scary movies and I can say this movie and Halloween movie are two of my fav . Deff better than the 2 conjuring movies.,The Nun
1687,daniellekljcox,Huge let down,1,8 September 2018,"Highly anticipated film, been looking forward to this film coming out.
This film is absolutely awful. I wanted to walk out. 
There's no story, there's hardly anything that resembles any kind of story for Valak either. Just a bunch of sisters claiming they must go pray, a few weak jumps and a cringeworthy ending.
Adding awkward humour to the film was a bad move too, but I guess whoever conjured up this movie was just doing all they could to fill in so many wasted gaps. 
A real shame, this film had so much potential.",The Nun
1688,mio-97425,Disappointing...,2,8 September 2018,"Whats okay in this movie:
Nice scenery, landscape, atmosphereWhy i find this movie so disappointing:
Overall boring story, feels like they wrote the script in 3 minToo many jump scares/ lack of creativity, it feels like watching the same ""shock scene"" over and over again, no surprises at all.Bad jokes. One of the worst jokes when the nun is about to kill the french guy and says something like ""im going to kill you frenchman now!"" and he says something like ""im french canadian"" as comeback, while rescuing sister Irene.Frenchie has eyes on Sister Irene who is on her way becoming a nun and he is constantly using bad pick up lines. He is even kissing her later on. Is this ""love story"" really necessary? I dont think so...Very exaggerated that they randomly stumble upon the ""blood of jesus"" to kill the Nun and other ghostsIt doesnt make much sense, that the priest needs crosses and minute long prayers to kill some ghosts, but frenchie only needs a shotgun to kill them instantlyIt doesnt make sense, that the Nun can use telekinesis and psychic powers to kill everyone almost instantly, by throwing them against walls etc. but when she is trying to kill the protagonists she is choking them with her hands for minutes (even under water) but they still manage to survive.These were just some of my eye-rolling moments...",The Nun

But im really disappointed. The Nun's first half is the best, because the atmosphere is exciting and its not all about jumpscares. But as the movie goes on, there are more and more jumpscares and at the end its just full of foreseeable jumpscares. Also the exciting atmosphere fades more and more.",The Nun
1690,rmzemeski,I WAS SO LET DOWN!,1,8 September 2018,This movie was pointless. It was quit ridiculous. The story made no sense. ?? The Conjuring was by far a better movie.

I am not happy to report this but the movie is a complete disappointment. The film is not scary at all, there are too many jumpscares that are so predictable and none of them got me. The nun is barely in her own movie, she is in this film for around 5-10 mins max. The acting is very good however and the visuals are great but that dosent mean anything when the film is not scary. People go to a horror film to get scared, but when it dosent deliver on being scary, whats the point. If u love jumpscares, you will be right at home but if you were expecting anything more dont waste youre time",The Nun

1696,ricky_m-79933,Bring back James Wan!,5,8 September 2018,By far the worst in all of the conjuring universe. All of the jump scares were so predictable and there was no build up. The when the nun made her appearance in Annable she had a Erie quiet charisma with shear evil. This movie ruined her image as the demon in the corner of the room. This director I think ruined the movie with his predictable scenes throughout the entire movie and just threw valak at us like bio waste. Very disappointed. No build up to the character and her biography was non sense.,The Nun
1697,aaronlight-36677,A huge let down,1,9 September 2018,"The Nun could of been a great movie, but it wasn't. The unfunny one liners, lack of suspense, and zombie nuns completely ruined the eerie ness of the movie. The actors were subpar and the dialogue was predictable. I'm addition the Chopieness and utterly terrible soundtrack could not create any suspense, therefore making an un-scary movie. And finally frenchie was a completely avoidable character and added no additional wealth to the movie, he was annoying and unfunny. All in all it was a terrible movie, and a waste of money",The Nun
1698,harilogan-27248,GREAT MOVIE,8,9 September 2018,The movie has some flaws like making the nuns look like zombies attacking but the thing is the film was great and the place was creepy enough to give you chills. I don't know why most of them hate this film for me it's worth the wait.,The Nun

This is a movie that's completely different and it's about a Nun and where she ""valak"" came from. I think they explained it very well in this movie. So why should they put other elements and characters in the movie when it's all about the nun. And the visuals are amazing too.

There was not a single moment during the film where I felt scared, instead I was smiling or laughing at how bad it was. It was packed with clichés and the same jump scare attempts throughout which proved to fail time and time again. The plot was rediculous and had me shaking my head in disappointment. Very well could have walked out of this movie and not been upset with the fact that I missed it. The scariest scene of the movie was the very beginning which played a scene from the conjuring two showing the actual original ""Nun"". The couple other times you see the nun in the movie it looks like trash and isn't close to being what is was in the conjuring.Overall I'd say this movie was a complete waste of time. If you're looking for an hour and half of your life to waste and never get back I'd recommend ""The Nun"".",The Nun
1722,natashastill-73377,Boring!!!,3,10 September 2018,I was so excited to see this after watching The Conjuring 2 and it was a huge disappointment. I literally jumped 3 times and that was it. I almost fell asleep during the movie because it was that boring. They focused TOO much on the Church and not enough horror. It should've been balanced out some more.,The Nun
1723,bria_smith-61590,So much potential! But disappointing,4,10 September 2018,The dark ominous setting. Beginning was intriguing. But still no explanation to why the Vatican requested sister irene. Who exactly was Valak and why he took shape of nun..father Burke who killed a boy but had no real compassion that the audience could feel. seeing the little boy that just popped in and out several time and ended up having no purpose. Why was irene having visions? What was the purpose of 'Mary points the way'? You can't connect to the characters at all. Frenchie seemed more like O'connel from The Mummy shooting zombie nuns to protect sister irene. I did however love how they tied it into the first conjuring. I also liked the twist when finding out all the nuns were apart of a vision. It has so much potential to be great but flat lined with pathetic jump scares that gets tired quick. Being a true writer and movie fanatic ithe didn't pull me in as the first two conjuring.,The Nun
1724,katiekabootal,It was okay,4,10 September 2018,"Honestly, I get scared whether I'm watching a cheesy action or a haunting horror movie. I really, really didn't want to go to this, but I work at the movie theatre and we had an employee showing so I said eh, why not? Free movie, even if it is a horror one. I also brought my brother along with me because he's been begging me to see it. He was so excited. And, who would've guessed, he fell asleep during the movie... multiple times... while I hid under my blanket for more than half the film. The beginning was horrible. The middle was... super played out. The ending was kinda cool just because it tied everything together. The only reason that I loved this movie at all was because Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) is cute as hell and he got a lot of screen time. I rated this a 4/10 (probabaly rated it a bit higher because of the fact that I was genuinely scared once or twice... but then again, that's common for me.) and I do not recommend this movie!

Uninspired compositions litter the film and are accompanied by a cringe-worthy script that reduce the good actors to dissapointedly bad performances. I'm sorry. I wanted to like it.
The plot itself contains so many subplots (many irrelevant and superfluous) that it becomes convoluted and hollow, expecting audiences to forget about pieces of information that the producers lazily never bothered to follow up on. 
In fact, that's a good way to describe the entire film: lazy. Lazy shots. Lazy script. Lazy plot.

I want more movies like this.I'll agree with some of the other reviewers that the pacing is off. The Conjuring gives a clear outline of the stages of possession (infestation, oppression, possession). The Nun did not follow this guide.The early jump scares were extremely predictable in both timing and content.The characters and acting were good, but a little more character development wouldn't have hurt.I'm still waiting for the supernatural horror genre to have better demons. All they ever do is screech and howl. I want brutal aggression, arrogance, derision, cold, calculating intellect, sadism, and unbridled hate.

I feel that Valak only had about 15-20 minutes of screen time. Maybe in my opinion The Nun wasn't that great to me, because one of the screenwriters were from Stephen Kings IT! I don't know!!!

The overall lore and backstory to the movie is very compelling and is based on some Catholic traditions. So, if you're Catholic, you might get a good kick out of how the movie ""spookifies"" some Catholic traditions. Some concepts and characters are gimicky and unfortunately ruin the overall quality of the movie, it is easy to look past those comic reliefs.

It's a good installment and a great origin story for the darkest chapter of ""the Conjuring"" universe. I believe people underrate it because of its constant suspense and ""intense-ness"". The acting is great in my opinion and there isn't any (well too noticeable anyways) fake cgi scenes. The movie is scary and the jump scares feel genuine instead of cliche like others might say. The movie has a variety of horror aspects (dark, fast-paced in some scenes, good plot development, jump scares, the feeling you're being watched or followed). A definite recommendation for anyone who even remotely likes the Conjuring movies.",The Nun

1763,saturdaymorningcynic,"""Nun"" Too Pleased..",3,20 September 2018,"In an effort to be transparent, I haven't seen any other movies in The Conjuring universe other than The Conjuring. However, I will give credit to The Nun. It completely worked as a stand-alone film as far as continuity gaps go. Director Corin Hardy did a fine job splicing in a couple clips that explain the connection and makes the film feel like it is truly part of something bigger than itself. Yet that is where the credit I give ends. I did not hate The Nun, it merely fell victim to its own style choices. Missing the mark on what felt like a forced ""classic"" horror style, leading to overly predictable jumps and accidental comedic interjections.Honestly, I am a sucker for a good build, teasing the the audience with hints of the terror to come while starting the storyline. The human mind will do a lot of the work for a writer or director early in a horror film. The Nun didn't seem to understand that as they sped into the terrified shrills without enough room to care why anyone was scared in the first place. Instead, the first real frights of the movie depended on over-done CGI and loud noises. Seriously, The Nun has CGI shadows. CGI shadows. Are we really at a point where we can't make real shadows? The opening scene should set the tone for the ""classic"" style, and what could have been a shut-me-up moment became a spotlight on over-budgeting in special effects. Sometimes less is more and in this case, sometimes was the whole movie.""I laughed. I cried. I never actually feared for anyone that died."" -My first thoughtsSurprisingly, the script was both the lowest point of the film and provided one of my favorite lines of recent horror movies. Yet again The Nun struggled to live up to that ""classic"" style. The script fell short in a literal way, mostly centered around matter-of-fact writing. ""Oh by the way..."" seemed to start every line which ended in giving all too helpful clues of where to go or what to avoid. Nothing was left for the audience to piece together through tone and subtext. This style of writing seemed to hinder the performances each actor was able to deliver. Every scared expression had a rye smile peering through giving a glimpse into the thoughts of the actors, seemingly, ""Don't laugh.. don't laugh.."" A point that is proven by what is easily my favorite line from the movie and of recent memory:Frenchie: ""Holy $#!7!""Father Burke: ""The holiest..""Near the end of The Nun, I found myself hoping for something to redeem the last hour and twenty minutes. Low and behold my wish was granted, if only for a brief moment. I cannot recommend this movie for even the most avid horror fan, however if there was a reason to watch The Nun it has to be the ending. More specifically, how the demon was defeated (Sorry but I don't do spoilers). After I felt like this movie spat in my face for almost two hours, I was able to leave the theater with a smile. A laughable end to a forgettable movie.",The Nun

The male actor, A French Canadian living in Romania, held a stunning character with a strong reputation throughout the film. Maybe one of the best ""hero-type"" I've seen in a horror film.

This isn't a haunted house and demonic possessions.The music (you'll know when you hear it) is beautifully chilling. I don't know how to describe it. I'm a firm believer in the ability of a film's soundtrack can either make or break the movie. It fit perfectly in the scenes with Valek's appearances.I love the story of how Valek came to be and how the demon disguises itself to walk amongst the other nuns in the convent. I honestly don't see why people are hating on it so much. Just because it didn't scare them doesn't mean it isn't scary. Will it win an Oscar? Of course not.

1798,AsiaCreeps,The Nun Disappoints,3,18 November 2018,"So the Nun is the latest movie in the conjuring universe and this movie is surrounded around the Demon Nun Valek who dwells in a creepy Abby/church in Romania.So the premise is that a young nun takes her life in the secluded Abby/church and a priest (Father Burke)who is authorized to conduct exorcisms, along with a young nun (Sister Irene) who has not taken her vows yet are sent by the Vatican to Romania to investigate an unholy secret that is the malevolent force of Valek (the Demon Nun).So......What do I think? Well let me tell ya
I would like to say first and foremost I seen this movie on the Wednesday night. I received special advanced screening, so naturally I was excited and thought a special screening for the Nun was going to be cool.
I want to start with the good things because positivity wins first with me always. I loved the cinematography in this film, while the setting they chose was very clichè for this type of movie. I really thought I would be entertained on some level but, that never happened.Now for my negative Nancies sorry, guys. So I do have more negatives with this movie than positives. I think this movie was not scary but did what was the next best thing to a real scare which is the genre classic of multiple rising jump scares, I mean they were ok but constantly left me more mad than anything. There's a scene where The ghost of Daniel (a boy that died during a exorcism that Father Burke did years earlier) scares him into falling into an empty grave. Father Burke is constantly ringing a bell attached to the tombstone to let Sister Irene know he's there and needs help, but all at the same time there are demon manifestations near Sister Irene.That's cool and all but that's very unorganized and ridiculous, if you really want to kill father Burke just do it or hurt him! Why keep the bell going or even available for him to aid in his escape? Valek is also touching him and pulling him in the coffin and it's just like come on, that scene along with others became more humorous than anything.The real nitty gritty to me is the characters, oh jeez the characters. We do not learn enough about them to establish a relationship with them, which defeats the purpose in a movie dealing with demonic forces. I did not have any sympathy nor empathy towards the characters and it's just mainly because they seemed to just be there for the sake of being there.The characters were not bad people I don't think but they didn't seem to be anyone I cared about, why should I care if Valek gets them? In the first and second Conjuring there were sweet families with lives to look forward to they had a sense of personality and fear that made me care whether they lived or died. The Nun did not have that to me and that made the movie seem boring at times, that is...when it was not downright confusing or laughable.The timeline for the lore behind Valek's existence seemed completely arbitrary and just placed there for the sake of a backstory. Most of that would have been forgiven for the sake of entertainment if it wasn't for that ridiculous, insane, idiotic solution to the problem YES just use Jesus Blood omg I have never heard an audience sigh or laugh so hard in my life! It just didn't seem real it seemed like that solution was way to easy, elementary and foolish. They just so happened to have Jesus blood in a decorative cross inside a decorative egg, once again the timeline for having Jesus blood seems unrealistic, lazy and ridiculous. The rest of the film flowed I guess once you find out about the Jesus blood solution but it still left many questions about Irene and her relationship with the church and not a real concise origin of Valek was ever established.",The Nun

1819,taylorwenglikowski,The Nun evaluation,4,6 December 2018,"The 2018 horror prequel to the chilling true story of The Conjuring was released in late September. Movie critiques and horror lovers alike were both interested to see if the film would hold up to the high standard it shared with its sister movie. The plot of The Nun follows an investigation of a secluded abbey in the hills of Romania. It is after a nun takes her own life that it strikes the interest of the Vatican. A priest with a haunting past and a young nun are sent by the church to explore the dark halls of the hidden convent. Throughout their journey, they risk their lives and very faith in uncovering the malevolent secret and come face to face a demonic force encapsulated within a nun. Director, Corin Hardy, faced judgement on the film over the fact that there were many plot holes, poor CGI effects, and the film retold old horror stories that had already been seen and interpreted. Although this film was poor in many aspects, the cinematography, however, was new, beautiful, and entertaining. While only earning a whopping 27% on Rotten Tomatoes, movies goers were not thrilled with the lack of attention to detail this film included.
In watching this movie, there are obvious plot holes that arise within the first few minutes. When the young novitiate from London, played by Taissa Farmiga, is chosen by the Vatican in Italy to join Father Burke, portrayed by Demián Bichir, in the investigation of the deceased nun, it gives no background as to why Sister Irene is specifically chosen for the job as investigator. Sister Irene even states that she has never been to Romania and has no correlation there. It does not add up as to why the Vatican specifically chose Irene in particular over any other nun; not to mention she hasn't even taken her vows yet. There are several other instances throughout the movie where small details don't add up in the overall plot. It felt as though writer Gary Dauberman just threw in small bits without actually thinking of how they would affect the storyline or the audience.
While this film included inventive camera angles and intriguing techniques, the cast and crew relied solely on that aspect alone and gave no extra thought to the actual story. Creating prequels like The Nun are tricky since the majority of the audience already knows how the story should end. Directors and producers must think carefully on how they are going to keep the viewers entertained while still holding the storyline. The cinematography was incredibly crucial in ensuring that fact. Maxime Alexandre, director of photography and cinematography for The Conjuring series, playfully sculpted the film to which every scene was eye catching and different. Each shot contained personality and overall was entertaining to watch. The majority of the terrifying scenes that this film promised were jump scares. But unless that was something you were looking for, The Nun provided no deep psychological horror twists that lovers of The Conjuring so desperately wanted. Having the cinematographer be from a small town in Romania truly helped the the aesthetic of the shots and overall made the movie look visually stunning. But, unfortunately, just because the movie appeared elegant on screen doesn't mean it was a smash hit.
Just like many other horror films in history, this movie included scenes in which computer-generated imagery (CGI) and other special effects had to be put into play. The fire scene in the chapel where the flames seemed to appear out of nowhere. The large shadow of a nun peering over the railing seemed fake and unrealistic, and the gates of Hell being magically sealed in an instant looked sloppy and unfinished. These were just a few examples of where the CGI design was flawed. Adrian Popescu, special effects supervisor, overlooked quite a few things when his crew decided that this was their final product. The scenes did not look realistic or believable and worst of all, they weren't scary. The purpose of special effects and CGI is to enhance the film, but in this case, it just took away from the already bland plot line.
Horror and thriller movies have been around for decades. Just like in the past, this film touched on already retold topics of ghosts, demons, Hell, and possession. Many people that were excited for the release of this movie were not happy with the mediocre results they got as they sat bored in the theater seats. The film was held to such a high standard since it was the prequel to The Conjuring, the scary movie that supposedly changed horror history. Although the plot and story had been heard countless amounts of times, the cinematography was still absolutely breathtaking. They managed to put a modern twist on the classic storyline. The directors and producers just missed the mark on making this movie the success it was destined to be.",The Nun
1820,sanninaess,I actually liked the Nun!,8,9 December 2018,"The Nun is not mind-blowing, but certainly good amusement with a lot of jump scares. Despite what everbody else is saying, I liked the plot (especially the possible connection to Lorraine Warren!!).",The Nun
1821,joehallwood-67073,What you expect from a modern day horror,6,22 February 2019,"You can tell when there's going to be a jump scare, the demonic creatures were a bit comidical to be fair, would say the previous 2 films were better than this. Would i recommend it? Worth a watch, Would i watch it again? No",The Nun
1822,spcsims,I enjoyed it,9,13 December 2018,"I anticipated this movie very much and I really enjoyed it. I was confused about the french guy though. There could have been stronger character development there but the priest was amazing and the novice was fabulous.Still, this movie was loads better than Conjuring 2 and Annabelle. Didn't care for those.",The Nun
1823,e_anastasellis,Second Scariest Installment of the Conjuring Franchise,9,18 January 2019,I really dont see why the reviews are so negative. The Nun offers scare after scare after scare. Nonstop scares and it does have a good plot and great ending that ties it in with the Conjuring universe. Absolutely loved this movie it's so scary.,The Nun
1824,dragonlibra-01419,Ok but not bad,6,19 December 2018,The nun was OK but not terrible I've seen a lot of bad horror movies but this movie was better than The Annabelle movies which is in the same universe as the conjuring,The Nun
1825,ethynturner,I love horror movies,10,9 March 2019,"I've seen plenty of horror movies. I give this a ten, it was full filling it had some jump scares present I fell for 3. I don't get scared of horror movies but if they are able to jump scare me, then it deserves a great rating.",The Nun
1826,behnamjabbari,One of the best horror movies in history,10,29 December 2018,"I can't understand how some people judge this film in that unfair way!!
when we want to say film is good or bad we should think about the film genre then fundamentals of that genre.
The Nun has all the factors of fear, Great background music, and great story line to just build the future of story that later has seen in conjuring 1 -2.
if people don't endorse to this movie which horror movie they want to give high rate?
only thing I could say: maybe those who say negative reviews may watch The Nun in low quality formats that they can not feel fear factors.",The Nun
1827,vballhl,Stupid,3,11 January 2019,"This movie is a waste of time. I wanted it to be good so bad, but the nun was rarely in her own movie. It's cliche and the same jump scares in every scary movie. Ugh.",The Nun
1828,adzsebastianreason,Where's The Nun?,3,13 January 2019,"After only recently watching the Conjuring 1 & 2 I was really looking forward to this. Even though I'm a veteran horror fan Valeks appearance at the end of the Conjuring 2 gave me chills and fed my thirst for the nun.What a total disappointment. Looking back I am convinced that their was no plot, the acting was sub par, the scares were no existent and the couple they try are you were just lame jump scares. The Nun itself appears in about 3 minutes of the whole movie and sadly this is just another example of lazy writing due to confidence in ticket sales based on the previous movies success.",The Nun
1829,eliasmadison,"Unoriginal, but well executed",8,28 January 2019,"The actors worked well together and their parts were played in a way that showed this, though the plot is unoriginal it leaves you with the answers that weren't defined in the series of The Conjuring, as a horror fanatic I've been searching for originality and this is the farthest I've seen in the right direction for a long time, if you like the series you'll like the movie, I definitely recommend.",The Nun
1830,trinitymcdowell,"It was bad... it wasn't good, like at all",2,10 February 2019,This movie was by far the worst movie ever 😂 the only good part was when the guy gets buried alive. But you best believe it they make a sequel I'm watching it. Keep up the good work 😂,The Nun
1831,stephaniepennonen,Please don't waste your time watching The Nun,2,9 June 2019,There is not a plot? The movie is dishonest. I had too high expectations on this one after watching The Conjuring 2. This movie is a disappointment. I laughed more than I got scared. The best part of the movie is when Frenchie flirts with sister Irene tho.,The Nun
1832,franyfedele,BORINGGGGG,2,23 February 2019,I literally watched this movie 3 Times and fell asleep every single time,The Nun
