0,Leofwine_draca,Style over substance in this wannabe grindhouse movie,3,1 August 2016,"Rob Zombie is clearly a director with his heart in the right place. He's a massive fan of the kind of raw horror films that came out of the 1970s, the films that played in 'grindhouse' cinemas across the world and contained all manner of degradation and gruesome depravity. HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES is a direct homage, or pastiche, of those particular movies, and a lot of scenes are shot in the same style as a low budget backwoods horror of the '70s. There's fun to be had with crackly film stock and movie references and it's clear that Tarantino and Rodriguez liked the look of this as they went out and made GRINDHOUSE which was pretty much the same idea. The blood flows freely and it's one of the stronger horror films made in recent years.The problem is that HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES is all style and no substance. There's a meandering storyline with lots of irrelevant subplots which make it feel like it lasts forever, even though the running time is fairly shot. Zombie's happy to take all his influences from the likes of THE Texas CHAIN SAWA MASSACRE without ever bringing anything new to the table. The cast of genre greats is a nice touch, and admittedly they all seem to be having a ball with what the film requires of them, but everything here is familiar, seen somewhere before. I love the style – the set dressing and art direction are both spot on – but there's no real 'meat' here. Take THE HILLS HAVE EYES remake, for instance, a film which reminded me of this but was far more involving and well-crafted – not just a fan-made flick.The storyline is way too familiar – four young people meet weirdos in the backwoods and die. The first half of the film is presided over by Sid Haig as a crazy clown. I love this guy in the '70s Filipino flicks I regularly watch him in, and he's even better here – self-knowing, kinetic, lighting up the screen. But this part has little to do with the 'real' plot, that sees our protagonists getting stuck in a remote farmhouse and killed by a family of psychopaths. Some are familiar – blond wacko Bill Moseley showed up in the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD remake, as did lawman Tom Towles – while others, like Sheri Moon, Zombie's real-life wife, are newcomers (and in her case she should have stayed that way – she's awful). Karen Black pops up and is as utterly insane as she ever was and there are turns from familiar faces like Michael J. Pollard.Sadly the four protagonists play it utterly straight and come across as dull and uninteresting – even when one escapes at the climax you don't feel anything for her. Then there are some weird segments that seem to have come out of a cheesy sci-fi flick and the inclusion of some supernatural menaces which don't really sit with the psychotic goings-on earlier in the film. I wanted to like this film, and I can appreciate the classics of the genre it seeks to emulate – but it really ain't all that. A sequel, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, followed.",House of 1000 Corpses
1,SnoopyStyle,fascinating mess of craziness,6,30 October 2014,"Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) is a foul-mouthed clown owner of the ""Museum of Monsters and Madmen"" and ""Fried Chicken and Gasoline"". On October 30, 1977, Spaulding shoots a bunch of holdup guys. Jerry Goldsmith (Chris Hardwick), Bill Hudley (Rainn Wilson), Mary Knowles (Jennifer Jostyn), and Denise Willis (Erin Daniels) are traveling the country investigating weirdness. Spaulding shows the group his roadside show and tells them about Dr. Satan. They go in search of the hanging tree where they hanged Dr. Satan. They pick up hitchhiker Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie). Their tires get popped and they end up with Baby's family.I like directer Rob Zombie's weird outsider style. It's over-stylized Grindhouse. I just think that writer Rob Zombie needs help pulling all the craziness together into a coherent compelling plot. He needs to figure out rooting interest, and how to create tension. This is a bit of a mess but it's a fascinating mess.",House of 1000 Corpses
2,claudio_carvalho,The Boogeyman is Real and They Found Him,6,27 November 2005,"Two young couples are traveling making a research for a book about serial killers. In a gas station, they visit the horror museum of the weird Captain Spaulding, and they decide to investigate the local legend of Dr. Satan. They end in the hands of a dysfunctional sadistic family of serial killers.""House of 1000 Corpses"" is another teen horror movie, indeed a rip-off of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and other slash movies. The recent ""House of Wax"" is also very similar to this ""House of 1000 Corpses"". These screenplay writers need to have more original inspiration, instead of copying previously successful movies with minor variations in the storyline. The special effects and the death scenes are very reasonable, the music score is excellent and fans of gore movie will not be totally disappointed. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Casa dos 1.000 Corpos"" (""The House of 1,000 Corpses"")",House of 1000 Corpses
3,gavin6942,A Long-Awaited Film Fails to Inspire,6,12 November 2007,"A group of kids visit a gas station that also features a museum of the macabre. Things go downhill from there, as they are beaten, killed and turned into weird half-man, half-fish creatures... oh, and there's Dr. Satan, some weird Alice in Wonderland symbolism, and the tunnel of rebirth... this is what happens when a serious horror fan takes himself too seriously.I have been a Rob Zombie fan for well over a decade now, growing up on White Zombie and covering my body with Rob Zombie artwork. So believe me, I'm by no means against the man (who comes across as surprisingly shy in person judging from the few times I've run into him). Yet, he let me down very badly with this film. The man has one of the largest horror collections in the world, plenty of memorabilia and loves the really old films (see his live show to see just how old I'm talking about -- silent films). But the best he could come up with was a remake of ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" with the title changed.Some people will defend Zombie. In fact, most people will. Lots of people love this film. But the sad truth is that it's a knock-off and not even as scary or creepy as the original. He added some good aspects -- the opening scene at the gas station is great, but the film tends to go downhill from there. Sid Haig (as Captain Spaulding) was what sold this film -- the other baddies don't really get menacing until the sequel (which is much better).I liked the rabbit and Alice in Wonderland symbolism, and what Leslie Vernon might call the tunnel of rebirth where the ""final girl"" becomes a hero. And ""the professor"" was a great villain, from what little we see of him. Why was so much time wasted on worthless things like the talent show and Baby? As I've said in other reviews, as nice as Sherri Moon is, she's not a good actress. Please stick to dancing and signing autographs after the show. (With all due respect.) I could get into the details, but I just really wanted to focus on my overall impression. After seeing gory clips at the concerts and knowing what I know about Zombie, I expected something more artistic and more original. I got camp -- and poor camp at that. I was so disappointed that after my copy of ""House of 1000 Corpses"" was stolen, instead of replacing it, I used the replacement funds to buy Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"". And I have no regrets.",House of 1000 Corpses
4,ma-cortes,"Incredible horror , grisly gore and bloody film",4,28 September 2004,"The plot line centers two couples traveling across the backwoods of Texas searching for urban legends of murder end up sheltering at house inhabited by a loony and murderer family (formed by Karen Black, Sheri Moon , Sid Haig and others) . They are a bizarre and sadistic backwater family of serial killers .The motion picture mixes a deal of gore , terror , screams , and spooky atmosphere . The storyline has got certain likeness to ¨Texas chainsaw massacre¨ , along with ¨Ed Gein¨ and ¨2000 maniacs¨. The film's script was constantly changing throughout filming, leading to an entirely different ending at one point . The actual house is the same used in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas(1982), which can be viewed during Universal Studio's tram ride. However, during filming, Universal refused to cease the tram tours, which delayed filming during many scenes .There isn't interpretation of the actors because they only kill and shout . However , the cinematography by Alex Poppas and Tom Richmond is nice to difference ¨Texas massacre¨ which was granulated and worn-out . There are some black and white flashbacks upon killers , it is the most interesting bit of the film . This is Rob Zombie's directorial debut , and was filmed in 2000, but wasn't released until three years later. Rob Zombie has said that he was constantly shooting two versions of the gorier scenes to appease Universal. For instance, a shot at the start of the film in which the robber who was stabbed with the Axe is on the floor was shot two ways: with blood and without blood . The movie will appeal strong emotions enthusiasts and gore fans. Rating: 5/10 average .",House of 1000 Corpses
5,BA_Harrison,Meet the Fireflys.,8,20 June 2010,"October, 1977: two young couples, out on a road trip to compile information for a book on America's unsung roadside attractions, pull in for gasoline at a remote filling station; there they discover Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madman, and a ride dedicated to famous US serial killers, hosted by Captain Spaulding himself (a marvellously mad performance by Sid Haig). Intrigued by one exhibit in particular—that of demented surgeon Dr. Satan, who operated (literally) in the immediate locale—the foursome ask for directions to the tree from which he was supposedly hung.Soon after hitting the road again, the group pick up a beautiful hitchhiker named Baby (the butt-alicious Sheri Moon Zombie), who offers them refuge at her family home when their car develops engine trouble. No prizes for guessing that the four young adults are taken captive by Baby's murderous family of inbred hillbillies who, after a night of torture and death, introduce the survivors to the legendary Dr. Satan, who is still practising his bizarre experiments in a corpse strewn underground lair.I rated Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects a perfect 10/10, hailing it as 'a modern horror masterpiece', so imagine my surprise when, only two years later, I found myself giving his remake of Halloween a paltry 2/10, calling it 'an ill-considered mess' and 'insulting to horror fans'. Not quite ready to subject myself to Halloween 2, and realising that I couldn't remember much about Zombie's House of a 1000 Corpses, a film I originally caught in the midst of much nappy changing and sleepless nights, I thought I'd give the director's debut a rewatch for review purposes—and I loved it!This first outing for the Firefly clan might not quite be up there with The Devil's Reject's, lacking that film's epic feel, but it's still a damn fine movie—a gloriously twisted tribute to the grindhouse horrors of the 70s that boasts outrageously OTT characters, stomach churning gore, ghoulish black humour, and a lurid trailer park aesthetic that effectively imbues the film with a grotesque, nightmarish vibe not felt since Tobe Hooper's criminally under-rated Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.It's an auspicious debut from Zombie that, along with Rejects, has allowed him the freedom to tackle bigger projects, such as the aforementioned Halloween remakes. I can't help but wish, however, that Rob would get back to giving us a few more personal projects that are better suited to his gaudy white trash style.",House of 1000 Corpses
6,paul_haakonsen,"Run humans, ain't nothing but nothing. They all run like scared little rabbits. Run rabbit, run. Run Rabbit! Run!...",8,7 June 2018,"""House of 1000 Corpses"" was and actually still is a pretty entertaining movie; one that has lots of really interesting aspects to it. First of all it is loaded with the typical Rob Zombie imagery that you also see on his CD artwork and also crammed with lots of bits and pieces of horror icons and imagery.But it is also a movie that is rather brutal and grotesque at the same time. There is a good amount of blood violence and bloodshed in the movie as a movie of this type should have.What really worked out for me here was the characters, especially the deranged killers in particular. I love the Otis Driftwood and Captain Spaulding characters as they are so far out there that you can't help but love them and the fact that those two characters are played by Bill Mosely and Sid Haig respectively is just the icing on the cake.Now, aside from BIll Mosely and Sid Haig, then there are some pretty nice names on the cast list alongside those two; such as Karen Black, Tom Towles and also Sherri Moon held up her performance quite well.I have seen ""House of 1000 corpses"" numerous times and I doubt I will ever tire of it.The movie is also accompanied by a very interesting and unique soundtrack.If you enjoy horror movies then this is most definitely worth checking out if you haven't already. And if you haven't already seen this movie shame on you...",House of 1000 Corpses
7,Quinoa1984,Zombie tries to be Oliver Stone redoing Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3,8 May 2003,"And the results, from my perspective, are mixed.  Many of the reviews on this site are glowing for the fun Zombie had with the gore, the violence, the chaos.  As a throwback to the Texans Chainsaw movies, I think it works partly well, with not an ounce of sympathy thrown to either heroes or villains (after a while the term ""villain"" doesn't give these characters justice).  But what made me dislike the picture was the staggering, constant use of editing in clips from other movies, other sounds, which after the first ten to fifteen minutes became a big distraction.  The level of terror is recognized, yet Zombie thinks in his writing and directorial debut, that he has to do EVERYTHING all at once, over and over, to get the audiences attention; it's understandable why Universal thought his film would get an NC-17.  For the most hardcore and die-hard fans of horror flicks and Rob Zombie fans, it's a treat I suppose, but for someone like I, who has seen many horror films and listened to Zombie's music, it's a little too much (the expectation levels from scene-to-scene are numbingly painful at times).

8,BandSAboutMovies,A decent start...,6,7 July 2018,"This is the first film from rock star Rob Zombie, a man that I have pretty much vilified in conversations and reviews for basically filming Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 over and over again (with side dishes of Horror House on Highway 5 and Eaten Alive). That said - I watched this with an open mind and the hope of being entertained.
Zombie started directed several of his band White Zombie's videos and was selected by Universal Studios to design a haunted maze for their Halloween Horror Nights. It was so successful that he was credited with reviving the attraction and he began a relationship with the studio. He has previously worked on a script for a sequel to The Crow called The Crow: 2037 A New World of Gods and Monsters.Despite plans for an animated Frankenstein film, Zombie decided to turn his haunted house into an actual movie. Filmed in 2000 on the Universal Studio backlots, which gives this the same feel as the aforementioned Eaten Alive, the film was held for three years as there was concern over releasing it, due to all the blood, gore, masturbation and necrophilia. Not wanting an NC-17, Universal was content to sit on the film until Zombie bought it back and sold it to Lion's Gate, who finally released it almost three years after the film had wrapped.The film opens on October 30, 1977, as two criminals attempt to rob the gas station of Captain Spalding (Sid Haig, Spider Baby). It's a quick intro to get us into the spirit of the film - down, dirty and scummy. Soon, Jerry (Chris Hardwick), Bill (The Office's Rainn Wilson), Mary and Erin arrive, as they are traveling the country writing about strange roadside attractions.Spalding gives them a tour of his Museum of Monsters and Madmen, during which he relates the legend of Doctor Satan, a mad doctor who was hung by an angry mob. Before they leave, he gives them a hand-drawn map to the tree where they lynched the man.On the way, they pick up Baby (Zombie's muse, Sheri Moon Zombie), a hitchhiker who gets in the car moments before a tire blows out and her half-brother Rufus (former pro wrestler Robert ""Bonecrusher"" Mukes) picks them up in his tow truck.What follows is a descent into madness, as the Firefly family (who are all named after Marx Brothers characters) takes over the film. There's Mother Firefly (Karen Black, Trilogy of Terror), adopted brother Otis Driftwood (Bill Moseley, Chop Top from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2), Grampa Hugo (character actor Dennis Fimple in his last film) and the deformed giant Tiny (Matthew McGrory , a real-life giant who is also in Bubble Boy and Big Fish). The family has already kidnapped five cheerleaders and now is presenting a Halloween show to their guests, who run in fear before being taken back into the house.The family begins to torture the four kids, including killing Bill to turn him into a mer-man like something out of an old roadside sideshow and scalping Jerry (who is named for the composer of the Star Trek theme).Meanwhile, Denise's dad Don and two deputies (Tom Towles from Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and Walton Goggins from TV's Justified) track down the missing kids, only to be killed by the family. Then, the remaining three are dressed as rabbits and chased through a maze.Jerry - despite being scalped - and Denise survive, only to find their way to Doctor Satan's lair, where he operates on Jerry and reveals that his assistant Earl is the father of the Firefly family. Denise, however, escapes again, only to be picked up by Captain Spalding, who offers to drive her to safety. She passes out and Otis appears in the back seat. She awakens on Doctor Satan's operating table and that's the end!The footage for this film is all over the place, much like Natural Born Killers. That's because Zombie filmed a lot of the sequences in his basement with a 16mm camera, including the opening shot of the moon.There are moments of style here, but the film feels pretty messy, There are enough ideas to fill several films and no real cohesive tale to be told, but that didn't take away my enjoyment of the film. It feels like there's promise here, unlike 31, where Zombie pretty much retold this same story again. There are several films that Zombie never made, like retellings of C.H.U.D. and The Blob, as well as an adaption of his comic The Nail called Tyrannosaurus Rex that would have been an homage to violent 70's action films. I would have loved to see what he could do with different subject matter.",House of 1000 Corpses
9,Coventry,Is a horror fan entitled to have a second opinion?,9,16 August 2005,"I already had a user comment for ""House of a 1.000 Corpses"" submitted here on this site, dated over a year ago andumnot very praising. In fact, my first viewing of this film was so disappointing that I excessively discouraged other people here to see it. Rather than to simply ignore the old comment and pretend I never bashed it, I wish to write a new – more positive – review, if it were only to convince other people (who also disliked at first) to give it a second change. Several factors (like the praising reviews on ""The Devil's Rejects""-sequel and conversations with fellow horror fans) nearly forced me to re-watch ""House of a 1.000 Corpses"" and I'm glad I did. This truly is a film that requires multiple viewing before one can properly judge it. Rob Zombie's style is often innovating and so overwhelming that it might look overly hectic at first but, in reality, his dedication towards obscurity and his knowledge on classic cinema is one of the best things that could ever happen to the horror genre. And that is something you (or at least I) have to discover with repeated viewings The power of this film lies in the fact that the screenplay covers all kind of successful horror premises. Serial killers, mad doctors, a family of crazies, deranged clowns, devil-worshipers.you name the type of terror and ""House of a 1.000 Corpses"" features it! This movie is a small revival of the entire horror genre all by itself. No extended and boring intros or pointless red herrings in this film, ""House"" is straightforward and surefooted sickness from start to finish and you're given almost no time to breathe. Some of the sequences in this film are so damn close to brilliant that I can't possibly figure out why I didn't love them right away!! The execution-scene guided by the moody ""I Remember You""-song, for example, is amazingly atmospheric and quite unsettling. Although Rob Zombie's directing skills are still open for improvement (the abrupt climax, overly rough editing), his debut is a staggering gorefest that every horror fan has to experiencerepeatedly! Bring on the sequelI'm ready now!!",House of 1000 Corpses
10,michaelRokeefe,Unlike any other! Welcome to the freak show.,7,15 April 2005,"Welcome to the world of Rob Zombie former lead singer and co-founder of the Heavy Metal Band White Zombie. Zombie writes and directs this horror flick not unlike a box of fetid steak and tomatoes from a collision of two semi-trailers. You have to be in the right mood to accept this one. Its horrid, gross, obtuse, scary, un-scary and nauseating. If you like a touch of the weird...grab hold with both hands.Two young couples stray from the beaten path as they ride the back roads in search of an Urban Legend known as Dr. Satan. Check the tires...check the gas. These knot-heads have a blowout and find themselves lost and stranded only to find a bizarre family of murderers and satanic cannibals. Sadistic violence ensues and consumes.Just part of this sordid cast: Chris Hardwick, Erin Daniels, Karen Black, Judith Drake, Jennifer Jostyn and Chad Bannon. A cult following is deserved. This flick is a couple of hoots and a toot. Don't be ashamed to dig it!",House of 1000 Corpses
11,Scarecrow-88,House of 1000 Corpses,7,26 April 2009,"Demented debut from rocker Rob Zombie features a family of backwoods deranged psychos preying upon four teenagers who are in search of a notorious serial killer known as Dr. Satan. Filmed at Universal Studios, Zombie was allowed access to footage and props from their great classics such as CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, THE WOLF MAN, THE OLD DARK HOUSE, and even THE MUNSTERS. Problems Zombie faced were more than the pleasures of attaining the sets or production values, as camera operators came and went, & studio suits(..asking for cuts upon cuts, never quite pleased with what they were seeing, eventually shelving the film altogether before selling the property back to Zombie, with the film being distributed by LIONSGATE) played a part in his film's disjointed, often uneven presentation. Admitting to interspersing shot footage on a video camera, Zombie really creates quite an odd experience, with plenty of sadistic displays by the Firefly clan towards their victims. The film takes place during Halloween Eve and Night, adding a great deal to the overall look of the film(..lots of pumpkins and costumes). Zombie effectively uses neon and candlelight giving his family of weirdos an alluring setting to commit their variety of sick activities. One victim is turned into an art piece, ""Fishboy"", kidnapped cheerleaders are subjected to torture, victims dressed in bunny suits are tormented psychologically by their captors, with two of them eventually lowered into an underground cavern where muddy ghouls live along with other freaks of nature(..along with Dr. Satan who operates on victims, opening up one's skull, using a drill, and the ""Professor"", with goggles, a horribly disfigured face with a mouth that releases mucus of some sort, chasing after a victim with an ax).The first portion of the film shows the four traveling teenagers meeting up with Captain Spaulding(Sid Haig), a vulgar, pot-bellied clown who operates a gas station/murder museum, featuring collectibles you can buy along with displays of all sorts of unusual things(..and pictures). Spaulding even has a tour ride for visitors regarding wax museum mannequins depicting various notorious serial killers. Soon they desire to see Dr. Satan, with Spaulding sending them to the freakshow that is Mother Firefly(Karen Black), her daughter Baby(Sheri Moon Zombie), twisted albino son ""artist"" Otis(Bill Moseley), massive mute auto mechanic Rufus RJ(Robert Allen Mukes), belligerent and loud Papa(Dennis Fimple), and the burnt subservient titan, Tiny(Matthew McGrory). This gallery of the bizarre and grotesque are given star treatment while the ""normal"" kids don't help their situation any by fueling their ""hosts"" disdain through obnoxious behavior, goading them(..specifically the girls who often curse or berate Baby and Mother who flirt with their boyfriends) by often antagonizing when they should leave well enough alone. Moseley has quite a powerful, if unpleasant, presence as Otis, quite confrontational and unrestrained while Baby enjoys carnage, gleefully cheering during their attacks on victims.Once the film moves away from the house, chock full of odds and ends like a junkyard untended, into the dark and sinister underground cavern(..and above ground where a cemetery is present)the film shifts in tone completely, as Denise(Erin Daniels), the remaining member of her friends, runs for her life from the Professor through a hall lined with corpses..cobwebs and lights are ever present as Denise attempts to save her skin not knowing what lies in wait. Her situation looks hopeless. The film features Zombie's music and some really strange nightmare sequences, often either tinted in bright colors or sepia tones. Certainly, you can sense just how much a fan of horror Zombie is as his influences are quite visible. Prepare to be bombarded by lots of peculiar images and characterizations. The cult following doesn't surprise me because HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES has enough unusual qualities to appeal to the Midnight Movie crowd. Lots of in-jokes such as the shirt(..and Halloween costume) Tiny wears, not to mention his cereal(..also, you'll notice a grisly skinning scene where Otis wears a victim's face)and wicked humor that will not appeal to all tastes. Tom Towles and Wolton Goggins star as country cops out to investigate the Firefly's residence finding themselves unwelcome. Great supporting star treatment for Karen Black as the loony mother of the clan. Almost everyone in the film has filthy dental care. A superb star vehicle for scene-stealing Sid Haig, provided with a role that might well define his career, later even enhancing it more in THE DEVIL'S REJECTS. Baby's giggles might induce either chills or aggravation, considering what she finds funny. Definite highlight for Sheri Moon would have to be Baby's stage show to a Betty Boop song..her performance can be(..purposely?)irritating/grating.",House of 1000 Corpses
12,Hey_Sweden,"""It's true. The bogeyman is real and you found him.""",7,10 March 2012,"The appeal of ""House of 1000 Corpses"" for horror fans clearly lies in the fact that it's made by one of our own. Writer / director Rob Zombie makes his crazed, off the wall nightmare of a movie a wonderful visual treat, and keeps it fairly unpredictable, at least in the sense that one wonders what kind of macabre creations he can come up with from scene to scene. Legendary shock rocker Alice Cooper came up with a great description of Zombies' visual sense by saying that it's like watching the ink in a tattoo parlor come to life. With homages made to many horror movies of the past (including clips from such favourites as ""The Wolf Man"" (1941)), the movie is styled like an unrelenting trip through a particularly sadistic funhouse.The story has four young people (including Rainn Wilson of 'The Office' and Chris Hardwick of 'The Talking Dead') travelling the country for the purpose of documenting strange roadside attractions. Captain Spauldings' Museum of Monsters and Madmen is just one stop along the way. These poor, dumb schmucks are in for a series of torturous experiences as a few local cops and the father of one of the girls try to track the kids down.The soundtrack, featuring such Zombie songs as ""Pussy Liquor"" and the title track, is absolutely kick ass. His admittedly often profane script does include some very choice and memorable quips as ""Boy, I bet you'd stick your head in a fire if I told you you could see Hell."". The antagonists are far and away the better characters in comparison to the insipid victims; who doesn't want that one jerk to bite it as soon as he starts screeching ""Dr. Satan!"" upon exiting the Museum?In addition to Zombies' feel for the macabre, his ghoulish sense of playfulness, the striking look of all scenes, and the effectively gruesome violence, he gives excellent showcases to a fine cast. Some of them got their best roles in a while in this film, especially veterans Sid Haig, as the flamboyant Captain Spaulding, Bill ""Chop Top"" Moseley as Otis, and Karen Black, as insane family matriarch Mother Firefly. B movie fanatics will also appreciate the presence of Michael J. Pollard, Tom Towles, Dennis Fimple, and Irwin Keyes.""House of 1000 Corpses"" is the kind of thing that works due to the presentation, not the story, which is admittedly derivative of classics like ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"". It's not anything truly great, but it's a good encapsulation of one horror lovers' vivid imagination, maintaining a definite energy from its blatantly humorous opening to its gloomy ending, and showed the potential in the budding filmmaker, who of course followed this up with the impressive ""The Devil's Rejects"". Good fun overall.Seven out of 10.",House of 1000 Corpses
13,preppy-3,Kick-a** horror film,10,17 April 2003,"Two couples out on a dark and stormy night pick up a hitchhiker. Then their car breaks down near the hitchhikers home. She invites them in to call a repair man. But she has a VERY strange family...Rob Zombie's notorious film has finally come out. Universal refused to release this because they said it was NC-17 all the way. After 2 years of shopping it around, Zombie finally got Lions Gate to release it. He did cut it down to an R (but he's said the cuts were minor).The plot is vague, there's no character development, and some of the acting is truly terrible. Still, I LOVE this movie! It's a VERY gory, strange, bloody, sick and downright frightening horror film. When this film kicks into high gear during the last section it never stops. Zombie's direction is great--he shoots it with multiple screens, negative film stock, video film, excellent use of colored lights and sets it all the extremely loud rock music blasting at you. This all combines to keep you off balance constantly--you never know what's going to happen next. Also there are countless visual references to past horror films (in particular ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") making this a real treat for horror fans.As I said it's very bloody and sick--I'm a big horror movie fan and I don't scare easy but this one scared me silly. I was literally cringing in my seat a few times! It's going to be too much for some people--5 people walked out during my screening.This is one of the scariest, goriest, most graphic horror film since the 1980s--SEE IT!

14,poolandrews,Extremely disappointing much-hyped directorial debut from Rob Zombie that attempts to be a horror film!,3,8 February 2005,"House of 1000 Corpses starts with an on screen caption that informs us that it is 'October 30 1977'. Jerry Goldsmith (Chris Hardwick) & Bill Hudley (Rainn Wilson) plus two of their friends Denise Willis (Erin Daniels) & Mary Knowles (Jennifer Jostyn) are travelling across the underbelly of America, the weirdo out of the way places no-one knows about so they can write a book about them and the legends that surround them. They stop off at the Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) owned 'Museum of Monsters and Madmen'. After a trip on the 'Murder Ride' they become interested in a local legend about a killer dubbed Dr. Satan and decide to head out to an area known as 'Deadwood' to investigate further. It begins to pour down with rain when they notice a hitchhiker, a pretty young girl named Baby Firefly (Sheri Moon). They stop and offer her a lift, which she accepts. The tyre on their car suddenly blows and they become stranded. Baby says that her brother has a pick-up truck and can help them, what follows is a living nightmare for Jerry, Bill, Denise and Mary as Baby's deranged family are all sadistic killers and have their sights set on our four protagonists! Their only hope is that Sheriff Drake Huston (William Bassett) and his men Lieutenant George Wydell (Tom Towles) & Deputy Steve Naish (Walt Goggins as Walton Goggins) are able to find and save them!Written and directed by Rob Zombie I was throughly disappointed with this lame effort of a film. Zombie directs and presents the film in an often annoying fashion, quick cuts, black and white shots, scenes sped up or slowed down, split screen, colours messed around with and certain shots filmed in obviously low grade 16mm which make them stand out like a sore thumb. It's slow and at times surreal & bizarre. It appears to steal it's entire plot from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). A sadistic backwoods family of killers, one who wears a mask, another wears human skin and the innocent victims picking up a hitchhiker to kick things off, sound familiar yeah? Zombie even went as far as to cast Bill Moseley as virtually the character he played in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986). The ending, which is the only time it tries to do something different, doesn't make a bit of sense and left me very frustrated with the whole experience of watching this rubbish even more. Forget about any gore, this is a really tame film that has a few seconds of cutting with a straight-razor and a skinless corpse but nothing else that sticks in the memory. I found the characters highly annoying too, especially the mumbling incoherent idiots who ramble on about nothing in particular and go to make up the psycho family. On the positive side there are flashes of style and it's generally well made with good production values and had a decent atmosphere about it, I really liked Dr. Satan when he finally made an appearance for all of 2 minutes. I also liked the underground sets at the end, pity they weren't used for more than just a screaming girl to run down. This had great potential but didn't deliver in the end. I can see why two major studio's dropped the film and it remained unreleased for three years. Poor and my three star rating is generous to say the least.",House of 1000 Corpses
15,Bunuel1976,"HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES (Rob Zombie, 2003) **1/2",6,17 June 2006,"Despite being a fan of many a strand in Rock music, I've never heard any of Rob Zombie's songs. Still, I was very skeptical about what would result from his eventual dabbling in films, so much so that I only bothered to watch this one after reading positive reviews of its follow-up, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS (2005; see comments below). Having now watched Zombie's first directorial effort, I can say that I'm pleasantly surprised with the inventiveness and wit on display - although the film, despite its slim running time, does eventually outstay its welcome.While the film is ostensibly another rehash of Tobe Hooper's seminal THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974), Zombie injects it with enough verve and panache - not to mention knowing in-jokes to past Hollywood classics (particularly Universal Horrors and The Marx Brothers comedies) which, for once, don't come off as the work of a self-indulgent fanboy - for his film to stand on its own two legs. Naturally, gore plays an important part in films of this type and even here, Zombie's film does not come up short.The actors are, however, something of a mixed bag: at least two of the four teenagers abducted by the crazy ""Devil's Rejects"" - the oafish boy (Chris Hardwicke) and the brunette whose father comes looking for her (Erin Daniels) - are appealing; the albino-ish son (Bill Moseley) is delightfully sadistic, and, especially, Sid Haig is memorable as the clown-faced Captain Spaulding who hosts a dilapidated ""House Of Horrors"" attraction. On the debit side, while it was nice to see Karen Black getting such a plump role, her eye-rolling performance was perhaps a tad misjudged; similarly, Zombie's own wife, Sheri Moon, while certainly a visual asset, soon grew tiresome with her one-note performance and especially her irritating recurring ""maniacal"" laugh.Also, I'm not too sure whether that ""twist"" ending or occasionally self-indulgent direction was entirely necessary but I'm quibbling really: this is an enjoyably gory and surprisingly witty romp which is more than can be expected from most recent Hollywood horror fare.",House of 1000 Corpses

Reasonably well put-together entry into the torture porn subgenre of horror. There's really not much story here beyond getting these people to where they can be tortured and killed by these freaks. There's also the disturbing element of narrative sympathy with the killers, not the victims. This is not surprising given that Rob Zombie belongs to that breed of ""heavy metal horror fan"" that equates real-life killers like Charles Manson with fictional movie monsters. It would be more disconcerting if one wasn't convinced these posers simply get enjoyment out of being shocking and offensive. Anyway, it's not a terrible movie of its type.

19,Boba_Fett1138,Crazy and I definitely love it but it doesn't always connect well.,7,11 September 2008,"This movie is obvious homage to the horror genre and in particular to horror movies from the old days, the '20's till the '40's, as well as the slasher flicks from the '70's. But it at the same time is also a modern horror movie that tries to put new life into the genre. It doesn't completely work out though, since the movie tries out too much.What saves this movie is its totally crazy style and atmosphere. It makes the movie foremost a comedy, which of course obviously also goes at the expense of the horror though. The movie is very stylish looking and Rob Zombie obviously has a love for the genre.The movie is deliberately B-movie like, with some of its crazy moments and acting performances. This all adds to the style and atmosphere of the movie and it works out really well for it.But because the movie picks so many styles and approaches not everything that happens in the story connects well with each other. Not all of the events always blend in well with each other and the movie is definitely style over substance at times, that tries to pay tribute to too many genre movies. It doesn't give this movie a well flowing story or provides the movie with any characters that you'll ever care about.The best character of the movie is Captain Spaulding played by Sid Haig. It might very well be the best and certainly most entertaining role out of his career. It's a crazy and evil but yet very likable character.The movie isn't really that effective as a horror movie or shocker, due to its style. Nevertheless the movie still has gore and some good make-up effects in it, which is nice looking but it just doesn't take the movie its horror value to an higher level. Still I'm sure that Rob Zombie can be a capable horror director if he starts to pay some less attention to the style and some more to its storytelling and actual script. Zombie wrote the script for this movie himself, just as he always writes for his projects. This movie ain't a bad debut from him but I'm anxious to find out if he has learned from the mistakes he still made in this movie and if his later projects were better. I'm definitely going to check the rest of his movies out. Despite the fact that the movie really isn't being original or renewing for its genre, it still is a refreshing movie due to its excellent style, provided by Rob Zombie (also thanks to the musical score he composed for this movie).

Rob Zombie has proved here that he is not only a skilled filmmaker, but also capable of scaring us. As with other shockers such as Last House on the Left and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, we have the innocent intruding within the forbidden and suffering dire consequences. Two couples venture about in search of road attractions and receive a lesson in that old ""don't talk to strangers"" bit our parents warned us about. After brief bizarre entertainment they are tortured graphically while one of the females escapes through the tunnels of a deep shaft dressed in a bunny costume. This is not an easy film to watch as the violence is extreme and brutal but it can be credited for its ability to shock and scare. It is a well made horror film that delights in one of those cop out endings where all really isn't well. Sid Haig plays Captain Spaulding while Bill Moseley plays Otis, and Sheri Moon Zombie plays Baby. Karen Black completes the crazies as the crazy mother Firefly. They are convincingly crazy as they enact our deepest fears immobilizing us. There is a lesson here regarding strangers and strange places and how easy it can be to fall victim to one choice mistake.

22,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Overrated but still watchable,8,13 November 2021,"Traveling through the countryside, a group of friends looking to do a book on roadside attractions finds a reported lead on a legendary serial killer that lived nearby and want to seek him out only to stumble upon a psychotic family that holds them captive and begins torturing the travelers.This is one of the hardest movies to review since it's either a real love-it-or-hate-it kind of movie. As an homage to the films of the 70s, this one actually delivers and becomes something that could almost be made from the 70s. The different short films that are included every so often with a grainy look, soft-focus flashbacks, and the general hostile tone taken throughout the film has a much more deranged feel to it attempts a 70s feel. The fact that it takes place during daylight hours for most of the time is its main claim as that allows for some brilliant daylight shots and sequences. The other really nice part of this one is that this grindhouse aesthetic lends itself quite well to the action and torturing going on. Every now and then, there was a cool scene thrown in that didn't seem like it was homaging something from the 70s. The first fifteen minutes is some of the best and most creative parts in horror movies recently and is a real highlight, while the exploits of the family carving them or their other guests up makes the film seem even more desolate. The supposed gore that should've been in here includes. Repeated amputations, dismemberments, and slashing marks that there isn't some enjoyment to be had when looking for a nice, gory romp. It still looks hopeless hacked up, but enough got through that it's still nice if that's what you're looking for. It's far more comfortable with all the underground sequences, as those provided some of the greatest moments in the film. As our last remaining teen stumbles through a corpse-lined corridor is easily the greatest example, which really got the hair standing up and delivering some real suspense, making for the film's best attributes. There are some big problems here. The biggest problem is that this falls into the big trend of following others who think homaging grindhouse films are paying homage to one film in particular and it just seems overplayed. It's quite obvious this is the case here, with this being a virtual remake of that movie, even down to several characters, scenes, and ideas. Having a small group of teens wander upon a demented backwoods family that relishes killing the wanderers, showing the clan enjoying acts of necrophilia, wearing a dead person's skin, and keeping artifacts around the house as well as the family and their positions within are major influences right there, and that amounts to a good portion of the film's running time. The other big problem with this one is how badly this one misses the mark on grindhouse aesthetics outside o paying homage to everything. Oh sure, moments of gore and vivisection that try to develop some sense of fear are present in most stages, but the uneven editing and obvious exclusions for the sake of a rating undermines the effort. This is far too gimmicky at times, using the modern media shortcuts of jump cuts, shaking cameras, and obtuse lens and camera angles that are surprisingly evident in here, and just make more head-scratching scenes than normal. Yet, for all these problems, the main one is that the film is not an exercise in non-stop thrills and blood spills since the movie never builds up enough of a head of steam to succeed on that level. It kinda peters out around the half-hour mark and doesn't pick back up until well into the third act. These here are what hold this one back.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, Nudity, and acts of sadism.",House of 1000 Corpses

25,Wuchakk,"Rob Zombie's comic book non-horror take on ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""",6,13 June 2018,"RELEASED IN 2003 (but shot in 2000) and written/directed by Rob Zombie, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is a horror/black comedy about two young couples who inadvertently visit a house of demented serial killers in backwoods Texas.A critic summed the movie up as ""a ridiculous horror comedy, but with extremely annoying villains."" It was inspired by (or rips off) ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) and combines it with the cartoonish horror comedy of ""Evil Dead II"" (1987) while throwing in a little ""The Funhouse"" (1981).The entire first act, including the amusing prologue that introduces Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), is very entertaining, but the over-the-top approach starts to get dull by the middle of the picture with the overdone events at the demented Firefly abode. The last act gets so cartoonish that I thought maybe the main protagonist (Erin Daniels) was experiencing a nightmare. The fantastical elements strip away any vestige of horror that was hardly there in the first two acts, which were too zany to take as serious horror. As such, I can't see anyone older than 7 finding this movie ""disturbing."" Still, the film pulsates with colorful pizazz and characters, not to mention a quality score/soundtrack.Sheri Moon Zombie is effective in her role as Baby Firefly. I liked her voice and didn't mind her laugh (which many criticize), but she's a little too thin for my tastes. Daniels works pretty well as the main protagonist. But, considering Zombie's resources (e.g. the five captive cheerleaders), the flick sorta drops the ball in the female department.The film sat on the shelf so long because Universal feared a NC-17 rating. Lions Gate eventually picked it up, but it was cut & edited in an attempt to achieve an R-rating. The original version was 16 minutes longer.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 29 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Chicken Ranch Backlot, Universal Studios; Palmdale; Santa Clarita; and Saugus).GRADE: B-/C+",House of 1000 Corpses
26,The_Void,Twisted sickness anyone?,8,2 August 2005,"When I saw House of 1000 Corpses for the first time, shortly after it's release, I wasn't all that impressed. Rob Zombie's homage to seventies exploitation flicks plays out much like a backing video for him to play his songs against, and that; combined with the MTv style editing ensured that I didn't enjoy myself all that much. I've seen more seventies exploitation flicks since then, however, and have become much more tolerant of fast editing styles; and so upon my second viewing, I found that this is actually a very good horror film. For a rock singer, Rob Zombie has a surprising amount of directorial talent; and it's always obvious that he respects the films that lead to this one being made. The plot is typical seventies exploitation, and it follows a group of teenagers that find themselves at the mercy of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre-style family's sadistic sickness. What follows is a tour de force of sickness, gore and violence that replaces any notion of plot or characters with just simple visual potency. This isn't the sort of film that will top 'best of all time' lists; but if you're in the mood, Rob Zombie's ride won't disappoint.Zombie has given us a number of sick characters to shock and entertain. We've got the sick clown, name of Captain Spaulding; the beautiful, yet sick, 'Baby'; her equally odd mother, hideously burned Tiny, hideously sick redneck 'Otis', and best of all; a deformed ""doctor"", delighting in the name of Dr Satan! If you know Zombie's music, nothing in this film will really surprise you. Rob delivers old style heavy rock music, with a nu-metal swing to it; and House of 1000 Corpses is an old-school horror flick, with new techniques added. Zombie gets to enjoy himself by entwining sepia shots of his characters into the mayhem, along with various other techniques. Zombie direction isn't all about throwing in nice visuals, however; he does have some talent, and this is shown best in the brilliant scene that sees Otis shoot a policeman! There seems to have been something of a resurrection for good horror films since the millennium; and while we're still not back in the golden age that this film is a tribute to; this decade has been a hell of a lot better than the nineties - and this film is one of the reasons why.",House of 1000 Corpses

Rob went specifically on the actors reactions to things.Is this film for everyone? No! Not in any way, we have a Texas Chainsaw Massacre type of family that is extremely sadistic and scary. They torture people very violently and this film is in no way meant for children or people with a weak stomach. It's a scary movie that might give you nightmares for a few nights, that's for sure. We have a classic situation of four teenagers who are on the road looking for creative advertisements on the side roads in towns that are unheard off. When they stop off at a place called Captain Spaling's, they are pretty much set there. Captain Spalding is this freaky clown with a dirty mouth and well dirty everything. They get a ride at his gas station to present all the famous serial killers in history and there is one that catches their attention, Dr. Satan. Who happened to be buried in that town.Back on their way home they see a hot chick in need of a ride home, so they pick her up on this incredibly stormy night.

They do the most horrible things to these kids I could not describe, but if you love horror films, I guarantee this is for you.

In fact many could classify this as not a horror film yet more of a torture porn like that teases very close to that of a low budget snuff film. The scenes are blunt, far out and crazy as it's clear that pain will be put on the victims. Set in 1977 across the rural backwoods a group of four teens go searching for a local fun house attraction that is suppose to be a museum of local murder legends.However the house has many and plenty of dark secrets as it involves a family and clan of serial killers and flesh eaters. Many compare this picture to a blend of ""Last House on the Left"" and the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and it has it's moments only Zombie takes the film on a tease ride of wild parody fun and games that involves Easter bunnies, medical surgeries, and hell with death.

In a nutshell, what I witnessed was a boring story full of over-the-top gore and sadistic trash that is too disturbing even for a make-believe movie. The crazy and twisted family was given too much glory in the movie, while the innocent, albeit clueless, victims were given the back-burner. The acting was horrible; there is really nothing memorable about the characters - good guys or bad. The hideous Captain Spaulding was the worst - he looked like he was a forgotten product of the turmoil of the drug/sex craving 60s.Don't try to understand or follow the plot, because you won't find it. There is nothing suspenseful or scary about this movie - just endless gore and unnecessary gross scenes that will make you feel unpleasant.

Maybe it was a symbol. Perhaps Director Zombie wanted to send some kind of message to a friend (I'm sure enemies would get worse) or the critics. Not sure, but it kind of ran out of steam or effect, I don't know, the seventeenth time.Viciously unscary, Zombie clearly decided on substance over suspense. His House of 1000 Corpses would be an easy target for anyone to compare to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Heck, it was (strangely) set in the 1970s (and in Texas!), had a house of related loonies and a group of young adults who go off the beaten path to a creepy old white house. Coincidentally, or not, the Massacre remake, came out almost 6 months to the date later. (Hmmm?)The biggest difference between the (true) 1970s classic Chainsaw and this mess is you got into those victims shoes. You felt for them, you were scared for them, you saw their angst. Here, you barely see them, much less give a second thought if they lived. I'm guessing, again, that Zombie chose to show off his new camera angles he learned at movie-making 101 night classesonline, over any bit of human connection. (SEE ALSO: Rob Zombie's Halloween II.Sure, I know who rocker Rob Zombie is, so saying this movie is basically an hour and a half music video shouldn't be surprising. But it really is. Unfortunately, that's all it is. Weird here, weird there, ideas start, sometimes stop, mostly leads nowhere. Everyone seemed to be doing their own thing that makes me think Zombie was hands-off and allowed the improv'ing to prevail. Was there even a screenplay? Did he whisper in his actor's ears: ""Think Chainsaw, well, without the 'saw. Go.""Most of these ""Wrong Turn"" movies are almost step-by-step the same: (usually) set in the 1970s, a single road that's hard to find and leads to a house full of back-wooded crazies and (generally) involves 2 males/2 females that are about as dumb as the drugs their on. (In Corpses's defense, I didn't recall seeing them use any narcotics, but, ironically, you really need to be on some to enjoy this feature.) I think Zombie saw that, and only ambition to ""change the way"" is just to make it as crazy as ever. Congratulations. Next time, remember there's the plot part of the screenplay.Okay, I'm being too harsh. It wasn't the worst, but if you're expecting to be scared, look elsewhere. I believe the reason it lacked thrills was, again, the lack of human connection. Besides the obvious – a man in clown paint 24/7 – you rarely see the ""main victim/stars"" of the film. Half the time, it takes more energy to remember where they're at in the house than to care if they're still alive.Quick plot synopsis, if there is a story: Foursome writers forget the written cliché about curiosity killing the cat and head off to ""Dr. Satan's"" domain in the middle of nowhere after already being subjected to beyond abnormal characters, ones that don't hide their killer instincts. After their stereotypical tire blow-out, they head for ""safety"" from the obligatory rain and have the seen-it-before gross-out ""let's introduce the clan"" dinner before the been-there slaughter/run-like-hell begins.This movie is so point A-to-Z, it's not hiding this is homage to horror movies of true terror Zombie wanted to mimic. So, if you want to rekindle all those old Chainsaw knockoffs, and possibly have a little stash of drugs, watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake instead. Really. Besides the superior (from what I can recall) sequel, The Devil's Rejects, there's no reason to visit this house of 1000 corpses. Speaking of which, I wonder if there really were 1000 corpses here. Perhaps there were, but I have no interest in rewatching and counting.Disclaimer: I don't do drugs. Drugs are bad, mmm'kay. Maybe if did, I would've enjoyed this more. Maybe I would be scared. Maybe I would've actually understood it. The movie's just not worth the effort to start drugs just to get into this film. Say Nope to Dope(y Movies,) mmm'kay.",House of 1000 Corpses
32,bensonmum2,Loved It,8,2 February 2005,"I was recently given the House of 1000 Corpses DVD as a gift. I had heard such bad things about it that I had been afraid to buy it myself. I just knew I wasn't going to enjoy it. Now, I wish I would have seen it sooner. I watch movies for the sake of entertainment. And if it entertains me, then art, technical merit, or any other thing people like to complain about be damned. Bottom line - House of 1000 Corpses is one of the most entertaining new movies I've seen. I found myself playing along with Rob Zombie to spot all of the movie's influences. A lot of reviews I've read complain that Zombie ""ripped"" The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and other movies. Personally, I don't think ""ripped"" is the right word. I see it as Zombie's way of paying a loving tribute to the movies he enjoys.There's nothing at all original about the plot. Two couples get lost in the backwoods and are set upon by a crazed family of killers. Sound familiar? But what makes this movie different from many of the others that have tried this same plot are the visuals and the characters. Zombie has filled every frame of this picture with some of the most gruesome eye-candy imaginable. I wanted to stop the movie every five minutes just to take it all in. Everything from the vintage t-shirts worn by Captain Spaulding to the mobile of shoes is a real joy to behold. Zombie must be a nut for detail.As for the characters (and here, I'm referring to the killers), each is so over-the-top that I couldn't wait to see what they would do next. Much of this comes form Zombie's casting choices. Sig Haig, Bill Moseley, Karen Black, and Sheri Moon play their demented characters to perfection. Each is an absolute ""scene stealer"", often within the same scene. It's such a pleasure to watch people having this much fun making a movie.The movie is not without its problems. As previously mentioned, the plot is all but non-existent. Many of the underground scenes toward the end of the movie were not necessary to me. Also, some of Zombie's editing style is not to my taste. But, these things are minor to my overall enjoyment of the movie.",House of 1000 Corpses
33,Robert_duder,Rob Zombie's Artistic piece of garbage,3,25 June 2006,"House of 1000 Corpses has Rob Zombie written all over it. This wasn't created with viewers in mind, or how the audience would like it but rather he created it (both writer, director and composer) as his own love child of his own twisted, demented ideas. I mean the story is pretty stereotypical ripping off ideas from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and a dozen other horror films. The sadistic family from Grandpa, to Mama, to Baby is a fun idea but then Zombie mixes it with some sort of stylized flashback, acid trip that makes the entire film annoying and unwatchable. I did watch the whole thing but I also fast forwarded through most of it and watched it that way and found it far more amusing. Fortunately it's short, and I was surprised that it wasn't as gory as I expected. I heard many people rave about the gore and horrendous death scenes and I mean it was pretty typical horror. I've certainly seen far worse as of late with Hostile, The Saw series and so on.Rainn Wilson, Chris Hardwick, Erin Daniels, and Jennifer Jostyn play the four unsuspecting young people driving across the country writing a book about out of the way tourist attractions when they come across Captain Spaulding's store. The four of them do a decent job of being the scream teens of the story, getting picked off one by one and leaving us to guess who is next and how they will die although I'm still not sure how come of them died it was done in such a confusing music video style. The four of them all do a relatively similar job with none of the standing out particularly. They all distinct personalities and do that part of it well. You don't really, truly get attached to any of them so you don't particularly care whether they die or not. Veteran actor Sid Haig plays one of my favorite characters in the film (yes I do have a favorite) Captain Spaulding. He's kind of the front man for the family because he actually runs a legitimate business without murdering every single person that walks through the door. He's funny, sarcastic, and sadistic all at once and he definitely adds some spice to the film. Bill Moseley plays Otis Driftwood, the most sadistic killer, and kind of leader of them all. He is appropriately deviant, and completely messed and his make-up and costume fits nicely. The idea of the character is pretty good and he does it well. Sheri Moon takes her performance over the top and does a great job as Baby Firefly. She looks completely normal, even sexy to the average guy but she as crazy and twisted as the rest of them always desperately wanting to kill something. Karen Black is Mother Firefly and she too is appropriately twisted and disturbing. Her and Baby Firefly play off each other well and are convincingly mother and daughter because of their completely twisted personalities. Matthew McGrory is the mute, deformed Tiny Firefly. Considering the character has nothing to say and little to actually do he does an alright job. I would hope that they would do more with a character they barely explain but they don't. He's just kind of there. Dennis Fimple, and Robert Allen Mukes play the final two members of the family but they also get the least screen time. Fimple as Grandpa Firefly has some funny lines but never does much of anything. One character entered the film and I thought it might change the entire premise and I was excited. He looks rough, tough as nails, ready to take on the Firefly family and that was Sheriff Drake Huston played by William Bassett. Brought in by one of the girl's fathers he immediately launches an investigation. Except he sends other people to do the investigating and we never see him again. He looked so great and tired and weathered and experienced...he was like Dr. Loomis of Halloween, ready to chase down these murderers and he was completely not used at all. What a disappointment!! So the cast was a lot of potential to at the very least be a typical, fun little teenage slasher flick where the kids try to escape but it wasn't. The story was far more complex than it needed to be. It was all about an aging murderer who used to be a doctor in a mental facility and was trying to make a race of super humans by operating on mentally disturbed patients and now they all reside under ground, under the house hence ""House of 1000 Corpses."" DUMB!! Pointless, stupid, and by the time this all unravels you don't care in the least. Rob Zombie simply wanted to slap something together for himself with no thought to audiences or whether it was worthwhile and he wasted some good acting talent and even a decent idea for a good horror film by stylizing it with the ridiculous flashbacks, dream sequences and pointless cut ins done in different video styles like grainy, color drained, and so on. I will see the sequel ""The Devil's Rejects"" because I'm a horror fanatic and I want to see if he managed to improve it because it did better than the original one at the box office but even still... I suppose a lot people did enjoy it although with such a small budget it's not hard to do well in the theater. So if you like completely twisted, sadistic garbage like Zombie's music and films then you'll probably say I'm crazy but if you like a GOOD, WELL DONE, THOUGHT OUT horror film then you'll agree with me and say this one IS a corpse. 3/10",House of 1000 Corpses
34,bowmanblue,"A gritty, gory mess",7,14 October 2016,"If there's one thing modern cinema is criticised for, it's that it's made by executives and corporations rather than by fans of the genre itself. However, that cannot be said for the delightfully-titled 'House of 1000 Corpses.' It's made by the (equally delightfully-named) Rob Zombie, who, despite being better known at the time as a musician, is definitely a fan of the horror genre.But, without even going into who made it, perhaps it's the title that should give you all the information you need to know as to whether or not you'll like this film. If you're expecting anything deep and meaningful then you're going to turn it off within minutes. What you have is a pretty standard 'slasher' flick (okay, so it probably bears more in common with 'Texas Chainsaw' types films than 'Scream,' but there are definitely 'slasher' elements thrown in there), but presented with a sense of art. Or, if you're feeling a little harsher, you could replace the word 'art' with 'bits-thrown-in-that-look-like- they're-taken-right-out-of-an-MTV-music-video.' Rob Zombie tries to do something different with the way the film is shot. It's got a lot of cutaway films and stylishly-filmed segments which break up the narrative. Some may find those interesting and different, others may find that they distract from the narrative – it's really a question of taste, but you can see his music video influence shining through.But, you probably don't watch a film called 'House of 1000 Corpses' for its artistic integrity – you want the gore. And it doesn't disappoint on that one. It's packed full of disgusting characters and imagery – from grotesque mutants to gorgeous babes (who are equally grotesque when it comes to their tendency to murder people at the drop of a hat – Sheri Moon Zombie, I'm looking at you!).Overall, 'House of 1000 Corpses' isn't an original story, but it's done differently enough and with the required levels of gore that will satisfy anyone who wants to watch a film entitled so. It does feel a little 'raw' here and there. Sometimes I felt that was almost intentional, other times I wondered whether Rob Zombie was letting his visions get a little too convoluted. However, he definitely proves that he can do more than sing (assuming you agree with that in the first place!) and, seeing as he's a fan of the genre, hopefully this will be a good stepping stone to launch what might be a promising horror career.",House of 1000 Corpses
35,CuriosityKilledShawn,Absolutely mental!,10,6 May 2004,"Gulp! This was one barmy film. By far the most true, nerve-wracking horror we've had in ages. Far too many 'horror' movies over the past 10 years have been neutralized sub-genre flicks starring generic babes and hunks from teen soaps. Nothing of the sort here. Rob Zombie has made a REAL horror film with some shocking and unbelievable elements.Four kids, on their way home, stop over at some remote gas station (and fried chicken bar) run by the manic Captain Spaulding. Upon witnessing his freak-show amusement ride of urban legends they become fascinated with the myth of Doctor Satan, an insane local mass-murder/torturer/scientist. They make the very unwise decision of taking a slight detour in order to find him.Soon enough they've picked up a wild hitchhiker called Baby who is more than a little slutty. Their car blows a tyre and Baby has her brother Otis take them back to her house for repairs. Baby, Otis and the rest of the family seem kind of hospitable at first, despite their peculiar idiosyncrasies.
After that, well...complete and utter madness follows. Rob Zombie bombards us with so much horror, both macabre and morbid, that the film becomes a hypnotic thrill ride of guts, gore and grim. As the traumatized teens slowly lose their minds so do we. They barely have time to comprehend the mania and carnage and neither does the audience.In the final 15 minutes our senses are so over-stimulated by the breath-taking madness, furious pace, escalating and mind-blowing horror that the shocking plot twist in the last few seconds comes as the biggest surprise and fright I've ever seen in a movie.Many have criticized Zombie's Oliver Stone-type direction of this film and called his rapid switching of film-stocks jarring and distracting. I didn't mind it at all. It adds to the unstable atmosphere of the film and only proves Zombie took more time and effort to put this film together than most other directors do.House of 1000 Corpses was made by Universal and Zombie wrapped production way back in Spring 2000. But the film was so gory and perverse that Universal simply refused to release it. MGM tried to help get it out there but ended up dumping it too. Finally Lion's Gate Films stepped in and gave the film a limited run (which is unfortunate since a mainstream Universal release would have guaranteed it reached a bigger audience). By this point the film had been cut, edited and censored. Which is a big shame. Even with these 15 minutes missing House of 1000 Corpses will still leave you feeling numb and slightly sick.As Zombie is already working on a sequel (called The Devil's Rejects) he doesn't have the time to work on the uncut DVD but has promised he will do his best to get it out there. So until then get your fix with this DVD.
The film is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Special features include a commentary, a featurette, audition footage, rehearsal footage, cast and crew interviews, a still gallery, trailers and an isolated score. The region 2 DVD (which I have) has an exclusive DTS 5.1 track.",House of 1000 Corpses

So many demented parts and quotable lines, it's an excellent experience every time even 15 years after release.The soundtrack is superb especially for the genre! There's a lot of sadistic subject matter that boggles the mind and should disturb just about anyone.

38,BaronBl00d,Twisted Topic by Twisted Artists,4,17 April 2005,"Well, every now and then I am surprised with a newer horror film being rather good when I expected it to be rather bad. It was that way with Bubba Ho-Tep, but it sure wasn't that way with Rob Zombie's House of 1,000 Corpses. Let me first say that this film is very unique in terms of composition, direction, acting styles, visuals, and plot. I found the innovative camera work of Zombie - that eerie, low-budget feel it created - to be very effective. Some of the performances, although bouncing off walls at monstrous speeds, were more than interesting. Sid Haig in particular did a fantastic job as Captain Spaulding. No one gave a real bad performance. Bill Mosely plays the lead horror character in the film: a man living with his sick brothers (one deformed and very tall creatively named ""Tiny,)"" his slutty mother played by a hammy(yet still very attractive Karen Black), and his sister Baby - played by Zombie's real-life wife Sheri Moon. Moon is a pretty thing at least. These characters are vile, odious concoctions; however, as the do all kinds of perverse, cruel, sick, twisted things to a group of young people that happen to find their way to their strange house. The story combines a Texas Chainsaw Massacre plot line with several others. It is quite graphic at times too. For me though, the movie tries too much to be sick and disgusting toward its end despite showing lots of potential. Zombie is an obvious horror fan as he showed various clips of old horror films by Universal throughout. I thought some scenes were very nice - the opening sequence and that whole ""I Remember You"" song routine. I also liked the tunnel sequence, but the story in this film is really too weak to hold this picture up.",House of 1000 Corpses

Wasn't that impressed as a horror fan. Rob Zombie's debut is a throwback to the horror films of yesteryear. Stirring in elements of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He did an awesome Devils rejects, bad Halloween remakes, n waiting for his new flick 31. His debut is a throwback to the horror films of yesteryear. It offers nothing new. It was not scary, gory, suspenseful or tension filled. It was full of cliché n just painstakingly obvious. A real stand out is the use of color. The photography is surprisingly good for a horror effort. Another big reason to watch is Sid Haig who acted in many 70s classic exploitation efforts. His recent Bone Tomahawk was awesome. Agreed he had a very small role. The film contains stylistic references to just about every 'cutting-edge' horror technique of the seventies, shaky-cam, point-of-view-camera, negative exposure etc. The dark humor was the best thing about the film, creating an interesting atmosphere. Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding was definitely this movie's highlight. Also it has horror veteran, Bill Moseley.",House of 1000 Corpses

41,insomniac_rod,"Rob Zombie's own surreal nightmare. His ""dream"" came true.",8,27 August 2004,"Anyone can notice that Rob Zombie's favorite horror movie is ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Now, imagine watching an 88 min. White Zombie clip with the events of 1974's TCM. Something like that is ""House Of 1000 Corpses"".As a fan of Rob Zombie's work (music and videos) I wasn't shocked by ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" brutal and weird content. Zombie deserves a major recognition for having the guts for making a TRUE horror movie. I kept thinking about ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" while watching this movie. The colors, the characters, the gruesome sequences, the insanity, the acting, the situations, and even the score (at some points) is very similar to the 1986's cult classic. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is not better than TCM and TCM 2 in my opinion, and it's not even that violent or shocking the first time you watch it.OK, TCM and TCM 2 doesn't have demons monsters. The movie has a bit of the 70's and 80's low budget horror movies with a touch of 2000's and that is fashion, over the top clichés, etc.The beginning of the movie is like watching White Zombie's ""Boogeyman"" video clip, then the opening scene where Spaudlin's store is assaulted is just a preview of what the movie's gonna be like. I wasn't shocked or surprised by the movie but I had respect for it's gruesome images and disturbing sequences. I was happy to see that most fans of the ""Jeepers Creepers"" and ""Scream"" movies were TRULY shocked (and frightened in some cases) with Zombie's movie. This is not your typical slasher movie where an unknown killer chases a bunch of pretty teens and only one or two survives. Zombie's diabolical script doesn't hints on who could survive, who is going to be the lead character, or what will be the highlight scene of the movie. The tag line of ""who will survive and what will be left of them?"" fits perfect in this movie.The movie is unpredictable, fast paced, and the feeling of uncertainty adds tension towards the events helps to create a weird, disturbing atmosphere. Zombie is strongly influenced by Tobe Hooper's 1974 horror masterpiece ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and he mixes it with his particular way of understanding horror. Zombie has a wicked and twisted sense of black humor and mixes it with his known taste for horror. There's plenty of gore, scary images, top notch make up for monsters, demons, creatures, etc. The soundtrack (of course, by Rob Zombie) is perfect for the movie. Great acting for a movie like this where sanity is something you will not notice. Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) is a great character, he looks mean and demented, perfect for the role. His performance is one of the best and he's not based on any character I can remember from other movies from the genre. The other most important character in the movie, Otis Driftwood (the great Bill Moseley) is great also. He's perfect and reminds me a lot of Chop Top from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"". Baby (Sheri Moon) is hot as hell, with all respect to Rob Zombie. Her character was kind of annoying but it fit good with the movie's going. Mother Firefly (Karen Black) and Dennis Fimple -R.I.P.- (Grandpa Hugo) are both grotesque characters that add a lot of tension to the movie. Mary and Denisse are very hot and can act. That's good about their characters. The male victims, specially Jerry worked very good for the movie.*SPOILERS* I loved Zombie's wicked way of portraying the torture scenes, specially when Jerry and Denise are forced to ""visit"" Dr. Satan. I love that scene, it has to be a new classic moment in the genre. When Jerry is attacked by the creatures down the murky water, I was amazed by the creepiness of the scene. Otis performing a ritual dressed as a black priest or something, the music and scary sounds: all in one help to create a very tense and shocking scene in the movie. Also, I dig the scene where Tiny and Otis beat Jerry and Bill. Zombie should be proud of his talents : horror movies and rock music. He's familiar with both things and with time he'll be a privileged horror movie maker. I don't know if he based most of the movie's scenes on his nightmares or something very evil. Zombie is a true fan of horror and he deserved very much this chance.""House Of 1000 Corpses"" is a great addition for the genre. This movie was needed to show that quality horror can still be made. Thanks Rob Zombie, people like you are always welcomed by fans of Horror.8.5/10 A cult classic in the future. Let's see if Zombie can consolidate with his next movie.",House of 1000 Corpses

It's there, featuring a bunch of kids getting stranded into a weird house full of weirdos because of reasons, but it's merely an excuse for Zombie to indulge in all the horror tropes.And I mean all of them. We have the hill billy killers. We have the satanists. We have the killer clowns. We have the body horror fetishists. We have spooky mines and the lab of a mad scientist. We have something straight out of Terry Gilliam's nightmares. We have mermaids (it's better if you don't ask). We have it all.But don't get me wrong. That's the main attraction of this film. I cannot in good conscience call it a good film, but there is something to its undiluted zest for this genre that's quite attractive. In the right mindset this would be an absolute blast to watch, from start to finish.Alas, I watched it alone and I watched it sober.

The start of the movie showed promise and gave hope that you were in for something special but as the movie went on it just got worse and worse. The movie wasn't a complete lose however with one scene being drawn out for what seemed like forever and yet kept you eyes focused the entire time.So basically the only reason you should be tempted to check this out is if you've already seen every half decent movie in your preferred genre and you're still not satisfied.",House of 1000 Corpses

So, that makes ""Zombie"" an appropriate last name for little Bobbie, indeed.You know, I'm actually surprised that Cummings/Zombie used such a high figure as 1000 in reference to the total corpse count in his dumb movie-title. If this flick is any indication of little Robbie Zombie's juvenile mentality and limited skills as a director, then I would have never believed, for a minute, that this big phony could've actually counted all the way up to 1000, at all.With its utter lack of originality, House Of 1000 Corpses is so easy to discard into the trash heap as just another blatant rip-off of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There's no doubt about that. Yeah. It's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre without the chainsaw. And without the chainsaw this flick had no balls.

As such, it's a popcorn movie - throw that ol' Pop Secret in the microwave and get prepared to have that knowing smirk wiped off your face. This isn't a tame, placid movie in which the killers aren't seen; it's an all-out gore fest that delights in shocking, or at least in attempting to shock.Much of the plot has been lifted from countless drive-in movies. Four teens are driving across the country, collecting information for a book one of them is writing about odd roadside attractions. They stop for gas at a place called Spaulding's, run by a half-mad misfit (Sid Haig) who sometimes dresses as an evil clown. The young quartet, after gassing up, takes a ""tour of evil"" behind the store, and here they learn about a half-mythical being known as Dr. Satan. Thinking this might be good fodder for their book, the kids ask Captain Spaulding (you oldtime movie buffs should catch that reference) if he can direct them to where Dr. Satan now resides. The wacko is glad to oblige.But of course, it's dark, and then it's rainy, and then they pick up a sexy hitchhiker, and then the tire blows. And wouldn't you know it, the kids forgot the spare. So the hitchhiker (Sheri Moon) who says she lives down the street, says she'll get her brother to bring his tow truck around. Which means it's not too long before our four ""normal"" kids are stranded in a spooky house in the middle of the night during a harsh rainstorm.
The Firefly family is a tad on the peculiar side, from young harlot Baby (Moon) to old harlot Mother Adrienne (Karen Black) to Otis (Bill Moseley), who looks a lot like Riff-Raff from The Rocky Horror Picture Show, to Granpa (Dennis Fimple). Naturally, it's not long before these meddling kids want to get out of there. FAST.House of 1,000 Corpses is not a movie built strongly on a foundation of irrefutable plot development. It's signature is style, and director/screenwriter Rob Zombie bathes the movie in an absolute orgy of it, complete with dismemberments and scalpings and many other horrific elements. There's plenty of blood and gore, and as long as you can convince yourself it's not actual gore, you might find this a fun movie.
Let me pause right there. Some of you are probably scratching your heads. ""A fun movie?"" you ask. Death and dismemberment is fun? Sure, in a creepily exotic way. The idea of the movie isn't to see how the kids can escape the horror, it's to see how many unique and interesting ways they can be tortured. All right, so that's a little sick. I admit it. I have a bloodthirst when it comes to some movies. If I'm in the right mood, a gory film (see Dead Alive, by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson to learn about fun with a lawnmower) is perfect.This is all a roundabout way of explaining that this movie is not for all audiences, but then again the title alone should alert you to that. It's probably a bad idea to let young, impressionable kids watch this. I say ""probably,"" only because perhaps you don't mind your Timmy growing up thinking slaughtering young people is okey dokey.It's not a movie for the weak of heart. Please don't watch this if you're pregnant; it may induce laughter. You see, when this came out to poor reviews, I figured the big problem was that it was laughable. It's not laughable - you just have to be in a precise frame of mind for it. I hope Zombie makes more of these.Oh, and here's an interesting bit of trivia.

I always have to break this film up into two storylines - before they go into the hole and after. I always love this movie all the way until the go to see doctor death - the movie is a perfect new age Texas Chainsaw Massacre until that point. Once they throw the kids in the hole, the movie falls apart for me. The characters and dialogue are fantastic. The unique gore and kill scenes are very well done. The cinematography, 70s theme, commercials and soundtrack are all brilliant. There's honestly not much to not like about this film outside of the ending. This is a horror fans dream as it does a great job of delivering all of the characters and the execution, kill scenes and soundtrack are perfectly done.

It's like a script wasn't actually written, but instead someone just took dictation as Zombie paced back and forth one night, rambling away about how this happens and then that happens and then this other thing happens. You could take the last 40 minutes or so of this film, randomly switch around the scenes and it would make about as much sense.This movie is also a catastrophe visually. Zombie can't go more than a minute of two without indulging in some cheap effect or digression. It looks like a normal movie, but then there's some hand held video, then everything's shot with 16 millimeter film, then the film is reversed to a negative image, then there's a clip of a TV broadcast, then there's a clip from a old horror movie, then there's some stuff you can barely make out and it goes on and on and on like that. Have you ever encountered a little child trying way too hard to get and keep your attention? Imagine that kid having ADHD and injecting caffeine all night and you'll have some idea of what House of 1000 Corpses looks like.I'm not even going to get into how the movie is clearly styled after films like The Hills Have Eyes (original, not the sucky remake) but then takes off on this Lovecraftian tangent where it appears as though Zombie forgot what kind of film he was making. Imagine watching The Verdict and finding out about 8 minutes of My Cousin Vinny has been spliced into it at the end.The acting in this mess is also almost uniformly terrible. Except for Sid Haig, every other person in the cast could have walked around carrying signs saying ""I am an actor"" and it wouldn't have made their performances any less believable or involving. You can tell that the actors were told to do everything as ""campy"" as possible, but instead of ""campy"" they ended up with ""crappy"". Haig is the only one who makes his depraved beast of a character even vaguely interesting, and that's because Haig's Captain Spaulding doesn't spend every single moment on screen desperately trying to convince the audience how evil and provocative he is.Almost all of the things wrong with this film could be forgiven, though, if it was really frightening or disturbing. But it's not. Oh sure, someone with a weak stomach may find some of it unsettlingbut someone with a weak stomach isn't watching a movie titled ""House of 1000 Corpses"". None of the violence, none of the perversity, none of the gore has any affect at all. That's because none of it is connected to anything real. There's no real emotion and no real dilemmas, so there's nothing real to fear. This film is like that high school kid who thinks he's ""edgy"" because he dresses up like a goth vampire and drinks Clamato, pretending it's actual blood.As dispiritingly bad as this movie is, Zombie got to make a sequel to it. That's the sort of unfairness that drives people to contemplate suicide. In fairness to Zombie, however, The Devil's Rejects is a much more professionally competent product. It still sucks hard, but maybe if he gets the chance to make 2 or 3 hundred more movies, he might finally come up with something halfway decent.",House of 1000 Corpses
49,lukem-52760,I LIKE ROB ZOMBIE AS A DIRECTOR & THIS IS HALF GOOD!!!,3,14 January 2020,"I do really like Rob Zombie as a visionary & extremely unforgiving Horror director but what i don't like is how he often wants us the viewers to feel sorry for & root for his sadistic & pure evil murderer characters, I'm much more for having these sicko characters but as villains & have a Cop or a Vigilante kill'em off brutally, like hunting them down & dishing out old school ""Charles Bronson"" justice but that's my own opinion & ""Zombie"" does his thing & lots love him for it.That was why i couldn't enjoy his ""Devil's Rejects"" even though IT'S said to be his best film or even his ""MASTERPIECE"" but the film concentrates on a vile sadistic family that torture & murder innocent people so morally it's hard to like these freaks & when an Awesome vigilante character came along in the form of the excellent ""William Forsythe"" as an angry & out for revenge Sheriff, well he was looked at as the ""badguy"" & was killed off? Even though he was a Hero & those freaks are evil deranged killers so i was more annoyed at that film & rated it a 5/10 as it's a well made & crafted, gritty & brutal 70's style grindhouse flick, it's just abit too much of the ""Sick"" & not enough Vigilante justice.Anyway with his Debut, sick & twisted ""House of a 1000 Corpses"" it's a very stylish & gorgeous looking neon drenched Horror slasher, zombie has a very good vision & stunning visual look to his films especially this one & the first half is great Horror fun with a rain storm & a car braking down & a group of innocent fresh faces finding a big old spooky house in the middle of nowhere in the dark storm, it's almost perfect Horror but then of course it all goes way too far & way too deranged, sick & sadistic too really enjoy & it's full of dark humour which is fine but it comes off too silly & too gross to enjoy.
Both of his crazed serial killer flicks so far are ok but but not great but i get why these films have a big Cult following, i just would've liked a Cop or Vigilante to follow on the journey so we can get behind & have a good solid moral centre amongst all the dirty, filthy depraved trash.Now i loved Rob Zombies ""Halloween"" & ""Halloween 2"" & his Awesome ""31"" so i do like some of his films but his ""1000 Corpses"" & his ""Rejects"" are not ones i enjoyed but I'm willing still to give his 3rd entry a try ""3 From Hell"" mainly because it's Sid Haig's last movie appearance R.I.P & i like the underrated & intense actor Richard Brake!!!

50,drownnnsoda,"Gruesome, Schlocky, and Utterly Bizarre.",7,25 August 2004,"Musician Rob Zombie's debut film, ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" is one gruesome, campy, and disturbing ride. The film follows two couples who embark on a journey (we never really are told where they were going) through the back roads in some remote location on Halloween Eve. After stopping by a very strange gas station that offers complimentary fried chicken, features a ""muder ride"" attraction, and is run by a trashy clown, they head on there way, and end up meeting a hitchhiker and getting their tire blown out. The hitchhiker takes them to her old farmhouse, where she and the rest of her twisted backwoods family lives... but they aren't aware of the horrors that await them.A truly sick and twisted film, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is reminiscent of old school 1970s horror films, but is also much more violent and gruesome. The storyline is derivative in and of itself, and we've seen it done dozens and dozens of times before (primarily in Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""). In that aspect, this film isn't all that original. But the subplots and twisted imagery provided here is what makes this film more recognizable from others. Lots of really disturbing images and some hand-held camera footage (used for a raw effect I'm assuming) add to the movie's strangeness. The set-pieces (inside and outside the farmhouse) are stunning, and some even give the movie an almost cabaret feel because of their flashiness. To my knowledge the movie was filmed in Universal Studios, so they had a lot of props and set-pieces and whatnot at hand to be used, which could explain this.There is a sense of an almost demonic-feeling to this movie, and it as well makes this an even more disturbing film. I thought the first 45 minutes or so were really interesting, but then it went downhill a little, when the entire ""Dr. Satan"" legend is expanded on, adding a supernatural element to the movie that is never quite fully explained. I think if they had kept things within a real-life frame, it would have been more realistic. The first half of the film is like a slasher flick, but then transforms into a supernatural horror movie with zombie creatures and an underground labyrinth, among other things. I'm not sure where they were trying to take this, but it was one strange ride. To be honest, the entire film actually reminded me of something you would have seen at a grind house theater back in the 1970s, which might sound strange, but if you've seen the film you will more than likely understand what I'm talking about. The acting in the film is mostly good, we have Karen Black (""Burnt Offerings"", ""Trilogy of Terror"") and Bill Moseley (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2""), among other actors. The acting isn't great, but overall isn't bad. The movie ends on a strange note, leaving it open-ended for a sequel. Not a bad conclusion I guess.All things considered, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is a bizarre and over-the-top freak show that I'd recommend only to horror fans. If you like schlocky, grind house-style horror flicks, this twisted semi-throwback to 1970s exploitation films might be enjoyable, although it may also be a little too weird for some tastes. Overall, I enjoyed it, but it is admittedly very strange and has a few problems here and there. Worth watching though at least one time, especially if you're a fan of Zombie or his style. 7/10.",House of 1000 Corpses

As some people called this one a ""cult movie"", I gave it a try...Well, you see me very disappointed now. This movie is just joking on some real great and original horror movies and dishonouring them, the whole thing is touched by some weird humour, exaggerated and surrealistic gore elements, an absolutely stupid storyline and embarrassing dialogues. The whole movie hasn't a real story, sense or logic. I've tried to watch this movie another time with some friends and some beers, it doesn't get funnier and is still very poor. When I heard, after watching this one, that Rob Zombie would do a remake of the legendary ""Halloween"" movies, I was just shocked and laughing out loud...

I'm very pleased to say that I was surprised by how much I really liked this film. It's genuinely terrifying and it uses classic horror tactics that work. There's a lot of originality too, and I love that in this genre because so many horror films, especially nowadays can be so cheesy and stereotypical. I wasn't bored ever while watching this, I just became more interested because of it's originality. The actors all did a really great job, I was impressed especially by the actors playing the killer family. The third act of this film is really great and it's one of the best third acts of any horror film I've seen. I won't spoil anything because I want everyone to see it who hasn't already, but suffice to say that atmosphere has a big role in the third act. Atmosphere actually has a big role in the whole film, they did a really good job creating a creepy atmosphere that works.

They meet Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), who tells an unusual story about the legendary Dr. Satan. Four Friends are curious about the local legend. Then later... Four Friends meets a family of freaks (Bill Moseley, Sheri Moon, Karen Black, Robert Allen Mukes, Matthew McGrory and Dennis Fimple), who turns out to be Serial Killers. The legend of Dr. Satan might be real after all... when one of the four friends gets to meet him.Directed by Rod Zombie (The Devil's Rejects) made his first film, which Zombie comes close hitting the bull's eye in this strange, unusual, oddball horror film. Zombie adds humor to his film. Zombie pays tribute to ""Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Which Tobe Hooper loved this film.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an good commentary track by Zombie, Behind the Scenes featurette, Interviews and more. This film was filmed in 2000 and it was picked up by two studios:Universal and MGM before independent distributor:Lions Gate Entertainment picked it out for limited release that turned into a Box Office Hit. Good Performances by Moseley, Moon and Black. Fun supporting role by Haig. The film's mistake is Dr. Satan is a major disappointment and maybe it is a mistake to root for the Serial Killers, which is not always a good thing.

54,aidanratesmovies,Why?,2,9 October 2020,"A messy, forgettable, and incredibly trashy horror flick- House of 1000 Corpses has little to offer, and little coherency or significance whatsoever. I believe it is safe to say that I didn't like this film. No that does not mean I shouldn't be watching horror movies, no it doesn't mean I appreciate horror, I infact appreciate the genre very much, it's just that this film is an absolute garbage heap. Rob Zombie has a tendency of producing more gritty, dirty, and rather trashy kind of horror flicks- full of gore, senseless violence, cheesy lines, and even cheesier performances. All of this and more atrocities occur between the 1hr28mins that this film unfolds on screen. The very beginning is okay, although it led me to expect the rest of the film would be much different. Sid Haig provides a somewhat decent performance as Captain Spaulding, but besides him, the actors in this film are honestly quite atrocious. The performances are over the top, the characters are pointless or incredibly grotesque, and the script requires little to no reason whatsoever to care about any of them. The cinematography does that weird little trick where it changes its picture every few seconds or so, similar to Natural Born Killers, but unlike that film, this doesn't seem to really be trying. The plot and script make absolutely no sense, as it seems to go nowhere and yet everywhere at once. The music in the film is all over the place and clashes with the tone in so many ways, there is no positive way to recognize what the director wants you to feel. It's ending is unbearable, and although the film isn't necessarily boring, there is absolutely no joy to be found while watching it. Needless to say, I would skip this one, save yourself from losing brain cells.
My Rating: 2/10",House of 1000 Corpses
55,Agent10,A binge of ragweed and hard drugs created this sloppy gorefest,5,21 April 2003,"Rob Zombie's videos have been spectacles of self expression, but would it work in the full-length feature? The answer is no. Sure, the film had some incredible moments of gore and whatnot, but the acting and plot was simply lacking. Sure, about 17 minutes was lopped off this film, but even the additional time would not have saved it. For its audacity, I give it a 5/10, but for everything else, this film doesn't deserve any points. Maybe Rob will work a little more on his music than trying to a director, just yet.",House of 1000 Corpses
56,Jonny_Numb,"Still a Brick Sh!t ""House""",3,25 August 2007,"(Second Review.) ""My brain is frozen!"" Otis Driftwood (Bill Moseley) yells at a trio of bound-and-gagged cheerleaders at one point, and I felt the same way. Even on second glance, ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" is awful, simply because form and narrative is jettisoned for a near-endless string of abrasively avant-garde camera techniques (loud color filters, cut scenes that come out of nowhere, aged-down video quality, negative filters, split screen, etc.) chosen because...well, ""they look cool,"" I guess. They certainly don't augment any narrative purpose with their constant assault, and this makes sense, given Rob Zombie's previous background in music-video direction.The story itself is a muddled mess. There are at least 3 separate plots going on, none of which are given sufficient attention. The scene is set when a carload of grating college students (including former ""Singled Out"" host Chris Hardwick and ""The Office""'s Rainn Wilson), writing a book on weird roadside attractions, run afoul of Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig""Spider Baby""), the flour-faced clown proprietor of a combination gas station/fried chicken stand/Murder Ride. Said students learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan, but get sidetracked by obnoxious hitchhiker Baby (Sheri Moon, Zombie's wife), who brings our zeroes home for a night of torture, terror, and totally gross overacting by her kin, the Fireflies. But what of the aforementioned cheerleaders, who are made out to be a plot point? And why do we spend most of the movie with the grating Fireflies when the Dr. Satan thread would have made a far more interesting film? Who knows, who cares. While Zombie may have never read about postmodernism in film, ""Corpses"" fits the criteria to a Tthis is a fanboy movie that wears its '70s influence on its sleeve (going so far as to set the movie on October 30 and 31, and making blatant the socio-economic commentary that Tobe Hooper's infinitely superior ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" smoothly implied). The Firefly family is yet another riff on the inbred sickos of Hooper's seminal masterpiece crossed with the mountain loonies of ""The Hills Have Eyes""but whereas the characters in those films gave naturalistic performances (that made them seem all the more real), Zombie writes dialog like an invitation for histrionics from his C-listers; Moseley spends most of the film screaming his lines; Moon's helium-inflected voice is irritating; and Karen Black's over-the-hill slut routine is embarrassing. Haig emerges relatively unscathed, as his presence is reduced to a handful of scenes. And the less said about our wayward heroes, the better. Zombie doesn't present any characters worth caring about, and his penchant for third-grader gross-out gags induces more groans than guffaws.But above all, ""Corpses"" fails in the department it was most heralded in: a throwback to gritty, 1970s horror. The aforementioned overzealousness of the director is so unnatural that the viewer is constantly being reminded of the film's modernity as it pulls out all the tricks in the book. More than anything, it feels like a renegade from the direct-to-video bin, where it should have gone in the first place.That being said, ""Corpses"" did invoke a consistent feeling of unease in my gut, and I thought the story threads introduced could have yielded an entertaining (and '70s-faithful) finished product if handled with any bit of seriousness. And the last 15 minutes are easily the best in the filmtaking place in dark catacombs with zombies and a red-tinged S&M club for lobotomy patients is very well-done, as it is the only time Zombie reins in all his camera tricks and focuses on atmosphere and suspense. Too bad the same can't be said for the rest of this bloody mess.",House of 1000 Corpses
57,a_chinn,"A grindhouse mess, but a glorious mess",6,20 May 2017,"Extreme horror films hadn't hit it big until a couple years later in 2005 when Eli Roth's ""Hostel"" came out and I think if this film had been released around that time it might have been a bigger success. Instead, this film took some years to find it's cult following. The story, such as it is, follows a group of young people, two of which are played by Chris Hardwick and Rainn Wilson, ironically visiting the roadside attraction ""The Museum of Monsters & Madmen"" run by the wonderfully creep Sid Haig as the clown-faced Captain Spaulding. From there, the film becomes something of a greatest hits of 70s grindhouse horror films. Writer/director Rob Zombie has made a grizzly love letter to films ranging from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to ""Last House on the Left"" to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" to ""Spider Baby"" to really too many to mention. Zombie has some nice visual stylistics (grainy black & white documentary- like footage, an incredibly long crane shot, or delightfully creepy over-the-top production design) mixed among others that don't quiet work (mainly the ugly photo negative effects). Also in the film's positive column is a to-die-for cast of character actors, including Karen Black, Bill Moseley, Irwin Keyes, Sheri Moon Zombie, Bill Moseley, Dennis Fimple, and Michael J. Pollard. The overall effect of all this is a disconnected mishmash of partially developed ideas that felt as if Zombie was trying to cram in every single horror movie idea he'd ever had into one film. If there is a unifying story, it's the teens trying to survive their captivity by the maniacal Firefly family, which then follows the classic ""last girl"" horror trope. However there are tons of dangling story threads involving the legend of Doctor Satan, Tom Towels and Walton Goggins investigating the missing teens, or just odd one off musical numbers and other throwaways scenes. Still, despite the film being kind of a mess, it's also kind of a glorious mess for fans of the type of film Zombie is celebrating.",House of 1000 Corpses
58,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"An Arty, Grindhouse Homage Film from Rob Zombie",8,25 September 2020,"This film I actually didn't really care for the first time that I saw it. I was a bigger fan of the sequel, The Devil's Rejects. I will admit I had only seen this film once and that was in the theater with my family. I did get the chance to give this a viewing when it came to the Gateway Film Center when it was showing it as a 15 year anniversary, so I decided to check it out to give it another chance. A third viewing has now been done as part of the Summer Challenge Series from the Podcast Under the Stairs for the 2000s. The official synopsis is two young couples traveling across the backwoods of Texas searching for urban legends of murder end up as prisoners of a bizarre and sadistic backwater family of serial killers.Now I will admit, this synopsis is a little bit misleading. The group is Denise Willis (Erin Daniels), her boyfriend Jerry Goldsmith (Chris Hardwick), Mary Knowles (Jennifer Jostyn) and her boyfriend Bill Hudley (Rainn Wilson). They are traveling to write a book about the random roadside attractions that are out there. They end up at Captain Spaulding's (Sid Haig) museum of the mystery of the strange and murder. There is actually a dark ride where they learn about a serial killer named Dr. Satan. Jerry really wants to go to the tree where he was hung and thinks it will add to their book.It starts to rain pretty hard on their drive and they come upon a hitchhiker. She is Baby Firefly (Sheri Moon Zombie). She tells them that she knows where the tree is. As they near her house, someone shoots their tire out. It turns out to be Rufus (Robert Allen Mukes). Baby takes Bill to her house to get her brother to tow them and fix the tire.Things take quite the turn for this group. There are a quite a few people in this Firefly family. They have their own bizarre way of having fun and they won't let this group leave. We've been given news reports about a group of cheerleaders who have gone missing. They are also here, some of them with Otis (Bill Moseley). They're not enjoying their stay though.The question then becomes, is the story of Dr. Satan real or just a way to get people back here? Denise's dad, Don (Harrison Young) is a former police officer and is expecting his daughter. When she doesn't show, he starts to look for her with the local police. They're in for much more than they bargained for though.My views of this film definitely have come up since that first viewing. I wasn't really used to more of the art house style horror films that I am a fan of now. I don't necessarily consider this to be art house, but it does have some interesting editing and quite stylized. It is a lot like watching a Rob Zombie music video. There is lower quality home video footage that is interspersed in the film and after this viewing, I didn't mind at times. It really makes it more surreal by giving us a look into this family, which the other characters do not get. I also think when they're doing some attacks on people during it gives it more a grindhouse feel and makes it more real for me. The film does get a little bit boring for me during the day when Don and the police are searching. I felt some of the tension dies, but it does pick back up in the end. I did really like the ending of the film.Something I have also noticed is that Rob Zombie is really wearing his heart on his sleeve for this movie. I've heard that he loves the Universal Horror films, which makes sense that we're seeing a horror host like they used to get back in the day with a horror movie marathon where they would show those films. This is really paying homage to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre with what we're getting with some other exploitation/horror films mixed in. It does work here for me.The acting of the film is really good as well. I do have to give it to Zombie, that he went out and got people that were underrated or were popular back in the day. Haig is wonderful and gritty in his role. He is hilarious and dirty, but I could literally see him running the attraction that he does. Black was solid as the mother of this family. Daniels, Jostyn, Hardwick and Wilson were also good. We get to see the fear and the uneasiness that their predicament has them in. Not necessarily sure the women would fight back like they do though. Moseley, Sheri Moon Zombie and the rest of the Firefly family were good as well. It was also fun to see Tom Towles and Walton Goggins in this film as police officers. They are both solid actors.As for the effects of the film, they were all done practical and looked amazing. The blood looks real. We see some of the damage that is done to characters, but it is edited in a way where it does cut away so we fill in to make it worse. The look of the characters as they are just tortured and beaten looks great. I thought the look of Otis was great too. He looks to be albino, but he is so dirty that is kind of hard to tell. Also the film is shot very well. I like the angles and gritty feel to it. It definitely makes it feel more real. This last viewing there was a few times where I think he's cut to some things that do bog it down ever so slightly for me.Something that I knew coming in was that Zombie would make sure that score was great. We get an odd mix of metal with oldies. The film actually takes place in the 1970's, so it incorporates music from the era. I think that actually adds to the tension as cheery songs being played over people being tortured. It gives such an odd duality to it. Metal also just fits in with the genre as well. This is a strong part of the film for sure.Now with that said, I'm definitely glad I revisted this film a couple of times. It is much stronger than I realized and I think my tastes had to grow for me to fully enjoy it. The story of the film is pretty basic. We have a group who gets taken by a family of maniacs where they start to be killed off one by one. The setting and how things play out, how they are toyed with makes it quite scary. It is well acted, there are just slight issues with some editing and some of the images we see. The effects were great as was the score of the film. Something I didn't include earlier was there are so many references to film of the past as well as to horror films. Whether it is posters or films on the television, I thought it was a great touch. I would say this film is like a mix of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. This film won't be for everyone as it is not traditional, but I do think if you haven't seen it give it a chance. If you, but haven't seen it in awhile, give it another viewing.",House of 1000 Corpses
59,Samiam3,B-movie craziness,5,29 May 2010,"For a short while, House of 1000 Corpses works as a sort of campy, black satire of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Before long however, it becomes quite obvious that like Tobe Hooper's cult classic, this film is not meant to be played for laughs. What little story there is dissolves into utter chaos and pointlessness, which makes Tobe Hooper's work actually feel impressive.Having not done any research, it is impossible to tell what exactly Rob Zombie was trying to do. Take Disney's haunted mansion, add a little Addams Family, and a lot of Texas Chainsaw, with maybe a pinch of the Misfits' punk rage and you will get House of 1000 Corpses. The whole thing ends up amounting to little more than a long string of scary images and make- up effects with no plot to back it up. There are a few nice shots here and there, but this crazy piece of work is generally loud, and dull with bad acting and an ending that just cries out for sequel, (which the film doesn't deserve).House of 1000 corpses was probably more fun to make than it is to watch. I liked the first twenty minutes. It made me smile in the kind of way that black humour does. I cannot remember which expression I made next, a look of weirdness or disgust, maybe both. The film, gets not only progressively sadistic but also experimental, using copious amounts negative imagery, out of context monologues, and over used 'super' slow motion. House of 1000 Corpses may have made a better music video.This feature will appeal to a very small group of people. Anyone who goes for Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the Hills Have Eyes, will probably get a kick out of this. I don't find it very likable or entertaining, In part because it over does the sadism, but mostly because it is clueless, and it does not amount to as much as Zombie thinks it does.",House of 1000 Corpses

Were it not for Karen Black, one wouldn't be sure these are actually actors playing their roles as if they were those barbaric, mentally defective sadistic killers, and while clearly Rob Zombie knows enough of movies to throw in a variety of references to Marx brothers movies as well as slasher classics, the very inhuman nature of the movie will be so forbidding that only hardcore lovers of this sort of movie will see it.",House of 1000 Corpses

The film sets, the characters, the story-line, dialogue & themes in general are all nods to slashers of the 70's & 80's era! This film being set in Halloween 1977! Hell, the film itself takes inspiration from Texas Chainsaw Massacre & its horror comedy sequel!The film follows 2 couples who run into car trouble & meet a hitch hiker who takes them into her house with her family. But things turn nasty as the family are killers & intended to make their new guests their next victims!I found the film to be pretty good, not amazing as I was expecting a high level of gore, but it was good! The characters were great too & the story-line was simple & basic! Maybe too basic, but it was alright!It's an overall good watch, but not as gory as you'd expect! 6/10",House of 1000 Corpses
64,brando647,A film that grew on me over time...,6,22 January 2006,"I admit, when I first saw Rob Zombie's horror flick, I wasn't really a fan. In fact, it kinda bored me. It wasn't until a couple viewings later that it started to grow on me. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is Zombie's throwback to classic horror flicks, resembling movies along the lines of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". It's pretty campy, but it has it share of thrills.The story revolves around a group of four college-age kids researching corny roadside attractions as they make their way across Texas. Along the way, the hear of a local legend in a small town known as Doctor Satan (yes, it sounds cheesy). It's during their research into the legend that they come across a crazy redneck family with a dark secret. I love the look of this movie. It plays out like a mix between a retro-horror and one of Zombie's music videos.The only thing that still bothers me to this day is the acting in the film. Not on the part of the redneck family, they were great. At first, Sheri Moon-Zombie got on my nerves a little with her laugh. It's a great addition to one of Rob's songs, but when you see her do it in the movie, it feels forced and fake. Bill Moseley was almost charismatic as Otis Driftwood, probably the most demonic of the family. The best performance was the shortest: Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding. He was creepily-funny and I wish he had a bit more screen-time. It was the victims that annoyed the hell out of me. Especially, that of Jennifer Jostyn. Her immature acting had me rooting for her character to die from the very beginning.Nowadays, I enjoy watching the movie. I got past the little problems and enjoy the movie as a whole. It's campy 70's fun with a Rob Zombie twist. It has definitely got some sadistic moments that can be hard to watch if one has a weak stomach. But hell, choke it back and enjoy the movie.",House of 1000 Corpses
65,PimpinAinttEasy,Some great characters ..... but also long tedious scenes of violence,7,9 August 2016,"Dear Rob Zombie, I appreciate your creativity and the amazing psychopathic redneck characters that you created. But House of 1000 Corpses overstayed its welcome - the film got really tedious towards the end. The long scenes inside the cave looked great but the screenplay was terrible. The writing apart from a few instances, was pretty poor. It seemed like there was pressure on you to create many bombastic scenes of violence. But the scenes from the daily lives of these psychotic characters were the best part of the film - like scenes from Captain Spaulding's day as front man at the store. But I enjoyed large portions of this film. I think you might have been inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 which had similar psychotic and gluttonous characters. You fulfilled the true potential of these unique characters in The Devil's Rejects which has much better scenes and interesting supporting characters. Best Regards, Pimpin.

66,baumer,"One severely f***ed up, brilliant, old school horror film!",9,21 April 2003,"I think many self proclaimed horror afficiondoes (I being one of them) are simultaneously in debt to Scream for revitalizing a dormant genre like horror and loathe it for revitalizing the dormant horror genre.  For every brilliant and innovative film like Sixth Sense, The Ring and Blair Witch Project, you get such stratagem like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Darkness Falls and so on.  Many film makers looking for a quick buck throw together a quickie horror film and hope they can catch a society sleeping and lull us into the illusion that we have seen a good film.  With the decade of the 70's long behind us, we sometimes forget films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left, Black Christmas and Halloween. Names like Carpenter, Craven, Romero and Hooper are now more synonymous with the shock pop culture than they are with the brilliant exposes that they created.  And that is a shame.But now comes along Rob Zombie and you can put his name along side the greats from yesteryear as a man who has guts and grit and as someone who loves the nasty films that we may be ashamed to admit that we do. Zombie's HOOC is a throw back to when films could get away with the carnage of a film like this.  While obviously tipping his cap to films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Evil Dead and Last House on the Left, it is only a tangential tip and one that never strays far from Zombies own touch.  Simply put, this is one sick and twisted and macabre film.  This is what has been missing from the horror genre since the early 80's.  While Craven and Williamson paved the way from the new breed of horror films, lest we forget the ones that they paid homage to.  Rob Zombie has remebered all too well.House of 1000 Corpses has a great many similarities to Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  It has a twisted family, four stupid teens that haven't seen enough horror films, it takes place in the 70's, it has a roadside gas station that starts the ball rolling, it has a hitchhiker that leads them to their doom and a plethora or other obvious imbroglios that tend to come from TCM.  But it also has a style of it's own.  I read somewhere that Rob Zombie is a horror buff and that he has seen just as many horror films as the rest of us.  It shows here.  He has given us a pastiche of every horror cliche and at the same time given new life to the fraudulent horror genre as of late.HOOC looks and feels like a well crafted horror film and it has all the right components in place.  From the director of photography, Alex Poppas using dark reds and ominous blacks and dusky hues to accentuate the hopelessness at hand, to set designer Lisa Sessions creating a truly wonderful haunted house to the actors to the direction, this is a throw back to the incomparable horror films from days gone by.I can see how some would say that this is too much of a rip off of TCM, but I think that that film was only a blue print, the rest was Zombie at his finest.  There are some images in this film that are strong and will not leave you easily.  Images like one of the main characters being operated on and dissected by one of the crazies, or a scalping or any number of barbaric images you can witness watching this film.  Obviously this is not a film for everyone and to those that don't like this sort of thing, stay away.  But for anyone that can appreciate the time and effort and the labour of love that went into making such a disturbing film, this is something you may not see for another 25 years so enjoy it while you can.  You can now add Zombie's name to the list of ""young"" directors that made their mark in the horror genre and I certainly hope to see much more from him.  This film is sick, depraved and f***in brilliant.9 out of 10-  This is a horror film that is truly horrific and one that deserves to be recognized as a true barometer for the horror industry in the years to come.One last thing, this is not a film for the faint of heart.  If certain images disturb you, and I'm sure you can figure out what kind of images those may be, just don't go.  Stay home and watch Sixth Sense again.  Not that there is anything wrong with Sixth Sense, it is a brilliant film, it is just at polar opposites of horror entities like House of 1000 Corpses!",House of 1000 Corpses
67,mstomaso,Rob Zombie's nightmare world realized on film,6,1 June 2005,"In my opinion, House of 1000 Corpses is a fan movie. Fans of both the horror genre and Rob Zombie are likely to love it. Though I do not count myself a fan of either, I do like both at times, and I am quite familiar with both. Those familiar with Rob Zombie are likely to be the only ones who completely 'get' this clever little film - appreciating its depraved sense of humor and nihilism. Zombie's themes are fairly consistent - evil (without the usual religious connotations and clichés), murder, sex, insanity, and stereotype ""hillbillies"". Zombie's world is not a place for people who are terribly concerned with reality, but, for Zombie himself, it seems to supply endless muse for a prolific and interesting commercial creativity.Two couples traveling across country and working on a book on bizarre roadside attractions stumble across a filling station / theme park run by a vaguely evil clown with a bad attitude - Captain Spaulding. Spaulding teaches them of a few local legends, including a mad surgeon who worked in a local insane asylum and came to be known as Dr. Satan for the grotesque surgical procedures he applied to mental patients in secret. They pick up a pretty blonde hitch-hiker on their way to see the tree where Dr Satan was hung, and run into some car problems, so the hitch-hiker invites them to her family house. The family, apparently headed by the phenomenally weird Karen Black, makes The Addams family look like the Brady Bunch.My narrative has described the first 20 minutes or so of the film, and at this point the film, much like RZ's songs, is so campy that it seems a straightforward horror comedy. However, once our protagonists are in ""the house"", the plot takes a decidedly more sinister spin, and never lets up from that point forward.This film successfully and entertainingly portrays all of RZ's themes in about the same proportions as his music. Of them all, sex is the least explored, and I, for one, am thankful for that. The film also walks a delicate line between Hannibal Lector grotesque art realism and supernatural forces. For example, at one point, one of the bad guys turns on a cassette player with low batteries so that the voice recorded on it sounds extra-satanic.If you have problems with blood and other bodily fluids, and utterly repulsive surgically induced variations on the human body, you might want to avoid this film. If you don't have any great objections to standard hardcore horror imagery, or if you like it, you might want to see this. It is masterfully visualized and does a much better job of making horror into art than the standard Hollywood horror fair. This is Rob Zombie's art, and he does it much better than most. This first major effort in film bodes well for his future use of the medium, and I will look forward to his next.",House of 1000 Corpses
68,ElijahCSkuggs,Great Horror film!!!,9,10 November 2004,"I, like many other Rob Zombie fans, were waiting for this film to be released for some time. But when the film did eventually hit theaters, I was to find that many horror ""fans"" and critics bashed the movie as being disappointing. Maybe the film could've been gorier, but the overall effect that Zombie pulled off was awesome! There's great music, some really hilarious dialogue (especially by Sid Haig and Sheri Moon Zombie), and the direction was really cool. I'm a big fan of the horror genre, and I was definitely not disappointed with the efforts of the cast and crew, they did a damn fine job, and I'm pumped for ""The Devil's Rejects."" Bill Moseley was the man and really funny, though campy, which was perfect. The DVD is really funny, with the cast explaining each option. Sid Haig is the man, and why he isn't in more films is way beyond my understanding. He has perfect comic timing, and can also play one hell of a creepy f**k. I'm glad he'll have a bigger part in the continuation. Grandpa Hugo, was perhaps the shining moment of the film; God bless and R.I.P. Dennis Fimple. The film just kicked butt, plain and simple.

There are a lot of references to horror movies, clichés are getting fun of with consequences, and there are no boundaries and restraint.The movie is really funny for the most part, but the twisted sometimes doesn't give you anything and the acting can get out of hand from the family brothers Otis (Bill Moseley) and Baby Firefly (Sheri Moon Zombie). (Both making the heavy lifting here). Weird edit starts as great and weird and new, and as the movie goes on, it gets kind of annoying or at least something of a way to stretch the movie into closer to 1h and 30m.Still, its entertaining and if you don't get offended easily, you should watch it.",House of 1000 Corpses

That's right! Gore! Lots of it!The film is not too inspired by originality, nor crafted for a mass audience - the film was held back from release for a good 3 or so years. Despite all this it is a very well made horror film that is Rob Zombie's tribute to what he loves most - a good movie scare-fest. Zombie even said that this was largely inspired by the 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and in watching this film you'll see that it is, in fact, very alike to the cult classic. A long dinner scene, hanging bodies, crazy hillbillies, and the like.However, Rob Zombie, who directs all of his band's music videos, has a good visual style and despite the film's unoriginality story-wise, he keeps things very interesting visually and musically. You know you've see this type of stuff before, but it isn't exactly stale due to the direction and genre fans are bound to love it for just that.

72,FilmOtaku,A fun film,4,28 April 2003,"Every time I mention to someone that I wasn't scared by this movie, they assume that I didn't like it.  I actually enjoyed this film.  Based on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre story line (with a few homages to the original, ""Get Grampa"") I may not have been scared but I thought it was a lot of fun. Zombie's script and direction are so campy that it is obviously delivered with a macabre ""wink"".  The acting was terrible, but believe it or not, it worked.  Had there been decent acting in the film it would have been out of place with the spirit in which I believe this film was made. 
The storyline is simple - four travelers, two boys & two girls stumble upon a family of homicidal freaks basically headed by Karen Black, who was a riotous example of Tammy Faye Baker gone horribly wrong.  I couldn't help but think of her other movies while I watched her on the screen, namely ""Burnt Offerings"" - a much scarier film, but her part was much more fun in this one.  Throw in some other outside characters, namely the fantastic ""Captain Spaulding"" (hilarious nod to the Marx Brothers) and you've got yourself a great cast. Although I think Zombie went overboard with his ""arty"" scenes (more suitable for a music video than a feature-length film in my humble opinion)I was pleasantly surprised with what he was able to do with the limited budget (and experience) he had.  All in all, an entertaining movie.  Not one that I would recommend to anyone who doesn't enjoy B-grade films, but not an unpleasant experience either.",House of 1000 Corpses

To tell you, I have never, ever seen anything on the big screen quite like this before. House of 1000 Corpses is a throwback to old school horror movies such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but succeeds much more. It is about  four friends who are driving cross country and are returning home after a long trip. Late on Halloween eve, they stop by a sleazy gas station and next to it is ""The Museum Of Monsters And Madmen"", owned by Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig). Interested and curious, they check it out and end up riding a ""murder ride"" inside the museum, learning a bit more about a local legend, Dr. Satan. They then head for the road and pick up a strange hitchiker, Baby (Sheri Moon). Their car then breaks down and Baby takes them to her house, not far up the road. They then are pulled into a world of torture and violence, as they are captured by a family of insane lunatics who want them dead.I have to say, congrats to Mr. Zombie! He has created a horror masterpiece that may become a historical landmark in film history such as others have done before. Zombie's directing debut is wonderful, and had some uniqe and unusual touches to make the film that much more bizarre and spooky, such as the split screen effect, I mean I haven't seen that used since the movie Carrie! The movie also had strange flashbacks and flashforwards. I recommend this movie to any horror fan! You won't be disappointed! I'm surprised it took 3 years to get a company to buy this movie!

74,Son_of_Mansfield,Movie of Little Enjoyment.,2,20 August 2003,"I wanted to like this movie. I took to Rob Zombie as soon as I heard Hellbilly Deluxe and I was sure this would be cool when I heard the title track on The Sinister Urge. Nothing grabbed at me. The names are a good example: Killer Karl, Tiny, Mother Firefly, and Doctor Satan. I am so scared. Leatherface is a cool, fitting name, because he wears human skin on his face which has become like leather, hence Leatherface. Tiny is tall, so the name should be funny? Rob Zombie's direction is flat, his script is filled with annoying characters, and the surprise ending leaves a lot to be desired. Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding is funny. When he lets loose with that giant grin, he reminds me of Jafar posing as a prisoner to get Aladdin's help, ear to ear. Rainn Wilson(Arthur from Six Feet Under), Tom Towles(Otis from Henry: Portrait of a serial Killer), Michael J. Pollard(Bonnie and Clyde, Roxanne), and Karen Black(Easy Rider, The Invisible Kid!) add to the usually stacked character actor stock of the horror homage picture. I am also ashamed to recognize the two girlfriends as the one from Milo and the one from One Hour Photo. Sheri Moon has a scary laugh, an annoying voice, and the expected nice body. The controversy surrounding this movie is just as limp as the movie(same goes with the other Lions Gate releases Natural Born Killers and O).

He's one creepy dude. But then the movie didn't have anything more to it than just the weird stylistic editing that's supposed to create a sense of confusion and madness to the characters. It got boring and was just the same thing all over again.The gore and violence were alright. Some were nasty, but most didn't move me.

76,Superunknovvn,Welcome to the world of Rob Zombie,5,17 July 2005,"Watching ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" reminded me a lot of that scene in ""Man On The Moon"" where Andy Kaufmann learns that he has cancer and decides to organize one big show that includes everything he loves and that he assumes people love (Santa Clause, a dance revue and lots of kitsch). ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" is like Rob Zombie's version of that show. He fought hard to produce his own movie and now he's putting in as much of what he likes as he can. He likes people getting their brains blown out, he likes hot psycho chicks, dark masses, clowns and freaks... it's all in there, but does Mr. Zombie's genuine love for the horror genre make him a gifted director/screenwriter? Not really.""House Of 1000 Corpses"" is neither scary, nor thrilling. It doesn't make you jump and it's not really funny. Zombie tried hard to put lines in the script that are as cool as the ones in ""From Dusk Til Dawn"", but he didn't really succeed. I would at least have expected the movie to be gory, but it's not even that.The storyline leaves you somewhat indifferent to the whole thing. Apparently there have been some major production difficulties, because the overall editing is very patchy (no, just because you put some hand held camera pieces in there doesn't make you the next Oliver Stone, Rob) and the final scene seemed awfully tacked on.What's left is Rob Zombie's passion and that's enough to help you make it through the 90 minutes one time.

78,acidburn-10,Doesn't really live up to the hype,5,13 February 2011,"Okay firstly I don't expect much from horror movies that are hyped up to the max, because they mostly turn out to be not very good and this one kinda falls into that category, this is by no means a terrible movie, it's just way too over the top and there were a lot of scenes that weren't necessary.The plot = A group of travellers, get lost and comes across a psychotic family. The movie was basically a mix of many different horror movies. There wasn't anything original here, but I wasn't expecting any originality and I'm sure Rob Zombie wasn't aiming for that anyway. It seems obvious he became inspired by several old school slashers, but he used way too many elements from each and well this movie kinda got lost in it all and became much too weird.This movie has absolutely no scares but there were scenes aimed to shock but in today's generation very little shocks the audience these days, trying to make the family seem scary and unhinged but they came across as trying to hard.The acting was OK, but none of the victims came across memorable and I couldn't tell them apart at times, they just fell into the background as the usual slasher movie fodder, but Sherri Moon's sexy as always and does unhinged well, I also liked her in the recent Halloween remakes, also directed by Rob Zombie I thought the best performance in the movie was by Sid Haig's character Spaulding and Bill Moseley could have been better though. And it was also nice to see genre favourite Karen Black as the mother of the crazy family, although she was underused.The positive aspects of this movie is that it had a fair amount of blood in it and the rock music was pretty cool, but with so much going on you'd probably wouldn't remember everything that went on in this movie, but the camera angles were interesting and nice to look at.All in all not a terrible movie just way too over the top and feels more like an extra long music video.",House of 1000 Corpses

First off, there are so many homages to the classic horror films such as the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Evil Dead"". If you don't recognize the homages, this film isn't for you. Secondly, the way it shot and lit, plus the disgusting yet artistic creations within the film, are just awesome. It creates a true sense of hopelessness that makes the film a must finish once you start it. Thirdly, like a good exploitation film (unlike the recent Machete), the film doesn't bother with explanations as to why you're seeing what you're seeing. Is it a supernatural horror film, the common slasher, truth is the genius of the movie makes this hard to discern. It's one of those rare success stories where visuals triumphed over story, namely because the visuals are so strong and nightmarish. Come to think of it, the whole film feels like a sadistic dream and I highly recommend it to horror fans.",House of 1000 Corpses
80,sashank_kini-1,A bold but failed effort by a first-timer who rights his wrongs in 'Devil's Rejects',3,27 August 2011,"Last year, I had made a short silly film for a National Graphic Championship held in India. It had all the makings of a film influenced by a variety of films, but lacking any credibility as a movie itself. Also came along highbrow language with all those heavy, 'refined' English which made the dialogues even more turgid, convoluted and not to forget unnecessary. It was enough to fetch us the second prize but I knew that it was miles away from a balanced film. It had absolutely no fluidity. The same thing can be said about promising horror-gore director ROb Zombie's 'House of 1000 corpse' which struggles a lot to find that balance, but the director-writer rights it with his next film 'The Devil's Rejects'.Rob's first film can be called an experimental attempt of self-understanding and thank God he realized he wasn't made to make such 'Tarantino-Coppola' influenced films. His next film 'Devil's Rejects' is awesome, but this one's a disaster, for sure. It's absolutely devoid of thrills, chills, gore and rather looks cartoony and ludicrous. The carnival-themed atmosphere fails to bring any scares, mainly because the director is trying so hard and not letting loose. Everything is overdone in HOTC, be it the homages, the slow-mo effect, the side-angle shots, the color-saturation, the stock footage etc. Most of it is dispensable, especially the horrid stock footage which makes no sense and reminds me of the game Batman Arkham Asylum, except that in the game in looks cool. Also, why the naked characters I can't comprehend; its so silly to have naked women romping around without any purpose. Another no-no is the Coen-brothers inspired slo-mo shots, which derail the momentum of the film and the shock value badly.The side-angle shots, focusing on the eyes are just plain boring and seen mainly in Japanese horror. The homages are plain fillers, making the movie verbose and inaccessible. I would like to add that even though I was highly impressed when I had seen Pulp Fiction for the first time at the age of 15, I was frankly disappointed on my second viewing about two months back. Its a good film but relies heavily on homages and lacks the feeling of oneness and sincerity. I personally prefer the Kill Bill series to PF because KB is an improved and stylized version of Japanese slasher-action films. The same thing happens with HOTC, except than in this movie scenes have been pasted from old films- I could recognize one, 'The Wolf' a great werewolf film of the 40s that I had seen last year. The abundant use or rather misuse of color in the film, with screen losing color in some scenes, becoming pink and blue is just grating. Also the footage of serial killers is humorous rather than disturbing.Coming to the verbosity of the film, I feel DR is a very self-indulgent and self-important film, because of which the audience's needs are completely ignored. Everyone sounds artificial, be it the first scene where the two guys are chatting about their friends or Karen Black's first scene, the Halloween celebration, Baby Firefly's Monroe act and her maniacal giggling and Otis' chat with the girls. Nearly the whole film is lame, unlike 'Devil's Rejects' which is profane and bad-ass and yet simple in its language. Also characters are more believable in The Devil's Rejects. When the guy says 'The Ride was awesome' in this film, he was just saying what was in the script.The film is badly acted, but the funny part is that nearly everyone thinks they've done a great job, and so they continue with their bad acting. Karen Black's the worst, sounding comical and pretentious. I liked Leslie Easterbrook's performance in DR, which was salacious and vulgar. Sid Haig plays a clown and he's certainly not disturbing, though he tries to be. Bill Moseley is like a heavy-metal loving bully rather than a cold-blooded, egregious and remorseless killer. His pep talks with the girls don't work at all, and I was surprised at how weak this performance was compared to the one in DR. But again, its Rob Zombie who's to be blamed. Sheri tries a lot to get freakishness in her role but she sounds like Harley Quinn, an interesting but caricature of herself. The four kids are plain horrible. At least the guys try to get the late-70's attitude, but the girls are straight out of Final Destination. All the dead bodies in the movies made me wonder whether this was The Evil Dead or Braindead that I was watching, because there seemed to be no real gore in them. It had a supernatural feeling rather than real dead bodies feeling- and that's a sore disappointment. Also Tiny was like some stupid sidekick that didn't matter. And you know how scary tall ugly men can be if with the right directors. The music is excessively redundant and over-played and I can understand why. But it has an adverse impact in HOTC, while setting the right tone in DR. The final 15 minutes are particularly exasperating and overdone in all aspects. The ending lame and the question mark cringe-worthy.All in all, HOTC can be called a valiant first-effort, since most of the horror directors don't even try now. Alas, its a failed effort. My rating: 3/10",House of 1000 Corpses
81,Bogmeister,Zombie robs from the Grave of the '70's,5,5 August 2005,"Rob Zombie made it known that he was emulating the grisly psycho horror films of the seventies with this unsettling retro rehash of bloody murder. You have to be familiar with that period to understand the style he's copying here. Mostly, Zombie seems to rebel against conventionality and embraces innovation in creating this film. Standard storytelling seems to go out the window at regular intervals and an unnerving mood takes over. It doesn't always work and comes across as slapdash, uncertain. I'm beginning to think the seventies really were the best period for certain films, mostly horror, sci-fi and thrillers. I used to think I felt this way because that's when I first began to see films in earnest, but now I'm not so sure. Many others, including Zombie, have the same opinion, regardless.This obviously, more than anything, imitates the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre film from 1974, including the plot (group of traveling young people stumble across the most depraved family in the state). Sid Haig, very active in films of the early seventies, usually in the role of a villain, returns to good form here as Capt.Spaulding, who runs a local horror show and dresses in clown make-up. The strange & perverse family here, which includes momma Karen Black (also in her prime during the seventies), indulge in pointless sadism with their victims - at least the family in TCM(74) had a rationale, cannibalism. The film continues to follow TCM's pattern through to the end, as a final female victim experiences hellish, unbelievable visions concerning the revelation of 'Dr.Satan,' a local legend which turns out to be true (I think - unless she's hallucinating). You don't really follow a plot by this point, but just absorb the nightmarish images Zombie throws at you, to be digested later. I would've rated this higher if it hadn't so blatantly copied the classic TCM(74).",House of 1000 Corpses
82,WriterDave,"Well, Shuck My Corn!",6,17 August 2003,"For about the first thirty minutes of this film I thought, ""Golly, if the characters would just break out into song and dance more (and one character actually does a Betty Boop ditty), we could have ourselves the next 'Rocky Horror Picture Show'!"" The film is so slapdash, jokey, and over-the-top weird, that I found myself laughing more than anything (especially at the very memorable Captain Spaulding character).But then night falls on Halloween, and for about twenty minutes, we get the all out creep-fest we had been promised for so long after so many release delays and MPAA controversies. Zombie creates some truly shocking and horrifying set pieces here. There are a series of scenes that really just might be ""the most shocking tale of carnage ever seen"". From the redneck psychos in costumes traipsing across the field, to the chasing/stabbing scene, to the lowering of the coffin into the well, to the catacombs of horror beneath the wheat and corn, I was totally glued to the screen. Unfortunately, the ending is lame, and then you are reminded how ""funny"" the beginning was, and you begin to wonder, ""WHAT THE F---?""Rob Zombie clearly thought the apex of horror film making came in the 1970's with ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" but he also was equally influenced by another 70's horror icon, Dario Argento. Zombie's images are crisp, bright, and colorful, making the gore seem all the more weird. There are many other homages to be be found that should please true horror fans. On some Halloween night in the near future I can imagine some discount theaters doing a midnight showing, and people will dress up like Baby and Captain Spaulding, and they'll laugh and throw-up and bring their kids and act out scenes in front of the screen, and will have an old-fashioned good time.An aside: Did anyone else thing Baby looked and sounded like Amy Poehler from SNL?",House of 1000 Corpses
83,LoneWolfAndCub,"Over-Hyped, but still OK",6,24 February 2006,"Before anyone decides to see this movie, here's a word of advice, don't go in expecting this to be 'The Most Shocking Tale Of Carnage', because it isn't. This movie is not very gory or violent as people make it out to be. This doesn't mean it's a bad movie, but it is disappointing when you think 'this is gonna be so disturbing and gory, I can't wait.' This movie has a few scenes with blood in it, but they are brief, and no where near as shocking as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre or other 70's horror films which this is meant to be like. Not to say it isn't entertaining.This movie has a typical 70's plot. Four young teens are travelling the back-roads of America. They hear about Dr. Satan, a local legend. They want to try and find him, instead, they get captured by a family of sadistic freaks. Horror ensues.Rob Zombie (Director) is homaging most of the horror films from the 70's and 80's. Films like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes etc. are all being homaged. As I said before, it isn't as disturbing or gory as these movies, but there are a few scenes which might make some squirm and feel discomfort. The torture that goes on is sometimes horrible to watch. The family are truly sick, and that helps us root for the teens, who unfortunately, don't have luck on their side.This is certainly one of the better horror films of 2000+. 3/5.",House of 1000 Corpses

Here, he creates a bloody cross between ""Freaks"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""  With all the blood, guts and profanity, this is not a movie for everyone!  The best performance is probably by Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding, one of the scariest clowns in movie history.  The imagery is nightmarish, but well-crafted.  A lot from the movie will haunt the viewer, from the story of Dr. Satan, to the sick rituals at the Firefly household.

It is a mess.. The entire film is made up of gruesome gore images and sadistic torture scenes... cut as if it were a hard core music video.... I still cant figure out what the plot was... and the cast of people playing the hapless victims is so anonymous that I often couldnt figure out which of the two dingbat actresses I was watching get tortured in this scene or that scene...

88,baileycrawly,Don't Pick Up Hitchhikers!,8,8 July 2020,"In his first full-length film, Rob Zombie gives us the first glimpse into his mind in this twisted horror gem that, for some unknown reason, was attacked by critics - with a Rotten Tomatoes percentage sitting at a measly 20.This film is a love letter from Zombie to the horror community. There are a lot of homages to horror movies that he's openly said in the past were inspirational to him (Texas Chainsaw Massacre being a big one) while adding his own unique style to the stories. It creates an interesting, albeit highly odd and uncomfortable, viewing experience that practically demands multiple viewings.It's very intelligently shot, with a regular use of split screens/mirroring, sudden zooming in, mock-35mm film prints, grainy, low-quality found footage style video, and the use of inverted/negative colours. It's a surreal experience, but these decisions are what made it so much fun.The writing and score is on par for what you can expect from the genre; it's fairly basic, but it doesn't need to be anything more. It's a perfectly satisfying experience without going over the top. It's not afraid to be funny when it needs to be (if you see text on any character's shirt, read it) and it gets tense when Zombie wants it to. Some of the music decisions are a little odd, but in a movie that borders on the avant-garde, one has to wonder if that was the plan from the beginning.This isn't an instant gratification movie, in both the overall plot and in individual scenes. Rob Zombie, being a horror fan, knows the formula of a horror movie and is just comfortable enough on this film to play with that formula and exploit it enough to catch longtime horror fans off guard. It's a weird, shocking, disgusting journey through the mind of a brilliant man who is kind enough to share it with us. This is a definite recommendation.",House of 1000 Corpses
89,nitzanhavoc,"The plot/story is boring, not compelling, and simply bad. And you won't even remember to mind!",7,7 April 2013,"Well, I've always been a devout fan of the Horror genre, and a big fan of Rob Zombie's music. I also really loved his featured art in the Beavis & Butthead film. So not long ago I've asked myself - how come I've never seen any of Rob's films?! So, better late than never, I've got my hands on House of 1000 Corpses.Now I've seen every kind and sub-genre of the Horror genre, and still I have no idea how to even begin describing this film. Is it a homage/tribute to earlier Horror films from the 70's? Is it a gore film? Is it Comedy Horror? Is it a parody/satyr? Is it torture-porn? Is it the waking nightmare of a sick, sadistic maniacal mind? Is it even a film?! The answer to all these questions would have to be something like ""well no, not exactly, but actually kind of, heck f*** me if I know!"" The only way I could tag this film would be ""Rob Zombie"". Had zombie made long short-film music videos (like Michael Jackson RIP) - they would have probably resembled this film.Still, I'll try to review it the way I always do by examining all the regular aspects... The screenplay and story are, well, actually of no importance. The main gist isn't at all original, even if it was written 10 years ago. Then again - the story itself was never meant to be the original part. The acting is excellent, especially by the psychotic Firefly family (much respect for Sheri Moon Zombie who played the psycho-hottie almost as if she wasn't acting at all). The shooting, cinematography and soundtrack are all originally horrific and very artistically done. The little short cut-scenes (of sorts) were also a great addition.All in all - this film was sick and genius at the same time. This might be the only film ever where I hated the plot and haven't at all been compelled by the story, but have still enjoyed the film. Rob Zombie, in a way, is the Tarantino of Horror films, and deserves a genre of his own.",House of 1000 Corpses

Then one day I bought this movie on sheer impulse, bracing for the worst....the worst never came.Instead I got what appears to be a movie straight from a time capsule. The movie looked like an 80's horror movie, only made in 2000 (It took 3 years to release the movie because they feared it would get a NC-17 rating).Everything had an older horror movie feel to it. And it's not just because the movie takes place in the 70's. The characters were stereotypical horror movie fodder. 4 Young adults, Jerry, Denise, Mary, and Bill are out seeing roadside oddities for a book they're writing. They soon stumble across Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen, and decide to go on a little hunt to see if a legend is real, but they get more than they bargained for. The movie is based heavily off of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But don't get me wrong, it adds its own elements to make it unique.Captain Spaulding was probably my favorite character, played by Sid Haig. His lines were so funny and random, yet well-placed and witty. Otis Driftwood was well played by Bill Moseley (who ironically appears in TCM 2 as Chop Top). Baby Firefly was played quite tastefully by Sheri Moon, Rob Zombie's wife. There were some excellent scenes. The camera-work and music really made this movie unique. I recommend this to horror fans, particularly fans of TCM. 9/10.",House of 1000 Corpses
93,Gafke,"Ugly, Obscene & Vile",7,15 September 2003,"The same things were said about ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" when it first premiered, and yet TCM is now part of Classic Horror History.Four young adults on a road trip, gathering information about odd roadside attractions, run into the weird and obscene Captain Spaulding, who owns a gas station/fried chicken stand/murder ride. After tempting them with the local legend of a serial killer called Dr. Satan, the kids go off in search of further information. They stop to pick up a pretty hitchhiker, which proves to be a fatal mistake, for the hitchhiker is Baby Firefly, youngest member of the deranged Firefly clan, who enjoy kidnapping and torturing random people. The lucky ones die quickly. The ones who live are eventually turned over to Dr. Satan, still alive and well and living in an underground House of 1000 Corpses.Rob Zombie is very obviously paying homage to the splatter films of the 70s with his ""1000 Corpses"" In-jokes abound, and the references to TCM, Halloween, The Hills Have Eyes and many others are not difficult to spot. This is the blackest of comedies and not for everyone. I found several scenes (the stabbing of the ""rabbit"", the torture of Jerry and ""Who's Your Daddy?"" in particular) very difficult to watch. However, the film itself is technically brilliant: the candy-bright neon colors used throughout, and the contrasting grainy 8mm footage slipped in here and there, were intoxicating. So too were the performances of Sid Haig and Bill Moseley. The character of Dr. Satan could have used more screen time, but managed to bring a ""Whoa, cool!"" from my lips nevertheless. This film is an exercise in dread and anxiety, yet never really takes itself seriously. It's like watching an autopsy performed by the Marx Brothers. It's sickening and hysterical and may only be appreciated by hardcore horror film addicts and/or Zombie's die-hard fans.So, you ask, did I like it or not? Yeah, I did. I liked it the way I like a really good dinner that makes me vomit a few hours later. And if that metaphor makes no sense to you, you may wish to skip this film.",House of 1000 Corpses
94,christian123,Generic And Not Very Scary,4,21 May 2005,"House of 1000 Corpses is a below average horror flick that's more disturbing then scary. When car problems force cross-country travelers Jerry, Denise, Mary and Bill to stop for a break, the foursome pull into the gas station-cum-museum on the night of October 30, 1977--All Hallows Eve. Though most of the group is wary of the stranger they find within, Bill is enthralled, for he is penning a book of offbeat roadside attractions. When Spaulding invites them to take in the Museum's premiere attraction--the Murder Ride--they embark into a world of darkness where ""Life and death are meaningless and pain is God."" But for these four travelers, this strange ride is just the beginning. The plot may not be original but it does sound like it has some potential. It didn't work out so well as the film isn't very good. I was expecting a good horror film that would be fun to watch but I didn't really get that. Rob Zombie directed and wrote the film and he apparently watched a lot of old horror films. The film just felt like a collection of old horror clichés. House of 1000 Corpses also gets really ridiculous at times and the film seems like it wants to achieve cult status, which it probably will. The acting was average with some performances being scary and others being terrible. The best was Bill Moseley and his performance was effective. The film is very disturbing as some scenes and images were defiantly very creepy. Its also very gory but that doesn't mean its scary. It also sometimes goes over the top on the gore. The running time is only 88 minutes long though it does get boring at times. There were a lot of horror flicks that were released in 2003 and this one is probably at the bottom of the list. There's a sequel coming out soon that I'll probably end up watching and hopefully they will improve. In the end, this is a predictable, unoriginal horror flick that's worth skipping.

Of course if you see it all too seriously you will recognize tons of things you've seen before, especially The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but this movie wanted to be a hommage to those classics in the first place.

If you like those, I can pretty much promise you that you'll appreciate Rob's effort here.Although it does include elements of a teeny-bopper horror flick, it is done in the coolest way possible and features an ultra bad-ass soundtrack and a nihilistic ending that comes as a surprise.For those of us who have been into the exploitation stuff for years and can appreciate the Italian stuff, the Japanese goodies and all the old school American slashers, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is a rad flick.

The plot is pasted together from other horror movies (mostly Texas Chainsaw Massacre). With this said, that does not make it a bad movie or one that I did not throughly enjoy. The plot revolves around a group of young people (big surprise there) who are traveling around the back roads looking for out of the way tourist things. They stumble upon Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) and the story of Dr. Satan. From there is gets rather expectantly weird and unusual. By far the best thing about this movie is the visuals. The colors and locations are just so captivating (I love the P*ssy Liquor and Captain Spaulding's place). This movie has the usual array of strange and psychotic characters and their equally strange behaviors and criminal tendencies.

That's great and all, but it's also lacking in everything that makes a horror film good -- scares and most of all, any sort of fun factor. This is not an entertaining film; unless your idea of entertainment is on par with a snuff film.  The film marvels in its graphic cruelness toward its characters, there is not one character to root for or any sort of protagonist. The film is loaded with sickos, who are suppose to be funny, while at the same time they are cruel and psychotic.

However, let's look at the positive first: Sid Haig, Bill Moseley and other actors make the cut in a cast that does not hold too much on the female side. The aesthetic at the beginning helps a bit with nods to well-known movies and a lovable era. The problem begins with reversing the old cannibal hillbilly tradition that has been around since the beginning of the gore era. And here comes the problem: a great actor cannot work miracles with a bad script. Finally the story is given in such a way that the few turns of the screw respect even the smallest cliché.

101,Jacques98,Violent nostalgia.,5,1 January 2009,"The hypocrisy and inconsistency of critics (professional and nonprofessional) never fails to amaze me. It's become apparent over the years that the majority of them only see flaws in the movies they want to see flaws in, and ignore the exact same flaws in movies they're supposed to like. That is the only way I can contemplate the countless negative reviews of House of 1000 Corpses whatsoever. Sin City and Natural Born Killers both get critically acclaimed and viewer-loved because of their ""groundbreaking"" aesthetic. Fine. I can understand that. But if that's all you judge those films on, why isn't House of 1000 Corpses in that list? The visual aesthetic and grungy directing were as good, if not better, than those movies I just listed. At visual level, House of 1000 Corpses is a work of dark artwork. There is not a single scene that doesn't drip with awesome (and even ""cool"") visuals and art direction.House of 1000 Corpses, a lot like The Evil Dead before it, tries hard to be the be-all-end-all horror movie by mashing every aspect of the genre together and spitting them out in an awesome, disturbing mess. Does it succeed? Somewhat. House of 1000 Corpses is cliché, and it knows that: embraces that. While countless other 70s horror mash-ups (Wrong Turn, Hatchet, etc.) try to relive that old nostalgia, they all fail because they just repeat one subgenre and and add absolutely nothing to the formula for the new generation. This gets old FAST. Instead of wasting millions of dollars on a copy/paste job of your favorite 70s horror movie, why not, you know, take the same feeling and put it with today's style? Rob Zombie understood that, thank God, and that is why House of 1000 Corpses stands as the single best 70s rehash of all time. Though it is 100% unoriginal, there isn't any other movie like it.All of the acting works well for the movie. The characters are all very interesting. People complain the leads are just flat characters, but, again, that's the point. If House of 1000 Corpses slowed down the pace to give us some cliché, generic backstory about the leads having a daughter with cancer, it would ruin the entire movie. It would take the attention off the actual horror elements. Likewise, I constantly hear people say this is just a rip-off of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and they're right. But it also rips-off hundreds of other slasher movies as well. Again, it's the point, people.If you're not a hardcore horror fan, don't even try to watch this. You'll either get bored or simply won't understand what the genius behind it is. This was made by one horror fan to other horror fans, and that's all there is to it. It's a genre piece.The one thing that disappointed me was the lack of gore. Simply put, there isn't any gore at all. I can't even so much as remember a single bloody scene in the entire film. This is something I've hated about all Rob Zombie films: they're all so ridiculously tame on the gore front.But, my overall opinion of House of 1000 Corpses is very positive. The aesthetic drives the film, as it's meant to. So why my low score? Because even though unoriginality was the point, the lack of anything truly new here was very unsatisfying.5/10",House of 1000 Corpses
102,TheRedDeath30,Don't Be a Hater,10,15 October 2016,"There are a lot of haters for this movie. There are, also, plenty of people who worship at its' throne and I am proud to say that I fall into the latter category. Let's just get out of the way that I am NOT a Rob Zombie fanatic. I don't like his music. I was always a little annoyed by his music videos. I pretty much hate his HALLOWEEN films. I do absolutely love the films about the Firefly Family though.This movie is depraved, sick, psychotic and nightmarish and I don't use any of those words with negativity. If you want bland horror, there are plenty of CONJURING ripoffs out there for you. This movie can unnverve you. Many hate and complain of the cutaways, the film clips that are intercut, the odd little side paths that interweave. I think all of it adds to the quality of this movie. Much like Captain Spaulding's Murder Ride, the whole movie is a walk through a psychotic haunted house. Yes, a lot of it feels like a video DJ playing at a Halloween party. If you hate that, I get it. I can understand that it's not everyone's bag, especially if you are of an older generation, but I love it and won't apologize for it.We open at Captain Spaulding's, a gas station/ roadside attraction. We meet our main characters, but also one of the best horror icons of the last 20 years, in Spaulding. He's foulmouthed, funny and scary as well. He takes our kids on the Murder Ride, which really sets the tone, as well as the plot. Zombie has a lot of influences, most he is readily willing to admit. He rips off THE OLD DARK HOUSE? Sure, he shows clips of it right in the movie. His aesthetic is pulled from Tobe Hooper? Absolutely, this ride is every bit a love letter to THE FUNHOUSE.Our introduction to the Firefly family is just as memorable. It's Halloween night and its seem they intend to have a talent show. We know that something isn't right, but it's not yet entirely obvious to our main characters, until Baby's Betty Boop act sets off a jealous girlfriend and all hell begins to break loose.From here, the movie goes all over the place. I understand that this is another major complaint, but it's one of the things I love. It's a pastiche of scenes and each character and villain is allowed to shine and play out their own act. Again, I bring in the murder ride metaphor. It's like a walk through the most twist haunted house you've ever seen. Not every scene is connected, but each is terrifying and the end result is one of absolute terror. Otis, Tiny, Dr Satan, The Professor. These are all amazing characters that will bring fear and absolutely memorable enough to become iconic. The fact that they are continually made into action figures, t-shirts, posters and masks is proof of the lasting legacy of this movie. Yes, there are plenty of haters, but walk into any horror convention and see how many HOTC shirts and cosplayers you see. Plenty of horror comes and goes, to be forgotten forever.

104,darkreignn,Abandon all hope,7,2 November 2021,"It's been a long time since I've seen a horror film as relentlessly bleak as ""House of 1000 Corpses."" Rob Zombie's directorial debut, ""1000 Corpses"" is a testament to Zombie's signature grindhouse style that he so loves to include in virtually all of his films. However, whereas in certain movies of his this stylistic decision may feel out of place (""Halloween"" 2008, for example), here Zombie's creative choices feel suited to the nasty, grungy, dirty world he has decided to create.""House of 1000 Corpses"" is a mean film, no doubt about it. IMDb summarizes this movie's plot by saying, ""Two young couples traveling across the backwoods of Texas searching for urban legends of murder end up as prisoners of a bizarre and sadistic backwater family of serial killers."" In my honest opinion, the words ""bizarre"" and ""sadistic"" do not accurately depict the horrors conveyed upon the characters in this film. It seems to me that Zombie had an active dislike toward the characters that he thought up because all of them go through trials and tribulations that I literally wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. Characters are mutilated, dismembered, scalped, eaten alive, and turned into fish-men - and that's just a small taste of what you can expect people to go through in this film. In a way, it's almost impressive how consistently and constantly miserable this movie is in terms of what it forces its characters to endure. The horror comes from this, and from the sheer insanity of what you're witnessing on screen. It's truly disturbing viewing - that said, it's also a whole hell of a lot of fun.If there's one word I would never use to describe Zombie, that word would be ""subtle."" No doubt, that can be a hindrance when creating films, but in ""House of 1000 Corpses,"" his signature brash style of filmmaking works wonders in upping the entertainment value. Nuts and over-the-top, and don't quite cut it when describing this movie - perhaps bonkers? Sid Haig is in this movie as a crazy clown man (there's really no other way to describe him), and he completely steals the show when he's on screen. His wide smile, crazy eyes, and unpredictable mannerisms make him a joy to watch - seriously, I had a smile on my face every time he appeared. Karen Black, Sheri Moon Zombie, and Bill Moseley also add this same air of unpredictability, infecting the film with a contagious sort of energy that can really take hold of viewers. Even as what's occurring on screen is some of the most horrible things ever put to film, the ludicrous nature of the characters add much needed levity.""House of 1000 Corpses"" disturbed me, which is typically what I want my horror films to do. It harkens back to classic slashers while adding enough new blood to revitalize this tired genre. Zombie depicts violence as what it is - terrifying - while keeping in mind that people want to be entertained when watching a horror film, and entertain he does. Packed with memorable characters and silly encounters, this movie will make you laugh as much as it makes you want to cover your eyes. Sure, this can be quite a depressing film based on its subject matter, and I do commend Zombie for making a bleak, dark horror movie. That said, I'd be lying if I didn't say I had a great time while watching this, and I imagine many horror fans will too.",House of 1000 Corpses
105,rparham,"Don't visit this ""House""",2,22 July 2005,"House of 1000 Corpses aspires to be an homage to horror films of the 1970s but instead transforms into what is essentially a bad parody of them. Written and directed by rock music star Rob Zombie, a self-professed fan of 1970s horror films, House of 1000 Corpses hits almost every major beat of a film from that era, and the final result is horrifying, if only because you wonder how anyone would have thought this was a good film when it was greenlit.House of 1000 Corpses leaves no stone unturned in it's attempt to emulate films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (it's closest cousin), Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes, and many more. There isn't barely a shred of originality to be found, as almost every major plot element, scene and character is swiped from some other (better) film. And when assembled, House of 1000 Corpses proves that the whole is not merely the sum of it's parts.The plot (what there is of one) is minimal: Four teenagers driving cross-county through the US, Jerry (Chris Hardwick), Mary (Jennifer Jostyn), Denise (Erin Daniels) and Bill (Rainn Wilson), stop off at a gas station run by the rather foul and unsavory Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) which happens to also feature a low-budget theme park style ride called the ""Murder Ride,"" the main attraction of which is local legend Dr. Satan, who experimented on individuals and was eventually hanged at a nearby location. Intrigued by this story, the kids set out to find Dr. Satan's impromptu gallows, only to end up with a flat tire in some rather spooky backwoods environments. A hitchhiker they picked up, Baby (Sherri Moon, Rob Zombie's real-life wife), offers them shelter at her nearby house, which is inhabited by her mother, known as Mother (Karen Black), Grandpa (Dennis Fimple), a towering giant named Tiny (Matthew McGrory), her monosyllabic brother Rufus (Robert Allan Mukes) and her other brother, Otis (Bill Moseley). After a rather strange dinner and stage show put on by the family, the youngsters attempt to flee their hosts, only to find themselves captured, bound and placed through various mental and physical tortures at the hands of the insane Firefly clan.Pretty much everything in House of 1000 Corpses is overcooked. The actors playing the family flail about wildly, spouting out clichéd dialogue that is supposed to cause us to feel unease, but instead only elicits stares of incredulity. It would be helpful if the victims were even the least bit three-dimensional, but that is not the case. The four teens are cardboard cutouts, providing us with nary a single sympathetic character. So when the various acts of torture start, lacking any connection to anybody, we are just watching endless scenes of depravity that is so over the top, it is not the least bit scary and instead comes across as an act of a director that seems to believe that the weirdness of what we are watching alone can make some kind of an impact. It doesn't. Anyone familiar with the films Zombie is aping can see his source material shining through, but what he has placed on screen is so overdone, so amped up as to be almost comical, in a rather morbid way. Zombie is trying so hard to live up to his childhood icons that he loses sight about what made those films good in the first place.The film lurches along from scene to scene, and features a subplot where one of the victim's fathers (Harrison Young), an ex-cop, goes looking for them, that seems to attempt to try to interject some seriousness into the proceedings, but fails miserably with cliché dialog and some rather questionable acting. Zombie also edits his film with cutaways shot on video or post-processed to give us glimpses into other scenes in the film, often as counterpoint to the main scene, but these prove to be simply distracting and suggest that Zombie is attempting to be ""arty"" but is instead merely annoying.The only element of the film that works is it's opening sequence, set in Captain Spaulding's store, where Sid Haig chews the scenery mightily and provides a bit of black humor to the proceedings. He pops up again here and there, and is again diverting, but it's not enough to save the film. Almost all the other actors are just going through the motions, bringing little memorable to the screen.With a title like House of 1000 Corpses, you would imagine there is some gore to be found, and that goes without saying. While not quite the gross-out fest of Hellbound: Hellraiser II, House of 1000 Corpses isn't for those with a weak constitution, especially towards the end of the film, where Zombie pushes his plot and effects to a new level of ridiculousness without a point.It's obvious that Zombie has an affection for the genre, and it is possible that he can create an effective horror film if he would simply pull it back five or six notches and assemble something a little more realistic and low-key. As it stands, House of 1000 Corpses would classify as one of the worst attempts at a horror film in years, and considering some of what I have seen, that is saying a lot.",House of 1000 Corpses
106,lthseldy1,Not a bad movie at all,7,22 April 2003,"I didn't know what to expect in this movie being that it was directed by a musician (Rob Zombie at that) but I was quite empressed.  I liked the fact that the movie circled around the carnival, circus atmosphere because clowns and places that have to do with clowns have that ""erie"" feeling around it anyway.  I liked the list of characters and I thought that they just brought the movie to much enjoyment, Karen Black whom I haven't seen acting in awhile and a few others I recognize in previous horror movies.  There were a few flaws though that the movie could have done without like the annoying blond in the movie that I wished were killed off early in the movie instead of the victims and the aliens which lead to a switch from horror to sci-fi and the underground scene of the zombies going after one of the victims after escaping near death in a coffin.  The gore was there and the music added much to the gore.  the sex was there also along with the gore which made it a packaged deal in a good horror film.  I recomend this one to fans of horror and I think Zombie did a good job with this one.  Can't wait till it comes out on video, I'm buying it.",House of 1000 Corpses

108,oneflewovertheapocalypse,"Rob Zombie could be horror's worst nightmare, and not in a good way",3,15 January 2005,"I had high hopes for Rob Zombie's directorial Debut as House of a 1000 Corpses did look like an quite enjoyable horror film from seeing the trailer and for some parts of the movie it is. Half way through though you ask yourself ""have I seen this before""? Because it really is a film that has taken on Texas Chainsaw Massacre and tried to make it better and failed miserably. The atmosphere of the film feels just like Chainsaw Massacre and the parts which were thought up by Zombie weren't that good at all. The first 20 minutes intrigued me a lot with Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding but after that I wasn't that impressed as it was the big borrowing from Texas chainsaw Massacre that really bothered me. I think Rob Zombie has a glittering career ahead of him as it wasn't a badly shot film at all but it fails to deliver. Zombie's use of camera shots are quite interesting to watch but I think it's more make the audience feel uneasy which works on some level but doesn't at the same time.I would love to talk about how great and original this film is, as I had high hopes for it because of all the hype it generated upon its release but you just can't because Zombie does a great job of making it obvious he is borrowing off other films and makes it hard for the audience to judge it as his own film. Parts which I won't mention do have some originality which you have to give it him but because of the previous scenes it does stick with you. With Rob Zombie directing as well I thought he might not make the lead character be a hot looking girl and try and concentrate on another lead instead but he has gone with the typical conventions showing us that though it's his first film Zombie is not taking us into any new and improving ways of the Horror genre.Maybe I am making a mistake. For all I know this could be exactly what Rob Zombie intended for his film to be like which I think it is, a collection of fan boy moments from his favourite films rolled up into one movie. I do look forward to Zombie's next film as this was his first and there is plenty of effort thrown in but that doesn't mean its any good, in this case it isn't but what can we expect from his first feature film.",House of 1000 Corpses

It was similar to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" with many more killing characters and bodies. One very interesting character was Captain Spaulding via Sid Haig.

112,patrickfilbeck,The Movie of 1000 Attempts,3,15 August 2021,"Rob Zombie's film debut and the first part of the Firefly trilogy tries really hard to be a cult film. From the Museum of Monsters and Madmen to the incestuous murderer family and above all with 1000 references to classic horror films as a means of genre success, Zombie has packed this film so full that the attempt seems inflationary. Of course there is an approach to funny ideas and an approach to funny dialogues and also very explicit slasher splatter, but that's about it. Only the approach remains. In a sense, the movie is a processing of Zombies Marylin Manson feud, a processing that ultimately does not benefit him. Zombie involuntarily confirms that he lacks depth that other artists in the horror genre - and in the very absurd and twisted variants of the artistic world - possess, be it in music or cinematic. He frankly packs in clichés, as if it were worthless, even in a story intended as an homage, to rethink certain references - for the sake of the film's artistic ambition. The most fun is to focus on the details, yes, to look, to hunt for them. Meanwhile, the main story seems rather slow and forced. All in all, not one of the worst horror films of all time, but clearly not a good one either.",House of 1000 Corpses
113,plasticanimalz,A Really Really Bad (should have been) Straight to Video Film,2,4 May 2013,"I have to say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I've seen more films than most. I am a fan of various types of horror films and this was a pointless exploration of a tired theme. Nothing new to offer other than one of the first entries in what would become the 'gore porn' phase, or slump, which was the past decade of horror films. It's a stereotypical, played out theme of, 'kids on a road trip get lost.' Everything about the film from the beginning reminds you of a very bad, straight to video film by an inexperienced director, and by actors who have had little to no experience. The characters stumble upon some ridiculous hillbillies within the first 5 minutes. They go back to their house, carnage ensues, the end. Though, we did not stick around 'til the end. There was virtually no story other than the paper-thin plot, every level of production in the film looked horrible, was executed poorly, the film was not even remotely scary, and was all just a weak, transparent set-up to get to the torture and gore.Anyone actually comparing this film as meant to be funny or in some way compared to 'Evil Dead,' is completely oblivious. 'Evil Dead' is actually scary, humorous, clever, and original. Not to mention it has engaging characters like Bruce Campbell. 'House of 1000 Corpses' had none of those elements. 'Cabin in the Woods' was clearly an homage to 'Evil Dead' and was effective in its tribute and still had plenty of its own original twists, was witty, well written, well executed, and every level of production was on-point.I have friends who went to Rob Zombie's parties at Comic-Con and said he had creepy, submissive, mutilation demonstrations done by woman. So, I honestly don't think Rob's material has some underlying meaning other than he gets off on torture and gore. Thus, why the term 'gore porn' was created because it is clear that the objective of the director is not to create an actual horror film but something quite a bit darker and personal to himself. Eli Roth being another example of this tired, pointless trend. In fact, I just saw a movie based on real events of a serial killer who was into making 'movies' about his victims that revolved around pretty much all the same themes of Rob Zombie and Eli Roth's movies.It just seems that guys should find healthier ways of dealing with women rather than creating these types of films to deal with and 'vent' their misogyny and narcissism. In the end it's really just a sad reflection of them.",House of 1000 Corpses

Sid Haig(Spaulding) was great & Bill Moseley (Otis) was brutal & awesome. Sheri Moon(Baby) was somewhat annoying with her 'Evil Dead' chick laugh & talking sometimes as a baby. I dont know why people(reviewers) constantly pick on the 4 strangers that enter the house. They dont act badly. Jerry was hilarious. Denise was the chick from ONE HOUR PHOTO. I loved the split screens & that filtering from blurry images to the normal images.Now, I'm waiting patiently for the Uncut/Unrated version to come out.

115,TheRadiobox,Call the HOA because this house needs fixin',1,14 December 2020,"House of 1000 Corpses was directed and written by Robert Zombert and stars Rainn Wilson, Chris Hardwick, Erin Daniels, Jennifer Jostyn, Bill Moseley, Sheri Moon Zombie, Karen Black, Sid Haig, and Matthew McGrory. It follows a group of young adults as they try to survive their captivity at the hands of a depraved family.Plotting is pretty much non-existent, with little of importance or necessity to anything. Young road trippers Bill (Wilson), Jerry (Hardwick), Denise (Daniels), and Mary (Jostyn) need gas and stop at a station/theme ride owned by Captain Spaulding (Haig). Upon hearing of a site of local legend, the crew ride to it and pick up hitchhiker Baby (Zombie) on the way. During their trip a tire is popped by Rufus, and Baby leads the group to her home, occupied by adoptive brothers Otis (Moseley), Tiny (McGrory), and Mother Firefly (Black). The sadistic family entertains themselves and the ""visitors"" with violence and threats while the sheriff works his way to the house due to a crime committed by Spaulding.Characters are mostly terrible, Bill and Jerry are stupid, adventurous, nerdy guys who like pop-culture stuff; whereas their girlfriends Denise and Mary complain about stuff. The Fireflys don't fare much better, with Mother and Tiny acting as half-measures of the main three family members. Baby is by far the weakest, only ever shown off as a piece of ear-ringing eye candy for the audience, sometimes doing something nasty. Otis is the most outwardly violent, a self-serving agent of chaos that preaches and performs violence of all sorts to anyone who gets near him. Spaulding is the best, a hellbilly clown with some memorable lines and an idiosyncratic personality. Performances are generally awful, with the normal leads being uncharismatic, Zombie being plain annoying, and everyone aside from Haig and Moseley banal.Horror is equally terribad. While the movie strains itself to push the viewer to their breaking point with physical violence, sexual violence, and psychological violence, it only ever comes off as Zombie trying to get a rise out of the audience. There's a lot of torture, some manhunting, and some unprofessional surgery, but none of it shocks in the way it clearly wants to; aside from Fishboy. Can't forget about Fishboy (not that that creation is scary or anything, but it is bizarre). Several of the movie's scenes are less nods to and more rip-offs of much praised classics like a dinner scene entirely aping the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and chase scenes reminiscent of slasher franchises like Friday the 13th and Halloween. While not a high bar to pass (with the exception of the original Halloween), Zombie still fails to bring anything new or even energetic to the screen.Technically the movie is a garbage fire. Zombie has a distinctly awful approach to his film making, much like his music. Writing is just pitiful like the worst of screenplays, confusing a string of expletives for creative interactions; lots of F-bombs and slang plague the script and it wears on the senses after the first 500 utterances. Editing is the pits. Spliced between scenes are bits of non-sequitur footage with the Fireflys spitting random, vaguely related dialogue; other times it's of characters that have never appeared. Also edited in are color-changing transitions meant to reference grindhouse films of the 70s, but they only bring up memories of better homages. Pacing is lumbering, finding the 89-minute movie struggling to pad scenes out to feature length by means of slo-mo, musical interludes, and long pauses. It's a mess.I do believe all films are pieces of art, but some are on a different level, House of 1000 Corpses for example, has a ramshackle plot, mostly uninteresting characters, and a script most likely written in crayon. If this is called one of Zombie's best, i want nothing to do with his worst.19/100",House of 1000 Corpses
116,schroeder-gustavo,Almost thoroughly entertaining...Almost....,5,12 June 2015,"So House of 1000 Corpses is Rob Zombie's directorial debut. I'm not gonna lie I had heard very mixed things about the movie before watching it: mostly bad stuff from critics, but seems to be a fan favorite, so I decided to give it a shot. And I'm glad I did because the movie IS entertaining and I have to say that I was entertained until the last 15 minutes or so, which I will talk about in a bit. Rob Zombie actually did a pretty good job in paying homage to genre classics like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but he does it in a very surreal and unusual fun way that makes it unique. Although some of the subliminal images work, most of these actually don't make a lot of sense and look just goofy instead of artistic. Also, some unnecessary jump scares in the movie. The movie was great fun for me until they start burying the girl and the guy. That's when everything just stops making sense, at all. When underground, the girl encounters what I think are the 1000 corpses from the title, which come alive and try to kill her. Also she encounters Dr. Satan mutilating the other dude. So needless to say, everything just stopped making any sense whatsoever to me at that point. At the very end of the movie, when the clown (whom I found very cool and likable by the way) picks the girl up and ""saves her"", you see one of the guys from the crazy family hiding in the back and the very ending you see the girl being tortured by Dr. Satan in these subliminal surreal imagery. I was very disappointed with the ending and the movie would have gotten a 6/10 if it wasn't for that.

The story goes a lot of places at once, and if you are a Texas Chainsaw Massacre series fan, you will see all kinds of similarities and tributes.  I prefer to call them ripoffs, but thats for you to decide.  The acting is not that good, with the exception of Capt. Spaulding, but what do you expect for a horror film, they are not exactly known for their acting.  Sheri Moon is hot, which is a plus, and Spaulding's dialogue is pretty cool.

Whatever I remember of the hits back then of his, ""Superbeast"" and ""Dragula"", it was definitely something I could connect with this movie as there is definitely a Rob Zombie touch to it. The plot itself is wild and crazy, full of carnage and the blood scenes seem to be endless. The soundtrack involves Rob himself of course, and I'd say it's cool and goes along well with the film's general touch and style. Whoever likes blood, violence and even more violence accompanied by the music of Rob Zombie have find himself/herself a gold piece here. I perceived the film radiating vibes of ""personality"", but sometimes it perhaps got a bit too much for me. For example, there's some great sessions here where it's only light music being played during some blasting scenes with slight slow motion effects, but at times I felt this returning style got a bit overused and worn out. There's no real ""red line"" throughout the plot that demands your awareness, so the movie itself is a fully good candidate for a Sunday's brain-dead hangover.",House of 1000 Corpses
123,Zombified_660,Can we get a hell yeah? I thought so...,10,25 July 2005,"House of 1000 Corpses was well worth the wait. People were understandably a little sceptical of Rob Zombie's debut as a director, but knowing myself that the man is a scholar of the modern horror movie and a raving fanboy himself, I had high expectations of House. I was not disappointed. From the demented and hilarious opening sequence through to the surreal and terrifying ending, Zombie's first foray into direction and writing gives the world of cinema a much needed boot in the pants.Is it gory? Well, yeah, it is, but it's never gory in an absolutely horrific fashion. What's such a pleasant surprise is that the movie, despite being a homage to the bleak and nihilistic 70s horror boom, is full of well-painted, full-bodied characters and rich dark humour. House of 1000 Corpses is an absolute blast to watch, never wallowing in darkness and only really becoming a terror-ride toward the very end, meaning it's a movie that while not for all the family could well put a smile on at least some of their faces.The movies combination of gore-soaked serial-killer horror, Tim Burtonesque visuals and Evil Dead's sense of humour is a fresh turn from a genre currently stuck largely in bleak apartment buildings full of long-faced pouty heroines and even longer-faced pouty ghouls. Yeah it isn't that tense, but it's wickedly funny, wonderfully psychedelic and chock full of demented set-pieces. To be honest, I'd almost forgot what it was like to be entertained by horror before I watched this.A lot of people love to dissect this movie and venerate it's influences, but the bottom line is unlike Kill Bill which relied on you being as nerdy as Tarantino to enjoy it, Zombie's movie is fun whether or not you've seen the movies he doffs his threadbare circus hat to.

Two dudes who are probably fans of movies like this and their bored girlfriends stumble upon a murder museum in some huckburg run by an overbearing clown. Eventually they are captive and put through stuff. The source material goes all the way back to that epic of gore, Hershell Gordon Lewis' ""2,000 Maniacs"" in 1964. That movie was also about two couples who blunder into a hellhole.What is interesting about Rob's movie is the set design, makeup, camera work and editing. In fact, it can be argued that that's ALL it is about. None of it makes any sense, but visually, it's just one damned thing after another. It's as if Zombie is saying, ""You thought that scene was horrifying? Get a load of this next one."" The movie is drenched in effects, including polarization, pulsations, split screen, slo mo, etc.Throw in an Ed Gein reference, cheerleader torture, cutting off faces to make masks AND Karen Black and you got quite a package.There are those who prefer movies like ""Session 9"" (also excellent, but a completely different kind of horror movie). Demonstrates that horror now has many subgenres.As the man said, those who like this sort of thing will find it to be the sort of thing they like.",House of 1000 Corpses
126,pizowell,Was worth the wait!,10,1 April 2003,"Two misguided couples stop at Captain Spaulding's, a serial killer museum, chicken hut, and gas station in search of odd roadside attractions for a book.  There they hear about the legend of Dr. Satan, a psychotic murderer who enjoyed torturing patients at the local nut house.  Intrigued by the story, the kids venture into the night looking for the place he was hanged, instead they run into a family of psychos living in a nearby farmhouse.  I think you can see where it's going from here.""...where pain is God.""House Of 1000 Corpses as you should know, is the long (and I mean LONG) awaited debut from rocker/artist/sicko/genius Rob Zombie.  Since it was first announced horror fans lined up by the throngs to check the movie out. After several false starts and one gutless studio that shall remain nameless (Universal), House was picked up by Lions Gate and will be hitting a limited number of theatres on April 11th.  So, was it worth the wait.  One word: Oh-Hell-Yes!House Of 1000 Corpses starts strong and doesn't let go until the hard cut to black at the end.  Reminiscent of Texas Chainsaw Massacre in quite a few respects House Of 1000 Corpses should gain it's own following and hopefully the respect it deserves not only from horror fans, but from the general population.  House is simply an unrelenting exercise in style, gore, insanity, and fun.  A spit in the face to the trendy Hollywood horror of recent years, House is a throwback to it's main inspiration Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  A remarkable homage to that masterpiece is this masterpiece of the macabre.The family unit is one of the most entertaining and fun to watch psycho families since the first TCM.  First off, there's Captain Spaulding played side-splittingly by Sid Haig.  My hats off to ya brother, great job! Among the extended family are Mother Firefly (Karen Black), her daughter, `Baby' (played very well by the extremely hot Sheri Moon), and the de facto leader of the house, Otis played diabolically well by Bill ""Chop Top"" Moseley. Great work Bill!  Loved the hair!  Writer/director Zombie injects loads of humor in the screenplay with witty/silly/fun dialogue and as a director he has a visual style all his own and I freakin' loved it!  Zombie adds footage from classic black and white flicks, a kick ass opening title sequence, and some fancy editing to the fold.  Add a grim, dread filled atmosphere to that and you have one impressively bleak looking and feeling flick.
From what I heard about the movie early on, I expected it to be a mindless bloodbath with buckets of gore and little sense.  In reality, it's not all that gory or at least I've seen gorier.  There's ample blood with stabbings, skinnings, tortures, mad scientist slashings, and shootings.  It's not for the faint of heart that for sure.  Loved the long drawn out cop execution and once Dr. Satan himself gets thrown into the mix, the movie takes on a whole new aura of madness.  The story and plotting get thin toward the end, but by then I was so absorbed into the movie as a whole I hardly cared. As the film progresses it repeatedly one ups itself with grisly images and some truly crazy shiznit!The protagonists in the film take a backseat to the villains.  The only other movie I can remember that happening in was, well...Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  The villains here are the movie and like in TCM I routed for them instead of the dumbass kids.  House Of 1000 Corpses is one of the most impressive horror movies I've seen in recent years and proved to be worth the wait for any serious horror fan sick of the repetitive mainstream horror flicks that have been force fed to us recently.  House is a horror movie by a horror fan for the horror fan and is definitely worth multiple viewings. It's funny (sometimes quite hysterical), it's gruesome, it's bleak, it's stylish as hell, it's well acted, it's well written, and damned if it didn't kick my ass.  An instant classic!  Burnout Central awards to Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, Sherry Moon (Rob's fiancée), Karen Black, and of course Rob Zombie!",House of 1000 Corpses

128,Oosterhartbabe,Where were the 1000 corpses?,1,25 December 2004,"Rob Zombie has obviously watched WAY too many horror films. And then cut pieces out of all of them to make this film. To quote from MST3K's Future War ""This isn't a real movie, its more like a movie loaf."" ""yeah, it's made from real movie parts, chunked and formed."" One of the movies that Zombie seems to have stolen the most parts from was the early eighties horror film American Gothic, in which a hick couple and their grown children kill anyone who comes to their remote island. The insane family, the little girl dresses put on the victims, the hanging the corpses up like dolls, and the girl who obviously thinks that she's a little kid rather than an adult...all stolen from Gothic. Which is sad, because despite its low budget American Gothic is a better, and much funnier, horror film. I suppose that it's not a coincidence that the little guy shown talking to Captain Spaulding at the beginning of the film in fact PLAYED one of the homicidal children in American Gothic. I, too, rented this movie thinking to have a good laugh at a low brow horror film. I don't think I laughed even once, because the movie simply isn't cheesy enough. Nor is it good enough to really hold the attention. The characters are all very uninteresting, the victims because you don't like them enough to care whether they get killed or not(a sure sign of a bad movie), and the killer family because they just don't have enough personality or seem psycho enough to really hold your attention. Especially Otis, who should have been the main and most interesting character, and just wasn't. The gore content wasn't the highest I've ever seen, nor was it particularly scary. Otis parading around in the skin of one of the vic's dead father just seemed like a bad, campy rip-off of Silence of Lambs. There was no logic or real explanations in the plot for the whole 'Doctor Satan' thing; you were left scratching your head as often as not. The funniest part of the whole movie had to be the girl running away in the giant bunny costume they'd (for some inexplicable reason) put her in. All I could think of was that skit from Kids in the Hall. I wanted to yell ""I'm a nutty bunny!"" as she was running away. That was the closest time I came near to really giggling at this film. Otherwise,I found it rather drab and dull. This movie is not worth watching.",House of 1000 Corpses
129,rarepeperonis,Okay movie,6,9 October 2019,"I love the wacky bonkers plot and gore here but the screenplay and the cinematography is really bad.
I hate the shot transitions from a weird negative tone to reality and the bad way they frame some of the shots. Feels very amateurish.
The score is nothing to rave about and the acting neither. Baby is very annoying.
Worth a watch just for the bonkers story here tho.",House of 1000 Corpses
130,MovieLuvaMatt,Nowhere near as good as I expected,5,29 August 2003,"Though I'm no snob to trashy horror movies, this one is a bit too dull for my taste.  Of course, I watched the R-rated version and many people claim that's why it's not that good, but is it really the trimming of the gore that destroyed the film?  Even with the excessive gore, I still have to watch those annoying inserts of grainy video footage, which have little or nothing to do with each scene.  Rob Zombie was obviously trying to be in-your-face, and hammer into people's heads that he has talent as a director.  Well, guess what?  I didn't go into this movie expecting the work of a talented director.  I just expected a good ol' trash horror flick that's worthy of a guilty pleasure.  But Rob had to go pretentious on us. One prime example is the crane shot where the officer gets killed.  Robert Zemeckis said the best shots in movies are the ones that you can't tell are shots.  If you can tell their shots, then the director hasn't done his job. That pretty much sums up the pretentiousness of that shot.  To drift into the positive side, I do give Rob points for originality, because the film isn't a total rip-off of previous horror movies and does hold its own. Plus, the acting is good for its standards.  Sid Haig has some funny moments as the filthy, foul-mouthed clown.  I've never seen her before, but Sherri Moon is unbelievably gorgeous as Baby.  I was hoping that I'd at least get to hear a lot of Rob Zombie's songs in the soundtrack, so I was disappointed in that department.  Maybe, just maybe, I'll change my mind when I see the unrated version--if it does come out.  But until then, I will give this only an OK rating since I expected a heck of a lot more.  My score:  5 (out of 10)",House of 1000 Corpses
131,FrightMeter,What's with all the complaints?? I liked it!,9,16 August 2003,"I had my doubts about this film when it came to theaters--so much so that a huge horror fan such as myself didn't even bother to go see it.  I had heard so many mixed reviews (mostly bad) about it that it really  put a damper on my eagerness to see it.  That, and the fact that I am not at all a fan of Rob Zombie's music.  So yeah, it was released to video this past Tuesday and for lack of anything better, I rented it.  Now I wish I would have seen it in theaters!  There hasn't been a horror flick filled with so many disturbing images and that has given me such a sense of frenzy and doom for ages.  I believe this film totally accomplished what Zombie set out to accomplish and that was to pay homage to the 70's shock flicks such as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Hills Have Eyes,"" and ""Last House on the Left"" and I would certainly argue that this film is better than the latter two mentioned.  Because I know what this film's purpose was, I honestly do not understand all the negative reviews that are posted on here and have to comclude that you people just don't get it and shouldn't have rented or went to the movie in the first place.  First off all, the settings were incredible.  Everything from the Roadside Death Ride, the the House itself, to the Dr. Satan's tunnel at the end of the film had SO much detail put into it.  You could watch this film a dozen times and catch something new with each viewing.  The acting was decent and the craziness and ruthlessness of the family came across splendidly.  The direction was top-notch and there were really some intense, disturbing scenes (the rabbit chase and the coffin-lowered-in-the-pit come to mind).  I was glued to the screen the entire length of this film and the day I returned it to the video store I went out and bought the DVD.  It's a great horror flick and is unlike anything released in the past 30 years.  If you can go into this film realizing what it is and appreciate the shock flicks of the 70's, you will have fun with this film.  If you are expecting another ""Scream"" or ""Urban Legend"" stay away!!!  I, for one, am very excited to see what the sequel has in store!  9 out of 10!!",House of 1000 Corpses

That's not a bad thing, but with that said you can clearly see it was born from that movie.The movie is filled with lots of gore and horror.

Yes it is gory but not blood and guts every five seconds.Good connection with characters and villains.

Well done dude.",House of 1000 Corpses
135,Dandy_Desmond,A Visual Assault,6,10 August 2010,"Sometimes a horror movie can have no soul, sets out to un nerve, disturb and generally assault the audience visually. House of 1000 Corpses manages to do this. A lot of reviews mention that it shows the killers are kind of heroes, that it is sick. I disagree. the violence is not cool, its ugly and shocking and anyone who would find Otis, Baby and the like cool need their heads read. An example is the scene when the girl in the bunny rabbit costume is stabbed by Baby - its horrible not cool and I have to agree with an earlier reviewer - made my blood run cold.The idea behind this movie is similar to many 70s grime films such as Last House on the Left or The House by the Cemetery, which is to basically attack your senses with images and sounds that will disturb you - not to give you the pretty Hollywood ending and have good guys vs bad guys but to shock you and show you the ugliness and to gross you out. It reminds me of when all the video nasties were out in the 80s - these were movies that were banned and you were not allowed to see - but cos they were supposed to be so nasty you felt you had to see it. On some level this film is entertaining and is certainly an experience - at times unsettling and horrific it can also be funny and weird.I have seen it 2-3 times since i bought it years ago and each time I have felt different about it. I think it has improved with age compared to the shockers we've had since in the Hollywood remakes of Texas Chainsaw, Friday the 13th, The Fog and When a Stranger Calls. This movie was followed by the equally ugly Devils Rejects which changes style and tone but remains violent and bleak. I don't think Rob Zombie is a great film maker, nor is he great at writing dialogue but something entertains me in his movies. His movies are trashy, badly written and soul less but for some reason I watch them. I think he is in a band of current horror directors that have grown up as fans of horror movies such as Neil Marshall (The Descent, Dog Soldiers) Eli Roth (Cabin Fever, Hostel) and Christopher Smith (Creep,Severance, Triangle)and you can certainly see the influence spattered all throughout the movie. Its worth checking out even just for Sheri Moons ass.",House of 1000 Corpses
136,KennethEagleSpirit,Rob Zombie Rules!,9,8 January 2007,"The long and the short of it ... I LOVED this flick! Quirky, funny, weird, off the wall, etc. It IS, as far as I'm concerned, a classic Cult Classic. Every character and all the cast, every sequence, the music, the photography, the continuity, the plot, the over all weirdness ... ALL done to the hilt, and with excellence. In fairness, I think that this is one of those films that the viewer either falls in love with totally or detests completely. There seems to be, given the comments I've heard from others, no comfortable middle ground. Captain Spaulding, Mother Firefly, Tiny, Otis, and Baby ( Oh, baby! ), not to mention the Victims and the Police ... All perfect. I think this is the best horror flick in decades.

137,McFrogg,I feel robbed by this zombie.,1,23 April 2017,"Once upon a time, Americans used to make good horror movies. Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Dracula, The Thing (50s version) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers to name a few. Somewhere along the road, they decided that graphic violence and jump scares equals good horror. It probably started with garbage like ""Blood Feast"".Instead of the horror/sci-fi movie serving as a warning against messing with the unknown/nature, they just wanted to shock people with naked and dead bodies. Movies like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street started to pop up, movies where the only purpose is for the monster to kill off one character and then move on to the next till almost everyone is dead. It wasn't enough with a couple or stabbings, we needed ""cool"" and inventive ways for the victims to die. The monster needed to be a ""badass"" too, someone you could root for. Michael Myers is a silent ninja assassin with a butcher's knife, Jason is The Hulk with a hockey mask, and Freddy Krueger is a comedian with claws. The victims, and especially the women, had to show their naked bodies on screen. Horror became more and more about sexuality. Horror regressed into a primitive state where only blood, gore, jump scares and graphic sex mattered.House of 1000 Corpses is one of the most extreme cases of primitive horror. I had the displeasure to watch this piece of crap back in 2008, and I still regret it. For some reason, Rob Zombie, who can't even make good music, decided to try horror movies. He took the script from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, xeroxed it and added a lot more gore and his exhibitionist wife. Now I know why he calls himself ""zombie"".Watching it, I got the disturbing feeling that Rob Zombie actually thought his fictional serial killers were cool, that he approved of their behavior. It seemed to me that they were his ""heroes"". From what I've heard, this is also the case with the sequel I will never watch, and the Halloween remake and sequel. If it's true, he should probably seek help. Usually, I say stuff like: ""why waste your talent making crap like this"". This time, there's no talent to be found.House of 1000 Corpses is cruel and disgusting without any redeeming features whatsoever. It doesn't even deserve to be called a movie. Like I said earlier, I regret that I wasted my time and money on it when I was younger. Money and time that could have been spent on better things. Some years after I watched it, I took the DVD and threw it in the garbage where it belonged. Please, stay away from this movie. Don't give away your money to makers of trash. Vote with your wallet! Like He-Man would say: ""We have the POOOWEEEEERRR!""(One star? Zero stars!)",House of 1000 Corpses
138,actionmoviestar,Pointless Trash,1,5 June 2005,"""House of 1000 Corpses"" can be summed up in two words: ""pointless trash"". Yes you heard it ladies in gentlemen, this film was pointless trash. A throwback to the many 70's horror films, most notably the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Corpses"" is such a bore that it makes some of these b-horror movies look great. Directed by Rob Zombie, this film follows a group of teenagers that try to escape the crazed Firefly family. We have seen nothing new with ""House of 1000 Corpses. Maybe if it was released in the 80's it might have been a little bit better but who knows? I think the main problem that I had with the film, is that it is utterly violent. Even though I know violence was an essential part of the film, it wasn't justified. Violence for the sake of violence has never turned me on, as I feel you have to have a point for violence(violence is never wrong, but there are certain circumstances that one must defend himself or herself). This film doesn't display this. Sometimes it just go way too far. Besides this, the acting is terrible, the characters are one dimensional and this movie surely has nothing on the remake of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""(which was pretty decent in my opinion. All in all I can see why this film was pushed back for two years before it made it into theaters. Avoid renting this one. Save this one for cable t.v.",House of 1000 Corpses
139,evilmatt-3,A very good horror film that is true to the genre,8,12 April 2003,"I'll admit that after the 80's, I didn't hold out much hope for the survival of the slasher genre.  What had started out in the 70's and 80's as clever little social commentaries gave way to the 90's teenie bopper crap (e.g., _Scream_).  If we are honest, _The Texas Chainsaw Massacre_ was really a revolution in film, not just the horror genre._House of 1000 Corpses_ doesn't quite reach the brilliance of _Chainsaw Massacre_ or other early slasher films, but it gets as close as anything you're likely to see these days.  Much to my surprise, Rob Zombie is a very competent writer/director and has made quite a literate horror film with tons of genre references for the true fans (taking from the aforementioned _Chainsaw Massacre_ as well as other classics like _Evil Dead_ and _Hellraiser_.)The visuals here are amazing.  Zombie cleverly uses differing quality film to suggest the films he's paying tribute to.  Very slick indeed.  The special effects are more graphic and realistic than any I've seen in a horror film; perhaps they show us a little TOO much, but you can't really complain about gore when watching a movie that has the word ""corpses"" in the title, can you?I do have some complaints about this film, though.  Chief among them is the complete lack of character development.  Zombie chooses to make the villains the focus of this film, and his reasons for doing that are well-established genre practice.  However, character-driven horror is always more effective in the end (as we saw in the generally bloodier but WAY more intelligent _Hellraiser_).  The protagonists in this film have little function besides being targets for the depraved killers at the heart of the film.  While fun, this does tend to distance the audience from the film a bit and make it less satisfying overall.Many people I've talked to liked the first 30 minutes of the film best. Frankly, I thought it was a waste of time precisely because that was an optimal characterization opportunity that Zombie missed.  At the very least, it would have been nice if Zombie had chosen to make the antagonists a little more self-reflective; this would have been a nice addition to the genre.It is interesting that some of the more formidable characters here are female, and the almost-mythical Dr. Satan is for all intents and purposes of indeterminate sex.  While I don't think Rob Zombie is exactly an ardent feminist, I think that these developments are worthy of further examination.Go see it if you are a fan.  Stay home otherwise, because you'll just irritate the fans.  :)",House of 1000 Corpses

It seems totally out of place here as this isn't your usual American Graffiti type of movie! It is in fact a movie which would have been called a Video Nasty at one time and caters to the demand for Extreme Horror.And since the 70s Horror is in demand more than ever especially the kind about mad doctors who get struck off the register for conducting live autopsies! The only thing missing was David Parker Ray-I mean this wasn't fiction it really happens every other month -try reading Sadistic Killers. It delivers just what it says on the box-but you need to have some experience before you delve into it. Wide open for a sequel but somehow I couldn't see 1000 corpses.The title would have been better to just Corpses its something of a mouthful and sounds like one of those 50s horror flicks of the Night of the Flesh Eating Zombies type.

There are definitely some things I don't like, such as Zombie's choice to cast his wife Sheri (Not a professional actress) in the role of Baby Firefly, and the overuse of lighting effects in some scenes· Zombie doesn't hold back, and that's what I like about it. Zombie doesn't care if he steps on people's toes with this film. There is extreme graphic violence, much of which is committed against women· The editing and cinematography are cartoonish, and frightening at times.

This is a pathetic rip off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, with a hint of Evil Dead, and another bit of Natural Born Killers.  This movie has absolutely no plot, no direction, and not a single bit of sense.  It might as well be called Rob Zombie's Freak Show.  For me, this is officially the worse film ever made. This movie stunk so bad, I wanted to gorge out my eyeballs and use them to stuff my nose up with.  I went with hardcore fan of the horror genre and they also thought it was a mess.  This is the belly button lint of the film industry, its the gum under the theater chair, the jam between your toes, the discarded black juju beans.

148,samgiannn,House of 88 Wasted Minutes,2,2 November 2014,"This movie just bored me mostly because there was absolutely no story. I also hated how it felt like a TV show. The shots were framed much like a sitcom's, and I didn't like the random shots of torture and sex in between scenes. The cinematography was very aggravating as well. The random mirrored, negative, and inverted shots distracted and annoyed me. It made this movie feel like a music video (wonder why). Dr. Satan was also very forced. He didn't come into the movie until the last 10 minutes. If they would have explained the connections between the Firefly family, Captain Spaulding, and Dr. Satan, it would have made a bit more sense. Speaking of which, the best part of House of 1000 Corpses was Captain Spaulding. He was a very likable character, and he inserted some much-needed comic relief into the film. I just wish that he had more screen time. I have no clue how anyone could like this movie. To me, it was scene after scene of bizarre imagery and torture.",House of 1000 Corpses
149,thehardyboyz2043,It's finally here....,1,18 April 2003,"and you'll probably like this film (if you're a big horror or Rob Zombie fan that is). If you're not then you'll likely find it to be boring and not terribly horrifying.  (Possible Spoilers) That was my impression of it at least. I'm not the biggest horror movie fan around, not that I don't like them, I've just never gotten around to seeing a lot of 'em. But I don't have to be a big fan of that genre or any one for that matter to know ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is a really, really bad movie.  I can usually ignore plot and character development if the idea interests me, but despite these low standards for horror flicks, ""Corpses"" was more or less an irritating mess, with very annoying actors, not the characters, the actors themselves. I'll say this the camera work was interesting, even at times fancy (not very though) and the whole film seemed thrown together. Finally, for all the hype I heard about how bloody, gory and disturbing ""Corpses"" was, it didn't scare or disturb me at all. I was actually laughing quite a bit, especially during that one scene where there's what seems to be a never ending pause until the cop is shot by one of the killers, it was quite laughable.  My overall impression is this film was really not worth being delayed time and time again, because it was too gory and disturbing, if anything it should have been delayed because it's a really, really bad movie. 0 out of 4 stars.",House of 1000 Corpses

As a horror fan, I will be doing the usual, which is having an all day horror movie marathon, and I'll be saving my personal favorite Halloween-themed horror film for last, which is House Of 1000 Corpses. This is the first film written and directed by Rob Zombie and the first film before Zombie's 2005 hit sequel, The Devil's Rejects. At the age of 15 or 16 years old, this movie was my very first experience of something totally bizarre, shocking, hostile, darkly humorous, and insanely amazing. Now, it's 2017, I'm 27 years old, and in this very day and age, House Of 1000 Corpses never ages. It's a wonderful ride of non-stop old school 70s horror straight to hell, filled with an all- star cast and unforgettable performances from massive horror heroes, Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding, Bill Moseley as Otis Driftwood, Sheri Moon Zombie as Baby Firefly, Karen Black as Mother Firefly and many more. Plus, with brutal special and makeup effects, creepy atmospheres, fuzzy music video style-like scenes, amazing cinematography, a super soundtrack and just about everything in a horror film that is truly a hardcore masterpiece. It's absolutely an awesome and cozy flick to watch on Halloween. This movie was also special to my late father, and we used to watch it every year on Halloween, until he passed in 2013. It's been four years now, and I'm still keeping that Halloween spirit between me and my late father alive by watching this movie. No matter what horror movies from the past, the present, or even those to be made in the future, House Of 1000 Corpses will always be my favorite Halloween-themed horror movie.",House of 1000 Corpses
151,DJ_Shilo,Come inside if you dare!,8,21 September 2018,"Let me just start by saying that ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is R-rated for all the right reasons. Musician Rob Zombie directs for the first time and he also writes this insanity but given the genre, it's a well-made film if you can stomach it and it won't surprise me if a lot of audiences can't.It begins on October 30, 1977, where a group of friends is on a journey in hopes of writing a book about offbeat road attractions. To their luck, they stop at a gas station and ""The Museum of Monsters & Madmen"". The owner, Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) takes them on a tour and they discover the legend of Doctor Satan, an alleged lunatic who was hung from a tree for human experimentation. After Spaulding gives them directions to the tree, they take off and end up picking up a young hitchhiker named, Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie). When their car runs into problems, Baby takes them back to her house where their worst nightmares are about to come true.Mr. Zombie has done his homework on the horror genre because he crafts himself a horror film that stands out among others and there is a clear indication that, Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is a major influence. You know the whole ordeal of curious kids wandering into trouble. The difference with this setup is the villainous characters themselves. We're not sure what they really are other than disturbed killers with a haunting presence but we sense theirs something more. They don't feel like just killers. Satan worshippers, cannibals, maybe everything in one package. They are left to be mysterious and I like this angle. Baby is a childish sexpot that lures the victims, Otis has a Charles Mansion look to him, Mother Firefly (Karen Black) is the overseer of the farmhouse and Grampa Firefly (Dennis Fimple) eats with his mouth open and has the intelligence of a monkey wrench.It opens with the character of Captain Spaulding and some good camera work as we move into his gas station. From here he is stuck up in a robbery attempt which he manages to foil because of the stupidity of the robbers. As the opening credits roll, it's a very 70's looking montage of horror movie mayhem while the title theme song ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is sung by Zombie himself. From here we meet the 4 main characters: Bill (Rainn Wilson), Jerry (Chris Hardwick), Erin (Denise Willis) and Mary (Jennifer Jostyn). All seem intelligence but nonetheless curious.Into the second act is where the picture takes a twisted turn and the violence explodes. The opening sequence of the robbery's aftermath is violent but it's a stylish gore fest throughout the rest. The house itself is a haven for violence and these kids are subjected to various forms of torture that prove to be more sickening than anything. Rob Zombie approaches the material from a stylish point of view when a character is mutilated and turned into a stuffed fish-like creature Otis calls ""Fishboy"". You can imagine what happens after this.Here's an interesting work for the camera. Zombie is stylish in the way he makes the film but it's the oddball feel to it. He is always cutting to oddball inserts and black and white flashbacks. One of the sequences involves red lighting where Baby purchases Beer from a simpleton working at a place called ""Red Hot P***y Liquor."" Why would she be purchasing beer? Anyway, Captain Spaulding shows up again midway when two deputies, George Wydell (Tom Towles) and Steve Nash (Walter Goggins) begin looking for one of the missing girls. We get the strange feeling he is not one of the good guys when he sends them to the house to meet an unwanted fate.So we have determined that this picture is a sickening and disturbing film where many viewers will likely want to throw up instead of watching. That's agreeable but if you stop and take a look at some of the movie, it's made in the horror genre for a reason so you should know what's to be expected. Zombie is a macabre kind-of-guy in some of his music videos so that should be a clear zinger as to what he is capable of. There is some good material written here but it's buried under the gore. One of the best sequences in the film is when a character is revealed and he is working on a ""patchwork monster,"" like Frankenstein. Unfortunately, the monster is one of the teenager victims hooked up to an operating table. This is just graphics but it's the horror element that works because it's meant to shock you.It amazes me on a high level that Zombie is able to create a picture of this repulsive but yet still manage to keep the material stylish. If you like the horror genre, this takes it to new levels. The original cut of the film was filmed in 2000 and rated NC-17, forcing the film to be shelved for several years. How it got released with an R rating is another mystery but either way, here it is. Don't say you weren't warned.",House of 1000 Corpses
152,maxcellus46,"Cheap ""Texas Chainsaw"" Ripoff.",1,28 June 2008,"A piece of pure schlock to say the very least. The basic ""story"", if you can call it that, is pretty much a ripoff from the far better and much more intense ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" from the 1970's. This Zombie (Rob) film is nothing more than a feeble attempt to shock you into numbness, as is shown with most of the victims in this story. Dr. Satan? He or ""it"" appears more as some kind of alien creature or maybe an actual demon from the underworld. And there is no real attempt to explain or define what the motivation for all this butchery is. It just happens, one after another. It also leaves nothing to your imagination so that you dredge up in your mind what's happening as in the original ""Texas Chainsaw."" In this flop everything is right out there in the open, distorted camera shots as they may be. A waste of time. Avoid it like the plague!",House of 1000 Corpses
153,jhs39,Boring garbage,3,18 April 2003,"Extremely lame, poorly made horror flick doesn't live up to its pre-release hype and is nothing more than an overdirected rip-off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  The best that can really be said about this mess is that writer/director Rob Zombie seems to be trying very hard and he is obviously a fan of the genre, but being a fan doesn't make him a film-maker.  One stylistic decision that grows old quickly is Zombie's tendency to insert frequent cuts in the middle of scenes that generally don't have a damn thing to do with the action--film clips; tv shows, naked girl writing with skeleton--the constant cutaways during nearly every scene for the film's first hour become monotonous and might be part of the reason why corpses is unable to sustain even the slightest bit of tension during any of its horror scenes.  Sid Haig at least was fun as the gas station owner dressed like a lost member of Insane Clown Posse.  I will admit to the possibility that the film is so watered down in it's R-rated version that the scenes have lost their horrific nature, but it's not likely I will sit through this dud again on video to find out.",House of 1000 Corpses

Also by having the scenes of how people were killed kind of drowned out by the music and not really showing anything were also lame.  The clown Captain Spaulding was very funny though and always had me laughing.  The four victims were acting more like 90's college kids than from 1977.  I think I would have liked an uncut version more.  Where were the 1000 corpses as the movie title claims?

Really weird and could get annoying sometimesSPOILERSSome of the things I didn't enjoy were the shooting of the young cop. He just kept the gun there and it keep going and going. I was thinking when is he ever going to shoot him? The ending also didn't make sense to me what so ever. What were the bodies in the well all about? I didn't understand who the monsters were at the end either. The ax wielding guy and the dude operating didn't make no sense at first.

After picking up an attractive hitchhiker the couples find themselves at the mercy of a sadistic clan of satanic, cannibalistic murders. Will anyone survive the House of 1000 Corpses??Ultimately i find this movie to be a giant waist of time. there are few redeemable qualities to it, at best its clichéd, and pointless and at one point almost feels like your watching a film where the entire point is of shock and disgust. Now I have no problem with horror films at all, but i want some substance to them rather than gore for the sake of gore. At one point one feels as though Rob Zombie has wandered outside of his element and should have stuck to making music. The only thing about this movie i can praise is the acting of Sid Haig who plays the violent and sinister Captain Spaulding. Other than that I find this movie to be shlock for no other reason.

The characters are slightly altered, but still apparent.  And it doesn't help matters any when you're using one of the same actors from TCM 2. When you create a movie that is supposed to be an homage, you don't take from one film alone and hope no one will notice.  I had to fight to stay awake through this one.And to those who found this movie funny -- well, I find nothing funny about sadistic torture at the hands of a crazy family, or a foul mouthed chicken cook who dresses like a clown.

The only thing positive I can say about it is a character named Dr. Satan looked pretty cool. He was very original could have been horrifying in a different movie.

I thought for sure it was going to be really scary and a real fun ride, oh how disappointed I was.My first disappointment is that the movie is one big rip-off of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and not the 1974 original but the really lame 1994 sequel/remake.  A group of kids are captured by a really weird family...blah blah blah, do I really have to give a plot synopsis?The movie does have a few things going for it.  Captain Spaulding is a real treat.  His scenes are humorous but also creepy and disturbing.  A fine character and a fine creation which deserves a better movie.  The movie does have a couple of creepy moments, but no where near enough for the type of film it wants to be.  The major problem is that Rob Zombie has these weird interludes during scenes which break up any tension that was being built. Perhaps he was using them for shock value but I found them to be distracting and provided little in the way of story.Story is the main problem with this movie, it's got tons of it but doesn't use any of it!  The whole issue of Dr. Satan could have been truly frightening but he is reduced to a set piece once he's finally revealed. Also you never get the feeling that the characters you are cheering for (hopefully that's the kids in the car) ever have a chance of escaping, hence no tension or suspense.Overall the movie starts off slow but has a creepiness to it.  Once the family is introduced the film screams Texas Chainsaw Massacre and you are left saying, ""oh yeah I've seen this, I know how this works...yawn"", and you are left hoping for an exciting conclusion.  Zombie does try to give an exciting ending but his nightmare visions of the tunnels under the house tend to just be set dressing and much of the action doesn't make sense because the viewer doesn't know why people/creatures/Dr. Satan are down there.  The final third of the film is just a confusing mess, almost like Zombie forgot all about Dr. Satan and threw something together at the end.The final scene is another disappointment.  There is reportedly an alternate ending which I think I would have been more satisfying.  Hey, I like Captain Spaulding!Rob Zombie has some good ideas and if he can stick to the story of Dr. Satan I think a sequel could be quite good.  I would also recommend to slow down the pace a little and work on creating a lot of suspense.

It basically serves as his little homage to horror movies. However, that very fact itself serves as the film's first flaw : It has no originality. It's almost like Rob Zombie thought it would be a really cool idea to make a movie that didn't have anything new to it. Instead, he would just take all these scenes from his favorite movies and just re-shoot them. It doesn't matter how many obscure horror movies he references in this scene or that. In the end, the whole flick is just a stylized ripoff of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. So, that kind of brings me back to my original question : Did this movie really need to be made ? It's not scary. It's not really what I would consider ""gory"". Hell, it's not even that creepy.

A truly nightmarish ride through a disturbing world of a family of psychopaths is indeed difficult to watch. Talk about being mad' is an understatement..at least the film didn't depict graphic shots of the victims being butchered, it was severely edited. It's certainly not a film I would want to see again, probably because the plot has been used over and over again in various ways and to be honest it becomes tedious. There were a few distractions included, though I had no problem with them being there. The direction, overall was fairly basic.none of the scenes held any memorable images for me. I had a lot of contempt for the concept (storyline) really, because (to me) it was very hard to figure out.  I had lots of questions while sitting through this film, maybe I was too analytically motivated or somethingI don't know, in any case it didn't help either way.

Zombie makes no attempt to build any kind of suspense or generate any kind of terror. Rather, he focuses in excruciating detail on the process of abducting, torturing, and killing four unlucky teenagers. Watching what could be Charlie Manson's home videos is an unnerving, disturbing, disgusting experience; the teens are trapped in a house of killers, hopeless, beaten, despairing, with only the knowledge of their imminent torture and death for company.

Cool editing, creepy production design, fun music choices, great/disgusting makeup, and awesome characters. Let's talk about those characters. Otis was very disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. A total flip from Chop Top (also played by Bill Moseley). The Professor and Dr. Satan were gross and not easy to look at due to the great make up. Captain Spaulding was very funny, especially in the cold open. And finally, my favorite character Baby Firefly. She was unhinged, but also captivating. Every time she was on screen, my eyes were drawn to her. Also, she had quite the range. This movie also had Rainn Wilson before The Office, and Chris Hardwick before Talking Dead. I also enjoyed their characters as well. I also felt like there were some homages to other horror movies.

Lewis would see this, it would even make Roger Corman cry...I being a huge RoB Zombie fan had tears falling from my eyes, while a big smile was drawn in my face...I hadn´t got such a nice time in a horror film since a long time ago. I hear the DVD is coming in August, I can´t wait to have it.The film is obviously inffluenced by such classics like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Carnival of Souls, 10,000 maniacs, etc. etc. etc...but more than a rip off is a grand tribute to those classic forgotten gems...Good work Rob!!! I just hope the nre texas massacre takes this one as an example.",House of 1000 Corpses
173,drunken_critic,Shocking!,8,21 November 2003,"Wow, this movie was pretty extreme.  I hear Rob Zombie (the director), had to edit the movie like crazy to remove the nc17 rating.    If a movie was to be rated a nc17 this movie deserved to be it.  The violence was graphic. One memorable scene is when a kid is shackled and a girl starts chopping at his wrists with a hatchet.The best way to describe this movie as a `gross out movie'.  It is a movie where you feel like you have to turn your head during some scenes because they are so sick.  Zombie did a good job of creating sick characters in this house.  The characters are cold blooded, and seem to enjoy torture, murder, and mutilation, with a ruthless fascination.  I want to see this baby when it goes on DVD uncut.  I would like to see some of the scenes that were deleted from the R rated version.  They must have been pretty gross to be put on the cutting floor, and not make it to the theater version.Every person in the world has compared this movie to Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I wouldn't know, I never saw the original.  I have only seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequels.  I will have to make it a point to watch the original, so I can compare the two.  I think years from now, this will be considered a classic shock horror movie. 75/100",House of 1000 Corpses
174,TensersFloatingDisk,A Swing and a Miss,3,7 November 2003,"As a musician, Rob Zombie has been responsible for some of the best shock-rock of the past twenty years.As a film-maker...well, Rob Zombie is a fine musician.Rob's authorial/directorial debut is derivative, which is not too much of a sin in the horror genre, but it's also boring, which is a terminal flaw. In order to qualify as ""horror,"" I should be, well, horrified.  I should care what happens to some of the characters, I should care whether they live or die.  Zombie makes this practically impossible by offering us teenage prats for victims, and then offering us uncharismatic nothings for villains.  A thick 'Okie accent (Otis) and an hysterical giggle (Baby) do not make a compeling villain.  Even nasty little gorefests like Texas Chainsaw Massacre offered SOME kind of internal logic to their storyline, SOME kind of rationale behind the splatter.  Zombie offers us none whatsoever, and actually ends up contradicting himself several times.  If the monstrous gang of butchers are simply escaped psychopaths, why are there a bunch of undead zombies rising from the water at the film's climax?  If they're so above the pretensions of their victims' horror fetish, what's with the childish 'satanic' ritual at the ending?  And the horrors of the underground chamber seem entirely supernatural -- where's the rationale for that?  Please, Rob. Grow up.There is one startlingly well drawn character in this see of faceless dorques, and that is Captain Spaulding, a hilarious send-up of Zombie himself as a mock-terrifying clown who offers to show us horrors which are, at their core, more rusty carnival sideshow than real terrors.  Sadly, though, Spaulding's character is left in the dust by the plot, which rattles on to focus on our gang of lame been-there, done that, psychos.  By the film's end, the appearance of yet more un-named nasties with axes and scalpels produce yawns, not shudders.All the plot holes and mischaracterizations could be set aside if the film were visually engaging -- beautiful (as Eyes without a Face, or The Ring) or compelling (Andalusian Dog, or the otherwise sad remake Thir13en Ghosts), or terrifying.  Instead, Zombie swings from a gorgeously carnivalesque atmosphere in scenes around the gas station to color-negative 'dream' sequences, and then to simply grainy and indistinct 'gut' shots of maggots, flyblown corpses, and skeletal remains.  There's no visual consistency, and, unfortunately, not much consistency of any other kind, to be found.There are three sequences which stand head and shoulders above the rest of the film.  The first is the introductory sequence in which Captain Spaulding and his assistant confront some would-be thieves, and the second is Captain Spaulding's tour through his Murder museum.  In both cases, there is an achingly true contrast between those who think they're bad-ass (the thieves, or the hapless horror-fans) and those who actually ARE a menace (Spaulding and his hulking assistant).  The third is the sequence in which the police finally reveal the family's handiwork, only to be victimized themselves, to an insanely incongruous soundtrack of 40's love-ballads.  The juxtaposition between violence and schlock is brilliant.  Of particular note is a final shot which starts in deep focus on the barrel of the gun levelled at one officer's head, and then pulls back, and back...and back...and back.  The tension is sustained longer than I thought possible, much longer than I think most film-makers would dare, and yet the absolute stillness in the center of the frame keeps the audience stretched taut as razorwire.  It's a moment of actual terror which may, hopefully, point to better work in Zombie's future.",House of 1000 Corpses

While I don't have a subscription to FANGORIA, I do go see any horror film that looks like it might be a quality film.The first few minutes of HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES were impressive. They really captured the backroads of America around Halloween. The decorations, the sickly yellowish lighting near convenience stores......and some of the characters had promise....but the whole thing seemed like a sick excuse to appeal to the rape/torture crowd in this country. I never identified with any of the victims and did not want to identify with the killers. I left the theater with a sick feeling as if I had watched a snuff film or child porn or something else that would disgust a reasonable person.I've seen a few movies of this genre..the travelers being hosted by a creepy family.of course, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE comes to mind, both versions of OLD DARK HOUSE, even ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW....but this one could have been a winner....but in the end...it was all about gore and not plot or whatever else one wants in a movie.

I saw this with very low expectations, and pretty much got what I expected, plus a little extra.This movie gets lots of points for creativity. Never have I seen anything quite like it. One thing I really enjoyed was the use of inverted colors in certain scenes, making this movie stand out from others in a visual sense. Costume design is excellent, the hair, face paint, masks, are all outstanding.There are several bits that made me laugh out loud they were so ridiculous, although I'm unsure on whether they were intended to be funny. Also, be sure to read the t-shirts some of the characters are wearing, they are quite a hoot.Some scenes are just memorable. My favorite is when the cop is on his knees about to be shot, and there is, I swear, a 60-second pause while music plays, you know what's going to happen, but it takes such a long time it really is just plain humorous.This film is extremely bizarre. Unfortunately, too bizarre for my liking. I spent most of the film with one eyebrow raised, going, ""Why did that just happen?"" or ""What in the world...?"" Now, most horror buffs will yell at me for saying this and go, ""well, that's what horror is all about!"" I'm sorry, I need at least a little bit of a plot, or explanation of what is happening and why, otherwise I'm just sitting there baffled, confused, and ultimately, annoyed.",House of 1000 Corpses

182,hoversj,"You can love your ""baby"" too much...",6,22 April 2003,"The basic plot of this movie is similar to the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (etc.) - four generic people in a car run across a spooky family and mayhem ensues.I enjoyed it, but found it fundamentally unsatisfying - thus the analysis that follows. I'm not sure if what I plan to say will give away any more about this movie than the commercials and other hype, but just in case I will say (POSSIBLE SPOILERS).The plot: four people are travelling the back roads, apparently doing research for a book about old roadside attractions, and run into a creepy family (apparently with roots in the carnival). The tourists are tortured, mutilated, and eventually killed. The four ""protagonists"" (or to coin a phrase ""victagonists"", since they aren't particularly proactive at any point in the film) are so lacking in personality that you remember them only as ""girl with camera"" ""guy driving car"" ""girl with cop dad"" and ""guy with morbid sense of humor"" aka ""guy to blame for getting them into this"".A fundamental difference between H1KC and TCM is that instead of the movie being ""four normal folks run into sadistic spooky family and are subsequently done over by them"" - it's ""Spooky family does for stupid carload of normals who annoy them"". The difference being that from the start it's clear that the sympathies of writer/director Zombie are entirely with the spooky family. He loves his creations too much to let them have a chance of losing, let alone of getting hurt.In fact, one of the several complaints I have about the movie was that not once does a single member of the spooky family even get kneed in the groin, let alone INJURED. One of my favorite things about ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" was that Freddy took a sledgehammer to the face - he got up again, but it slowed him down, darn it!! I prefer to see the villains be something less than infallible, and for them to get bricks dropped on them... or something... spat on, even...Another thing the movie lacked was breathing space - the best horror movies hit you with adrenaline, then let you breathe for a bit, then hit you again (and harder). When the hits just keep coming, without room to ""come down"" it's hard to keep any enthusiasm...Now I want to write an article about ""what makes a good slasher movie"" (oxymoron though it may seem).

Then I discovered through a good friend that he was into making movies. Upon seeing this, I knew that I had been hooked...to a point. Violence has always been Rob's specialty and this is certainly no different. He is a very colorful character who goes right for the throat and is not afraid of producing a rather large amount of shock value in his work.The Firefly family is your typical family who lives out in the woods and doesn't care about anyone or anything but themselves. When you have Bill Moseley (probably picked because of his role in ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"") with Karen Black (""Five Easy Pieces,"" just to name one) and Rob's wife Sheri, you can't go wrong. Who could avoid Mama Firefly's cackle and Baby Firefly's childish giggle? Otis is just emotionless. You can't see anything on his face, but that's the entire point when you have a family of insane killers terrorizing the unsuspecting locals.Dark with a capital D, it possesses some interesting music and characters that you either love, hate, or even both.

The reason for my listing these movies is that I want anyone reading this review to rest assured that when it comes to horror/exploitation, I know what I'm talking about.Rob Zombies first feature film 'House of 1000 Corpses' is fun, entertaining and highly stylized, yet slightly flawed. The movie holds together pretty darn well in its first half but degrades pretty quickly to music video status later. It has absolutely no tension in it, and is not the least bit scary. The content may well be too graphic for some viewers, but I suspect that hardcore horror fans like myself may be a little disappointed in the level of violence.The main point of House seems to be entertainment first and foremost, and when taken in that context, it succeeds. But, I fear, this movie is really only for people like me who really like the mean-spirited stuff. People who like movies like 'Scream' should probably stay away. Real horror fans, on the other hand, should like it well enough, and have a great time seeing it. Just remember, it's Robs' first baby! Since he's already signed 'House 2', let's wait and see before we judge him too harshly.

190,sexytail,Anyone Who Hated This Movie Should Not Be Watching Horror Films,10,10 July 2005,"You like horror movies? Have you seen the original 1974 ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""? If not, do yourself a favor and go watch it, and then come back and treat yourself to Rob Zombies wonderful homage ""House of 1000 Corpses"". The film is all homage and humor, but it would be wrong to call it parody. The film is really lovingly done.Now mind you, this isn't in the same class as movies like ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Citizen Kane"". It is, however, still beautiful. The style is almost in overkill and is where most of the entertainment is derived from. The story is secondary. Like many a horror film, it's about a group of young people who go where they shouldn't and p*ss-off (I can't believe I had to censor this word) some creepy hicks. In this case they are looking for Doctor Satan, a local legend who might just be real. From there it follows the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" formula pretty closely, but far better than any of that films sequels ever did. The film is very inventive and keeps from being very boring or very predictable. I was able to guess at a few things, but then I watch a lot of horror films.A real stand out is the use of color. The photography is surprisingly good for a horror effort. Another big reason to watch is Sid Haig who acted in many 70s classic exploitation efforts. The guy has always been fun to watch and is really funny here.After this I'm really looking forward to Zombies's ""The Devil's Rejects""",House of 1000 Corpses
191,droogiedim77,ZOMBIE DELIVERS!,10,12 April 2003,"All hail Zombie. Let me start out by saying that I don't think I've ever waited this long to see a movie. I remember in April 99 when Universal had first announced it. I remember when they were shooting for Halloween release. I remember the battles of what needed to be cut. I remember when the trailer first appeared on the Pitch Black rental video in October of 2000. I remember the supposed release dates in January, April and October of 2001. I remember the track ""House of 1000 corpses"" on his Sinister Urge cd. I remember him showing a clip at the Merry Mayhem tour that December. I even remember jumping for joy when I heard in June 2002 that MGM might be picking it up. I was still optimistic when Zombie introduced his set at Ozzfest 02 with a trailer followed by ""COMING THIS FALL."" I was ecstatic when Lions Gate finally picked it up. That being said....I made sure I went to see it the first day it was out. Sadly, this film will not be a huge success. It is a film for true horror fans. I was so sick of the state of horror movies the past 3 years. Everything that came out was so watered down in order for it to be marketed to teen audiences. This movie is dark, disturbing, gory and depraved....and I loved every second of it. Sheri Moon is so fun to watch on screen. Karen Black, as true horror fans know from the TRILOGY OF TERROR, is great in her role. Bill Moseley has a great role. All the other actors do great in their roles. I can't wait to dress up as Captain Spaulding for Halloween. I love the way Zombie shot this movie. As soon as you start watching it, you know Zombie wrote and directed it. I'm also amazed at what he did with the sets considering he only had a reported $7 mil for a budget. I hope that he builds an actual ""Captain Spaulding's museum of mayhem and murder."" I also love the way he scored the movie. Zombie worked with Scott Humphrey, the producer of his two solo albums and it helps move the movie along, rather than just serving as background music. Zombie does everything right giving us a film that serves as a throwback to the golden age of horror, the pre-slasher era of the 1970s. This is the best horror film to come out since The Mothman Prophecies and easily one of the best horror films to come out in the past ten years.",House of 1000 Corpses

What gets to me is that he apparently had a moment where he said to himself, ""Good golly, Robert, we've got to STYLIZE this thing!  That's the only thing for it!""  ""Stylize"" is a Hollywood word that means ""I'm gonna do some wacky crap with the camera and edit it like a crack addict and pretend it means something.""No, no, it was REAL scary though.  Trust me.  Nightmares for weeks.  It was almost as scary as that episode of ""Cosby"" where Theo pierces his ear.It's full of nasty grossness, I'll give it that.

Lion Gate got the right to release this when multiple studios including Universal, gave this movie the AXE. Well onto the movie, this was a decent directorial debut from Rob Zombie and it turned out to be a fairly decent horror movie with a great cast, gore, but a not-so original story line. The part that was very disturbing had to be the beginning with Capt. Spaulding and friends taking care of some robbers and open to the Rob Zombie music with credits. The story drags a bit from that part up until the middle where we discover the true intentions of the Firefly clan and up comes Dr. Satan and his diabolical creation chasing after the lead girl at the end. The make-up effects for Dr. Satan and his creations were well done and the acting from Sid Haig and Bill Mosely were classic and I like that in a good horror movie. The disappointing fact had to be that the movie was supposed to resemble Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and it seemed to copy it instead of taking the main aspects of the movie and taking it from there. Still worth a check if you are curious and are a Rob Zombie fan. Still, I recommend The Devil's Rejects.7/10 stars",House of 1000 Corpses
194,TheyKilledTheGiggler,An Awesome and Crazy Ride!!!!!,10,13 April 2003,"I recently saw the long delayed Rob Zombie film House of 1000 Corpses a day after it opened and boy was it something. First off critics bashed this film and secondly many people probably didn't get the set up and style of the film. To really enjoy this film it helps to be a fan of Rob Zombie's music. I've been a big fan of Rob Zombie's music since he was apart of White Zombie and I also enjoy his crazy artwork. Rob Zombie's artwork is something straight from a horror show on acid. For those of you who either don't know or don't remember Rob Zombie did the artwork to the hallucination scene in Beavis and Butthead Do America. So anyways, like many have been saying, it really helps to be a Rob Zombie fan to understand and enjoy this movie to the fullest but even if your not you might still enjoy this campy throwback grindhouse style horror film. So what did I think of it? I loved this movie. The whole film played like a tour of Rob Zombie's mind and included some awesome effects and slick  visuals. There are many horror veterans in this film including Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding, a clown who runs a spookshow gas station (with free complementary chicken) and Karen Black as Mother Firefly (the mother of a house of crazies) The film also features Bill Mosely (as Otis) once again playing a ghoulish character. The plot circles around a group of 2 guys 2 girls who stop at Captain Spauldings to get gas. While there they check out Captain Spauldings little horror show and attractions inside including a ""Death Ride"" profiling different maniacs/killers. One of the legends is that of a sadistic Doctor named ""Dr. Satan"" Eager to find out whether or not the legend is true or not the group is given a map and while on the road run into a hitch-hiker named Ms. Bunny (Sheri Moon) who leads them to her house which as you can tell from the title is a bad move. The film is very much like a mix of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Motel Hell but also adds a mix of exploitation humor and is given a campy throwback feel. The whole film is a fun experience and a rollocoster ride full of scenes that can make many jump at times. The movie was a tad bit different from what I was expecting but not by much. The film still delivered what I would expect from Rob Zombie and I am hoping there is a sequel. Overall a very fun movie, but for a selected audience ****/****",House of 1000 Corpses

Not really. Is it twisted? You're damn right it is!!! For 90 minutes, I found myself laughing, marvelling at Zombie's direction and being disturbed by a few scenes.As long as most genre fans can set the hype aside (this isn't the be-all-end-all of the genre...sorry, folks) they'll have an absolute blast with this film. Any fan of Zombie's should no EXACTLY what to expect. It oozes his persona. It's a rollercoaster ride straight through his brain.
This is a film made by a genre fan for genre fans. There's nearly hundreds of vague nods to old horror films (the 'Halloween' reference had me slapping my knee) that run constantly from beginning to end. And luckily, Zombie's personal style and warped imagination make this seem like a seperate entity from all his influences. As a horror fan, I've seen films much more risque. But as far as big studio-made films go, this is the most twisted and depraved genre film to be thrust onto general audiences. It's the absolute antithesis of the safe, crowd-pleasing teen horror film. For that reason alone, Zombie has succeeded and this is as important a film as fans were hoping for...because it's success will mean a brighter future for the genre. BIG THUMBS UP HERE!!!

It is more like a copy of a copy of Texas Chainsaw Masacre II mixed up (in a very unmotivated way) with Italian gore-movies like Fulci made them. The dialog though totally silly and one-dimensional is witty sometimes and i wished the nerds would have lived longer because they were my favorite characters. The end is a total mess and makes no sense at all but maybe there is some kind of weird psychotronic tradition followed here. It's a pity that with all its supposed to be ""gruesome"" imaginary the movie never is horror- or terrifying. It's worth watching for some great performances, though.",House of 1000 Corpses
198,scarletheels,Mediocre,6,16 June 2004,"Where to begin?I'm not going to over analyze this film....or analyze it all, for that matter. Don't faint--this movie actually entertained me. I can't claim that it was the most impressive horror flick that I have ever seen; however, it wasn't the worst either. It amused and unsettled me, and for the most part, did its job.I'm not going to delve into the acting, the dialogue, or the manner in which it was shot. There are two gripes that I have. One is that it completely lacked any truly scary parts. Sure, it depicted numerous graphically violent scenes of torture and murder, but I never once jumped out of my seat or held my breath.!!!!! SPOILER (?) !!!!!The other grievance I have with House of 1,000 Corpses is the ending. Not the conclusion itself--I'm all for the 'bad guys' triumphing at the end--Doctor Satan's henchman type assistant with the axe was downright cheesy and too 'out there'. If he had been cast as more of a human figure, it possibly would have been more terrifying.If you don't mind sub-par acting, a weak plot, an irritating laugh, and senseless, bloody torture and killing, then go ahead, give this movie a chance. If you need somewhat of a solid plot and coherent acting, better steer clear of this little number by rocker Rob Zombie.",House of 1000 Corpses
199,Newski_the_Hippie,Not many people appreciate a good horror movie,9,17 December 2004,"Something troubling about the horror genre. Slasher films have stopped being slasher films and play up to expectations instead of trying to go beyond (Freddy vs. Jason, Jason X) and just so many films that claim to be horror but are nothing but action films (Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead), and the PG 13 rating opened the doorway for films that lack any sort of real terror, only a few things that go bump in the night (The Ring, The Grudge, The Haunting).House of 1000 corpses is one of the greatest horror films of recent years. It may not be the best (I can't forget the pseudophilosophy ramblings of 28 Days later). House of 1000 corpses, Rob Zombie's directorial debut, is a very well made piece of work. It does follow the typical horror movie trends (I knew they shouldn't have picked up that hitchhiker) but is made with such precision and style that the momentary clichés cease to matter. Zombie added weird tints, obscene and insane images throughout the film, which he said was to ""Make the film seem weirder."" Though that was not necessary, since we are glued after the young hitchhiker brings one of the heroes to her house.""I like to rip off the arms and legs of my dolls then nail them to my wall"" she says in her perky voice. The four writers should have listened to Captain Spaulding, who told them that trying to solve the mystery of Doctor Satan was a waste of time. What began as a simple diversion becomes a hellish existence of torture, death, and harsh escapes.Its very stylishly directed, with the notably chilling scene of what would be nothing in any other movie in which a police officer is shot in the head. The first few scenes of Captian Spaulding's place are similar to some of the shots from the lesser horror film The Funhouse. Gore is used very effectively in this movie, making you cringe but cutting a way just as the squeamish look away.Four Stars. Most people do not appreciate this movie, and critics saw it just the same as disappointed horror fans. Even people who like the movie do not understand my four star rating. Yet the movie surpassed all expectations, was never boring, always creepy, skillful direction, a great sense of atmosphere, great acting, and you expect me to give it anything else?",House of 1000 Corpses
200,isotope2112,Blah,2,14 October 2003,"House of 1000 Corpses was pretty sub-standard.  Not scary, not really very gory, and the cinematic style was too reminiscent of Natural Born Killers.

201,TonysLittleFriend,Captain Spaulding ain't no Captain Howdy,5,4 September 2004,"Rob Zomie's first movie, is well a little weird. for a movie that's really short it felt long.

When the four take off in search of finding the tree that Dr. Satan was hung from, they pick up hitchhiker Baby. When their car breaks down, Baby invites them into her house. This is where the two couples meet the Firefly family, a murderous clan of bizarre people. As the family attacks the unsuspecting couples, Jerry and his friends try to survive the house of 1000 corpses and it's dark secrets.I enjoyed it, but it's very messed up.

202,MrNefarious,You know what your getting into...,10,12 April 2003,"I want to first of all say that the previews and the title of this film give you a pretty good idea what you are getting yourself into. Fans of Rob Zombie and his music will have a better idea than the average Joe. Personally, I still like Rob Zombies music,but I was a much bigger fan when he was in ""White Zombie"". Anyways, this movie was great. It was gory,suspenseful,funny,and fun to watch. It caused some major audience reaction. By the way that is probably the last time I am going on opening night to any film. I will stick to opening weekend Sunday late night from now on. Being elbowed by some guy every time his chick jumped and screamed on him was not fun at all. There were some couples getting up and leaving during the film because they couldn't take it. It is relentless. I hear Rob had to cut out only less than 10 seconds of the film to get his R rating. I hope that is put back in the DVD version. Very well shot. Perfect mood was set by lighting and camera work. It is a must see. A must own. A piece of history. Enjoy. 10 out of 10",House of 1000 Corpses
203,miguelsanchez69,this movie is just bad,1,16 July 2003,"Some movies are so bad they're funny. This isn't one of those. It's one of those gee I want an hour and a half of my life back kind of bad movies. People have said Universal delayed release of this film because it was too gory. I don't mind gory movies, so I decided to check this one out. Well I was surprised, when I found most of the gore in the movie was fairly tasteful by today's standards. I mean after the Evil Dead movies and Dead Alive, this looks like Mary Poppins. I think what's more likely is distribution got canned when they realized this movie was crap. Or maybe they just liked the movie better the first time they saw it when it was called the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. By the way TCM is NOT from the classic age of horror, it's from the 70s. Classic Horror is the Universal age people. Rent White Zombie (yes there is an excellent movie that Rob Zombie's band borrowed their name from) Island of Lost Souls or Bride of Frankenstein if you want classic horror. Horror films did not begin in 1970. But anyway, this movie is horribly derivative of 70s horror. The acting is bad, the sets are worse. The directing, replete with gimmicky negative photography, yellow lenses, and naked people prancing about who are not even in the movie is terrible. The writing is worse, with an incredibly simple and predictable plot, inane dialogue and an inconsistent tone as well as an unsatisfying conflict, climax and denouemont, and its not really scary either. The only decent moments in the movie are decent because they have been plagiarized, and generally involve Ms. Moon (who is actually fairly interesting despite her underwritten part). Very amateurish film that wouldn't be out at all if Rob Zombie wasn't the director. Rob Zombie should stick to making music. If you want to watch a 70s horror film rent the original item - not this. NOT RECOMMENDED at all. The only thing I found scary about this movie is the notion that it might spawn a sequel.",House of 1000 Corpses
204,Pigbelly,I kept trying to flush but this movie just wouldn't go down,1,26 February 2005,"This is a very amateurish attempt at a film. The ""characters"" are pointless and, due to the director's ineptitude, tries to give his baddies a Hellraiser-type mythology and ends up over-sympathizing with his villains. This leaves the audience with nothing to care about. This film looks like it was made by dumb teenage boys from a small town who read too many comic books. It is inane and juvenile and just plain awful. It amazes me that anyone would give this movie higher than a 3 but I guess there are some die hard Rob Zombie fans out there. I have actually taken this movie out of the hands of people in the video store and told them to they would thank me for it. Pssst... Rob.... stick to music buddy.",House of 1000 Corpses

Torture porn is good if it makes you realise how crap the world is, torture porn because it is ""kewl"" is so wrong it makes my skin crawl. And that's what this was. Sure the fan boys without lives will say otherwise. And that's the point, if you have a life you'll be sickened and disgusted by this, just not in a good way. It's been more than nine months since I was stupid enough to watch this movie. I'm not religious, I don't believe in god but these people are from the wrong side of the tracks.

210,thewag777,Brilliantly Wicked,9,3 August 2005,"The song says it all, 'This is a house built on sin.' This movie has a somewhat 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' quality to it. But make no mistake, it is an original idea. A group of young adults are exploring the fascinating little places found in rural America and come across this clown fellow with a little gas station/horror ride. After learning the legend of Dr. Satan, they decide to pursue. They come across this rather eccentric family of fun loving evildoers, and all hell brakes loose.The villains of this 'House of 1000 Corpses' have their own little eccentricities that make you fall in love with them, even if they are murdering sadists, he he. Baby has this youthful giggle as she engages in her inhumanity towards her house guests. She also does an excellent Betty Boop impression, though she doesn't look like her. The long haired artistic rebel has his insane paranoid outlook as he brakes societies shackles and frees his mind to do his work. Wait 'till you see his art, you'll love it. The mother is hospitable but a bit too flirtatious to call a lady.This movie is one wickedly humorous horror film done on a pretty low budget, though not nearly as low as many others. I highly recommend this for those who are fascinated by the nature of evil, for this movie certainly portrays it well.Definitely a 9 out of 10.

212,TobyS,"Very visual, not a bad first...",8,23 August 2003,"House of 1000 Corpses is a throw back to the old 1970s films like The Hills Have Eyes, Last House on the Left, and yes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Rob Zombie has stated that he wanted to do this film because he was tired of the sh*t being put out by Hollywood like Scream and its to numerous to count knock-offs.  While I did enjoy Scream and a few of its followers, I also was waiting for a film that shadows the '70s horror films to be brought to the screen.After being dropped by Universal, adopted and then abandoned by MGM, Lions Gate finally picked this puppy up and released it.  I was glad to see that (for low-budget horror movie standards), it did quite well in the theatre.Having finally seen it on DVD, I was quite impressed with the film. Visually, it rocks.  Rob Zombie has a great eye for style and casting.  And while it does pay homage to many of the films I mentioned above, I don't think that's a negative because from everything I've read about this film, those homages were all intentional.If you're reading this, you probably already know the story, so I'm not going to get into it again.  The only thing I will say is that Zombie achieved his goal at shocking.  While the film's rep may lead some to feel the final product is a let down, I for one enjoyed it very much.  My only negative comments are that A: after the ""burial"" scene, it seemed like I was now watching a totally different film.  Perhaps I missed a key point, and I plan to watch the film again to see if I can pick up on the link.  And, B: after watching the extras on the DVD, there seem to be a lot of scenes that were cut from the final film.  I understand that Zombie took some scenes out to garner an ""R"" rating.  Why not either release the film on DVD as an ""unrated"" disk, or at least put those scenes in the extras?  Oh, well.All in all, you have to enjoy a special type of Horror (yes, a capital ""H"") film to enjoy House of 1000 Corpses.  If all you've seen are Scream, Urban Legend and any of the other ""cast from WB"" horror films, then no, you probably will hate this movie.  But, if you enjoy the old-time films by Craven, Hooper and others, then come on in to Capt. Spaulding's and have a grand ole time!My grade: B",House of 1000 Corpses
213,JasonXIX,"All Style, No Substance",2,17 September 2019,"Basically the film equivalent of a circus geek show. It's like watching 90 minutes of freaks biting the heads off chickens.

Furthermore the setting, the atmosphere is really scary, the house our villians are staying in has that Texas chainsaw massacre feel , like a really HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES eerie type of feel . I loved the style , the soundtrack is awesome. The characters are extremely well written. Especially our villains. Captain Spaulding is both amusing and a guy I wouldn't want to mess with, baby is super hot and deadly crazy , and Otis feels like a crossover between Charles Manson and a weird outback serial killer that spends too much time alone. Mother firefly is one  mess . I liked the cutaway scenes with baby and the skeleton. It showed us who these characters really are. Great sets!! Especially doctor Satan set. The gore is truly disturbing and realistic. Otis is one crazy motherf#cke# and so is baby.

215,youdontsmellbad,labor of love (of sorts),7,17 April 2003,"Mister Zombie has proven that he can run a film crew by directing his last I-don't-know-how-many videos, and now he has simply proven that he can make something longer.Clearly, Rob Zombie is a born artist.  A songwriter who designs his own album covers, directs his own videos, and now makes a film that is not only watchable, it's a blast.  ""House of 1000 corpses"" is not an attempt  to sell soundtracks, or jumpstart a pathetic second career; it's a bona fide film oozing with gleeful self-parody and affection for it's own material.The plot follows a basic kids'-car-breaks-down, kids-get-stuck-and-end-up-getting-ripped- apart-by-psychos formula.  The performances, especially Sid Haig's, are mostly over-the-top and fill the screen with all the energy needed to handle the disturbing material.  Zombie's direction is like that of his videos: abrupt, colorful (sort of), and clearly a bit self-indulgent.I question the casting by Zombie of his wife as one of the villians.  the part was clearly written for her, and she plays it correctly.  But her acting is (intentionally) annoying, and in movies like this, characters like hers should be repaid, usually by being killed, for annoying me.  She isn't. Sure, this probably doesn't bother most people.But generally you get what you want, a spectacle. Lot's of people getting killed, and lot's of screwy camera techniques.

216,Imaculata,Director Rob Zombie seems more in love with the villains,6,29 April 2016,"The House of a 1000 Corpses starts off pretty good. It has a unique freaky style to it, with weird video filters, split screens and some really fun characters. The opening immediately sets the tone, and establishes a weird and funny style. Its a horror movie with a big wink to the audience.But unfortunately, while the movie does start off strong, it quickly gets stuck in the predictable plot of a bunch of freaks kidnapping and murdering a bunch of teens. None of the victims in this plot are interesting, and none of them seem even remotely competent, or attempting to fight back. And there in lies the real problem with this movie. It feels the director was more in love with the freaks, than the victims.A good horror movie has you rooting for the good guys. It makes you like them, and you hope that they survive. This creates suspense. Then there are also trashy horror movies, in which you just want everyone to die violently. Was this movie trying to be in the latter category? Well, it doesn't quite work. Plus the director overindulges in weird video filters, and especially shooting scenes in negative. So a style that at first seems original and refreshing, eventually outstays its welcome.The plot also really doesn't go anywhere. Its simply a case of waiting for everyone to die.... and the outcome is as predictable as you'd expect. Even the twist at the end is entirely predictable, to the point where it is just disappointing. That cliché end-twist instantly took the rating down a notch for being so done to death.I will give the movie credit for its excellent soundtrack, sets, costumes, and effects. The movie doesn't indulge too much in gross violence. In fact, I was surprised that a lot of violence is merely hinted at, or shown very briefly. So kudos for that.

There is no crafted story here. There are no real characters. It is just sick and demented methods of sick torture and violence. Where is the entertainment here? Why was this movie made?

I don't see how he could top it. This is NOT a movie that people who don't like the genre should be watching. I don't think they'd be able to stomach it.

222,John-423,a MASSIVE letdown in almost ever sense of the word...,3,17 April 2003,"I guess you could say I have had a rather unhealthy obsession with horror films for a good 20 years now. In that period I have seen the good, bad, horrible and pretty much everything in between, and given the stagnate and pathetic state of the horror genre since the early 90's I was literally salivating upon hearing the news of Mr. Zombies little opus given his apparent love of horror and exploitation films. Sadly though the comparisons to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House on the Left and classics like Bloodsucking freaks (among others)  are pretty much a sacrilege given how utterly insipid and underdone the film came out. COME ON PEOPLE, How can you even mention this failure in the same breath as those films? I can see how Rob Zombies fans will love it no matter what, but as for a fan who has seen the kind of films this is supposed to emulate I have to say it does very little to put it self in their league. First off it has one of the single most underdeveloped casts ever, and by that once you reach the films final climax its actually hard to differentiate which of the young ladies it actually was (trust me, She is no Sally Hardesty), and as for the rest you could really give two s**ts about them given that there is pretty much nothing interesting or even slightly redeeming about them. I mean hey, its ok to have non heroic characters and average Joe Normal types, but if you do nothing to make them matter in contrast to the bad guys who are out to do them in, what the hell good is it? Then on the other side of the coin if you have a  `family' that never really gels like this one why would you even want to even cheer the protagonists demise at their hands? Oh and did I mention Dr. Satan? Well no reason to, because much like the rest of the film he matters very little as well since there is really no rhyme or reason to his existence and place in the movie. Genre faves like Bill Mosely and Sid Haig were pretty much wasted here in how they were used as well, Mosely in fact was downright annoying, despite being in one of the only stand out parts in the film like Haig.very sad given how that as `Chop Top' he totally stole the show in Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2. Zombies wife was only there because, well.. you guessed it. she's his wife. Jesus, she was beyond annoying and among the worst actresses I have ever seen in Psychotronic celluloid, she made Heather Langenkamp look like Meryl Streep . Once you look past the cast you get to the actual filmmaker though and it's a damned shame that instead of trying to deliver a REAL exploitation film he seemed more into using his script (which I must add was on par with what a 6th grader might write, the dialogue was ATROCIOUS and not even funny) and camera as a self indulgent showcase for his garbage artwork, And MTV workings as opposed to making a real fright film. I swear to sweet Satan below that the break away vignette's that took place every 2 or 3 minutes killed the flow of the film dead until the burial scene (which I did love by the way). Perhaps lost in all of this though is the potential that was clearly wasted due to his lack of execution, in fact I will say that once you get to the burial scene the film actually starts to warm up a bit and since the MTVesque crap stops you actually get a 10 to 15 min period in which you can see if Rob had left the psychobilly egotrip behind the entire film would have been quite good. The chase scene was pretty neat, and the best part in this abysmal flick. Oh and the selling point was shock, but I cant say it was that. in comparison to recent films like Wild Zero (horribly bad but well done in a perverse sense) and Takashi Miikes Koroshiya 1 it falls incredibly flat. My advice to Rob Zombie is to stick to the pop garbage you have done since leaving Caroline records and selling your soul to MTV over 10 years ago, because as this film proves just because you like good horror it sure as hell does not mean you are capable of making it. A massive letdown. 3/10.",House of 1000 Corpses

It just felt like a boring meandering route we had to take to see these characters ******************SPOILERS************************* die. Any movie that relies too heavily on gore, torture or shock value seems to fall into this trap.If it was meant to be comedy, it failed because the over-the-top characters were goofy, but never clever.Ultimately it was too silly to be scary and not silly enough to be funny.

225,gregmovies,A very weird film,6,11 September 2008,"House of 1,000 Corpses is one of the oddest horror films I have ever seen. The unusual villains, sets, and overall feel make this an interesting experiment in horror cinema. The film is far from great, but it was pretty good and sets the stage for its much better sequel, ""The Devil's Rejects"". The horror and violent scenes are only OK, apparently because this was heavily cut to avoid an NC-17, and an unrated version hasn't been released. The dark humor was the best thing about the film, creating an interesting atmosphere. Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding was definitely this movie's highlight, and made it worth the $5 I spent on the DVD. Unfortunately, the film is over the top too often. This movie feels like the Natural Born Killers of horror. The color can sometimes be distracting, and the screenplay isn't strong.Overall, this is more of an interesting film than a good one. I give it 6/10.",House of 1000 Corpses

This was without a doubt, one of the most useless wastes of cinema ever! Even the original and vastly overrated Texas Chainsaw Massacre was better.

In fact, during the whole movie I just kept saying ""Oh they already did that in TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"". The way the movie's shot would've been cool if it were under more professional direction. I saw some cool ideas in the cinematography, but the way it was cut together was not effective.

229,manalone923,"If you're interested by the time the opening credits start, you'll like it",8,3 November 2003,"Ok, to start with, there's a great deal of argument for this film.  Those who don't enjoy it probably just don't ""get"" it.  I don't mean that they're senseless or less intelligent, I simply mean that, to appreciate what this movie is, you don't have to love Rob Zombie, or think of him as a genius, you just have to ""get it"".  You need to be in a certain mood, not look at it the way you'd look at a film like the Sixth Sense, which itself was a phenomenal film but which also had a much different style and tone.  No, in Corpses, the tone is different.  This is more or less a campy film. Not dopey Scooby Doo camp, featuring silly gags and lame one-liners, and not Scream camp, which is like having a bunch of kids who are smart enough to be hip and modern but still fall prey to killers in predictable ways (though the original Scream was great).  Corpses on the other hand, is very, very similar to the classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original).  Yes, a group of kids snoops where they should'nt, and yes, they will probably die. But this movie focuses on the antagonists.  Right from the start, we meet and spend some time with lovable Captain Spaulding, proprieter of a backwater gas station and connected ""Murder Ride"" theme park attraction. He's a goofball, but we're more inclined to like him than any of the dorky, ""normal"" characters who stumble upon his establishment.  And that's how most of the movie is set up.  We aren't led to root for these kids, we're led to instead be fascinated/appalled by the strange family that they soon encounter.  And the reason this is, in my opinion, is because they're just way more interesting.  Bad things happen to the kids (I hope this isn't considered giving anything away in a review of a movie with a title like this).  But the thing is, the demented family enjoys what they do.  In their eyes, they're just living their lives like they always do.  They weren't out hunting for victims.  These kids just stumble into their lives, and we watch their odd behavior as a result. In the last 20 or so minutes, the film does get much darker and cruel, but even by the end we can't stop thinking that, naturally, those kids should've just not been stupid enough to stick around a bunch of people like this.
  Zombie edits the film in such a way that, pretty regularly, juxtaposed images will pop up in between the regular continuity of the film (those who enjoyed the film will recall the ""skunk ape"" segment). I believe this is an appropriate choice, as the strange sudden cuts add to the disorient and discomfort of the viewer, parallel to what those dumb kids onscreen must be feeling.  While watching the film, you get the sense of ""this is a little far out, maybe I should turn it off"".  Well, that's probably akin to what those kids feel, so I believe this is an effective method of keeping us in a state of intimacy with the strange behavior onscreen.    But even despite this, the film does have a plot and you aren't left with any untied ends, and I think the final verdict as to whether or not you like it is whether you're with it from the start.  If you're interested or enjoying the movie by the time the opening credits start, 5 minutes in, you'll ""get"", or be along with, this film.

After a while you are just waiting for them all to die... At one point there is a big long drawn out chase after this one ugly girl and you just want them to catch her and play with her insides. Maybe I've gotten a little ahead of myself. The movie is about these 4 stupid teens who go in search of this twisted doctor who is a sick legend, and they come across these... Texas chainsaw like family. They are like the addams family except they are perverts too. They are disgusting. One of them is this whore girl who loves dolls and she beheads them. And this other guy looks like hes from Rockey Horror Picture show. The cops in this movie are stupid but that was a given since it is a horror movie and all those movies the cops are brainless. The movie is comical in how moronic it is.

233,thale05,"An Odd, Irreverent Precursor to the Greatest Movie of All Time",5,5 March 2011,"I have been a fan of Rob Zombie's music and films for over a year now. His career theme has revolved around the horror genre. He passionately emphasizes his love of horror through his songs, music videos, and movies. He's a man I have come to admire and respect for these reasons. However, I have to say his cinematic career did not start all so well with ""House of 1000 Corpses"". It's normal for a person to mess up in a film debut but Zombie was quick to fix the mistakes with his next film, ""The Devil's Rejects"", which is one of my favorite movies of all time. But for what ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is, it is an effort worth checking out of curiosity. Two traveling teenage couples get gas at a place called Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen where they become acquainted with the owner. He gives him a tour of his museum and tells them about one of the local legends, Dr. Satan. Come on, you got to love that name! Dr. Satan was a surgeon who tried to create a race of super humans consisting of the mentally ill by subjecting them to ""primitive brain surgery"". The story intrigues the gang so much that they want to solve the mystery of his disappearance on Halloween Eve. They explore the rural area and encounter a bizarre family along the way who claim to know a little thing or two about the doctor. However, it turns out that the family is a group of serial killers and the teens find themselves in a circus of violence and bloodshed. The movie is heavily reminiscent to Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and it pays tribute to other horror movies. I felt as if I was watching one of Zombie's earlier music videos like ""Dragula"" but this is supposed to be a movie, not a music video. The random sequences where people are talking to the camera like a documentary or dancing in some sequence seem out of place in a movie and more suited to one of Zombie's videos. Amidst the brutality and torture, Zombie brings in goofy, campy humor that I occasionally laughed at, especially in the beginning scene. It's what brings ""House of 1000 Corpses"" down because it feels as if Zombie doesn't know what direction and tone he wants to take. Should we focus on the sadistic macabre or the silly humor of the movie? I have come to agree with Staci Layne Wilson's assessment that the people in ""House of 1000 Corpses"" are more like caricatures than characters. The killers, in particular, don't have enough time to fully develop their personalities for an audience like characters do but they are seen as images meant to reflect something in society. I interpreted it as different forms of violence and conflict in America. Captain Spaulding (played by Sid Haig) is my favorite person in the film because he evokes the majority of the humor and is entertaining when he does so. To me, he represents an America that takes foreign policy to an extreme. He will mock or kill any stranger that mocks or threatens him. Otis Driftwood (Bill Moseley) would represent an oppressive part of America. He also seems to hate the USA (one of his shirts encourages the burning of the American flag) for being a haven of the people he looks down on. Sheri Moon Zombie plays Baby, a sadistic, blood-licking killer who revels in violence and craves the pain of the tortured. Is it just me or does she remind me of DeeDee from ""Dexter's Laboratory""? Baby would probably represent the side of America that feels an obligation to kill someone when it is absolutely necessary without conviction. Grandpa Hugo (played by the late Dennis Fimple) is truly a hoot. He screams vulgarity at the top of his lungs and thinks he is a comedian while only a minority finds him entertaining. Overall, most of the acting is below average but it's mostly what the caricatures represent that matters.""House of 1000 Corpses"" has the right amount of blood it needs to sicken people but doesn't deliver the kind of horror I would want. Some of the scare moments are more comical than scary such as ""Fish Boy"" and the final revelations near the end. It's a movie that doesn't take itself so seriously and usually runs wild. When you see it, step back a little and try to appreciate what Rob Zombie has tried to do. I assure you, Rob recognized the faults and delivered a golden sequel but that's another review. My Rating: 5/10",House of 1000 Corpses
234,oso_travis,A strong debut by Mr. Zombie. He has started his career with the right foot,7,14 July 2004,"House of 1000 Corpses. Directed by rocker Rob Zombie. ***Back in 1996 ""Scream"", directed by Wes Craven,was released. It certainly was a hit, involving both audience and critics. It was an open invitation to re-visit the gore subgenre that have been forsaken by big studios, when they were going after subtle and more atmospheric horror fare(""Interview with the Vampire"", ""Dracula"").But like usual, studios went nuts about it and they focused their efforts in bringing cheap and light slasher gore, in the vein of ""I know what you did"" and both ""Urban Legends""; nothing serious, everything was a parody of itself. More crapfests were yet to come with ""Valentine"" and ""Freddy vs. Jason"", this one being the best example of the low point gore films had reached.That's why I'm happy: Mr. Zombie first directorial effort is very impressive and refreshing: it vitalizes the gore subgenre just as Mr. Boyle vitalized zombie. He takes the film seriously and shows some real talent behind the scenes. He is on the right way to become a great gore director.Using with intelligence and wit ""old"" video and sound footage, he creates textures, pacings, environments that work pretty damned well on the film. The structure and pacing follows a virtuoso crescendo towards the climax, which is shocking and disturbing. In deed, both the visuals and the pacing turn the film into a nightmare that was conceived in the pit of hell. If Lynch had directed a gore film, I'm positive that ""House of 1000 corpses"" would have looked alike.Of course the film is far from flawless, but still, the key elements on it, help it to get above mediocrity. The film has good writing, the actors are very competent, and the sound design is especially made to support the ""textures"" Mr. Zombie worked on here.I can't see why it has polarized opinions. The film is closer to films like ""The Hunger"" and ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" than to usual slasher fare. Actually I don't think ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was a direct inspiration for it.More disturbing and shocking, than actually scary or chilling, this film is a must-see piece for genre fans.

You can brag that this film is disturbing and you would be correct, but is that anything to brag about? I guess seeing young girls tied up and tortured is a thrill to somebody that was never able to get them, which is where Zombie and his fans seem to be coming from.

Since almost all horror films post-1990 (with the necessary exception of John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness) have sucked, it's finally refreshing to see something worth watching. NOTE: See Texas Chainsaw Massacre before you see this movie. If you don't have a strong background in 70s and 80s horror, the value of this film may not be much to you. (Unless you are a die-hard Rob Zombie fan-then it will impress you anyway...or at least confirm that Zombie is psycho)I'm not going to get into the whole thing, but this film is most notable for the excellent cast (lots of 70s and 80s exploitation stars), some nice editing of creepy/flashy imagery, an awesome soundtrack (of course), great use of sound, some great humor and I loved the way history's infamous killers were incorporated (Manson women, Ed Gein, etc.).Extra note: There's two sides to a scary movie: Psychological horror (probably can't happen but it's creepy)and Reality horror (this could happen).If you saw the American bastardization of The Ring, and thought it was scary...that film isn't a horror film, it's a suspense film. The film tries to scare you by making you jump at opportune moments WHILE bombarding you with too many plot elements.House of 1000 Corpses is a reality horror film. While there's a few ""jump"" moments, the main focus is on scary people, gory situations and what would most likely happen given the situation. Texas Chainsaw was as real as you can get, House just makes things more perverse and flashy.And...good horror films:a) don't have to have a happy ending b) don't necessarily have to have a plot c) don't have to make you jump every 2 secondsIf you disagree, then you don't know squat about horror movies and probably liked Halloween Resurrection, Haunting (remake), House On Haunted Hill (remake), Dracula 2000, anything after the opening minutes of Scream (including sequels) and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (even though they are all GARBAGE).",House of 1000 Corpses

I feel it is a respectful thing to do, like playing a song in tribute. You take older material and put your own stamp on it, not because you are stealing it, but because you love it. This is an admirable thing for Rob Zombie to do. Yes, it is true that some of the acting was cheesy in the film, and that at times it may have been hard to sympathize or believe the characters, but this is part of the films appeal. It's like the old drive in movies--it's fun to watch because of this. I also enjoyed how it takes place in the 70's--it added to the effect of the film. Thumbs up Mr. Zombie",House of 1000 Corpses

The rednecks there overuse the word ""pussy"" so much that you may be led to believe that you're either in a no-kill cat shelter or talking about guys in attendance at a Rob Zombie concert. Moronic police investigate, and there's a great (by great, I mean terribly boring) 90 second scene (which seems to last for agonizing days), that's supposed to be suspenseful (but is actually ridiculously stupid), with a redneck's gun against a cop's head.

244,ElectricWarlock,Rob Zombie's film debut and masterpiece,10,23 July 2013,"Most people already knew that Rob Zombie was a talented musician, but this film proved to us that he was talented at more than just music. He is also a wonderful director, as this film showed. My favorite part of the film is definitely the characters. The Firefly family (which as everyone who has seen the film knows is the family of serial killers) are some of the most fascinating villains I have ever seen in any horror film. You should technically despise them because they are evil, sadistic serial killers, but for some reason I don't. They have a sense of humor and their own distinct personalities. They aren't your typical silent, faceless serial killer wearing a mask and carrying a large weapon like in many other horror films. They have their own unique character traits that separate them from many other horror villains. All of Rob Zombie's films share this quality in that even the most minor characters have their own backstory and personality so I believe that the building of characters is Rob's strongest trait as a filmmaker.The synopsis sounds like your stereotypical, run-of-the-mill slasher film in which a group of people whose car ""breaks down"" seek refuge in a house full of serial killers overnight. But it is presented in a bizarre, unique style that only Rob Zombie can master that it is easily distinctive from any other similar horror film. It has a certain quality of surrealism to it that makes the film seem like a crazy dream or hallucination at times rather than a simple movie. That is a quality that few other directors can make their films possess. Not only is the film well directed, but it is also well acted. For me, the standout performance is Sheri Moon (the wife of Rob Zombie) as Baby Firefly. You could tell she really got into her character and I had trouble telling she was acting. It was almost like she temporarily became Baby during the making of the film. She was evil and sadistic but still possessed a quality of childlike innocence and I think that few actresses are capable of something like that. Karen Black, Sid Haig, and Bill Moseley who are three of my all time favorite actors are also included in the cast and do a wonderful job at portraying their characters. I don't think there was one weak performance in the entire film. It seemed like everyone truly loved playing their characters and truly had fun starring in the film.The movie is extremely violent, gory, and has it's share of foul language and nudity. Many would argue that it is trashy for that reason, but if those qualities make the film trashy then so be it. I like it anyways because it is delightfully entertaining and an outrageously fun film. It's Rob Zombie's first film but you can barely tell. This film made him look like a professional that has been directing films for years. For someone to make what to me is the best horror film of the 21st century so far as their first film shows a sign of a great director and none of his films have disappointed me yet.

After sitting through it a feeling of deja vu and bland disinterest set in. I could imagine two schools of fans for this film, the younger gore fan who has just got into horror films, or the older fan who has watched the original 70's and 80's exploitation/gore movies and likes the genre. However, as a viewer who has seen a fair amount of these types of films, I really wished I had watched ""Blood Sucking Freaks"" again instead, and that really says a lot. This style of movie has been done to death (sorry), some mild gore, a bit of torture, the villains as the anti-heroes, etc. A bit of homage is fine, but to base your whole directing career on it, as Rob Zombie seems to be doing, is a bit rich. The trouble is the original films were fun, but weren't that great in the first place. If you are a younger viewer then definitely watch ""House Of 1000 Corpses"", I think it's a stage all horror fans must go through and makes you appreciate the finer things.

One phrase, one set of seemingly meaningless words, sums up the entirety of my newly acquired misery, and it is _THE HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES_!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! The simple utterance of it makes me wish I had chosen a more lethal method of suicide. God, what a cruel world this is!!!!!!!!!

I love horror movies, even some of the sh*tty ones, but FOR THE LOVE OF JESUS this movie was a train wreck! I've never seen such a failure in all my life! Rob Zombie has not only committed career suicide but has lost a fan, ME!! If I could get out of this hospital bed I'd go rip him a new A**HOLE!!

And they get enough material for an entire book when they are held hostage by the Fireflys, a family who become the couples worst nightmare. If you think you've seen this before, you haven't! This is `Texas Chainsaw Massacre' meets `Clive Barker' with `style.' Rob Zombie does a great job in the writing and directing departments by interweaving surrealistic, flashback, and film negative scenes with colorful characters and a story that does follow the rules most of the time, but deviates enough to keep it fresh. One of my favorite techniques is his breaking away to documentary style scenes where the killers talk to the audience as if in an interview or just put on a show in the middle of the mayhem and carnage to reinforce our assumptions that these characters are totally insane. But that's the true horror, because there is absolutely no way to reason with these people. They are going to do some horrific things to you and that's it, so expect some bloody horror here. This one is for die-hard fans of the slasher genre who enjoy watching other peoples' nightmares. This is not for the faint-hearted.

I also admired the direction and style of this film and look forward to Rob Zombie continuing to make more films.  However, I can't say I liked it much.  The problem for me was the lack of creating sympathetic characters that I could care about. They were just fodder for the torture and mayhem that follow.  Now, there never is a dull moment and the violence and gore are pretty intense, but I just never really got too involved in the plot.  It was like watching a music video most of the time.  I believe other horror fans should check it out and some will probably love it while others may be disappointed.  One thing, though, it is a positive event that films like this are finally getting more attention then the usual run of the mill Scream rip-offs.

I thought Rob Zombie's style of gonzo horror would translate well to a full length picture.I was, however, wrong.Zombie lost something when he moved to the big screen. He lost a sense of fun. There were a lot of good attempts, or at least attempts with potential, at making homages to some of the classic cult horror memes that Zombie has used in his musical acts. But they just sort of collapsed on screen, like a flan in a cupboard. What resulted was a mush of MTV style camera tricks, some colourful characters, and some pretty brutal violence. The problem was that these characteristics never coalesced into any kind of whole, and after the first half hour or so, it got pretty damn boring. The rest of the film seemed to meander with no particular direction, just a string of scenes of sadism, peppered with lame cuts and cheesy camera angles.You can tell Zombie was trying, somewhere in there was a seed for a great tribute to grindcore horror. But Zombie just didn't seem to have what it takes as a director to pull it together and make it work.",House of 1000 Corpses

This film was supposedly held up due to excessive violence, grue, etc. I came away with the realization that the movie was just an overamped remake of every family slasher movie that had already come down the pike. General mismanagement of 'shock scenes' left me yawning.

In addition to this, a few hours after I had finished watching House of 1000 Corpses I decided to watch The Devil's Rejects, as I badly wanted to see more of Rob Zombie's style exhibited on-screen.I highly recommend this film; it's perhaps not for the feint-hearted, or for those who like some normality and composure on-screen, however it is a unique, crazy and highly enjoyable light-hearted horror throughout.",House of 1000 Corpses

Some would say that's crazy because this movie won't do well, but I say it was smart considering less than five minutes after arriving to get my seat at 7:30 pm, an announcement was made that the movie was sold out. Nothing could make me happier than to hear this movie was sold out since horror movies these days haven't exactly been up to par and people are starting to ignore the genre (Though who knows, it could have been sold out based on Zombie's fan base). Waiting for the lights to go out in the theater, one thing circled everyone's mind: `I've waited 3 years to see this film.' And so, the lights dimmed, the movie began, and an hour and a half later it was over. So? Without a doubt, this is one of the best horror movies ever made! There wasn't one part of this entire film that didn't have your full attention. Sure, you could see that this thing was butchered to death to give it its R rating, but still, there was just enough in some scenes to really make any horror fan happy. I also should mention, that this is probably one of, if not the funniest, horror film to date. There are jokes and comedy driven dialogue in almost every scene and some of it was just great, especially the character of Spalding. Whoever said this movie had a low budget was completely wrong too! The makeup and sets were awesome, especially during the last minutes of the film when you get to see, well, I won't ruin it but I do stress that the makeup was out of this world. Now there are some minor problems that exist. While the film is set in 1977, a lot of the characters were given horrible lines that make them sound like their from the early 90's. The clothes the characters wear are fine, but the way they talk isn't reminiscent of the 70's at all. The film also is laced with cut scenes of weird images that while sometimes serve a purpose to give you background on the story, aren't completely necessary when they flash in every 3 seconds. Some of them are just annoying and meant to add an exploitation aspect to the film. Not a great idea. To wrap this up, forget what the critics said about it, forget any naysayers of this movie, and judge it for yourself. I went in with a so-so expectation after reading others reviews, and I came out loving it. Any horror fan should at least see this movie once.

256,bigfella2k1,Brilliant genre exercise (with reservations),8,21 April 2003,"(**SPOILERS**)Wow. House of 1000 Corpses does exactly what it promises on the box- it delivers an extremely bloody, brutal hour and a half of horror. When I recently saw it, about four people of an audience of fifteen walked out-strange, you would think that with a title like ""House of 1000 corpses,"" some violence or blood might be involved. Perhaps their idea of a horror film is something like ""Scream"", in which case maybe it's good they left. This is horror in the '70's sense: no big name actors, no complex plot, and no ""character development."" In a sense I think it's superior that we don't know these maniacs and we don't know their motivation for acting the way they do- it adds to our sense of disorientation and lets us sympathize more with the victims. My reservations about the movie are based on Zombie's desire to simply throw everything he possibly could at the screen to see what sticks. So in the last twenty minutes, a story about some redneck serial killers suddenly takes off into science fiction (with what sounds like the ""Terminator"" music playing, no less.) The sets are great, the music is very chilling and atmospheric (if a little anachronistic), and the effects top-notch. Still, this thing is all over the map- from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to ""Rocky Horror"" to ""Natural Born Killers"", Zombie is not afraid to let his influences show. Still, an enjoyable addition to the genre. If you're not put off by buckets of gore and sadistic violence, go see this before some angry parents group yank it out of the theatre.

The film mentioned the likes of Ed Gein and Albert Fish, so it seemed like something that'd keep my attention. However, as the film went on, I couldn't work out if I was actually watching Texas Chainsaw, The Hills Have Eyes, Natural Born Killers, or if someone had just spiked my tea with LSD. I love unconventional horror films, and I'm usually very open minded, but this was far too weird even for my taste. There was no character development, no real explanation (unless I missed it in my perplexed state), and the ending was just a cop-out. I could forgive the mediocre acting as you expect that from certain films, but my God, the young blonde woman was so annoying.

It was sadistic and stuck two fingers up at the suffering audience. I bought House of 1000 Corpses off the back of Devil's Rejects not really knowing what to expect. This story tells the gruesome tale of two young couples who are travelling across the States. One fateful night they stumbled across Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Mayhem, and enchanted with the museum go off to find the mythical legend of Doctor Satan, a notorious figure in the neighbourhood but also a full-time sadistic, malevolent torturer. Picking up the beautiful Baby (played ever so psychotically by Sherri Moon) on the way the couples soon find themselves with a bit of tyre trouble (as you always do in the middle of the night, in the middle of the woods, in the middle of no-where) and take shelter in Baby's family home. Her family are creepy enough as it is and this is even before the fun begins. Zombie leads us through this film on a dizzying, almost LSD induced trip of brutal torture and graphic suffering. But don't we just love it? Otis (Bill Molesly) the brother of the family delivers some pretty upbeat, darkly humorous lines throughout the movie and the ending, although slightly psychotic and definitely messed up, makes for some entertaining viewing.

It had so many parts ripped off from other films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left. I decided to put House of 1000 Corpses as a tribute film rather than original. Rob Zombie is a big horror film fan and decided to go from rocker to director. He took aspects and themes from the horror films of the 1970s and added his own style. The film is about two couples who venture out in search of a local legend known as Doctor Satan. They instead run into a psychotic family and you can probably guess what happens next. I loved the movie and I got really excited when it was finally going to be released (the movie was shot in 2000, but wasn't released until 2003, because of the content and gore). I was upset tho that it didn't match my expectations, but I still liked it after more viewings. The film has a good soundtrack and lots of fancy editing that is quite effective.

I'm not a big splatter fan, but I did like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and other horror films, so I thought I would give this one a chance.I actually liked it at first, it was kind of scary and bizarre enough, but it just became more and more sickening, the evil family in this movie was just absolutely disgusting, which wouldn't have been so bad, but they are almost treated as the heroes of the movie, I get the feeling that Rob Zombie doesn't find their behavior all that reprehensible.One thing that happened was just to ridiculous, there were 5 local cheerleaders that went missing that keep getting mentioned in the movie, and when one is discovered in the trunk of a car, dead, with the words ""trick or treat"" carved into her, they send 2 cops to check things out. That place would have been crawling with cops, my suspension of disbelief doesn't go that far.I don't mind downbeat endings, sometimes I find them preferable, but this ending just took the cake, I think mostly because it wasn't presented as a downbeat ending, again, I get the feeling that RZ views this as a happy ending. Also, if they were going to end it that way, couldn't at least one of the villains have gotten their comeuppance?

And this movie pales in comparison.I've read a few of the other reviews, and many point out that it's a homage to 'Texas Chainsaw...'. That's the first drawback of any horror film. The fact is, although 'TCM' is a 'cult classic', I've seen so many 'cult classic' movies that I know understand that 'cult classic' actually means 'crap movie'. OK, it's not a 'fact', it's just my opinion, but just ask yourself, why did you enjoy 'TCM', was it the crap camera work? The awful acting? The non-story? The zero scares? Come on, give me a clue here. So, to make a homage of a bad movie (only got 'cult' status because it was banned in so many countries in my opinion) is like somebody making a movie glorifying Derby FC's Premiership performance last season.A review by Olympia states: 'Anyone Who Hated This Movie Should Not Be Watching Horror Films'. Olympia is clearly a 'Horror Snob'. He's the kind that will claim a crap-hole movie filmed with a 4mg pixel cam with shoddy sound is the best ever, and that the people who don't like it, just don't understand it. I digress.The film is full of violence and gore, but not much plot. The main problem is that there is no payback. I'm all for the non-Hollywood ending (ie. the bad guys winning), but this is just watching torture! The whole thing makes you hate the bad guys, but no one even challenges them! Thats why I love 'Devils Rejects', the sheriff in that is just a sick as the bad guys, and I was rooting for him all the way. Even 'The Hills Have Eyes' had some incredible payback.If you want to watch people get killed without fighting back, then this is for you, in fact you'd consider it a 'cult classic'.3/10",House of 1000 Corpses

This film relied heavily on sex, foul language, and pointless gore to appeal to thirteen-year-old boy mentality.  Who is Dr. Satan and what does that name have to do with this movie?-almost absolutely nothing. I have all but convinced myself that Rob Zombie just wanted to have a character in his movie named Dr. Satan because it was ""cool"" and kids would ""dig"" it.

269,dae5,At least it's different.,3,3 December 2003,"Rob Zombie's much-maligned debut probably deserves the critical flack it received upon release: Poorly edited, hardly written, and too weird/gross for most tastes, it holds an appeal only for the hardcore fans of the 70s splatterhouse era (and, even then, it's a limited appeal).  Sid Haig plays Captain Spaulding with such zeal that it's almost a shame the character never becomes interesting.  Every other ""actor"" in this movie (how did they get poor Karen Black?) hand in a by-the-numbers performance.  Rob Zombie throws in some choppy blitz sequences, flashing scenes of gore and perversion for split seconds and disappearing, I guess to add to the ""madness"" of it all, but instead of coming off as unnerving or tantalizing, these interludes are really just frustrating.  He also tries experimenting with prolonging a scene of gun-to-the-head tension, but that doesn't quite work either.House of 1000 Corpses hopes only to survive based on its shock value, and for those who are familiar with the Italian horror genre and grindhouse classics like I Spit on Your Grave, it adds up to a queasy retread.  But, on the other hand, this is probably the only film of its kind to be released in at least 10 years (excluding, of course, straight-to-video garbage).

Movies like this aren't produced that often and therefore I guess we aren't used to them, a little like Funny Games for example.Because even if this movie is heavy of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre influence, even because of the silly inclusion of a Dr Satan, this is certainly not a bad movie. if one has a few horror movies under the belt this won't be especially upsetting, but will provide some good entertainment for the time it last.After having seen The Devil's Rejects, Rob Zombie's Halloween as well as this one, I have to say Rob Zombie is on to something in the movie business, and since House was the first he directed, he has learned a lot and is getting better - there are directors who have been around for decades and still can't make decent movies, but Zombie has the talent.Rough as House might seem, it has it points, and I would hereby like to change my initial vote from a 6 to a little more respectable 7.

Rob's manic direction fits the material, and while not as bloody as hoped (it is only R), it delivers in every department. Good music, sexy girls, blood, solid direction, great sets, and a wicked sense of humor. What more do you want in a horror film? Very funny, extremely entertaining.

I'm going to be very blunt and fair. It isn't any of those things. I was horrified, in a bad way. The acting was so bad I almost left the room, the gory violence was WAY too much, and it only seemed that way because it was quite fake. There was so many plot holes I lost count! This is probably the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life! As soon as it ended, I grabbed the disk from my DVD player, put it back in it's case and returned it for my money back (To my misfortune, we bought it) That's 2 hours I'll never get back, save your time and money and don't see it.

If your looking for a good horror movie I strongly recommend this.,House of 1000 Corpses
279,theantigaz,Exploitation Revisited,6,18 October 2008,"So here we have Rob Zombie's debut outing as a movie director. For those who don't know (and I can't imagine there's many of you reading this who don't), Rob Zombie started his carrier in the entertainment industry running errands on the set of Pee Wee's Big Adventure, before forming the seminal heavy metal band White Zombie. White Zombie gained notoriety in the late eighties and early to mid-nineties for their energetic horror/sci-fi/fantasy metal music, before Zombie split the band up and released a series of much acclaimed solo albums in the same vein.If memory serves, at some point in the late-nineties Rob Zombie was involved with Universal Studio's Halloween party/event in which he designed a 'house' type set for attendees to walk through etc. as part of the celebrations (my memory fails on the specific details). This eventually led to the development of the movie in question. Conceived and directed by Zombie, the movie was shot in 2000, but due to various legal wrangles and studio issues, was not released generally until 2003.So what of the movie? There is a short prologue before the credits introducing the eccentric Captain Spaulding, a foul mouth and ill-tempered clown who runs a gas station-cum-curios museum-cum-friend chicken shack. After the credits it begins as so many horror movies before it have, a group of teenagers/twenty somethings driving through a rural area (in this case Texas) when they have to stop for gas. The gas station they come across just happens to be the aforementioned Captain Spaulding who roughhouses our protagonists before giving them a tour of his 'museum' and directions to the sight of a local legendary/mythical lynching. On the way there (through predictably horrible weather conditions) they pick up an eccentric but beautiful young female hitchhiker, get a tyre blown out and are invited back to said hitchhiker's house while their car is repaired. You can guess where the story goes from here, needless to say the house is as the title implies not a homely Bed & Breakfast welcoming visitors and the Firefly family who dwell there subject their house guests to a series of ever more alarming, bizarre and grotesque situations.The film is and widely comes across as homage to the early slasher and exploitation films of the seventies. The film contains stylistic references to just about every 'cutting-edge' horror technique of the seventies, shaky-cam, point-of-view-camera, negative exposure etc. and initially this mish-mash of cinematic styles works. The general plot line is also inter-cut with surrealistic snippets of film and home movies of the Firefly family. This style of cinema fits the movie quite well but becomes tiresome as the movie progresses, you almost feel that Zombie was trying to cram too many styles and ideas into an 88 minute movie; he almost seems desperate to pay tribute to all of his favourite movies. And he succeeds, what we have here is an exploitation pastiche, a combination of Texas Chainsaw Massacre; the Hills Have Eyes and stories of the Manson Family. However, this is all combined together with the more modern horror movement some call 'gorenography'. Rather than attempt to shock and frighten us like in the days of old, Zombie builds the uncomfortable tension by explicitly exposing us to extended scenes of emotional and physical torture, physical mutilation and gory injuries and death. This is what prevents the film from coming across as a spoof or a comic book account of serial killing and reinforces its status as pure exploitation.Don't get me wrong though, I liked this film. It's not a masterpiece by any means and it falls down in a lot of areas, but on the other hand there's a lot to like. Sid Haig's wonderfully over-the-top Captain Spaulding steals every scene he is in, there are some hilarious characters and moments of dialogue such as the prologue with Spaulding when the Firefly's go to buy some booze for their Halloween party. The characterisation of the protagonists, although is quite obvious to any horror fan, is quite well done. The Firefly family are fantastically flamboyant caricatures of the worst of the worst horror movie villains and played with conviction, avoiding the temptation to 'camp' them up. While the movie isn't as shocking or chilling as I may have liked, the slow exposition of gruesome events in an otherwise fast-paced film does well to build tension and repulse the viewer. The ending is suitably over-the-top and does look like something out of a graphic novel, but somehow fits together with the rest of the film. Despite the villains being played convincingly and the general grim rather than camp tone of the film (which could have easily been the other way round in some director's hands), it is so over the top in some places and surreal in others that it's difficult to know whether or not to take this film seriously.Overall, this film is hardly ground breaking but is a decent entry into the murky genre of horror. Given the inconsistent nature of the horror movie genre which can lump together such films considered masterpieces (The Shining, Psycho, Rosemary's Baby etc.) with some incredible (but often entertaining) garbage (Plan 9 from Outer Space, Return of the Living Dead II, Seed of Chucky), House of 1000 Corpses fairs well. I get the impression that Rob Zombie has the makings of being a capable director who an obvious passion for what he does. On House 1000 Corpses he was honing his skills, which he further improved with The Devil's Rejects and Halloween. I look forward to seeing more from Mr Zombie in the future.",House of 1000 Corpses
280,eeluksw,Dr. Satan And His House Of 1000 Corpses,6,16 October 2019,"The blood reds, sick greens, and satanic blues of Rob Zombie's feature debut are indicative of the pure vision he brought to House Of 1000 Corpses. He's such an interesting director to me because he operates solely in the grind house, midnight movie aesthetic that was developed during his prior days fronting White Zombie. There's nobody like him out there, and while the end results can be mixed, there's usually something in his work that makes me thankful we live in a world where we can watch a shock rocker's dirty fascinations play out on the big screen.I enjoyed a multitude of things about this film. The Firefly Clan is genuinely interesting in a Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Resident Evil 7 kind of way. Their crimes are gruesome and horrific, and because of which the sense of dread throughout its familiar premise is palpable, and that's before things take a turn for the supernatural.It's not all peaches and roses, as Zombie sets up the exploitative habits in this film that haunt his entire career. Even though that's kind of the point of Rob Zombie's filmography, it's just hard to stomach at times mainly because its morality errs towards the dehumanization of anyone and everyone. It seems that the movie is saying that we are all just meat, and the only people worth a damn in the world of the Fireflies are those who use the body as a toy box for bloody sadomasochism. Rainn Wilson's punishment for undergoing a project of anthropology is to be fused with an alligator, leading to this idea that ink doesn't impress on the page, only blood.However, Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding is the best, most inspired bit of the film. His early scene standing off with a couple would-be robbers is a showcase for Zombie's ear for colorful, fun dialogue, and Sid Haig seems born for it.Zombie also shoots the film like it were a music video, connecting scenes with home movie asides of various characters, and I'm split on it. It's jarring, but still in line with the thematic content, so I'll give it a pass. I think I enjoy this movie the most for how experimental it can be, and I'm always a fan of filmmakers who choose to push the envelope in any way they see fit. There are a lot of good, promising choices here, and a lot of others that don't quite work, but ultimately I wouldn't leave it out of any compilation of interesting horror films.",House of 1000 Corpses

One thing that remains to be noted is that this surprisingly bad movie totally lacks taste as well as its creator.Rob Zombie is an OK musician but his problem is that he's constantly trying to be provocative and shocking like Marilyn Manson. Unfortunately he doesn't have what it takes. Manson is creative, Zombie is derivative. Manson is grotesque, Zombie is gross. Manson is smart, Zombie is... well, you got the idea.It all just became more obvious when he turned to film making. It can't be scary when the author is not creative. It can't be impressive when the author doesn't know where the borderline is. It can't be disturbing when the author is simply uneducated.",House of 1000 Corpses
282,muvcritic,"House of 1,000 Corpses Resurrects Splatter Genre",3,25 October 2010,"""Our bodies come and go but this blood... is forever."" -- Otis Driftwood (Bill Moseley).Yes, that's right, I went to see this movie, and I'll tell you why. ""Splatter,"" a subgenre of the horror movie, as distasteful as it may be, is a legitimate cinematic expression because, unfortunately, these things really happen. Rarely, thank gosh, but happen they do.For the majority of human history, people have been -- and to be sure, even in much of the world today, are -- exposed to bloodshed in such an intimate way that Hollywood (much less the evening news) doesn't begin to portray it realistically. In our zeal to protect society (and in particular, juveniles) from graphic bloodshed, we somehow believe we are distancing ourselves from our own physicality. Life is not neat and clean, does not consist of nice, dry plastic and steel; life is wet, sloppy, bloody, and consists of bodily fluids which are unspeakable in polite company.Of course, I share in this social delusion. I make my children watch Disney movies, although I note that Iraqi children are right now getting a full dose of real-life gore. They will grow up with no illusions about life and death, so sometimes I have to wonder: Are we really doing our children a favor by isolating them from the essential truth? I believe the splatter genre has a place; yet, given its lurid appeal, the splatter film that also possesses some intrinsic artistic value is rare. I would probably cite, besides Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs, splatter movies masquerading as mainstream films, the original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as, one of the first of this genre as well as its best representative. While I'm sure that many who are more devout aficionados of this subgenre could cite more recent examples, I feel safe in concluding that the heyday of the splatter movie was in the '70s with films such as Texas Chainsaw, The Hills Have Eyes, Dawn of the Dead, and another in camouflage as a mainstream film, Halloween.It is perhaps no coincidence that writer/director Rob Zombie (once known as Robert Cummings) models his House of 1,000 Corpses after Texas Chainsaw, popularly abbreviated TCM. Like TCM, this film concerns a carful of teenagers lost in the countryside, who run afoul of a family of inbred cannibals who capture them and then proceed to torture and dismember them. This is entertainment? Well, it can be. I recall seeing TCM for the first time at a drive-in, the proper venue for most movies of this ilk, and being completely stunned at the level of carnage being depicted on the screen. But it wasn't what was being portrayed that was entertaining; it was the response to it. Teenage girls were hollering; he-man high school football players were stumbling from their cars, retching on their own shoes. If nothing else, it was a plateau of audience reaction that you don't see at mainstream walk-in theaters, an absolutely amazing testament to the power of celluloid. I am also reminded of how, during a midnight showing of Dawn of the Dead, people actually ran out screaming, just because of a stupid movie. Yes, I will admit I was greatly entertained by that.Zombie's film emulates the violence quotient and the outrageous decor of the cannibals' home, and his sometimes almost psychedelic cinematography and editing do evoke an alien mindset that functions on an entirely different level from someone who is sane, although that may be too judgmental as there have been entire civilizations that operated on human sacrifice, and surely every one of their citizens couldn't have been lunatics. Still, those of us who are sane (or believe we are) demand some measure of structure to the bloodletting, and there is next to none in this movie. Without, I hope, revealing too much, I'll also say that the horror is lessened without some survivor to remember it.The net effect is that House of 1,000 Zombies, almost too professionally mounted in terms of this type of film, has more the feel of a fanboy's tribute to the classics of the genre than an original entry into it. And these rebel, anti-Hollywood movies are supposed to star total unknowns -- what the heck are Academy Award nominees Karen Black (Five Easy Pieces) and Michael Pollard (Bonnie and Clyde) doing in this thing? It may be that, with the demise of the venues it was designed for, namely drive-in movies and midnight shows, the splatter genre isn't capable of another original or valid entry. They're not designed as pleasant diversions from reality at walk-in theaters, but shocking reminders of the mortality we spend 99% of our waking time denying.",House of 1000 Corpses
283,jer-7,"A giant walk through a haunted house, but is it good??",2,11 April 2003,"As a huge fan of Rob Zombie's music and horror flicks, I couldn't wait to see this film.  When I first saw the trailer two years ago, I went crazy. Then the delay because of a looming NC-17 rating made me nearly cry.  Now finally, what do we get for our long periods of suffering?  Not much.  The dialog is bad, which is to be expected out of any good horror flick.  The story is sub par, also to be expected.  But what gets me is that this movie is not scary.  It isn't suspenseful, gory, anything.  It is a bit disturbing because of what the creepy family do to their victims, but more or less it is just plain dumb.  It is like a walk through a very expensive haunted house, but without the suspense.  The only part of the movie that I enjoyed was when the projector brainwrapped and burned through the print.  After all the other nonsensical things that had happened, we all just assumed it was part of the movie.

But besides that it's just repulsive. Those freaky killer-family-characters are unoriginal - and such is the whole storyline. Having watched a dozen horror and as many splatter movies before, this one has nothing (!) to be frightened or shocked of, in spite of all that blood, torture and agony.It's made for the only purpose to stage really hideous things in an as crudely-artistic way as somehow possible and at all costs. Costs e. g. are huge implausibilities in the plot and dull and almost absurd behaviours of characters. This makes that stuff so excruciatingly wanted, that it feels offending most of the time watching. The remaining time it feels like being bored to death by some sadistic fantasies being put in scene so explicit just because of not knowing how to create attention in any other way (or even by building up subtle suspense).",House of 1000 Corpses
285,draftyrafters,Rob Zombie Hates You,1,9 February 2004,"People either absolutely love or absolutely hate this movie.  That says more about the people than the movie.  The movie says enough for itself.  Or, rather, it doesn't say a lot, it just says the same thing, over and over again, a lot of times.  Let me clarify...The good reviews rave about ""dumb kids getting what they deserve"" and ""snooping where they shouldn't.""  These reviewers say that the murderous family is simply ""more interesting"" than the ""idiot teenagers"" that were slaughtered.  There are comments on irony, and sarcasm, and ""black comedy."" 
I am not arguing that there aren't certain elements which are darkly funny. There are.  But a) they aren't strong enough to warrant an entire movie, and b) those elements are outweighed and overshadowed by the film's dominating attitude of hate, cruelty, and self-indulgent violence.  This is a movie made by someone who watched ""Faces of Death I through XXIV"" and was disappointed.One reviewer says that you just have to ""get it.""  That's fine.  Ever heard a joke that lasted an hour?  At the end, when no one laughs, the teller says, ""It's funny.  You just have to get it.""Oh, I get it.  And you can have it back.If Rob Zombie had condensed this into a ten minute short, it wouldn't be bad for the purpose it serves, but this monstrosity is, instead, a grotesque anthem for creative death and murderous glee.  The family isn't ""interesting.""  The family is just as one-dimensional as the stupid teenagers.  The kids didn't blindly wander where they didn't belong. Captain Spaulding, et. al. were part of an elaborate trap to ensnare locals and passers-by.  This movie was an excuse to showcase Rob Zombie's macabre and nimble imagination, which, it seems, is purely obsessed with violence and hatred, specifically toward young, preppy teens (primarily cheerleader-types) and cops and stupid old people.  Hate and violence. That's about it.Which is why whether or not you give this movie a 10 or 1 says more about you than it says about the movie.",House of 1000 Corpses

That said, the last half hour almost makes up for the rest of the movie, with great visuals and excellent pacing...The movie becomes relentless, with false ending upon false ending, a twisted ""Alice in Wonderland"" that provides genuine chills...But that first hour, tsk, tsk, tsk...The soundtrack is occasionally grating and some of the performances are so over the top that they render the story too ridiculous to be plausible, and while this is a genre film, plausibility is almost always essential, to some degree, for a horror film to provide legit fright...""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is frightening because we've all seen hitchhikers, we've all taken drives in the country (and if you live in central Texas, you know how much all of those little houses on the two lane highways look like they could house Leatherface and kin)...But the more often we're exposed to actors wearing elaborate costumes and make-up, in fairly well-lit conditions, acting like cartoon characters, the less apt we are to perceive them as frightening...And when action is accompanied by an aggressive soundtrack that overwhelms that action without accentuating it, much is also lost (a good example is Hermann's score in Psycho, which is loud and intense, but never really overwhelms the action...If you recall the infamous shower seen, the music doesn't really start until ""Mother"" Bates opens the shower curtain).Zombie borrows a lot from TCM, but more surprisingly, he also borrows substantially from DePalma's editing style, with split screens and color. At its most excessive, the film's editing also resembles Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" (Stone's work on that film also seems inspired by DePalma, no surprise given their connection via ""Scarface"").

In our time, we tend to want to see the strange and unusual. We always have come to think of it. I mean, look back on the days of the three ring circus, or Ripley's believe it or not... And then came the days of motion pictures. Wonderful. This was Rob Zombie's directorial debut. And I give him his props for his first attempt. Don't get me wrong, the movie has it's flaws, but it was made by a human. Nothing can be perfect. The beginning of this movie has to be one of the funniest beginnings to a scary movie I have even seen. Capt. Spaulding is hilarious, in his own sick way. I love the shirt ""IF I WANTED TO LISTEN TO AN ASSHOLE, I'D FART"" classic... So, let's take it from the top, shall we...First, we have a car of young kids, probably early 20's, on a road trip. They are driving along the country side, and guess what! Almost out of gas... so they pull off in a small town at a gas station/museum.. how exciting! so, the kids go inside and look around. After a few strange and hilarious antics, the kids go thru the museum, set up like a scare ride at a theme park. They are introduced to Dr. Satan! The display makes one of the kids search more for this so called Dr. Satan that none of them have ever heard of.Next, they leave the gas station and are riding down the road. They come across a strange traveler, notice how i constantly use the word strange for lack of a better word. They pull up to the traveler and ask her if she would like a ride. She enters the vehicle and the trip begins. She seems disoriented and a little off her rocker, so the kids start to poke fun at her. The mention Dr. Satan to her and she claims that the area they are looking for is just near her house. The BAM... flat tire... sure, it all sounds pretty common up to this point, but what happens next is crazy.They end up at this house, full of insane people. Mom firefly, she is a Marilyn Monroe/Marilyn Manson remake. Tiny, who is actually huge and wears a mask the whole time cuz he was badly scarred in a fire when he was young, that his own father started to try to kill him. Then, we have Otis, who is just the random psycho... All seems well until after dinner. Baby, the traveler, starts to do a demonic rendition of Betty Boops ""I wanna be loved by you"" and picking one of the men to dance on. The girlfriend gets mad and throws her on the ground. Next, baby is in her face telling her she is going to cut her throat. The kids decide it is time to leave and they start out to the car. Next thing you know, they are being kidnapped by the family and brought back inside.After that part, I have received mixed feelings. I admit, some scenes are hard to stomach, but a lot of things in life are. It all depends on what you are witness to. The family shows how crazy they are by killing the kids, one by one... and in the worst ways possible. Since this takes place on Halloween, the movie takes a strange cult turn towards Dr. Satan. It is better to watch than to have me describe. I will admit, the cult scenes are why I rated this movie an 8. I am not a large cult fanatic, but they do exist, so we need to be aware of this.I think this movie was great for his first time. It touches on a few different parts of life, small town mentality, gas station attendants, strange families, groups of traveling friends, cops, cults... all that. In conclusion, i would like to say I can't wait for THE DEVIL'S REJECTS to come out. I heard that is part 2!",House of 1000 Corpses

There are some set ups and pieces of imagery that will be hard to forget after you've seen the film, but it insists on playing everything like a drunken drag queen who means no harm. When a scene should be shocking and bone chilling, it's undercut by silly characterizations and poor execution.The story recalls Texas Chainsaw Massacre as two couples travel around the country finding strange tourist traps and curios out of the way from civilization. They fall upon Captain Spaulding's Freak Show and Fried Chicken and are entertained by the strange redneck clown's ""infamous"" Murder Ride which ends on a local legend of a serial killer named Dr. Satan.

The entire film is punctuated with odd asides that look as if they've been recorded on a family camcorder that don't really add much to the film and, if anything, take us out of the story.There are still many inventively gruesome and bizarre moments and images that make it a worthwhile watch, but it's a frustrating one.",House of 1000 Corpses

He does understand that that does not equate to a good horror film, however what he failed to notice was... neither does this.The redeeming feature of the film that brings it up to 3 stars is the occasional joke/ sick sense of humor that is thrown in there, to mix things up.

So to all those people like me, to all those guys and girls who live off of violence, who live it everyday on their screens, you will not be disappointed. The strongest point of this film - The Return of Bill Moseley. I am a die-hard Moseley fan, probably his biggest. Now this man has acted in some amazing films after his insanely funny role of ""Chop Top"" in TCM 2, but none of those roles really got him anywhere. But now he's back and he's back like never before. He is Otis P Driftwood, the craziest of the crazies. This guy is menacing and aggressive and for the ""Lover's of Violence"", this man and his character is gonna make you guys howl, close your eyes, scream, dream and also, make you laugh like you've never laughed before.Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses is a delight and proves that Rob Zombie's love for horror films has paid off. Like Tarantino says ""If you love films, it's not possible to make a bad one"".",House of 1000 Corpses
294,rbjr330,One of my favorite horror films ever,10,22 March 2005,"I was always a fan of Rob Zombies music and I was very excited to see his first feature film. I can easily say I was not disappointed. I loved every second of this film. Most of the horror films that have come out recently are trash. They are made for 13 year old kids and really aren't even scary or horrifying at all. This film, however, takes us back to the better days of horror. It is not only scary and violent, but also keeps a dark sense of humor throughout the entire movie. I loved all of the characters, the score, the script, the death scenes (even though they aren't very gory), etc. It is extremely entertaining. I have read that a lot of people hated it and think that it is just a rip-off of TCM. I don't think that is true at all. You be the judge. I also can't wait to see a directors cut, which I hope comes out soon. The sequel, The Devils Rejects, comes out on July 22nd,2005, and you better believe I'll be there opening night. 10/10",House of 1000 Corpses
295,eschase,Obvious love letter to old school horror,5,14 June 2020,"This movie is The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. If you've seen that, you've seen this. I don't need to explain the plot; that's all you need to know. It's TTCM with bizarre attempts at stylization. The victims are characterless twats, except for Rainn Wilson, who plays a lovable nerd. Other than him, the real stars are the family and Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding, but the two psycho women are both horribly annoying. It does break away from the basic formula for the third act of the movie, but I can't say it was for the movies benefit.The stylization is the worst part of it; randomly cutting to 16mm film clips, random colored lighting that change in between shots, and a bunch of flashing quick cuts. If your over the age of 16, and/or are a seasoned horror fan, this movie is much more likely to give you a headache rather than scare you.Pros- Sid Haig, nostalgic premise, and some decent goreCons- awful attempts at stylization, annoying characters, a twist that makes the movie worse.If you're gonna watch it; you're gonna watch it.

296,emylou,One Hilarious Foray into the Art of Caricature,10,9 May 2003,"If you know anything about Rob Zombie, you know that his music, art and style is a carnivalesque mix of horror and humor.  I walked in to see House of 1000 Corpses with that in mind, and I was anything but disappointed. The movie plays like a Carnival Ride: music, color and gore highlight the kitsch and glory of the simple story.  If you've ever seen a 70s horror movie (think particularly Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyeswithout the cannibalism, and others in that genre; not creepy Last House on the Leftor psychosexual Toolbox Murders type of stuff), then you know what's going to happen, and Zombie plays on that assumption throughout.During the open, we see that the movie takes place in ""The late 1970s"" - our first clue that cliche will be used with irony.  Zombie lovingly caricatures aspects of splatter-films with a 21st century MPAA rating system that goes beyond the classic 70s splatter film.  Every moment, every mise-en-scene, serves as an homage to earlier horror films, and his use of timing and pacing gives the theatre-goer their shivers and shakes.  This movie would have had buzzers in the seats if the theatres were equipped.  In particular, his use of daylight as well as nighttime, indoors/outdoors, and underground shots bring horror everywhere, and its ultra-rural locale strip it of the reality factor that can often be an obstacle in creating a fun horror flick. Not to mention, the cast of extras that give the film extra flavor, serving the same purpose as the mannequins who jump out at you in the horror house. He explains only what's pertinent to the story, and leaves all the rest as part of the filmic landscape.  There are tons of loose ends, but at the end of any ride, you don't need full resolutions in order to have been entertained.Finally, irony drips into every facet of the film.  His use of every sort of cliched, and his use of collaging of old sideshow ads, and old clips of pornography stars mix gloriously well.  It's refreshing to see a movie do irony so well, and it's too bad more people didn't ""get the joke.""
My only reservation were some parts of the script that could have used tightening, but they're not worth mentioning here.Bottom line: If you want to see a contemporary thriller-horror a la The Ring to get your fear on, don't see this movie.  If you'd like to see a fun breakneck paced carnival ride of a movie, complete with its own hilariously murderous clown, watch my seat while I get the popcorn.",House of 1000 Corpses
297,Ghostly83,"Lovely, Beautiful, Horrific",10,12 April 2003,"Well yeah this is a homage to all those 70's horror flicks we all know and love. I read a lot of reviews before seeing this film and let me first say that the people who say this film has no actors is obviously not a true horror fan cause there are a ton of cult actors in this film: Sid Haig (Spider Baby), Karen Black (too many to name), Bill Moseley (TCM2, Night of the Living Dead 90""), Michael J Pollard ( American gothic), Tom Towles (Night of the Living Dead 90"", Henry portrait of a serial Killer) these are only a few. So yeah perhaps to the everyday ""Scream"" watching horror fan these are no names but to those who know True horror, know these people. As for the people who say this is a remake of TCM no please TCM2 was a remake this is a homage and not to just TCM but to many more.Now on we go I am a Huge fan of Rob I love the man and his vision and that is why I loved HO1000C it was beautiful in my opinion somewhat graphic but not even half as much as I was expecting but I also knew there was going to be cutting, of film that is, but I still very much enjoyed it. Can't wait for the DVD. It also featured a killer sound track I had heard Rob was not going to use his own music which upset me but He DID and I was thrilled so I even went out and bought the CD. Anyway If you enjoy horror especially crazy, sadistic, bloody freak fest's and 70's horror then see this film you'll love it. Also if your not so much a fan of this but Love Rob Zombie then you'll enjoy it and if your a fan of all of the above (like myself) then be read to see this movie several times!!!",House of 1000 Corpses

Retro. zombie just wanted to make a movie that would remind everyone that there was once something great about horror films. this will divert peoples attention to the pg-13 crap that were seeing all the time now (darkness falls, the ring) and allow us to remember the good ol days when horror movies were fun and intense which this was. this was obviously a send up to all old exploitation films so it will be deemed unoriginal and trite, but if this were the first of its kind it would be quite an amazing movie in many peoples eyes. long story short dont go into this thinking it is a totally serious slasher or supernatural flick, just enjoy the old school violence that if it werent for dvds we would have all forgotten about.",House of 1000 Corpses

I mean I saw it with my girlfriend and she almost got up and left. I really felt good at the end of the movie, because i was thouroughly disturbed by what i just saw and i knew everything that was going to happen. Rob did a great job on this one for a first movie i was inpressed. i mean this was like taking every great horror movie and rolling it into a ball and covering it in blood and throwing it in the pretentious face of everyone who he knew would hate it.  People say the movie was horrible and saddistic and that you are sick for enjoying this, but look at red dragon i mean that was just as sick as this but instead of seeing the investigation afterwards we get to see what happend and how horrible it was.I'm sure this movie will go down as a let down to most people because it doesnt bring anything new to the table but so what just watch it for the experience. I mean this will probly never happen to you in real life so why not see what it would be like, hell theres plenty of people who do that now just look at all the lonely guys and gals watchin porn, thats no different.I really wish I could sit down at talk to rob about this movie because as much as people love to hate this movie i want to congradulate him on this because this was the best horror film ive seen that has been made in the last 15-20 years. Well done man, and hey even if the reviews drill this into the ground which they undoubtably will, just look at what you got waitin for you in bed at home, because anyone whos seen the movie will know.

300,Codename-MovieBuff,Not For Fans Of Mainstream Horror...,6,16 June 2003,"""House Of 1000 Corpses"" is a 70s horror based film, similar to""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and many others. Its an okay film, butI expected more. There was alot of controversy surrounding thisfilm. It wasn't released for three years. With that in mind, I was veryanxious to see Rob Zombies film debut. But in some ways it was aletdown. It could of been alot scarier, but it was still decent. Itwasnt exactly a masterpiece of the horror genre, but its cool in itsown right. Umm. For fans of old horror. If you think ""I Know WhatYou Did Last Summer"" is horror, this film is not for you. 6/10.",House of 1000 Corpses
301,TheGonzoJoint,"It's Zombie's first film; so its failure is acceptable. But that does not make this intentionally exploitative torture-horror film acceptable, by any means.",4,2 March 2011,"*1/2 out of ****By all means, ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" is something that seemingly came directly out of the Rob Zombie's troubled mind. It's the kind of twisted, strange film that he probably had a lot of fun making. Sadly, that does not make it good. There are little hints of true inspiration hidden beneath this film's bloody exterior, but Zombie fails to make anything more than a mostly disappointing and boring exploitation flick. Come to think of it, ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" is so fixated on exploitation that it feels like it was made for the good old Grindhouse itself. But alas, it just isn't good enough, even as a cheesy first-time horror film. Zombie's film is neither scary nor interesting, which renders it generic and overly sadistic in nature. I'm sure that even the sequel is better. None the less, ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" is not unwatchable; it's just a film that you wouldn't be engaged in to the point where you'd WANT to watch it. I think that fans of Rob Zombie will get it and its twisted little ways, although where exactly does that leave the rest of us? Every time Zombie directs a film, I think he should consider making it for people who aren't completely stupid. His film is nearly brainless in its execution and boring in its exploitation. All in all, that's sort of pathetic. The movie is especially pathetic after Captain Spalding is out of the game for the entire film, and since he was one of my personal highlights, the entire thing might as well have been ruined. It will entertain a select few of hardcore gore-hogs, but even some very intelligent horror fans will leave feeling cheated. So I guess it's safe to say that Zombie's super-gory first outing is boring, brainless, and forgettable. And it's also mildly entertaining and sports some pretty solid production values, although not even Zombie's somewhat artistic visual design can save his film from being an utter disgrace. None the less, it's better than some horror films; but only some. However, that does not excuse it from being bad. Yes, it's not unwatchable like the other horror remakes/""originals"" that release these days. But it's devoid of creativity and only feels like it has a slightest hint of inspiration; meaning that it just doesn't have any when all is said and done. Unless you're a true gore-hog, skip Zombie's first bloody mess. I assume that ""The Devil's Rejects"" is a whole lot more interesting. At least it will be slightly better, and that is one film I can't wait to see, primarily because ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" left me pretty unsatisfied. Everything about it finally accumulates to a giant puddle of mediocre ""meh"".",House of 1000 Corpses
302,Sccrream97-1,Who Knew Rob Zombie Could Direct a Decent Picture?,6,8 May 2005,"""House of 1,000 Corpses"" is not a great film. It's not even original. But that's so besides the point. I think it's fruitless to try to complain how much it resembles ""Texas Chainsaw"", etc. ""House"" is innovative FILMAKING, even if the movie itself is flawed. Rob Zombie is not only competent at directing, he has proved himself a maverick that should quit his shticky music career and focus on this job. Unlike most movies that DO copy their scarier relatives, ""House"" has a quality to it, something that will stick with you long after it's done. None of the acting, or the actors themselves are forgettable. Instead of faceless teenagers and their even more faceless tormentors, Karen Black and her family have depth, and the Captain Spaulding character, played by Sid Haig, is actually the best thing about it. Haig brings an unforgettable energy to a colorful character that could have just been written as ""Non-Descript Creepy Hick Gas Station Adentdant"". But no, Rob Zombie makes him a CHARACTER, and what a character he is. I only wish ""Zombie"" had made a movie just about the Clown and continued the excellent opening instead of throwing it away into subplot status. Does this film make sense? NO. But does it HAVE TO? Rob Zombie has a bizarre sense of style, one that is NOT traditional, one that is NOT ordinary or created by a studio. Again, I think you're really misreading this film if you discard it as a ""copy"" of other horror movies. The difference between a cliché horror film and this one, is that instead of simply COPYING, Rob Zombie actually appreciates and loves the genre and its classics and quirks, in a genuine, Queintin Tarantino-esquire way. You might not like ""Corpses"", but respect it.",House of 1000 Corpses

Please. Oh I can believe a crazy redneck family of two, but this... no. Sorry. Every scene, every word, every character designed to be as weird and twisted as possible. Yeah that's real believable. Oh I am sure it was fun to make, fun to think of all the crazy stuff, but it just makes no sense.

Never a dull moment from beginning to end; this movie is a visual and aural treat. While some may be reminded of movies like Texas Chainsaw, there is enough new material here to keep most fans happy throughout. Great editing and fast paced, I especially liked the opening scenes at Captain Spaulding's. Another great scene, which will likely stay with you, begins with Slim Whitman's ""I Remember You"" playing in the background, and ends just before that great red sunset.

I checked it out and while I was entertained, I don't see anything but Rob Zombie trying to turn a done-to-death premise into something artsy.It's the same old Texas Chainsaw Massacre type synopsis with a few things thrown in the make it different. A group of friends are traveling across country for whatever reason (no need to go into it) and they end up stranded at an old house with a crazy family. It works for TCM, which was created in 1978 - in 2003, it's been done to death. I don't really mind it being done again and again. In fact, I welcome it. But this one just didn't work for me. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" plays more like a dark comedy than a horror film - but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I'm not knocking the movie - just the storyline.I can't really knock the acting at all. Bill Moseley is awesome as Otis. Otis reminds me of Chop Top of Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 which is one of my favorite all time horror flicks. Of course the hey are both played by Moseley. Anyway...the actors make the movie, as they make the off the wall characters come to life in excellent fashion. Captain Spalding is so hilarious. I could have stood for there to be more of him in the film. He is easily my favorite character. He makes the movie definitely more of a comedy than a horror film.Overall, ""House of a 1000 Corpses"" is a fun movie. Interesting, twisted and all of the above. Rob Zombie accomplished the insane and over the top feeling he was intending to reach with the greatest of ease.. BUT...something felt like it may have been missing. It's definitely an acquired taste. The follow-up ""The Devils Rejects"" is leaps and bounds better than this film.",House of 1000 Corpses

In my opinion it's true a masterpiece. It's not about the story or the plot. It's about the feeling you get watching it, about how it makes you laugh and disgusted at the same time. It's about the way its filmed, the colors that are used"" the way music is used to shift between different settings, the weird converations. I absolutely love it!

307,bigfanofthebob42,A Confused Mess With Occasional Awesomeness,5,11 February 2006,"My head hurts. This movie is like watching Rob Zombie masturbate to Texas Chainsaw Massacre for 88 minutes. As such it's sort of enjoyable, sort of icky, has its moments, and is ultimately unsatisfying. (much like masturbating to anything in general)The plot...well, I don't think there is one. It's basically a feature length acid trip music video with some occasional gore and flashes of Rob Zombie's wife's ass. Music videos are good for about 5 minutes, not 88. The constant pointless filters and other poorly handled post- production stylistics wear thin. It's basically a slightly more entertaining version of the first movie I ever edited--a kid playing with fancy filters. It all gave me a headache.However, there are some truly awesome parts that show that Rob Zombie is actually a filmmaker, and not just a creepy person who masturbates to horror movies and films it. For one, Captain Spaulding, who is apparently played by Sid Haig but I think he's actually played by Awesome McAwesome's soul possessing the body of Sid Haig, is a really great character, and his dialogue is fun. I'm not sure if that's because Awesome McAwesome's soul makes Sid Haig savor every line like it's Shakespeare (with more swears!) or not, but I do think it might be because the dialogue is bad enough that it actually breaks the scale of badness and becomes good again by default.The second awesome thing is the slow motion gunfight, or, rather, the slow motion gun massacre. See, Choptop shoots Private Ryan, and then this dumb deputy, and all in slow motion set to a happy country song. The coolest part is when the scene in punctuated by a 20 second pause before he blows away said dumb deputy. It was sort of out of the blue, even for a stylistic mishmash like this, but it does show that there's some genuine passion (not merely auto-erotic) behind the camera.The third awesome thing is Rob Zombie's wife's ass. Seriously, you see it, if I counted correctly, three times. (well, two but there's this really annoying part in one of the scenes where she stops and talks with a guy for about a minute and you don't get to see it until she walks away again, so I""ll say three) It gets even more screen time in Rob Zombie's first film, The Devil's Rejects. This is his first movie, Devil's Rejects is his first film, insomuch that it can be talked about by French people with only the base level of mockery that comes with the people talking about it being French.I need a Tylenol.",House of 1000 Corpses

A lot of things are to be considered when looking into this movie. The cast is EVERYTHING. In my personal opinion the atmosphere created by this cast is not one that just any actor/actress could create. Sid Haig did a great job of setting the tone of the movie early with the ride of death. Sheri Moon Zombie, Bill Moseley, and Karen Black take over for the duration of the movie terrorizing the couples. This is not a cut and dry slasher film, it gives personality to the killers. Rob Zombie also does an AMAZING job with the track list for this movie. Sorry that my review is all over the place, but there are so many great things about this movie. The best part about this movie is the ending because there is no happy ending, everyone dies.

Anyone who complains that it is ""sick"" or ""disturbed"" - shouldn't be watching films with titles like this one!It's not brilliant  somehow just doesn't quite reach its potential  but it is very enjoyable nonetheless as there's a lot more thought and imagination gone into this picture than in 99% of the movies I've seen lately.Basically if you like horror and are into metal - you may well really enjoy this. ****SPOILERS*****It's totally OTT and can't exactly be accused of being original - but the characters are entertaining and it zips by at a fair pace - the FX are good - the sets are very nicely crafted - the music is stylish  and people get killed in a plethora of ways. There are some terrific set pieces, such as the underground world decorated in skulls and the attack on the car by the scarecrows. It was a definitely a refreshing change from the slightly sterile and almost embarrassing worlds of the TCM & DOTD remakes- to have a film come at you with a real swagger and vehemence. Chopping off a victims hand and wiping it in their face  wearing another victim's father's skin in front of her  the crazy underground doctor  kept alive with mechanical tubing & still drilling through people's skulls in his lair of surgically created freaks years after his supposed death.I mean  what's not to like????? It's hilarious! And come on - ""Dr Satan"" - of course it's a dumb name - it's intentionally heavy handed like everything else in the movie.OK so the crackly, video style inserts are a bit distracting, but hey, if Verfremdungeffekt is good enough for Bertolt Brecht, then it's fine by me here. Serving to distract and put you on edge  I thought they added little to the film overall, but helped maintain the frenetic, unhinged atmosphere.The actors do a great job of hamming up their insane roles  Lots of respected genre stars in it. Karen black is still strangely attractive - And of course Baby is very photogenic. On the DVD Capt Spaulding's introduction is hilarious and the extras are fantastic.If only more films had this kind of imagination and obvious affection for the genre put into them  instead of being boring, soulless re-tellings of the same unimaginative story.

Drawing on a countless number of influences, Rob Zombie has managed to encapsulate what Hollywood must strive to aim for lest it decay and die (presumably passing on the flag to the Japanese and European horror masters, who are not waiting for the death of the American horror genre to get a fantastic head start).Let us now hope that people in Hollywood will realise what Rob Zombie has done in this film and follow his lead.

The senseless violence is only surpassed by the senseless cursing and swearing, both dead giveaways that the story and plot are weak. The movie itself tries to be a 70's B horror flick and/or drive in second feature, however an original idea, and not ripping off several classics, would mean people could take zombie seriously as a writer/director, plagiarism is as unacceptable in movies as it is in all other aspects of life. In some movies the characters can, through their performances, make you hate them, but in this movie, and especially the sequel, you hate the characters because they are so annoying and braindead. Zombie's movies make Ed Wood's movies look like Academy Award winning epics, but unlike Ed Wood, no one will care in a generation, or two, about Rob Zombie's feeble movies, like the majority don't care now. You can forgive much in a movie, as long as it is an original idea, not 50 different movies we have all seen several times. The ending is so obvious a two year old can see it coming, and like the rest of the movie, HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE, if otis would have been dressed like Santa Claus at least it would be original and somewhat funny. This movie apparently sat unreleased for a few years, if only is stayed shelved, the world could have been without the devils rejects, which might have given a real writer/director a chance to make something worth watching, but instead zombie went and ruined one of the best horror movies of all time, by a REAL writer/director John Carpenter, with ANOTHER unoriginal movie/ripoff.",House of 1000 Corpses

316,lapelpinproductions_remo,Please don't argue the moot point...,10,12 July 2007,"""House of 1000 Corpses"" by Rob Zombie is a great horror/comedy film, thought so the day I saw it in the movie theater. Please don't argue the moot point that it's a remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and therefore unoriginal... us horror aficionados realize it's a homage to cheesy 70s horror films and borrows heavily from many horror/slasher films from the past 30 years. It's still damn good and fine piece of film-making. To leave the audience with such a lasting impression of your main character that they remember your villain after the movie ends is a great feat... to make such an impression that the audience breathes life into that character every Halloween and costumed convention is amazing. Zombie did the latter with EVERY character in ""House"" which is almost unheard of... just say the names and you can picture the face: Otis, Baby, Captain Spaulding, Tiny, Mother Firefly, Dr. Satan, Grandpa, RJ... even Goober (""that's G. Ober""). Not as technically good as ""Devil's Rejects"" but truly a horror classic. If you think otherwise and want to discuss it with me, buy me a drink and get ready for the long haul.",House of 1000 Corpses
317,ts_nowhere,A movie without a point...,3,20 January 2013,"I do like myself a good horror or slasher movie - but this one got nothing going for it. Even straightforward movies like Chainsaw Massacre have some kind of storyline or some interesting dynamic for the characters - it might even make you root for the bad guys. And sometimes they just have great dark humor. At the very very least, all of them have some suspense. House of 1000 Corpses though is nothing except a uninspired collection of violence fantasies, one after the other after the other after the other.There is no time to give a hoot about the victims. There is nothing special about the slashers to make them interesting - they are all bland copies of old horror movie stereotypes. I can kind of see how die-hard horror fans would enjoy that, and that they can point out lots of references and head-nods to the classics. Everyone else can stay away and rather watch the classics themselves - like ""In the Mouth of Madness"", which has way less violence but makes it more shocking because you care about the leads... and even manages to make you think. Or ""Motel Hell"", which is also really silly - but actually makes you smile.I give this movie some extra points for being really well cut/lit and for having neat music. For the rest it's more like a porn flick - where otherwise pointless sex-scenes are replaced by repeated pointless violence.",House of 1000 Corpses
318,theduckofdeath-2,Not worth the price of admission,1,20 October 2003,"This film looks as though it were edited by Timothy Leary while on one of his hallucinatory trips.  The story is a poor carbon copy of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and about 150 other teenagers-meet-slasher-family flicks. Which isn't too bad if you're a fan of the genre.  Unfortunately, in this film the makers decided to use sepia toned intercuts amidst the ""main"" action sequences.  And the flashing back and forth is so fast paced, and so totally random, that half the time the viewer can't tell who is doing what to whom, and for all of the advertised gore, we really don't get to see anything all that explicit.The acting is pretty deficient as well, although newcomer Sheri Moon shows some promise in at least being a captivating screen presence.This movie was a total waste of time, and the cost of the movie tickets, and hopefully shows us the bottom of the barrel in slasher horror.  At least we can rest assured that there is no way for the genre to go from here but up.",House of 1000 Corpses

There are a couple of decent performances here (the shopkeeper for one). The gore effects are only sometimes good, but if you are a fan of gore films this might suit your taste. In fact, this movie wallows in gore. On to the problems... first and foremost this movie plays like a sophomore ""Cinematography 101"" project made by a C- student. Cheezy use of negative colors, slanted cameras, flash backs (and any other film cliche they could find) constantly taunt you about how bored you are. There is no real plot (like many horror flicks) yet somehow it keeps reminding you that you are wasting your time. Maybe because it has nothing new to keep your attention? There is not even a clever ending. in fact there is a HUGE cliche ending.

323,Taotrac,"One of the best movies of all time, in every single way.",9,25 January 2010,"For one, it's outright known that almost nobody fully 'gets' House of 1,000 Corpses. Those who even so much as like it will complain that it's 'too long', 'a Chainsaw Massacre rip-off', and 'too wacky to be scary, too playful to be shocking.' But the person who truly knows that this movie is exactly what Rob Zombie had in mind, will enjoy the film to it's fullest.What House of 1,000 Corpses is, is a sort of Kill Bill/Grindhouse piece of work. There are many tributes to past film ages and genres, and these tributes often end up being more fun and epic than the originals themselves. And Corpses proves that without a doubt. But the fact is, Zombie just does not stop at 'tribute'. He goes all out with beautifully shocking imagery, extremely love-able villains, fantasy, gore, comedy, and lastly, amazing set design and REAL stunts and effects. Not a single bit of CG in this movie, and very, very detailed and extensive sets and locations.And while you may think 'ok, so Corpses is a great tribute to crazy underground horror cinema of the late 70's', it's much more. This movie has the soul that many of it's influences did not have. The movie literally seems so inspired, so well-written, so well-acted, and so plain well done, that you even wonder if Zombie knew he was making a tribute. It's almost as if he's completely ignored the direction of modern film, and created something in his own twisted little world, a film that's entirely self-indulgent. If you hate the film, you hate the way his mind works, as this is it, and he's not changing for anyone. Not for the artsy folks who say this his film isn't cinematic, not for the simple-minded who just want to be scared, not for the stuck up who can't fall in love with villains as colorful and iconic as these. Best thing about it, the film has a great, very emotional sequel, Devil's Rejects, which makes you fall in love with the bad guys even more, if you didn't already wish they were your own family. (and let's face it, this band of freaks care more about each other than any real American Family, just one of the many points Zombie goes out of his way to prove.) This film is a wonderful expansion of the 'crazy tribute' genre of films, so amazing that it truly stands out entirely on its own merits, as 75% of this movie is very, very original, written entirely by Zombie. Yet it also has many influences and borrowed settings and concepts, written in a homage type way. Great film, it really is! (Props to Zombie writing the soundtrack as well!)",House of 1000 Corpses
324,jackbradwilson,A Clear Rip Off Of So Many Better Movies,4,12 January 2015,"When I watched House of 1000 corpses, I had already seen Rob Zombies other movies (except devils rejects) so I figured this would be at least OK because I liked his other movies, but I have to say this was his worst one and I was very disappointed. Even Halloween 2 is better than this (which I liked more than most people did). It does kind of become frustrating after a while because it just reminds you of so many better movies which, quite frankly, you'd rather be watching. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is the movie it rips off more than any, whether it's the wearing of a dead characters skin, or the camera zooming in on a female victims eye while being tortured, or even as simple as the picking up of the hitch-hiker. On the other hand, it did have a good opening and I liked some of the characters e.g. captain Spaulding, but after starting off good it continues to get worse and worse as the movie goes on, until I found my self constantly clicking the info button on my remote to see how long was left, hoping it would end. Additionally, it was poorly shot, and directed. The acting was OK, and I wanted to mention the character of baby, played by Sheri Moon, (who I like) because she wasn't very good and her character was annoying. I kinda wanted her to die so I didn't have to listen to that annoying laugh any longer. In conclusion, I can't recommend this movie to anyone, because any true horror fan will have seen the movies it rips off and will likely feel they've wasted time watching it. I would like to take this opportunity though, to recommend that those who haven't seen Rob Zombie's Halloween 2, give it a chance, you may be pleasantly surprised. P.s. don't be fooled by the 6/10 rating. It is way too generous.",House of 1000 Corpses
325,filmguy_07,Lions Gate Should Have Burnt the House Down.,1,12 October 2005,"Sometimes, I'll come across a horror movie that isn't any good and think to myself, ""Man, what a disappointment."" I came across House of 1,000 Corpses and could barely think of the words to utter that would fully justify the steaming pile that had just been delivered to me via the Lions Gate Films distribution service. I think Lions Gate should have burnt the House down.Our awkward and downright below novice horror film starts out with what we think is plot enough. Four friends out on a crazy misadventure, taking notes of odd side attractions across the U.S. Quickly after hearing the legend of Dr. Satan, the four bound off in search of him and his grave. What they find is the melodramatic (and ultimately just irritating) Firefly family that revels in their torture and death for the next 75 minutes (or something like that).Torture on film? I can live with that, even love it. Hell, Sin City is pretty much a torture film, Elijah Wood can tell you that. But there is a difference between being tortured for the sake of plot and just being tortured. I found myself trying to make sense of the the torture scenes, such as thinking ""Well maybe they're all possessed by the demon of Dr. Satan... oh wait, they're just... crazy people... weee."" Rob Zombie apparently thought he could trade plot off for some wicked gore and interrupting cut shots. Sorry Rob. Even The Last House on the Left had a plot.If people who watched Saw and didn't like it for the acting watched House and enjoyed it, you should be ashamed of yourselves. This film has an array of the most cheestastic actors I have ever seen, and not in a good cheesy way either. Kind of like cheese that had already been eaten and processed... which would actually make it crap. Not a single performance is really there to save this one, with the exception of whoever played Tiny, the only well-acted role in the whole damn film. Someone should tell Rob Zombie's wife that just because you're hot and a freak doesn't make you talented... in the least.As for Rob Zombie's attempt at taking a music video perspective for his first horror film, it was way too over the top. I can say that I respect him for trying something that WASN'T an awful idea, but the cut shots, as mentioned above, are too intrusive to the film, although they're not really intruding on anything overly important or critical to plot. Ultimately, Rob's cut shots to ladies masturbating with skeletons is just annoying.Horror critics seem to love this film, which confuses the hell out of me, being the horror fan that I am. It's misguided, pointless, and worst of all, unoriginal, one of the biggest plagues cursed upon the horror genre. Of course we all know that Rob Zombie giggled like a school girl after saying ""titmouse"" once this project was all wrapped up. Finally, a horror movie fan doing his tribute to the horror movie genre. Rob, do the horror movie genre a favor and quit trying to compliment it.",House of 1000 Corpses

I felt like the plot moved to quick, before you know it they are getting their heads chopped off. Because its so fast movie, with no real buildup, it does not leave much time for being afraid of what will happen next, with the exception of a few scenes that had my heart pounding. It gets good in the end, when everyone is dead except for one. I did feel my heart go for those who died. I felt bad, and was rooting for the bad guys to be taken out! But...it wasn't great. If your looking for gore, there isn't much. I mean, i didn't see much gore effect.

What I got was a grotesque piece of cinema that should have never been made.  This movie is not scary, it is revolting.  Using the latest in latex, fake blood, and pretty much every make up technique at Hollywood's disposal this film is an hour and a half of mutilation- including gutting, scalping, disemboweling, disfigurement, and amputation.  No plot, no character development, no creative filming, just blatant maiming of each of the characters one by one.  I was never scared at any point in the movie, but it made me beyond sick to my stomach. 
I am absolutely baffled at how this film was ever made.  To give it a 1 out of 10 is generous.  It deserves no praise, no points, and should never be watched.  I was actually warned by a friend that this film wasn't bad in the sense of ""so bad it's funny"" but bad in the sense that it's trash.  Rob Zombie can not write nor can he direct.  He should stick to making music rather than trying to score shock value points on an unsuspecting audience. It sickens me that any self respecting actor, producer, or even crew member could read through this script and think, ""hey, this looks like a project I'd take part in.  Four twenty-somethings go cross country, stop at an old house (oh that's original), get captured immediately, and proceed to be tortured in the most disgusting fashions imaginable before eventually dying from, oh I dunno, shock, blood loss, lack of internal organs?

331,trybrow-5,"Good? Well,... yes.",6,6 September 2007,"As an ex-drug addict, i cant find it hard to stay interested in a film unless the storytelling, script and acting is top notch. Because most films don't have such pedigree, i tend to find myself skipping through certain scenes i find boring. As you may have skipped to the end of this paragraph. I thought id just state that so i don't come across like many self-important reviewers who seem to think that their opinion is unbiased and important and level-headed. Mine is'nt, its just what i think of the movie.House of 1000 Corpses is you standard cannibal redneck yokel story like many before it, Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn, Hills Have Eyes, Psycho to name a few, all are based on the various myths and facts surround the serial killer Ed Gien who is referenced in this film at one point. The problem with those kind of films however, for me, is the relentless onslaught of young protagonists, who get themselves involved somehow in the storyline, usually on a road trip of some sort. In most cases i really fail to care at all about these characters. In fact they are less characters and more like plot devices around which the inventive or horrific murder scenes are placed. The same goes for HO1000C. I don't care for the characters so it gets a bit boring sometimes along the way.Thats all par for the course in these kinds of films, what makes HO1000C worth watching is the kooky antagonists they bump into like Captain Spaulding and the family of crazies. Thats what really floats my boat about this film and thats probably what was intended, the third act with Dr. Satan is great. Rob Zombie has created a new horror icon with this character with some help from the excellent FX team that created it.Definitely worth watching if your a horror fan. I can also highly recommend the sequel although having seen it before HO1000C i was surprised to find that Dr. Satan had been left out and a less supernatural vibe permeated the plot.",House of 1000 Corpses

I think it was meant to be watched while smoking pot and rocking out to heavy metal.  But I have to give it some credit.  It was just bizarre enough to make me want to see the sequel.  The movie, for the most part, made sense to me.  It was near the end that everything turned into one gigantic acid trip.  It went from plausible reality to plain insanity.  I guess I left the movie feeling as if I was robbed.  I wanted to know more and I definitely wanted to see more. Like, for example, who exactly was this Dr. Satan, and why was he living underground torturing victims?  I did understand that this movie was something of a satanic cult, but still, I'm clueless.  I suppose if the sequel follows up with the original, then I'll be a happy man.

It captures the essence of slasher flicks perfectly. I try to encourage people not to think of those as what the horror genre is. It's so much more, and in all honesty, I was expecting something more from this movie. I was hoping for a movie that would give me something to think about, as I believe a horror movie should. Instead, it gave me more gore than I would have liked while eating pizza.A few high moments and good lines aside, I wouldn't bother, unless you are a big Rob Zombie fan, slasher movie fan, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre fan.

It was OK, a few goofy twisted characters and a few changes, but over all I felt he just made enough changes to avoid a lawsuit on copyright infringement. The couples lost, meet a seemingly nice guy, end up in a house full of sick cannibalistic killers, everyone gets killed, one girl survives, goes to guy from beginning of movie who, in this case NO surprise, is part of the killer clan. OK so leather face is replaced with DR Satan, and his scene was probably the best, but too close for coincidence. If Rob said it was a homage to Tobe and his flick I missed that.

335,whatisitskip56,An unfortunate mess of a film,3,17 July 2007,"I have a certain respect for Rob Zombie. His love of the classic cult grind-house horror of yesteryear is very endearing and I believe him to have a certain integrity rare amongst film personalities. Unfortunately House of 1000 Corpses, while certainly expressing Zombie's love for old school shock horror, is simply too convoluted, elaborate and often boring to send a single shiver up the spine.It is obvious that painstaking care was taken in the aesthetics of the film but unfortunately it has failed. For the most part the film looks as if the lighting and makeup designers had just come from a job on The Bold and the Beautiful with gaudy colours and super smooth skin on characters who have supposedly been on the road for days detracting greatly from any attempts at a gritty atmosphere. Even in the supposed house of 1000 corpses the production design resembles a piece of theatre more than a disturbing pit of hell and mayhem. I understand the burlesque inspiration here but even with that considered the sets shouldn't look so staged. The special effects makeup also looked more like paper mache than deformed skin, apart from Dr. Satan, who does look very effective but is unfortunately severely underused.The acting for the most part is excruciating. Sid Haig is fun as always and completely steals the show but apart from him there is not a single character here who the audience will feel strongly for or against simply because they are all 1 dimensional stock standards played in the fashion of a high school drama class. One very disappointing aspect of the performances is that the older members of the sicko family are obviously played by college age kids and the poor makeup and acting is unable to hide this. The dialogue is obviously aiming to be quotable, and is therefore so ludicrously overwritten that it does little but add to the amateur theatricality of the film.By the time we get to the juicy horror stuff the film takes the action in a completely convoluted direction until the audience no longer cares what this sick family is hiding or what kind of back story there may be. Simplicity is the key stroke to the art of the horror film but obviously Rob Zombie wanted to do away with that trend in House of 1000 Corpses. The same can be said of the cinematography. Negative colourization and crash cuts to grainy newsreel style footage of what is happening in another room are amateur tricks at best and more at home in an MTV music clip. To add insult to injury these tricks are overused to the point of exhaustion.I watched this film with a friend who I consider a kindred spirit in horror fandom and we both are well watched and researched on the genre. I'm sad to say that half way through House of 1000 Corpses our silence could no longer be held and my friend finally had to open the floodgates with ""Ugh, this is so bad!"" Yes, it is.

336,brettmcneill,Ew! (spoilers),1,2 July 2006,"That's all I can say about this horrible film.Now, no matter what people have tried to convince me, this is not a satire it can't be a movie consists of just people getting killed, and thats already been done, in the Texas chainsaw massacre. I think the only real change in this movie is that this one doesn't have th4e chainsaw which was the highlight of the original.The thin plot of this movie has four people who are looking for scary things in Texas (irony, i think not) and they come across I creepy gas station that has a haunted tour ride that apparently shows the psychos that had lived in Texas (leatherface was not there) and there is one really creepy one named Dr. Satan. The kids being as stupid as they are ask were they can find were Dr. Satan use to live. Well the gas station clown give them the directions and the kids go away. Then they pick up a girl hitchhiker and the car breaks down. The girl says her house is near were the car is and they go to the house the people there tow the car back to the house and they fix it up. But when they try to leave the people won't let them and they knock the kids out. Then it just blood and guts and this the only film that actually made me puke and it would have been alright if this was entertaining. The deaths consists of cutting hands off then cutting the person in half. Then the other three have to endure a weird ritual were they have to dress up like rabbits (ruun rabbit) and one get shot brutally when she tries to run away. The other two are lowered into a pit were people are living and they run through the tunnels look for a washout. One ends up meeting Dr. Satan and the girl walks in on the Dr. skinning the other guy (puke, puke) and she runs away Satan chase after her she kills him and makes the tunnels collapse. She gets out and hitches a ride with the guy from the gas station and then one of the killers pops up from the back seat.Friends of mine recommended this to me and after this and their recommendation of Queen of the Damned i never listening to them again. I probably wouldn't have seen this movie other wise.Bottom Line: Ew, disgusting, gross, puke worth, Rob Zombie why? Bu there is some good that comes from this. My other friends who didn't like this recommended the sequel The Devil's Rejects and i was hesitant to watch but it was really good and don't worry you don't have to see this one first.

337,Ma_Herbo,A nightmare sequence,7,21 October 2017,"So two Rob Zombie movies were scheduled on the horror movie channel. I didn't know Zombie and after checking out the reviews on IMDb, curiosity had a hold on me. So even if I wasn't enthusiastic, I decided to set the DVR for both of them, «House of 1000 Corpses» being the first one I watched.I was promised a gore fest and I must admit I'm not usually a big fan of this genre, but the comedy aspect was appealing. I was afraid it would be one those horror movies that try to make you jump of your seat every 5 minutes, which I dislike. Worst of all, I certainly hoped it wouldn't be a festival of girls screaming for the entire movie, as I hate that too. So I was curious, but I was reluctant to waste my time watching this movie.Is there a good story? Nope. The first part with Captain Spaulding is really great. Then you go with that weird family, which kind of brings you elsewhere (It reminded me of «Nothing But Trouble» (1991) by Dan Aykroyd, which is not a good thing). And finally you go to Dr. Satan, which was introduced in the first part, but too late as you already have forgotten about him and it doesn't really affect you at this point and you're kind of glad the movie is finally ending.Is it scary? Not at all. Is it funny? Not really. Was I disgusted by the violence/torture/horror? It was pretty standard stuff and not that much of it (for an horror movie that is supposed to be a gore fest, anyway). I was more disturbed by the transformation in «Tusk» (2014) than anything in that movie.You really don't have that suspense that makes you say: «Oh no! Are they really gonna go there? They wouldn't. OMG, they went there!» Really nothing of the sort. Also - thank God - not too much screaming either.Did I like the movie? HELL YEAH!Somehow, it worked on a whole other level for me. I just loved the way it was shot. The directing and the editing was what made it for me, even though some reviews here hated the movie for the exact same reason I loved it.I felt I was watching my own nightmare. You know the kind of dream you have after watching a disturbing movie, where you are kind of reliving the movie, but nothing makes sense. You are not scared, because you know you are dreaming. You know you can stop everything by waking up, yet you don't want to, because you want to see what will happen next.The story kind of goes nowhere and everywhere, but so do the plots in my nightmares. All of those scenes that come from nowhere and those special effects that makes things look weird, guess what? Just like in my nightmares. Even this short movie was kind of long for what it had to say; Just like my nightmares that seem to circle around a theme by repeating the same scenes over and over.You can't make sense of the movie. You have to only enjoy the weirdness of it, just like a dream. I don't know if this was the intent of the director, but if it wasn't, it was a nice outcome that I enjoyed dearly.Usually, horror movies try to find another (original) way of killing someone. This movie was more about finding another (original) way of filming a very typical killing. The shooting scene was awesome. For an horror movie, you must admit that shooting your victims with a hand gun is rather boring, better suited to a western or action movie. Yet, the way it was shot, with the slow motion to the song «I remember you», followed by this extremely long waiting period before the last shot is fired (that you barely can see, which is weird for a movie that is said to be a gore fest), I thought it was really original and it kind of brings you back into the movie, wanting to see more of it.The music. Another great feature of the movie that really sets the mood, even if you don't get into the story. Weird, but fun. You listen to this (mostly) heavy metal music (which is good) and then you have an «I Wanna Be Loved By You» or a «Brick house» thrown at you that just makes you want to sing along. I'm telling you, fun!Is this the best horror movie ever? No. But it was fun to watch, left me with a «feel good» sentiment and I now am enthusiastic about watching my second Rob Zombie movie recorded on my DVR.",House of 1000 Corpses
338,RFSJ,Shocked and Appalled,1,12 April 2003,"I'm absolutely amazed at those reviewers who liked this movie.  Both my companion and I thought it was a complete waste of time and money. Hackneyed plot, terrible editing and production values, trite effects, all combined to produce a movie that we both would have walked out of, except there were people on either side of us in our aisle.

(((POSSIBLE SPOILER))) First, let me say I love the gory and the bizarre. 70's horror is my favorite- Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House On The Left, Dawn Of The Dead and House On Dead End Street are all brilliant. Even Tourist Trap was better then this sad, self-important extended music video. Nothing in this movie is shocking, sick, bizarre, unsettling, or even gross. And, wow, talk about a surprise ending! Jeez...hard to see that one coming! Just like with his appearance and his 'music', Rob Zombie tries way too hard. Rob, you can't set out to make a cool, cult film.

I am not even sure what to say about it quite yet!Interesting first time for Rob Zombie as Director, with some insane visuals and crazy set pieces!  This was Texas Chainsaw Massacre to the max!  But I found that to be a bit of a problem considering this is supposed to be more of an original film, it just wasn't.  No matter how many crazy things are going on, or how interesting the visuals are, or how neat the different lighting schemes are(ala Argento), it just didn't ever get passed the point of being truly terrifying or even remotely scary.  Yeah, there are a few jump scenes here and there in the mess of the mayhem but just not enough to sustain a mood of fright.  Really, it was all just a ploy to shock and gross-out the audience.Maybe check it out if you interested in seeing how Rob's banned movie actually plays out (even though I don't know why it was banned, I think they just realized that this movie is not movie theatre material).  I hope that you don't necessarily take my review in a negative way... the movie was still okay, just a little too over the top at times. (**1/2 out of *****)",House of 1000 Corpses

First, the directing is terrible, Rob Zombie's wife is so irritating in this movie and her laugh is annoying. She is in every movie he makes and she's a terrible actress.
This movie tries so hard to be like, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I am a horror buff and I can see all the attempts to make it similar. I have no idea who help fund this movie but they should be fired. TERRIBLE dialogue as well. Nothing the family says makes any sense. If you are a fan of horror, pass on this movie. Nothing good about it.",House of 1000 Corpses
342,ShadowDragyn,Is Rob Zombie a genius? You'll have to decide for yourself.,8,15 April 2003,"This movie is a twisted, convoluted, mess from the opening scene to the closing credits. It jumps from scene to scene with no direction whatsoever with no real cohesive plotline or story to speak of. By the time the film is over, you're left not knowing exactly what the hell just happened, with no idea how you're supposed to feel or what you're supposed to take away from the experience. I wandered out into the open air almost in a trance, trying to sort through all the disturbing and seemingly unrelated events of the past 90 minutes.Oh, sweet horror, how I've missed thee.Since when did we as a society start expecting horror movies to make sense? When did we start demanding a real plot that ties everything up into a nice, neat little package at the end? Critics  seem to think that any movie that doesn't explain itself is garbage. Well, I say that any ""horror"" movie that you can understand is not horror at all. Movies like The Sixth Sense and Red Dragon should really be labeled suspense or thrillers. Even classics like Frankenstein aren't true horror. A real ""monster"" of the genre should never be given sympathy. No, true horror is about people being in situations they can neither control or understand. Would Leatherface have been as disturbing a figure if we'd been given an explanation or motivation for his actions? Of course not.And that's what Zombie has given us; a true horror movie for people who love *horror*. I don't *want* to know why. I don't *care*. All I know is that my mind was reeling for hours afterwards from the visual assault I'd just sat through. It's not a great film by any means. The truth is, I'm not even sure if I *like* the movie or not, but that doesn't even matter. I will buy it and watch it again and again, not because of any artistic value, but because it's true horror. And true horror movies are few and far between.",House of 1000 Corpses

Was there gore and violence you say? Of course there was, there was so much it was ridiculous. Rob Zombie says only this to America: ""Hey kids, look how much I can shock you!!!"" That is all this was. Cult Classic? I sure hope not. This movie should be burned. Every film reel. Every script, burned. I am serious, this is a horrid film. What else can I say? As far as the worst movies I have ever seen, this is in the top 10. I really am at a loss for words, it was just disgustingly bad. It isn't that I don't like horror, I really do but this movie wasn't scary, it was just bad. Bad, bad, bad. When you leave this film you will be disgusted with humanity.

344,lumkinsc98,"Simply put, it wasn't worth the long wait.",5,20 March 2003,"I didn't expect much of anything from this film, and I might as well say that right off the bat. The majority of the performers in this film are obscure, unknown actors which have rarely been in any films of true note, it's directed and written by a man who has never directed a film before (Rob Zombie if you are not aware), and quite frankly, this film has been through the wringer way too much, and it's painfully obvious. The most well known actor in this film would be cult star Sid Haig, but unfortunately his role in this film is nowhere as large as I had been led to believe leading up to this film. Simply put, this guy is the high point of ""1000"", as he totally captures each scene he is in.The film begins on a great note. We start off with a great scene in Capt. Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen, which leads us into the musical opening for the credits. I'm no fan of Rob Zombie, but I do admit that his music goes along perfectly in a film of this sort. So along with his music, the demented images in this opening, it really set a great tone for the rest of the film. Well, I should say it set a great tone for the rest of the film, which only lasted for a few minutes. It quickly broke down, and all direction seemed to be lost.Everyone knows the plot of this film I assume. It's about a group of kids who are driving along, they run out of gas and are forced to stop at the odd, old looking gas station where they meet odd characters, which then lead them to a scary and broken down house in the middle of nowhere, where all sorts of horror and murder begins to take place. Now call me crazy, I've been called that before, but does that not sound just like a plot seen before in a movie just of this sort? It's so obvious that Rob Zombie wanted so bad for this one to be Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2000, but he fails to reach that goal.The rest of this film is a horrible mixture of very bad acting, virtually no storyline or plot, no explanation for anything that is going on really, horrible editing, and an attempt at ""cool shots"" and the such, which only comes across as headache inducing. The film just seems to be one huge mess of various scenes trying to disturb the viewer, nothing really fits together in any way at all. Out of all of the camera angles, effects, and everything of that sort that we see throughout this film, there is only ONE which I feel is in any way truly original, cool, and horrifying. The shot is a closeup of the right part of someones face, and over their shoulder, we see ""somone"" following them as they are at a dead end trying to figure out what to do now. The shot holds there for a few moments, as the figure in the background over their shoulder moves closer and closer, and then they slowly turn their head to look over their shoulder, and the other half of their face appears as they do so, as they see the figure behind them. This is one of my favorite angles/shots that I have seen in years. There is nothing fancy about it, there are no special effects involved. As a matter of fact, it's the type of shot that any one of us could go out and shoot right now, but that's the thing. It's simple, and in this film it proves that less, is indeed more.That is my favorite part of the entire film besides the very beginning before the opening credits/song. The rest of the film is simply ""just there"", with really no positives that I can think of. The only real positive I suppose that I CAN name besides what I've said before, is that of the character Baby, played by newcomer Sheri Moon, this is her debut acting role. As from the ""1000"" web site, ""Rob Zombie fans will recognize her from her numerous rock video appearances including such favorites as Dragula, Living Dead Girl and More Human Than Human."", so you may have seen her before if you've seen his videos. She is hot, beautiful, and has a great voice. I can't say much about her acting though, it pretty much just ran into the wall like most everyone else in this film.Also, the ending of this film comes out of nowhere. I like the ending of this film, but it just comes out of nowhere. I can't really explain it so as to not spoil it, but just be ready for a very abrupt ending. Also, do not look for tons of gore and graphic death scenes in this film, because you will NOT find them here. This film is all about being emotionally disturbing by using quick jumps, setting, and the overall mood... ...it's just too bad that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre did the very same thing years before, and did it much better.After waiting years for this film to finally finish up filming, and to be released, I am now forced to say that it was not worth the long wait.",House of 1000 Corpses

It's suppose to be all those things! But I left the film terribly disappointed and wanting. There was nothing scary about this film and nothing shocking. Nevermind weak character development and weak plot. Those characteristics are for real films. I really thought Rob Zombie had a better imagination than that. What was worst was how he tried to be artsy fartsy in a pathetic sort of way which was reminiscent of ""Natural Born Killers"" with the cinematography. Don't waste your money on this one.

Of course it was bloody and the plot was like so many other horror movies of the 70's and 80's but that's what made it different from what's been out lately.

It's not funny. It's not well directed or acted. It has an incredibly hackneyed plot. There's not a single original or otherwise interesting thought in the entire movie. The movie relies on gore and attempted shocks to be scary, but fails in the most pathetic way possible. I'm sure this movie will scare some people, but it won't be a memorable scare, like Halloween, Alien, or The Thing. Instead it'll be like when you find a container of food in the back of the fridge that's been there for 2 years. Just avoid this movie - you'll feel crappy afterward for having watched such an awful movie.

Some of the images were hip and stylish, but they are thrown in every ten minutes or so to break up the monotony of the film. The characters weren't very well written, (however Im not sure how well they need to be for a horror film) and the acting was total B level. They should have billed this film another remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. To me the films are awfully close in plots. I was hoping for some new ideas and was disappointed. I think just about anybody could have written this movie. If Rob ventures into another picture, im almost sure it will be better than House of 1000 corpses.

350,DeadSkinMask,Great Fun but Falls Short of All-Encompassing Terror,8,13 April 2003,"I've been waiting three years for this film to come out, following press releases interviews, etc. When it came out I was so pumped up. I wanted this film to horrify me. Well.......I never felt uneasy watching this film because it was cut so severely to meet MPAA guidelines, which ultimately turned what could have been a decent horror film into something trying to make the best out of a bad situation. It's unfortunate because this film seemed to have the potential to frighten people. Not so anymore. I found that the audience was laughing more than they were gasping or jumping. Maybe I was too immersed in the movie to accurately observe.The acting in the film is ""iffy"" because we never get a strong sense of caring for the characters. We can sympathize about their predicament but I couldn't care less if they died. Singularly, the character of Bill was simply atrocious; hard to take seriously because of his inability to act. Karen Black and Sid Haig act circles around the supporting cast, something I expected, but because of the MPAA's cutting, even the villains are shadows of what they were originally supposed to be.(I hope this doesn't turn into a soapbox against the MPAA. I would like to believe that the master of horror culture that Rob Zombie is could produce a great film. Maybe he could, maybe he couldn't)The cinematic style of the film is great, a spectacle to watch (i.e. in the pit with Denise). It is lit in a way that borrows from Dario Argento films like Suspiria and Inferno. The way it is shot, too, is amazing, utilizing split screens and 8mm footage spliced in with the action. The editors, however, didn't know how to effectively place the footage to give it the most poignant effect.(as a side note, there was something like four editors on this flick...) I loved the use of negatives and embossing and the scene in particular which still stands out is Otis holding the gun up to Officer Naish's head. The use of timing in relation to the audience's expectation is great.The sets were incredibly detailed, but my one discrepancy with them is placement. It looked too much like a backlot. If there is a building introduced, it is usually alone. I have a feeling that if the camera made a wrong move, you would have seen the police station behind Captain Spaulding's Museum, that sort of thing.One last thing, the script. The dialogue is littered with well-placed pop culture references and for the most part people interact well with each other, but after a while, the action replaces the dialogue. It sort of fades out inconspicuously. A neat (accidental?) trick, but as aforementioned, I wish there was more substance in the players.All in all, this is a fun movie to watch, despite it's flaws. It may not be constantly terrifying but it is entertaining.",House of 1000 Corpses

355,mvd102000,You May Hate This Movie - But Here's Why I Love It,9,14 August 2015,"Before really getting into how I feel about this film, let me explain a few things. I'm not a fan of Rob Zombie, other than his work in creating this film. He's made a few songs I've enjoyed, but if I won tickets to a concert tomorrow, I'd probably just sell them. If he releases a trailer for a new movie tomorrow, I probably wont find out for another six months, if at all. Let me also make it clear that I am hugely critical and somewhat snobby in regards to my taste in film. I don't get a kick out of anything that's made to be low brow and campy, and Im very picky with horror. Now that that's out of the way, let me get into what this movie's all about.Rob Zombie has somehow created a masterpiece out of a choppy, lucid nightmare of an idea. If you're well acquainted with classic horror films, you'll find a lot to be nostalgic about, but what could have been a simple homage was crafted into a unique new tapestry of horror. Personally, I found this movie to be deeply distressing, uncomfortable, gritty, and completely unapologetic. But it isn't my job to convince you to love it. Whether or not you enjoy the film is, in my opinion, largely based on the setting you watch it in, and how well you're able to suspend your own disbelief and just watch what happens. And at the end of it all, you may not enjoy it regardless. But if you do, there's no doubt it will have been because of the excellent picture Rob Zombie paints with an almost perfect cast. Please remember while watching - this in no way, shape, or form, is designed to be a comedy, or a horror/comedy combination film. If you find yourself uncomfortable after hearing what you thought was a joke, that was the intention. I feel as though this film actually digs into the human psyche and brings back with it the things that could only happen in our confused, manic nightmares. The entire movie just feels like a horrible nightmare someone had and worked into a film. Minus a bad actor or two, it really hit the nail on the head for me. It's disgusting, I hope you love it.",House of 1000 Corpses
356,aka_tourette,"If you don't like horror, don't watch it. This is a real one",8,16 December 2005,"I have seen The Devil's Rejects first, so my comments on this is influenced by the sequel movie. This is a much better one. Zombie looks here as a better writer. The movie looks like a collage of classic horror theme, and is very like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre II, but doesn't matter because everything works better in here. The lines are not a piece of art, but they fit very well in the story. The interludes with the monologues gives the movie a more psychedelic feeling. I love Bill Moseley's lines, even they don't mean a thing. Baby Firefly is a spoil evil child and so her behavior in The Devil's Rejects is justified. The image and the atmosphere is perfect, and the movie is not spoiled with the bad idea of making the audience sympathize with the mad family, like in the sequel. The entire movie looks like it was made with a bigger budget than The Devil's Rejects. The House of 1000 Corpses should have been mentioned in the movie as the lair of Doctor Satan, because the title is not justified. You barely see a few dead bodies in the entire movie so just calm down. The cop is also better, then the one from the sequel. Is only one thing that is missing. Because all the horror is wide open to your eyes every minute, the film doesn't deliver that feeling of building tension, to really scare the pants off you. It's pure horror, like every horror movie should be. I don't understand those who blame this movie fore the brutality, the crazy behavior, the strong language.

357,shoelace,More in your face than in your head.,5,15 March 2007,"***Spoilers***The best horror movies leave you feeling disturbed. They get into your head and stay their for awhile and get at something approaching primal fear. Sometimes they do it by not showing anything or just glimpses of terror (think Don't Look Now) or have some gore to go along with your shocks (think the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre). House of 1000 Corpses does neither. It just throws helpless victims who Rob Zombie seems not to care about except that he wants them to suffer, and seems to want the audience to cheer on their demise. He does not want you to relate to them at all. They might as well be pin cushions or plastic dolls to be stabbed and torn apart in sadistic ways. He seems to make his victims people who probably tormented him in high school. Cheerleaders, nerds, pretty girls, a suburban dad, and some cops. This movie feels like an movie revenge against those types of people. That is all the characters are anyway, just types. The movie is just one note. It goes from horrible, (when the robbers get killed to when the victims first get abducted) to more horrible (when the cops and Denises father get killed and Otis wears the ""Dad"" suit) to most horrible (all of the Dr. Satan scenes and the ending). Rob Zombie would show snippets of information to try to scare you I think by letting you know it is going to get worse. This drains any suspense he might build. We already know things are going to be bad for the characters because the title of the movie is House of 1000 Corpses. He would show clips of old movies along with faked grainy footage of the Firefly family in past crimes. If he just tried to be less MTV it may have worked better. I think the only reason for old movie clips is to show what old movies he liked. What other reason are they in the picture?One thing that bothered me was why wasn't their any follow up investigation into the disappearance of the cops and the girls father? The Sheriff knew what they were doing. Besides, as soon as the cheerleader body was found in the trunk of the victims car, the FBI would be called in and the whole countryside would be crawling with feds and cops.Some people liked the no hope ending and tout it as being realistic. Folks logically assume there is no way these young people would get away from these maniacs. All of the victims die and none of the killers are punished. This is true to an extent. But with the cops in the story and the dead cheerleader in the trunk (I mean it was all over the news), you really have to suspend your disbelief. Like I wrote previously, cops and feds would investigate. Maybe a better ending would be like a siege like a Waco or something (with less people though). The Fireflies rig up explosives in a suicide instead of getting caught. Going out in a blaze of glory taking out their victims and maybe more cops too. Or maybe they just leave out the cop angle altogether? I did like some of the cast. It was fun seeing Karen Black being creepy again. Sid Haig I recognized from some 70's-80's exploitation movies and TV was memorable as Captain Spaulding. Michael J Pollard was only in the movie at the beginning, which was a shame. Dennis Fimple was another guy I recognized. He is one of those guys you say, ""I've seen that guy in stuff but I can't remember what"". In fact, half of the older cast members fit in that category.I hope that Rob Zombie gets better at film-making because he has a ghoulish sense of humor. Its just that cheap thrills are not scary.

It seemed like either way too much was cut out or there is just a lot of problems going on inside Rob's mind.

361,vitalusty,Why does this film move me to nausea?!?,2,18 April 2003,"Horror films are a wonderful genre.  Films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left work because of solid storytelling, unpredictable turns and steady tension.  Not to mention amazing performances.House of 1,000 Corpses chose to follow four characters and their journey into `hell'. These characters are blank, boring and, in the end, less developed than anything else in the story, except, quite possibly, the very myth they are chasing, Dr. Satan.So we follow four unwritten characters through a story that has no direction, hammy performances and disturbing imagery.  The only real relationship between any of the characters is between Baby and the girlfriend, who have two confrontations and show conviction and passion for hurting the other.  That could have been compelling if it was written or directed to be.Another strange and absurd relationship is that between female pornography and mutilation.  As a woman, it was nauseating to sit through opening credits.  Sex is something that feels good and provides pleasure, what the hell does that have to do with severed heads and pulling off limbs?  I mean beyond the general stereotype of an adolescent boy's slumber party.  One would hope they don't hold both activities in mind at the same time.  I don't know how to react to it, how to be moved by it and what it has to do with the story.  I guess for general stimulation . . . how clever.A hell that becomes deeper and deeper, more and more vague, tortured cheerleaders and incessant giggling over the dismemberment of each character; this isn't a narrative film, it is a music video, scraping all its content from the top of cable television. Stick with Nightmare on Elm Street, The Entity, and TCM.  And check out Natural Born Killers for effective vertical cutting in a narrative structure.",House of 1000 Corpses

Second of all, I enjoyed the collage of disturbing images and sick scenes. I found them to be both amusing and disgusting at the same time. Seeing that guy done up as a fish was just plain bizarre.The whole DR. Satan thing was a little out there but also quite amusing.

Good film.",House of 1000 Corpses
363,brand_nu_sim,"Disappointing, big time",5,16 April 2006,"I don't get why so many people are of the ""If you don't like it, you're not a true horror fan"" attitude regarding this movie.I love horror movies and I love gory movies, but I really didn't like 'House of 1000 Corpses'. From the samples in his music and the very name of the band White Zombie, I knew Rob Zombie was a big fan of horror movies, so I was really looking forward to this.Unfortunately, this movie is what MTV would look like if it were rated NC-17: loud, busy, frantic, shallow, and largely mindless. Yes, the movie contains numerous references (homages) to past horror films, and that's a good thing, but other than that all it really has going for it is Sid Haig (who is hilarious, and comes across as far and away the best actor in the film).The biggest problem with the film is that it never develops any atmosphere whatsoever, and thus fails to ever become scary. Zombie doesn't choose between a loud and zany carnival of a movie and an atmospheric and tense lost-in-the-middle-of-nowhere movie, so the result is a house full of murderous hicks in the middle of nowhere that looks and feels like a torture theme park on speed. The endless palette of colours, including fluorescents, and the jarring and fast-paced editing, and the hand-held camera work, and the insufficiently motivated switches between camera stock, these all add up to make the movie chaotic.It doesn't help that the four main ""victim"" characters are not developed enough to be sympathetic. It also doesn't help that the murderous hicks are such a random assortment of characters with no clear reasons for doing anything at all. The mother and daughter are manipulative and briefly (only briefly) slutty, but otherwise don't do much; Tiny is underused; the musclebound one seems inexplicably to be a decent mechanic who actually fixes the car for no particular reason; the grandfather seems like nothing but underused comic relief...And then there's Otis, who oscillates randomly between being a sadist and a wanna-be cult leader. His passions seem to be behind the family luring people to their house (and Captain Spaulding helps them, which doesn't make any sense for his business, killing off people who could recommend his museum/gas station/chicken shack to others). However, Otis' changes of mind come as quickly as the edits in the film, and likewise make little sense: he tells the cheerleaders about his bizarre ideas, only to torture and kill some, and give the rest to Baby as playthings. He tortures Bill, then makes him into a Fiji Mermaid for no particular reason. The family buries two people alive in a pit, supposedly as sacrifice to the unexplained zombie-like things in the pit, all the while playing an Alistair Crowley recording though the family are never shown to follow Crowley's religious beliefs. The pit is connected to a sort of dungeon, where a couple of people are using impossible technology to perform deluded (and fatal) experiments on people.Some of these situations might be scary, if they weren't combined in such a haphazard and ludicrous way, and if the movie used a calmer pace and a more limited colour palette to develop at least a little atmosphere ... and character sympathy, and character motivation...The film's story is derivative of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which is okay: most horror plots are derivative), but the difference is that TCM (the original one) took the time to establish the setting and the victims' characters so that the sudden appearance of action and tension and gore is shocking and horrific. In short, TCM is good horror. This is not.Please tell me The Devil's Rejects is better. Please?",House of 1000 Corpses

It's an art film, at best, with little to no gore at all.I couldn't wait for it to end, and when it did, I felt like I'd just wasted 90 minutes of my life.

It's a rough vision by Zombie which would become more clear in his later films.First the positive, House of 1000 Corpses has a wonderful Alice In Wonderland feel to it. Even though it might not be realistic the film keeps going deeper and deeper into the pits of hell. The film also establishes Zombie's ability to cast great obscure actors that have been M.I.A for a while but are given new life in his films. Captain Spaulding's character is probably the best thing in the movie.The negative is that the film seems to lack clear direction. The characters seem underdeveloped, except for Captain Spaulding. I think that Zombie may have also been hampered by filming on the universal back-lot which makes the film look too glossy and fake.Bottom line is that its what you would expect for someone's first film.",House of 1000 Corpses

As one who has been a fan of the classic horror movies as well as the newer ones, I can tell you that Rob Zombie has done his homework, there are many subtle elements that pay homage to dozens of other horror movies, whether its in the dialogue, the imagery or the actors. Yes, the movie is not that original, the plot is close to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", but Zombie is paying homage to it. That is a big reason Bill Moseley is in the film, who does a superb job, pretty much recreating his character from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Zombie adds his own unique style, with strange colors, dark music, and short clips of weird imagery, but he keeps the movie's style in line with the 1970's style Drive-In movies. I found the characters to be gruesome, sick, funny, and very entertaining.  I got such a kick out of everything in the movie, I want to see it again. I was most impressed by Zombie's direction, he never let anything sag or get tiresome. The little things added to my enjoyment: the stuffy Dad and jerky policemen, the homage to ""Freaks"", the mask of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" one of the victims was wearing, etc.  So many classic horror movies play up to the big chase or big kill at the end, but this movie was one great ride all the way through.  Maybe you have to 'get the joke', but I laughed, I jumped, and I had a smile on my face through the whole movie.",House of 1000 Corpses

The film bears no resemblance to the trailer or commercials I had seen advertising it.  I was surprised that I hated it that much because I am a huge horror movie fan. Not only was it graphic, disturbing, and beyond gory, it was poorly acted. Obviously it's trying to follow in the footsteps of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (a film I didn't really like but at least respected for it's originality at the time of it's production"", but only succeeds at making a third-rate version of the cult classic.   Words cannot describe how awful this film is.  I'm not trying to offend anyone who might have liked it, It's not like I'm a prude who would be opposed to any scary movie, I just think that this particular movie went above and beyond the norm and crossed that boundary of good cinema.  Aside from the excessive violence and gruesome bloodshed, this film has ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT.  There is no reason for anything, nothing makes the slightest bit of sense.  You can't relate to the characters you're supposed to relate to because they are less human and more caricatures of different types of people.  Aside from the shoddy acting, pitiful special effects, and excessive graphic violence, there is no movie.  It seems like Rob Zombie just thought up every possible disturbing situation and turned them into scenes that he dumped into a blender and mixed up because the final product is completely incoherent.  If you're an average person who likes a good scary movie every once and awhile, then DON'T RENT THIS.  This isn't your typical scary movie and you might be disappointed by the campy attempt at recreating the hype surrounding ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""  That's it.",House of 1000 Corpses

370,davidpentecost,The spirit is willing the execute lets it down,5,3 July 2005,"This is how I see it. Rob Zombie, writer & director ( and whatever else) here, is clearly a huge horror fan. In this film he is bringing together a patch work of all his favourite horror archetypes. And of course all horror fans (include myself) know them and welcome them. But inevitably this is not what makes a classic horror. Horror comes from a realisation of some hidden fear or anxiety which we routinely defend against. True horror films capture some universal fears and bring them to life. So all the films that this film is derived from and cites as the plot develops have made their contribution, done their thing and the viewing public moves on. HOTCs, being a patchwork, feels like the (almost) best bits of many other movies. It's not particularly shocking because its not new or different. It looks good but doesn't build suspense and apart from Captain Spalding, who was rather interesting, doesn't do characterisation very well. So what are we left with: One memorable scene with a line of cobwebbed corpses and a lot of iteration of things you have seen before. I think for my money 'Braindead' does the whole derivative thing better and includes laffs. Can't really recommend I'm afraid, I would like to because Zombie is such a horror fan.

House Of 1000 Corpses is very similar to movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it revolves around a group of friends taking a road trip through the country, meanwhile their car breaks down in front of a house filled with psychopaths who are out to kill them. I won't say anymore because I don't want to spoil how crazy this movie gets towards the end. There are many horror movies that try to be like TCM, but fail miserably and end up being cheap, blatant knock-offs, this film however is very original in that it uses a similar premise as TCM, but adds more supernatural elements and is very original in doing so. It's fun to watch, with memorable characters and a fantastic climax that will definitely pull you in. However, I would only recommend this film to die hard cult horror fans, the general public will not appreciate this film as much, plus there are several references to cult horror classics that some viewers may not understand. Anyway, Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses is a very original film that uses similar elements from other horror classics but does so in a way that is not repetitive and not painfully obvious. 8/10.",House of 1000 Corpses

Rob Zombie's take on the story is rather boring than terrifying, and lacks suspense and intelligent characters. The problem with this kind of horror today is that it shows too much and forgets about the number one rule of horror: let the audience's mind fill what's not shown on screen with their deepest fear.
The very few good things about this ""movie"" are the cool vibe at the beggining of it, and the TCM vibes present in the second half.
TCM worked so well because it was a first of its kind, and had a unique antagonist. After watching Rob Zombie's mess take a look back at TCM and spot the differences. Probably the most important of them all is that TCM, contrary to popular belief, doesn't really show that much gore on screen. You don't see the stuff you see in 1000 Corpses and yet TCM still manages to be scarier than Zombie's something that almost feels like a bad remake.

I didn't hate it...I didn't particularly like it. I just found it pointless and unentertaining. I was going to turn it off a half hour into the film, but decided to watch the whole thing in order to give it a fair review. I did, and was unimpressed. While some of the filming, set design, etc. deserved a glance, nothing ultimately held my interest. The worst thing about this movie is the lousy screenplay. Period. I didn't sympathize nor care for any of the victims. The most interesting character, I thought, was Captain Spalding and that's not saying a lot. The film just plodded along, throwing in a gory scene every once in a while in an adolescent attempt to shock and horrify. But it was ineffective in it's attempts. This isn't good horror folks. It views more like some two-hour twisted music video than like a movie with any substance. But in all honesty, did anyone really expect anything different from Zombie. He's a musician, not a screenwriter. It basically was a poorly thought out mishmash of stuff we've all scene done before (though MUCH better) in the cult horror films of the seventies like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Hills Have Eyes"". It's basically just bad plagiarism... Sorry...like I said, I neither hated it or loved it. I was just bored.",House of 1000 Corpses
388,Buffy_2012,A true testament to what a horror movie should be....,9,4 February 2013,"House of 1,000 Corpses is not for the weak stomached. The murders are gruesome and the Firefly family relishes in it all. Sheri Moon Zombie stars as Baby the beautiful yet most ruthless of the Firefly family. There are many greats of the horror genre in House of 1,000. Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding, Karen Black as Mama Firefly, Dennis Fimple as Granpa Hugo, and Bill Mosely as Otis. One of my favorite scenes is Captain Spaulding's famous ""Fuck You"" speech at the beginning, when 2 robbers make the mistake of coming into Captain Spauldings store. You meet the victims of the movie right after Captain Spaulding takes care of his 2 robbers. Jerry, Mary, Denise and Bill stop by Captain Spaulding's store hoping to get a good story for a roadside attraction book they are writing. In addition to being a store, Captain Spaulding also has a ""Murder Ride"". The four friends are then introduced to the legend of Dr Satan.In usual horror movie tradition the friends set off to find out more on Dr Satan and pick up a hitchhiker who plays a big part in the torture and mayhem that will befall this group. You get a unique look at the inner workings of a truly psychotic family. There are actually a few moments where the Firefly family is just like any other normal family. Once the four friends enter the Firefly home, the world as they know it is never the same.Mary, Bill, Denise, and Jerry unfortunately experience first hand the true, psychotic nature of the Firefly family and get their wish of seeing Dr Satan. This movie is not intended for young teens or kids. If you are a true lover of the horror genre, then this movie is for you.",House of 1000 Corpses

Trying to combine the original thrills and chills of 70's Horror movies with the advances of Costumes and technology of today. Rob Zombie's Ideas in this movie were totally going in the right direction. But just the General fighting between the different Decade styles totally throws the whole movie into a pile, lights it on fire and leaves it to burn till you have taken the DVD out of the Player...Mixing B-grade Actors and D-grade Actors is bound to have throw things out of balance as well, because they kill off most of the B-Grades by the middle of the movie. Sheri Moon's character ""Baby"" was the most annoying of all of the character, and the only thing that is her saving grace in the eyes of others (men in particular) is the fact that she would be naked or exposed in some scenes.If you like to watch C to D grade Horror Movies from the 70's and 80's, this movie is for you. But if not, save your money and rent something else... God it feels like any star with millions wants to make their own movie these days these days. Just because you think you have a great idea doesn't mean that people with half a brain are going to shallow it. I think everyone knows there is a difference between Horror and Faux Snuff. And when I heard that Rob Zombie said ""I wanted people leaving the cinema feeling bad"", I don't think feeling bad about spending $5-$16 on this piece of crap is what Rob meant.",House of 1000 Corpses
390,kraken777,"Very cool movie, lots of fun!",10,20 July 2004,"Rarely does an original, entertaining horror flick pop up these days. ""28 Days"" was a fresh, enjoyable ride, and scary for the first five minutes (before sacrificing all semblance of suspense in favor of flashy editing.). The ""Gen X"" horror films (Scream, Urban Legends, et al) are clever, but are less horror movies than murder mysteries, and recently we've been inundated with crappy video game spin-offs, flatulent, over-produced remakes of William Castle movies, or rip-offs of other old movies. The Sci-Fi Channel routinely and brazenly shows beat-for-beat rip-offs concocted by budding ""auteurs"" who wouldn't know an original idea if it walked up and bit them on the femur. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" re-energizes the ""Chainsaw"" sub-genre, with doses of smart ""Rocky Horror""-esque humor (instead of the loathsome ""one-liner"" 'tard clichés served up in standard horror cheese) and a cool sexy production style which brings to mind The Cramps.Not a big fan of Metal music, which seems a generally unimaginative and redundant genre, I was surprised by the quality of music in this film as well as the quality of the movie itself. Rob Zombie is not just a wealthy musician indulging his fantasy of directing. He is more talented than most of the young directors working in the horror field, and obviously more of a horror fan as well.And so we have a horror film for horror fans. If Grand Guignol splatter is not your bag or you've never gone to a cheap matinée in a bad part of town, you should probably wait for the next Wes Craven frappe or Joel Silver blimpie to get your taste of ""scares.""Otherwise, pop a cold one and fire up that doober... and prepare to be entertained.",House of 1000 Corpses

I don't know. What it is, is dull. When nothing had happened by about the half way mark, I thought great, they're obviously building to a gross out climax. Imagine my surprise when the credits rolled. It's a horror movie without suspense, without gore, without... HORROR! The family are obviously psychos, they obviously kill a lot of people.What a shame that doesn't make it on screen. What you get is 2 hours of clichéd 'mad folk', and one girl in particular screaming non-stop.Credit where it's due; on the back of the DVD case it reads 'harks back to a golden age when horror really meant horror and the guarantee of cinematic shocks was more of a threat than a promise'.They weren't lying!

There's no moral to the story and there's barely a plot, every main character dies so it ends the same way it begins.What makes this movie even more unwatchable is the fact that there's ear-piercing annoying giggling and screaming in every other scene. I almost turned off the movie but I kept watching because I wanted to see the murderers die horrible agonizing deathsThere aren't any likeable characters in the movie, there's no humor, there's nothing genuinely scary, there's no payoff, there's nothing learned and no moral to the story, so what is even the merit of watching it?

Thats a load of crap. I have seen all the Nightmare on Elm Streets, Halloweens, Friday The 13ths, Hellraisers, Evil Deads, etc. etc. I like film directors like John Carpenter, Wes Craven, George A. Romero, Eli Roth. I've seen some obscure horror films too, like Blood Beach, The Company Of Wolves and even seen The Last House On the left (even though I didn't like it that much).Problem I had with this film was it was too sadistic for its own good (the ""bunny"" killing scene especially made my blood turn cold), the villains antics grew tiresome, and THAT scene where the gun was held on the guy's head was JUST TOO LONG. No matter how stylish it was meant to be, it was just a director letting the scene run for too bloody long!That said, I didn't totally dislike this movie. I could see that Rob Zombie has an obvious fondness for the horror movie and he set out to create a familiar story with his own sadistic and creative additions. The film was effective at making me wonder if the actors playing the villains were really acting or not, they did seem genuinely disturbed. However, the victims were kind of ho hum.The production design of the film looked impressive too, with a lot of visual points of references to horror clichés.Main problem was that I didn't really enjoy watching it, and I grew bored with it in its latter stages.

I think the expectation was that this would be like Texas Chainsaw on acid, and it turned out to be Texas Chainsaw II on acid. Not too bad, but not what you thought it was gonna be. The most apt analogy, for which I must credit brother Derek, is that it's just like White Zombie's music - the album covers are the best part. Sure, you've got high points like ""More Human Than Human"" or ""Thunder Kiss 65"", but you know those albums are spotty musically, while the cover artwork is consistently amazing. This movie has its high points, too, but it's too hit-or-miss with the plot, characters, and even the horror - the sick carnival atmosphere, the set and character design (Dr. Satan could have been better, but everything else was pretty great), and the cinematography steal the show.

Movies such as Reservoir Dogs, Wild at Heart and Hannibal were more violent than this one. Makes me wonder what they edited.I didn't care at all about the teenagers. They were so dumb anyway, just like all teenagers in all horror movies are below average intelligence.There were also too many holes in the plot.*spoilers*When the teenagers were about to drive away from the house I take it they stopped to open some gate? I surely never saw any large gate and the police surely didn't stop to ring the bell when they came. I guess they closed the gate just for that night though as a trap? Hmmm....Why do horror movies always include incompetent police officers that never call for back-up or don't know how to use their firearms? By the way, don't policemen always call back to the station to tell where they are as they are investigating a place? Wouldn't they send out more cars when they noticed those policemen failed to report back?Oh, that cemetary had great acoustics, good echo. And how dumb was it for the girl to stop running? Geez, I would've run like nuts. And how the heck did Baby catch up with her so quickly? And how was she able to jump her without the girl noticing? Laughable.After the bonfire I am made to believe that Otis goes over to Spauldings place and lies down in the backseat of his car with a knife just in case one of them gets away? This is the most ridiculous part of them all.Yes, the ending did suck. I was thinking for a moment she'd get run over by a truck. That would've been better ending for this movie, more ironic.
I understand this was a homeage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Evil Dead. Anyone notice how Baby's laugh sounded the same as the demon in Evil Dead? And wasn't the tape Otis played in the end readings from the Book of the Dead? The part when Baby kills the girl in the cemetary was straight from Evil Dead, even the shot of the full moon. And I think I've seen Dr. Satan before in something Marylin Manson has done.
All in all, a quite bad movie. No way does it live up to the hype. Why people find this movie good is beyond me. It had potential, the setting was creepy at times, the house was the sort of scary place I'd hate to get lost in.

Anyway the way Mr. Zombie cuts back between colors and the actual scenes make for an awesome affect. Some of the shots used in the movie such as where the father of the family is chasing the girl in the tunnel and you see the view of the camera looking over her shoulder to see the monster was truly awesome. This movie was such a breath of fresh air to the over popularized current ""horror"" movies such as darkness falls and dreamcatcher.

Unfortunately it seems to have no original ideas of its own, and decides to take ideas from these cult classics.(Especially Tobe's Texas Chainsaw 74 work) The film is the usual teenagers meet their doom scenario with very little suspense building. There was at least 20 similarities from the film to Texas chainsaw original. Apart from these negatives on the film, I will mention that I liked the director's use of negative lens work, orange filters and fuzz and noise in some of the shots. (which gave the film a VHS 80's feel) The music was also worth a mention it was great metal, and the film made some nice use of montage works which did build the film up. House of 1000 corpses is an average film if your new to horror, Its very poor if you started watching 'original' works in the 80's.

You probably need to be a fan, if not a rabid fan, of horror movies to appreciate this movie in a Quentin Tarrantino kind of way. The two directors certainly have elements in common - a vast command of their genre, an unhesitating willingness to parse the best content of those who have gone before, etc. While Tarrantino is clearly one of the unparalleled masters of the art, this is not to imply that Zombie is anywhere near that level. And even though, IMHO, this movie is a highly entertaining assemblaged stroll through horror movies memory lane, subsequent Zombie efforts have demonstrated the unrepeatability of this magic, and which has since relegated him to a sparsely populated club of unabashedly tired and overplayed inartistic disasters the likes of which hail the love guru as miserable company.",House of 1000 Corpses

Its been done before, maybe, but Rob Zombies passion has breathed new life (or death) into the genre. It is so obvious after seeing this film that Rob Zombie knows and loves his horror. He is bursting with ideas and has managed to get so many of them compressed into this film which makes it a real treat for horror fans. You can watch this film and have fun playing spot the different film influences from classics like the Texas Chainsaw Masacre, The Hills Have Eyes and many others. House of 1000 Corpses is a continuous psychedelic visual feast thanks to the attention to detail and work that has gone into the sets, costumes and props, especially in the house. It is a work of art. Theatrical colourfull grind house slasher gore aplenty courtesy of Zombie. ~Highly recommended~",House of 1000 Corpses

419,evil-drdeath,"A crazy,psychedelic ride in horror",7,29 January 2006,"The first film from director Rob Zombie is a crazy,original,psychedelic and psychotic story of a family of serial killers,and it is a clear homage to all '70 and '80 horror flicks like ""the Texas chainsaw massacre"" (a clear inspiration to this work).The story is very linear:Some boys,wandering on the streets of America,discover a local story about a crazy doctor named Dr.Satan and they decide to investigate on it.Obviously the will fall prey to the maniac. The plot is very linear but the power of this movie is in the stunning visuals,the weird atmosphere and on the crazy direction of Zombie:Crazy colors and angles,weird characters and a crash ride through '70 atmosphere.It is a weird,full of black humor,campy,crazy tale.It is a title that requires an acquired taste to be liked,but if you are able to appreciate it don't miss it:you won't be disappointed.Otherwise,stay away from it.",House of 1000 Corpses

421,elijahfuchs-60353,House of 1000 Corpses Review,7,9 October 2019,"Rob Zombie took his first dip into filmmaking with this 2003 Horror film, that is, in all honesty, an interesting movie. Critics thoroughly bashed this film when it was released, though many audiences did enjoy it. What Rob Zombie creates in ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is a very violent, funny, yet divisive film that pays homage to exploitation horror films, as well as being incredibly self aware. People who are big fans of horror films such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" will probably really appreciate the film, while others who are not very interested in the genre will think the plot is unoriginal, filled with terrible acting, and very unnecessarily violent. The plot for this film truly isn't something audiences haven't seen before, but what makes Corpses better than an average horror film is the incredibly entertaining and personable characters. The characters in this film mock the backwoods serial killer family in that they are purposely exaggerated from the stereotype, and act as a satire on the genre. While Rob Zombie isn't necessarily known for his screenwriting, and has tended to go a little bit over the top with trying to make unlikeable characters(his Halloween films) he really does craft some fun and entertaining dialogue that does provide adequate characterization for those in the film. The inclusion of the grind-house-esque montages, Zombie illustrates his unique style and vision that makes this film fun to watch. The goal of this movie isn't to be the best film ever made, but to be an entertaining and grimy horror film, and it does its job well. There are some obvious flaws present, and this definitely is not a perfect movie. Sometimes Zombie does go a bit far in his attempt to create grotesque imagery and scenarios, as well as constant profanity that can be overused at some points. At times, the film would be better if it did choose whether it's going for a comedic tone, or that of a creepy and foreboding tone. There are also some characters that just are not characterized well, mainly the main female characters, as well as the officers, and one of the girl's father. Overall, Rob Zombie's first film is really fun, and I had a good time with it. If you don't like horror movies, you will probably think it's stupid. If you love old school, blood and guts horror films, you will probably enjoy this greatly. Probably one of the more stylistic horror films of the 2000s.",House of 1000 Corpses
422,purrple,House of 1000 huhs?,2,13 August 2003,"As a horror movie fan, I could not wait to see this movie.  I rented it as soon as it hit DVD.  I was promised a good gory film, that was scary and shocking.What was shocking about it?  Let's see.  The atrociously bad acting to start with.  Karen Black, how could you?  I get that these characters (Karen & family) weren't sane but there can be more to playing insanity than maniacal laughter.  Really it got to be quite annoying and trite.There really wasn't a plot.  The car didn't ""break down"".  The tire was shot by a man with a gun.  The house isn't abandoned it is inhabited by a very motley crew/family.  Who doesn't know these young people aren't in trouble when they get to the house? Predictable.As far as the gore goes. I've seen so much better.  The use of red lights only serves to show that the special effects people couldn't make the blood and gore look real without them.  Most of the so-called gore happens off camera.  Unlike my steak, I like my gore movies raw and bloody!  This wasn't.  Perhaps to some, this movie seems gory, but really there was more gore in Final Destination 2.Scary, this film is not.  When I sit there watching it and all I can do is say, ""Huh?"" over and over again, I know I've missed something.  ""Give me a B, Give me an A, Give me a B, Give me a Y.  What does it spell?""  ""What does it spell?""  That is the horror one captive must endure?  Good grief. Sounds like Sesame Street, not a horror movie.On the positive side, I thought some of the vignettes, that were interspersed between the forward progress of what little plot there is, were disturbing and somewhat creepy.  This medium is not without merit. However, I did not enjoy, the constant cutting between regular film and negative film. Too jarring and didn't add to the flow of the movie.  There were pauses for dramatic effect that lasted way too long as well.This film had some great potential.  But as to what was coming next and who was going to die next... saw it coming miles away.  I even predicted the ending because it has been done before.  I thought Sid Haig as Capt. Spaulding played a sufficiently creepy sideshow host.  He was the best of the actors.Film students should watch this movie, so it is clear what should NOT be done to make a good movie.By the time the climax rolled around, it had felt like ages since I'd begun watching and it hadn't even been 70 minutes.  The maniacal laughter, the bad acting the invisible plot and the truly lame bunny costumes hammered home how awful this movie really is.  I don't fault movies for not being deep and meaningful.  I like entertainment for the joy of it.  There is no joy here. I can only say, ""Huh?""  I say again, bunny costumes?!?",House of 1000 Corpses
423,mtreek,A welcome return to the true form of horror,9,13 August 2003,"After reading some of the reviews previously posted, I was compelled to write one of my own. I'm not a Rob Zombie fan but after seeing this movie, I was very impressed. This is the kind of movie that takes you back to the days when horror movies were freaky, gory, AND scary. Jason and Freddy are all good, but they are more comedies than horror flick. This movie truly is frightening because unlike others, when you place yourself in the position of any of the protagonist characters, you are just as screwed as they are. It's not one of those flicks where you yell at the screen, ""don't go in there!"" or , ""don't open that door!"" You'd likely be doing the same thing they are. The cinematoghraphy was great at capturing the terror. Some scenes are so intense, they keep you on the edge of your seat, with your eyes wide open, and your jaw dropped. All the characters are so facinating... scary in their own different way. It's true that this movie and it's characters bear a resemblance to Texas Chaisaw Massacre, but so what? I found this movie to be just as good as the classic if not even better. I'm going to go buy the DVD today.",House of 1000 Corpses
424,monster23,"Fun, Exciting, But Not New",7,1 May 2003,"Rob Zombie has created a classic, one which wears its influences proudly on its sleeve.  A person with any knowledge of horror films can watch this film and point out the various movies being referenced. It is truly a horror movie made by a horror movie fanboy.  All this talk about ""shocking, disgusting, revolting"" is complete garbage.  I sat there waiting for it to get nasty, but it never really does.  At least not to a level I've never before seen.This is a great film, and even if it doesn't do anything ""new"", it at least gives something that hasn't been seen in 20-odd years.  For me, the saddest part was watching it in a sparsely populated theatre, smiling and enjoying myself immensely, but at the same time being saddened as I realized that the majority of those around me just were not understanding what they were seeing.

425,chuckvick182,gore does not equal scary,1,12 April 2003,"Rob Zombies House of one thousand corpses was no more than a gore fest. It lacked the pops, jumps, and suprises that makes a horror movie worth seeing. Also, there was no plot. The movies direction was so loose that you never know if the first act ends. The whole movie is an introduction to the evil characters with no 2nd or 3rd act.  I was suprised to see that the images and the overall visuals of the movie where very well done. I credit Rob Zombie with this as a fan of his art work. The cross cutting did get a little old, but it made the story move foreword and couldn't have been left out. I was disapointed with the sound track. I don't even think Rob Zombie had a song in his own movie. The music was usually an ironic old school throw away. The type of music film makers find in public domane arcives. The movie could have use some modern rock.  So  if you like gore. No scare. Good visuals. Bad music. NO PLOT. You love this movie. Your also insane.",House of 1000 Corpses
426,howard-51,A Shocker all right!!,1,20 May 2004,"Yes, this film is truly shocking, but not for any gore or scares - it's just plain terrible. First of all, it isn't particularly gory and it certainly isn't scary - you'll get more of both in the remake of Texas Chansaw Massacre which is vastly superior to this trainwreck of a movie which is even more disturbing when you consider how bad that one was as well.The acting is uniformly terrible - clearly most of the 7,000,000 budget went on..... that's a good point, what did it go on? Sheri Moon stands out as being particularly bad, however, they are all so terrible it's probably not fair to single her out. Karen Black should know better and it shows just how low an actor can sink without resorting to hardcore porno movies - incidentally, what was the point of the 50's stag films loops that kept popping up? The special effects certainly aren't special, the sets wouldn't rate above average.The script is awful and the story isn't much better - how could a movie with a character called Doctor Satan be so bad? Some reviewers have commented on the last 15 minutes being ""terrifying"" - well, not only is it not terrifying, it's not even vaguely scary - the thing carrying the ax chasing the girl at the end is laughable and the collapsing tunnel supports disabling it was as pathetic as it obvious.Over all, it seemed like a really, really, really long boring music video (some of the music was OK - but if you like industrial style music and blood/gore buy 'Ain't it Dead Yet' by Skinny Puppy and you'll get better in both respects)Zombie is clearly strongly influenced by the original TCM, but doesn't have the talent to come even close (mind you, what other decent movies has Tobe Hooper made?). He tries to be creative with continual and multiple film effects and cutaway shots, different film stocks etc, however, it just looks like a real mess and comes across as someone who has just bought their first Mac with Final Cut and tried to use every effect that comes with it - Zombie should stick to drawing where he has some talent, but as a writer and director, he is utterly abysmal.Don't be fooled that this wasn't released for three years because of rating worries - clearly the studio saw what an absolute stinker this film is and figured that the only way they'd convince anyone to see it would be if they held it back because it was 'supposedly' too extreme - well it ain't.Another nail in the coffin of modern horror films (pun intended) 0/5",House of 1000 Corpses

430,theclarkone68,Don't waste your time *contains some spoilers*,1,2 April 2004,"Rob Zombie makes his directorial debut in this jumbled mess. It's suppose to be an homage to classic horror films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but why does there need to be (basically) another remake of TCM? Is stealing ideas from previous movies and doing them worse an homage? What happened to creativity? Originality? It just looks like they wanted to make a quick buck off of the popularity of previous horror classics. This is The Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets MTV and the results aren't pretty.The story? There's not much of one - teenagers stupidly wind up in a house resided in by a crazy family. The poor camera work hinders the viewer's attempt at following the plot because of the fuddled imagery Zombie presents. Take a weak story, add in confusing camera work and what do you get? Nothing good. Some of what happens in the movie is left up to the viewer to decide, but to me the movie was such a mess that I just didn't care.The characters are the same cliched fare. There's the dumb teenagers who don't yet know what they got themselves into, the crazy, stab-happy family complete with deformed and masked sibling, and some helpless cops. None of the teenagers are engaging or developed or charismatic or give you any reason to care for them so you don't feel any sympathy for any of them. Their subpar acting and poor dialogue doesn't help either. The family is crazy without any kind of explanation, but at least they're somewhat interesting. They're also annoying so you kind of want to see them get theirs. The deformed guy is just a useless 'Leatherface' thrown in as an ""homage"" and for some poor humor. The cops are the same useless cops who don't survive for very long which you've seen in countless other movies.
Is it actually a horror movie? Not to me. It's not scary at all, just weird. None of the characters allow you to connect with them and the camera work is muddled so there's no sense of suspense. This movie left me with a question: would a monkey throwing feces at a movie screen make for a better movie?",House of 1000 Corpses

Sure, this movie isn't a classic, but I think it will definetly retain a cult following. Rob Zombie has shown us that he could possibly give us something brilliant one day, if he can come up with his own story.  The extras on the DVD are awesome.

His use of all fears is sure to give everyone a chill.  Zombie's use of light/dark created the perfect atmosphere for killing. This film was full of excitement from start to finish, and always takes a turn towards the unexpected. Zombie has created a classic horror with the use of physical effects, he did not use any digital effects which keeps the 1970's atmosphere consistant.

435,john_life,House of 1000 Corpses: Rob Zombie is the Tarantino of the Horror Genre,10,23 January 2012,"House of 1000 Corpses is about two young couples quest for off-beat, local color on the back roads of Texas. During their trip, they are kidnapped by a family of sadistic psychopaths who ultimately introduce them to a local serial killer who makes them look tame in comparison. After picking up a beautiful young hitchhiker (Sheri Moon) known only as ""Baby,"" they find refuge on Halloween eve in a broken down country house that is home to the Firefly family. The mother is a long-in-the-tooth nymphomaniac; the daughter is a flirtatious sociopath; one brother is a deformed, hulking beast; another brother is a giant mechanic; a third brother is an Ed Geinish sadistic surgeon/rapist; a grandfather is a boastful, profane buffoon; and a local friend or relative runs a tourist trap museum/gas station of the bizarre. The kidnapped couples experience a variety of the surreal before their descent into a living hell of torture and murder at the hands of the Firefly family, who's banter with each other and with others is both engaging, humorous, captivating, and ultimately terrifying. The strengths of the movie are its constant tension, it's character interaction/dialog, and despite its psychedelic features...it's realism. These monsters are real and seem to exist for the sake of evil itself, killing just to kill, tormenting just for the sake of fun, hurting just because they can. They are forces of a cruel world at work, bad that happens to people for the sake of badness. They are not unlike Anton Chigur of ""No Country for Old Men,"" who has his own mores and code of right and wrong for living, or Leatherface's clan of bad guys in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" If you like stories that are dialog-driven like Tarantino's movies, you will love Zombie's movies including this one. They are both master story tellers and if you like the interaction between Vincent Vega and Jules of ""Pulp Fiction"" or Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" you will be enraptured by ""House of 1000 Corpses.""

If you want more than that then go elsewhere but it's an entertaining, mindless way to kill an hour or so- watch this if you like to laugh at films.The directing was good I thought... maybe a little 'music video' but with some interesting ideas. Sid Haig was excellent and the film should have featured a lot more of him. After we are introduced to Sid, the rest of the films feels a bit like it's just a endless procession of crazy characters and costumes which seems a unnessesary.Also this isn't really a horror- it's more gross than horrifying and I think it has probably been cut down quite a lot because there is nothing here that warrants the film being so hard to release...",House of 1000 Corpses

441,JSValentine,"A perfect blend of horror, intrigue and absurdity",7,5 March 2015,"Watching films with no prior knowledge of the plot or public reception is often the best way to grasp a completely unbiased and fresh view, which is precisely what happened with my viewing of House of 1,000 Corpses. During the opening sequence, I was immediately reminded of American Horror Story, the recent FX anthology series. The surreal, purposefully old-fashioned and excessively artistic introduction may seem bizarre to some, but I thought it provided just the right level of intrigue as an opening. The tone of the film was also set at the start which I thoroughly enjoyed, as it was made very clear that the film did not take itself at all seriously. However, House of 1,000 Corpses cannot be classed as part of the well-trodden horror-comedy genre, as the comedy is extremely irreverent and the atmosphere that the film creates is eerie and bizarre.The trope of a group of friends' car breaking down in a remote part of America and falling victim to an insane and sadistic family is one that has been recreated in so many instances it could have easily seemed dull and unoriginal, but this is far from the case. House of 1,000 Corpses is a satire of the horror genre as much as it is a part of it, combining genuine shocks with fantastic art-house elements and enough obscurity and tension to keep the audience enthralled. Much like the equally brilliant recent film, The Cabin in the Woods, House's charm lies in the very fact that it takes a popular low-budget horror trend and turns it into something far more. The premise is simple, but the clever scripting and unnerving execution are what impressed me.The acting, too, deserves merit. The actors playing the lost group of friends managed to portray excellently their different characteristics and created entertaining caricatures that interacted perfectly with the Addams family-like portrayal of the antagonists, the actors and characters of which I thoroughly enjoyed, as their inane joy mixed with absurdity and cruelty combined to create hilarious and memorable yet also undeniably evil old-fashioned villains.I would certainly recommend this film to horror fans, but also anyone who would appreciate something a little different from your average slasher film, as its originality is a quality to be greatly congratulated.",House of 1000 Corpses

I urge people to see this one if they are a fan of the horror genre. There was not a moment in the movie that I felt bored. It was constant killing after killing. A completely original horror movie from someone who's brand new to the directing scene. This made me want to see the new Halloween remake, and I was absolutely stunned by it's greatness as well.

All the favor is put towards the bad guys, and the good guys do absolutely nothing. That's just boring to me. With the exception of Captian Spalding who I liked, all the villains were taken from other movies and just horrible. And just when I can't imagine it getting any worse, there is all that pointless editing and color effects between scenes that completely distract from the movie.The few things in this movie that could only be described as good are taking from other films.

The gore was somewhat good, but mostly cheesy. The storyline tried o act like it was completely original, ya know, unique, but the fact is it was just a bunch of ideas stolen from other movies. The special effects sucked, I was bored out of my mind. I was lost most of the time because I kept drifting off into space. Started out alright, then begins to hit the drainage. And weren't we all expecting it to be a lot better! Oh well. But I did think it was fairly OK, I wouldn't mind watching it again.

Here's an interesting concept -- how about a story!? Have you noticed that the actors in the behind-the-scenes all praised Mr. Zombie? It is so embarrassing to observe actors gushing over how great their director is while (here is the key point) making the movie? Funny, but I don't recall seeing any of these lunkheads blitzing the press or talk shows doing the same after this crap was released to the general public and they were paid. Good grief, how far Karen Black has fallen. I see it took ""Halloween"" for Mr. Zombie to construct a film based upon a story and plot. Too bad, although not surprising, it was written by a real screenwriter and filmmaker named John Carpenter. Who in the world thought it was a good idea to throw money at this freak-show, Rob Zombie? Well, with all of that said, it remains a fact that if this bonehead can carve out a living making films like this, they by gosh... ANYONE CAN DO IT!!!",House of 1000 Corpses

448,etruiii,A group of typically smart-ass teenagers fall prey to psychotic slashers in the middle of nowhere - you know the plot...,8,24 March 2006,"I really enjoyed this. I'll be the first to admit that there's not much in terms of a story or plot, but you can tell that Rob has done his homework on the genre. The characters in ""House"" and the sequel ""Rejects"" are worth the price of admission (or rental) alone.The atypical group of everyday smart-ass teenagers, the psychotic family in the middle of nowhere, the backgrounds, lighting, etc. - all are right on the mark. The best part is Capt. Spaulding the overseer on the insanity. The introduction to him in the beginning of the movie is a must see for appreciating people who are genuinely ""nucking futs""... To really appreciate the attention to detail you have to watch it 2 or 3 times so you can soak in all of the bits and pieces. I've seen others call this an homage to the genre, and it is. If you take the time to go back and watch some of the classics - ""Texas Chansaw Massacre"", the ""Friday The 13th"" films, the ""Halloween"" films, you will find a lot of close comparisons that can be made. I highly recommend it.",House of 1000 Corpses
449,uselesswarrior,Derivative Music Video Horror Mess,2,28 July 2006,"Initially I had little or no interest in this film but after hearing good things about it from a lot of sources I decided to check it out. Unfortunately for me this was not a new classic of horror that some people hail it as, it's a disjointed mess that's light on scares, originality, and fun. House of 1000 Corpses somehow manages even to mess up when it comes to plot structure, something even the lowest of horror movies can usually pull off.It does have a few redeeming elements; the carnival sideshow style of horror is an interesting motif for the film, Sid Haig's character is cool and underused unfortunately, and occasionally Zombie manages to unnerve by using quick jumps to snuff like 16mm footage, a technique that would have been better served if the director was able to exercise more restraint, especially in the early film. The film also contains a rather clever plot misdirection about mid way through, a subplot about cops and one of the victim's father that makes you think the plot is going to evolve one way, but then completely changes direction you. I have to give credit to Zombie for fooling and surprising me.The film's real problem is in the comparison it invites with its betters, this film basically is ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and it doesn't hold up well to the seminal 1974 classic. A movie that was made for approximately $140,000, that still manages to be way more effective then House. Maybe if you stripped Zombie of his 7 million dollar budget he would have been able to show his true film-making chops and been able to pull off the low budget fun and carnage he so desperately tries to achieve with this film; more likely this film would have been stripped of it's disguise of high production values and clever sets, and be revealed to everyone as the naked unfocused mess that it is. Even with its budget, the gore is nothing; there is nothing shocking or creative or fun. Maybe the unrated version is better, but since it's completely unavailable I have no way of knowing. As the R rated version stands it fails as a gross out flick and then later goes on to fail even completely at the loftier goal of actually being scary. When I first watched TCM I really was unnerved by it, and I found myself thinking about for weeks after. I watched House of 1000 Corpses today, and nothing has stayed with me; what little effect it had on me was gone the second I stopped watching it. Hell, I might even be fooled into renting this again years from now when I completely forget about it.""So what"", you might say, ""it's not scary, not all movies of this variety have to be scary, look at Evil Dead 2"". Well the problem is it's not really fun either. The teen victims are completely indistinguishable, which in fairness is pretty common complaint for this genre, and the killers, who the film is obviously in love with, are just too gaudy and derivative of slasher stereotypes. The one that had the ability to stand out from the crowd, Sid Haig's Captain Spaulding, disappears for most of the movie. So for most the film you are left with a plot, that much like victims, runs but never gets anywhere. It almost seems like a masturbation reel for serial killers. I get what he was going for, I've seen the dinner scene from Texas Chainsaw Massacre (there is that comparison again, but I can't help if the shoe fits), Zombie just doesn't achieve the disquieting creepy effect that film had. Towards the end the plot just spirals out of control into what I think was a failed attempt at surrealism, personally I was just glad it was going somewhere. After what is a close approximation of the last teen going through a house of horrors, the films ends on a truly predictably note that once again feels ripped from TCM.Overall this movie just kinda sucks plain and simple. I get that it's a homage, but it's just not a particularly effective one. Zombie might eventually be able to develop his directing into something interesting but first he has to clear the hurdle from music video style and shock to film atmosphere and substance. I will end by saying one more positive thing about the film; it's not the 2003 remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",House of 1000 Corpses
450,Prettytomboy,Definitely the most shocking film I've ever seen.,1,17 March 2006,"Words can't describe this.I've seen most horror movies. I'm a DVD junkie, and while gore is always fun in horror flicks, I love that feeling of suspense and terror the classics always deliver.This was pretty much a horror flick, without the suspense. It wasn't anything I could respond to in an emotional way- I wasn't frightened, I wasn't curious as to what would come around the corner.Now before you say anything else, I've seen the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""...I've seen them all, and I enjoyed the suspense and the mass slayings- such movies I consider to have backbone.This film started off interesting, dropped into the depths of dullsville (young adults find themselves trapped in a rundown house with maniacs), and then quickly got sick. And then sicker. And then revolting. It became so disturbing, that I lost all sense of what I was watching. Throw the storyline out the window- this was so unbelievably disgraceful that by the end, my mind was in a mess just trying to comprehend what I had seen.Now, I'll admit the MA rating we have for this film here in Australia was WAY off the mark. How it received such a docile rating, is beyond me. I'm not saying a R18+ rating would have stopped me from hiring it, but if there are people out there considering renting or purchasing this movie for anyone under the age of 18, I'd highly persuade you to hold off.Now, all of that isn't bad if you're pretty much a crazed loony and enjoy sadistic violence. To those of you who do enjoy such viewing, than you will probably buy this movie and watch it every week.To those of you who enjoy horror movies, but prefer the mainstream classics, I wouldn't recommend this. Being such a fan myself, I would never watch this movie again nor allow it in my presence. I think I'd prefer to hold onto my sanity so I can enjoy something worthwhile.Sick. 1/10 stars.",House of 1000 Corpses

454,Leiche,Return to the good old Days,10,24 April 2003,"After almost 3 yrs. of lurking in banishment Hell,Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses sees the Light of Day. First Universal dumped the Movie due to ""moral"" issues,but decided to let R.Zombie shop it around for another Distributor. Almost a year later MGM stepped up to the plate,but decided to throw Rob Zombie and his twisted Creation out of the editing room,after his illfated injoke about MGM's lack of Morals on MTV. More searching ad Hairpulling ensued until Lion's Gate picked up the Hot Potato called ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and the rest is ""History"" Guess which two Major STudios are pulling their hair now,after the unforseen success of HO1000C? Now to the Big Question,many Horror Fans have been asking. Is this the 2nd.Coming for Horrormovies? Yes and No! If you are looking for and are used to watered down Horror Flicks like ""I know what you did last Summer"",""Scream 2&3"",""13 Ghosts"" among others you will most likely be dissapointed. But if you,like me,yurn for the Good old Days of Horror which produced such ""Classics"" like ""The Hills have Eyes"",Lucio Fulci's""The Beyond"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1&2"" than it almost appears to be the 2nd. Coming! HO1000C very obviously and unashamed draws it's inspiration from the aforementioned Movies. Even though the Basic Plot of a bunch of Teenagers running afoul of something and/or someone Sinister seems more than a little tiresome,Rob Zombie never lets the Movie slip into the washed out category of recent Teeniebopper Horror Movies. Solid performances,albeit being Over the Top at times,by Bill Moseley(Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2's Chop Top),Sid Haig as Dr.Spaulding and Sherri Moon(Baby) make HO1000C stand apart from recent lackluster acting displayed in newer Movies. Even though the Movie sometimes looks like a Rob Zombie Music Video,he keeps it from slipping into this Category by not choosing to use his songs during some of the segments but rather sticking with a regular Movie Soundtrack. I wish some of the Characters would have been more fleshed out,aspecialy the reason behind the final incarnation of ""Dr.Satan"" during the final act of the Movie,but using your own imagination can answer that Question too.

455,crystalboogie,Gourgeously Gory!! Fabulously Freaky!! Come one. Come all. Its Showtime!!!,10,12 April 2003,"I have waited three years for this flick and was in no way disappointed. I am a Chicago native and now live in Jackson, Tennessee (in between Memphis and Nashville). I was shocked to learn that ""House"" would not be released in Jackson for a month. I immediately got on the computer and found the scedules for Memphis. I was surprised to find it was only playing in four theatres there. Anyhow, I got my butt in gear, jumped in my car with a buddy and raced to Memphis to cath the 5:00 show.I don't even know where to start about this movie. It blew my mind. It totally exceeded all of my expectations! It is quite obvious that Rob Zombie is as big of a fright fan as I am. He knows his horror history and was eager to pay homage to it. In ""House"" I saw the influences of: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1 and 2 (in the twisted dialogue, black humour, and sadistic depravity of the family), Last House on the Left (the grainy flashes intercutting the film were reminiscent of the cemetary disemboweling scene and one scene of ""house"" is definately influenced by the same), Last House on Dead End Street (the sadistic depravity of the characters and the grainy flashes throughout the film), Funhouse( the funhouse and the mutant son), and Natural Born Killers (Sheri Moon as ""Baby"" oozes Mallory Knox). Zombie has enough artistic talent however to make ""House"" not a rip-off of these movies but a cult phenomenon (I predict) all of its own. All of the performances in this movie were stellar: Sid Haig, Michael J. Pollard, Bill Mosely, and best of all Karen Black. Sheri Moon also gave an awesome performance, considering it was her first acting gig.I can't find the words to describe how gory, disturbing, depraved, disgustiong, and visually pleasing this movie was. Zombie obviously understands the fine line between sex and death, and gore and beauty. I thought the movie was aesthetically phenomenal. I am reluctant to give out any spoilers, so all I have left to say, is sit back and enjoy the ride, because its a wild one!!",House of 1000 Corpses
456,kogteguleroedder,"Wicked evil, and the best slasher-movie I can think of",8,10 July 2008,"I truly don't understand why this movie has such a low score... First off, I'm not especially into horror-movies; I ain't easy to scare, and normally I don't enjoy watching people get tortured and stuff :) I have been reading a handful of reviews of this movie, and some of them say it's only for some people who like 70' slasher movies - whatever that is anyway. I'm just a guy who normally likes movies like Juno, Snatch and then occasionally a good horror-movie. And I wholeheartedly enjoyed this movie (for what it is), and was scared shitless throughout most of the film. This movie is viciously evil and dark, there was some twisted humor and some great characters. That being said, there wasn't much of a storyline, and it sure wasn't flawless.First off, the things I liked about this movie: The whole hillbilly-theme I thought was kick-ass. Spauldings theme-park and the firefly house were so damn cool, and the atmosphere really sucked me in. The male villains were some of the coolest I have seen in a movie. Spaulding was disgusting and damn funny at the same time. Otis was a real hillbilly and looked like one too. When he changed into Dr. Satan, I thought he was so scary. The grandpa was just insane and Tiny... Tiny seemed like such a nice guy, I thought the scene where he lets the girl loose was awesome - the way he waved goodbye was so funny. I haven't got much to say about R.J. but he was fairly cool and believable. Last off, the whole evil part of the movie was what made it, the family seemed so insane and the way they killed people was cruel and scary.As I said, the movie is by no means perfect. The female villains, mother firefly and Baby was too over-the-top. It sounded so fake when they 'laughed insanely' and Baby was goddamn annoying and unbelievable. In their defense they do a damn well job in the follow-up 'the devil's rejects' (a much better film that this by the way(EDIT. oh, didn't know mother firefly was a different actress in devil's rejects)) and I watched that one before house of 1000 corpses and thought baby was great - and hot. As I said before this movie doesn't really have a actual story, it's pretty much just about the family killing a bunch of guys - which is fine, but it works so much better in the devil's rejects. Oh yeah, and the last part with the operations was too far fetched.Lastly, just some things i would like to say. The movie was very unrealistic (luckly), not really a bad thing though, but compared to the devil's rejects it was a bit too much. And there is a lot of cursing in the movie, but compared to Rob Zombie's Halloween where i thought it destroyed the movie, in house of thousand corpses it worked fine and was believable.So to sum up, it has flaws and it's easy to see this is Rob Zombie's first film, but sure did the job as a brainless slasher-movie. The violence is great and the atmosphere and the characters really saved the movie for me - actually, in my opinion, this one and the follow up are the best slasher-movies I have ever watched (bear in mind I'm not really into this kind of movies). I recommend this movie to everybody who wants to see a good gore-flick, and I don't understand why people don't like it. But even if you don't like this movie, do still watch the devil's rejects, because it IS better, and I reserve 10 stars for that one.",House of 1000 Corpses
457,Rockhigh,"The work of a true horror fanatic, and quite good at that!",9,12 April 2003,"**** out of *****Zombie's debut is a great throwback to the horror films of yesteryear. Stirring in elements of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Suspiria, and The Beyond, he has created a surrealistic horror rock video of sorts. The film is filled with graphic images shot through filter lenses, spliced in with the familiar tale of kids breaking down on a lonesome road. They of course find shelter with our film's monsters. Zombie has spared no expense in detail as we get a true taste of all of the things that go bump in his night. We see and hear little bits of everything we all may have thought scary at one time in our life (I love the laughing boxes heard throughout, CREEPY!). Zombie knows his horror and doesn't care much about giving us a true piece of originality, but instead filters it all into a kind-of ""greatest hits of horror"" that comes at you with undaunting pace. The characters are very colorful and even the not-so-lucky kids aren't the usual ""Scream Teen"" types. Props to Zombie for the Cop scene, it was rather original.The film is an assult on the senses, and although it loves it's violence, it never makes it too much to take. There is a violent stabbing that the theatrical cut has edited by a few seconds but all in all it's done in the name of fun. I don't think you'll need smelling salts.I also can tell you that seeing the theatrical release will be dishearting for some. I happened to see not only the theatrical version, but an earlier cut (yes, with more gore) as well.

As I stepped into the theater I thought I was in for a great movie.  I thought the movie had great potential, but I fell flat on my face.The first scene deals with a holdup at a freak show, if you will, which has no reflection on the rest of the movie.  These kids are out touring the country they stop in take a tour and decide to go ghost hunting.  Their car breaks down so they board with the family from hell, which at the time seemed better to house with them then watch the rest of the movie.  About an hour later I had to check my pulse to make sure I was still breathing. This movie was not a horror.  It was more like Rob Zomie throwing in a few people having them chopped up and add sucky 70's country in the background for a murder scene.  As much as I like Rob Zombie's music, his overall producing and directing skills sucked.  It's alright Rob stick to music.P.S.

NOTHING, there is nothing I can say except that you must see it in order to find out just what you think, don't listen to any holier than thou snobs who wanted to rip the film apart from the get go, ALSO do not listen to delusional geeks who created an imaginary horror movie in their head and were disappointed that Rob Zombie was unable to fulfill their selfish fantasies. The only way you are going to know if this movie is for you is for you to see it, so to help motivate you I will now discuss how much I LOVED THIS FILM!!! To me, House of 1,000 Corpses is a modern day Last House on the Left, for it is a movie that is being viewed by those who just don't get it and are hating it for reasons I can not see. When Last House was released onto the world it was called, appalling, boring and a waste of film, some of those same things are being attached to Rob Zombie's film and the fact that someone can HATE this movie is disturbing and offensive to me. SO, right now, I will go on record as to say that HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES it is one of the most visually stunning horror films I have seen in a long time, and it is so damned deliciously trashy with all its images of sex and horror memorabilia that it won me over within the first ten minutes and treated me right all the way to the end!  From the fantastic opener to the wonderfully vile opening credits (which were laced with all kinds of nudity and dismemberment) and all the way to the end, this movie treated me right and if I were its date I would have allowed it to hump me.HERE IS A MOVIE NOW, IN MY TIME that KNOWS what it is doing, it knows what it wants, knows what HORROR is and it NEEDS an audience!!! This is the kind of horror film I have wanted to see for years on the big screen and now that this great horror movie has arrived IT IS BEING P***ED ON!!! I know if it weren't for the hype, or Rob Zombie being the director, people would have a more open minded view BUT NO, some people will not just look at what they have, THEY WANT MORE, they want perfection! WELL GUESS WHAT this movie, at least to me, is a sliver away from PERFECTION! This is my horror fantasy film and I don't like any horror movie that isn't at least 15 years old (with the exception of perhaps 3)! It is funny, trashy, violent and even beautiful! No, the walls are not dripping with gore in this R-rated version, but the shots that are shown are oozing with a fresh kind of creepiness that has been missing for a long time in recent `horror' films. I know there are people who say it is just a rip off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre but I saw it as more of a grand homage than a rip off, in fact it is a grand homage to all GREAT HORROR! It has a little bit of everything that made me love horror films in the first place, not just gore and blood, but those dark images that stay in your mind, those scenes that your body reacts to and that wonderful feeling that what you are watching is just wrong, but you love it! It's like having really good dirty sex with a stranger in a graveyard!!People complain about the teenagers being annoying, NO CRAP this is the kind of movie where YOU WANT THEM TO DIE, you watch and grin ear to ear as they are tortured and mutilated! I love the scene where the character named Otis goes off on one of the victims about the over privileged and spoiled youth. AND THAT IS ANOTHER THING, the lines, this movie is also peppered with great B-movie speeches and one liners (and great ironic phrases on T-SHIRTS AS WELL!!!) .  HOW CAN ANY SELF- RESPECTING FAN OF HORROR DENY THIS FILM?*minor spoiler*And also anyone who complains about the prolonged `gun to the cop's head shot' completely missed out on an opportunity to take part in one of the best `money shots' ever filmed!! The wait.wait.wait.BOOM!! Holy S*** I LOVED THAT, I've never seen that. you should have heard the quiet in the audience and than the massive exhale (and scattered applause) after the cop's head was finally pierced with a bullet, F***ING BEAUTIFUL!!!! .
*end of spoiler*So  will YOU like House of 1,000 Corpses? The answer to that question rests within the eye of the beholder but, LUCKY ME, I have been waiting over two years and House of 1,000 Corpses was worth it!  And to the people who don't like it, don't try to give off the impression that the world is backing your stance because when this film ended the place erupted with loving and accepting applause (with the exception of TWO people, that I know of, who didn't like it).

So I was very guarded when the movie started. I must say, I'm very disappointed in people's inability to understand anything that is not spoon fed to them. I understand that there are people who just don't like the graphic and disturbing nature of the film. That's fine. There are genres that I don't like. But, this movie was so well put together I was floored. The biggest complaint I heard from critics was it was hard to follow. A true sign of the ADD way we watch films these days. I found no problems following the plot. It was a very inventive way to rework an old theme. Zombie's way of linking the film thru unorthodox, but completely understandable, imagery was groundbreaking. Sid Haig, Sherri Moon and Bill Moseley were particularly great!! It's NOT Scream! And perhaps that's the problem. People can't accept movies that don't fit the formula, or that don't have GAP kids in it. If this movie makes less than ""13 Ghosts"", ""Lost Souls"" or some other boring Hollywood ""horror"" crap. I'm moving to Baghdad.",House of 1000 Corpses
467,mangiman,So let me get this straight...,7,14 April 2003,"...Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith (both of whom I am a huge fan) can take every pop culture event they liked as kids, mix it with a basic plot lifted from their favorite 70's films (In Tarantino's case anyway) and they are ""cutting edge, genius, re-inventors of a genre"". However, Zombie is just ripping off Texas Chainsaw Massacre. OK, That makes sense. Who gives a flying bandito brother that the basic plot was modeled after TCM? IT WAS SUPPOSED TO! What's with the nit picking?? It's a movie. When I drove out to Arizona in my 20's we stopped at every roadside freak show that boasted a two-headed cow or a 400 lb hamster we came across. It's fun. (Unless of course a family of psychos kill you and wear your skin. But I digress.)Why is everyone so upset about the car breakdown...which, just to get clear, it didn't ""happen"" to break down. They were set up. The tire was shot. I know...geeky thing to argue. But it goes back to my earlier post.

For all I saw was a totally pointless story about four characters being murdered. That's it folks. Nothing else. No reading between the lines, no moment of revelation, no clever twists. Four characters get murdered by Five other characters. End. No suspense, just violence. If you consider violence entertainment, there are numerous websites that will allow you to watch sadistic acts of violence for real.

It's full of all the classic clichés and pays homage to a countless amount of films, particularly 1970's horrors. The loud, eccentric characters really make this film stand out and the vile Firefly family are portrayed perfectly. It also has a really good 70's soundtrack to it which gives it the sleazy, Southern American feel to it.Some of the film is quite graphic but there's certainly a lot worse out there. There's a mixture of implied and ""in your face"" violence throughout but the thing you will feel most for is the sheer helplessness of there situation.

472,carl_ian_andrews,Straight out of the Mind of a Zombie,10,17 June 2004,"<<<Spoilers Contained>>>This movie to me broke through what has been common place in movies of late cheese, and predictability. People can say whatever they want about the plot the acting, but really it is a breath of fresh air to find a movie that used intertextuality with blatant copy cat scenes yet managed to put a new spin on it. It seems to me a lot of the reviews of this film in the negative have completely missed the point of this film. The point is there is no point that is what makes it so disturbing. Rob Zombie creates an atmosphere that ever increases into mindlessness and utter ""What is actually going on here?"" The use of Alice in Wonderland, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and my personal favourite Betty Boop was great. Rob Zombie wanted to make a film that was like watching an utterly surreal music video; all his characters were very much like cartoon characters each having the very cliché personalities but mixed together made the film insane. The injection of the four overly curious young people was the only hint of reality in the film and their injection into a completely parallel reality of some kind of carnival fun house was a stunning idea. More depth of characters definitely would have made this film more accessible to the larger audience, and of course because of this film will never get the credibility it truly deserves. Cinematography of this film to me was fantastic, the fast paced editing and cut scenes were very entertaining and kept you in this obscure reality. But the clincher for me of this film was the ending, and last sane character alive escaping Dr. Satan's layer by crawling up through the ground was an obvious reference to the walking dead and she very much looked the part, yet after her tremendous attempt to escape this foreign reality she was dragged back into it and without doubt fell victim to Dr. Satan as her 1000 predecessors. Finally a modern HORROR movie where there isn't a sole survivor. I love unhappy endings.",House of 1000 Corpses
473,ethangrim,movie of 1000 disappointments,1,13 April 2003,"Rob Zombie has made one bad movie. It's exploitational without actually going far enough to sufficiently exploit any of it's many generic horror movie cliche's.There is nothing original about the plot (youngsters stranded while looking for adventure find more than they bargained for, or something). The story wanders from one shock attempt to another, yet never delivers. The scenes are seperated by garish 70's styled cutaways with mostly unrelated negative exposure images, which are highly annoying. The gore is incredibly tame. There is some nudity, but mostly brief, except for a few dead cheerleaders. Anyone who has seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, or any number of similar movies will have seen this all before and seen it done better. I can't even give it credit as an homage because there are just too many ideas ripped off from too many movies.The single plus which can be acknowledged is a few excellent set designs. Again, nothing terribly original, but there was enough attention to detail in that department that it deserves a mention.For a first film, it wasn't the worse. If it takes letting someone else write or direct next time, perhaps he should consider some outside help. He just does not have the talent to pull it off all by himself.

Sure it resembles, sometimes borrows, certain scenes from ""Chainsaw,"" but it is done in a Rob Zombiesque quality that gives it a total f*cked up distinction of its own. And plus, ""Chainsaw"" was a genuinely disturbing and considerably ground-breaking piece of cinema; ""House"" was not, but it is still harmless fun.  Oops, I compared.The plot: teens anger a psychotic clan of weirdos which leads to them being tortured and whatnot, this spanned over a 90-minute period of chaos.  That's about it.The movie does feature some fairly awesome and unique scenes.  For example the beginning credits and the underground lair towards the end.  But a particular scene, of which you have probably already heard about by now, deserves a merit of brilliance on Zombie's directorial part: the long pan-out death of the cop (you'll know when you see it).  Other than that this movie's just all around style-ladened and pleasure-filled with Halloween-inspired images and a great sense of humor.

As far as this movie goes, it is just plain bad. It tries to be scary, which at times it is almost funny. It tries to be art, but ends up becoming annoying and repetitive.***May Contain Spoilers*** Pros:*Good use of lighting and color. It really adds depth to the movie.
*A few interesting scenes; especially one that has the cop being shot in the head. It is nicely drawn out and adds quite a bit of anticipation to the film.
Cons:*Acting is OK. The acting is not stellar, nor is it the worst I have ever seen. There are a few characters that are just plain annoying and really take away from the movie.*Effects are poor to the point of just being down right stupid. Almost every prop used to depict some sort of `mutilation' is so blatantly made of rubber it makes it hard to really believe the scene.* An attempt to film random scenes in negative print tries to make sections of this film appear `artsy', but fails miserably. The scenes really add very little content to the move and are way over used to the point of sheer annoyance. After the first 20, you just want to cry.*It tries way, way too hard to be bizarre. Weird and strange movies are the best IMO, but this one just pushes the attempts to be strange to a new level.

She makes the most of her talents, embodying the slinky nut case that is baby firefly. lip syncing Betty boop, asking jerry who her favorite actor is (""if you get it right, you can go. If not, you're F#$%#@!""), buying liquor from goober, she just seems to be having a great time. Bill Mosley seems similarly liberated, pontificating on individuality and conformity whilst terrorizing a gaggle of cheerleaders , and proclaiming bill (I love that rain Wilson takes roles like this) an inspiration to his artists block. He brings intelligence and thoughtfulness to his riff-Raff-looking hillbilly. Sid haig is ever dependable, coarse, sarcastic, and bombastic. And let's not forget Karen black, who is clearly having a grand old time.I also really loved the scene when the firefly family ambushes the cops, doing so to the ironic strains of some oldies-sounding country tune while the young cop falls apart emotionally. I wouldn't bother surrendering to these folks, deputy.Zombie acquits himself beautifully in his directorial debut, and this movie just doesn't let up. We progress constantly and confidently, towards a wild ending in the catacombs of the firefly compound. Rob makes the most of these scenes, following our Alice-in-horrland protagonist as she navigates tunnels of skeletons and beautiful, cob-webby mine shafts. There is a great close-up shot of her, her eye moving to the right, as the terrifying, gas mask-wearing red skull looking guy is approaching. The set design is typical zombie, dense and interesting, and filled with drawing, paintings, and other props from rob's fevered mind. The presence of teevees everywhere showing classic universal films and the Munsters is a welcome sight to this horror homer.And special mention goes to Wayne toth, make-up supervisor, and, IMHO, master of body horror gore. I'm glad rob has hitched his wagon to this talented, under appreciated fx artist.House of a thousand corpses is a love letter to insanity, and I was happy to receive the mail.

Basically it is a remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and not a very good one at that. The movie is just a string of horror movie clichés, one right after another, with little or no concern given to the idea of actually having a plot that might connect them. It's not even very frightening. There are plenty of horror movies with thin plots that can be appreciated for providing genuine scares. I can't think of one frightening moment in this movie. I guess I was able to derive some enjoyment from the fact that the movie was so vapid, that I was laughing out loud during some scenes. And before anyone jumps to any conclusions, I don't think that horror movies begin and end with ""Scream"".

Its a meandering mess, desperate to disturb but with no real idea what its point, purpose or spirit is beyond homage. The characters are really annoying; Rob's wife and the guy who played Chop-Top in TCM 2!!?? Man, they should have died they were so relentlessly stupid and irritating but no, Zombie thinks we'll think that they're cool in some fashion and so they live. You don't care about any character in the whole movie, so you don't really give a damn about anything that happens. The film fails to mask the fact that all it really is an excuse for disturbing/ hip scenes/ gimicks/ images and nothing else with its ending: a series of weirder tricks and images from out of no where for no real point (was that Dr. Satan at the end, whatever, by then I didn't give a *beep* about anything in the film). I was annoyed then really bored. Ultimately, the film is very boring, pointless and stupid. Maybe Devil's Rejects will be an imporvement, I won't judge it until I see it, but if it's anything like 1000 Corpses then it will suck dick.Sick and disturbing? I'm a horror fan/ aficionado, have been since I was 5 years old. I've seen worse. I'm not saying any of this from a moral or religious point of view, the movie just blows (I was falling asleep watching Zombie's self righteousness). It was sadistic, especially that the film suggests that the bad guys are cool when they're annoying and sadistic and murder people and the whole time Zombie plays it with no self-reference. I think the film was mean -spirited, but more importantly, just bad. For those of you that really like it, hey, I'm not gonna say you're stupid or retarded or wrong. I'm just expressing myself because that;s all we can really do.

The mixture of sexual undertones (God I love Sherry Moon) and violence was just what the doctor ordered. A good deal of people hate this movie, and I can kind of see why, half way through the movie it feels like you start to watch a whole different movie. But that is the only faulty part of the movie that I can find. The reason Rob added the new ending was because the original seemed too anti climatic to him so he added the ending in, I personally think he should have taken more time to write a better ending, but either way the whole presentation of the movie is still great. I think the genre really needed this movie to come out, a mix of trash and heavy metal butt crack and blood, its whats been missing in all these teen slashers that have been coming out. Tongue in cheek and everywhere else is the name of the game and its just fun. Highly recommended.Plus the DVD is a great deal, filled with easter eggs that are funny as anything, and Rob Zombies commentary is a must for any fan, and even if your not a fan, the commentary should make the movie better for you. Rob is a funny guy it comes through in the movie and the commentary, many times I was in stitches because of his quick wit during the commentary. I give this movie a 10 out of 10, it doesn't quite deserve a 10 because of its flaws, however I believe that this movie was needed for the horror genre, and it embodies everything that I love about the genre, sex and death with a few scares thrown in for good measure.",House of 1000 Corpses

It was one of the 1st horror movies to ever scare me.The whole thing (until they are lowered in the coffins) is incredibly believable, especially since all of the tortures performed can actually happen. The acting of the Firefly family and Sid Haig as the wonderful Captain Spaulding was really well done. The two couples were annoying which is why their killings and tortures was so much fun to watch.I looked at other user comments on how it was too gory and too violent. Well what did you expect? Some psychological talking thriller? No. It's a gory movie with a sadistic family. Notice the word Sadistic. That doesn't mean oral communication and torture. It means physical. There was plenty of it to please the eye.I own the DVD and even if you don't like the movie, it's worth renting just for the DVD menus. The main menu has a huge rant by the one and only Spaulding. The scene selection has the creepy yet somehow attractive Otis. The special features has the lovable Baby Firefly. Last but not least, is settings where Otis, Baby, and Spaulding have a funny conversation. In Bonus Features, there is a feature called Tiny F*cked a Stump which is hilarious! -Spiolers- Probably the scene that scared me the most is when the girl Denise is underground in the tunnel once her bunny suit is ripped off. She then cries and looks around. Just that is so frightening to me.I love the part where Baby lip sinks Helen Kane's ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" and afterwords she says to May who was cruel and a b*tch ""I'll cut your f*cking tits off and shove them down your throat!!"" You also really get terrified when you see Mary tied up to a chair when Otis comes and gives a little rant. Then proceeds to show her her boyfriend who is now Fishboy!

At times, the dialogue is such that it is actually distracting in its lack of realism. For these and other reasons, this movie becomes campy and annoying at a rapid pace.

Unlike many horror movies, this one will actually mess with your head. I hear that many people on this site are complaining that there is no plot whatsoever, but that ain't true - it's just made deliberately hard to follow. The whole point of Rob Zombie was to make this movie a horrorfest - more like a horrible nightmare than a regular story. You know how does it feel when you wake up after a bad dream, struggling your mind to put all those terrible things you've dreamed in order, but you can't. The whole idea of this feature is to make you feel repulsed, disoriented, nauseated, confused. It's a heavy mix of all the things in horror films that Mr Zombie was fascinated by.

The actors were mostly cardboard aside from Capt Spaulding, his part should have been expanded and the rest of the family removed.All in all, I guess you have to really really like Rob Zombies films, this was a real let down and certainly soured my concept of his films as a whole, it was just trippy garbage with a horror theme.",House of 1000 Corpses
495,blood-guts-and-gore,An Instant Cult Classic,10,23 October 2005,"First time Director Rob Zombie combines movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Day of the Dead to create this horror masterpiece. This movie is originally horrifying and dark. It shows that if you love horror movies and watch them over and over, you can take some notes and come up with a great movie. If your tired of saying,""thats not scary, i could come up with something better than that!"" Then Rob Zombies House of 1000 Corpses will take the words write out of your mouth. This movie will quench your thirst for blood and gore. Rob Zombie doesn't hold back in this movie, with scare after scare. Great camera-work and writing makes this movie everything Tobe Hoppers 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' wanted to be and more. If your idea of a Horror Movie is I No What You Did last Summer or Scream then this movie isn't for you. If you stood up and clapped after Evil Dead and threw popcorn in the air at The Last House on the Left,then this movie is just what you've been waiting for. We haven't been gifted with movies like this in a long time. It is a jump-start for modern day cult Horror.",House of 1000 Corpses

The story is a garbled mess, if it exists at all, it's basically a succession of clichéd 'horror images' one after the other. This film is like a teenage boy has been given 6 million dollars & told to make a horror film, even down to the character names (DOCTOR Satan?! REALLY?!), but I should expect this from Rob Zombie. Everything I've ever seen of his is just terrible. Any fully grown man who refers to himself as 'Rob Zombie' surely cannot be taken seriously.This is the worst film I've ever seen in my life, & I've some some stinkers. As I've mentioned before on here, I can enjoy the occasional horror movie, or B-movie...but this takes the biscuit. If you do intend on watching this (why?!), then look out for this part; just after the police find some bodies (one of the worst scenes in this atrocity, it's just terrible) there is a point where the young cop is on his knees whilst the hick murderer has a gun to his head...& there is silence for about 30 seconds. For no reason whatsoever. It felt like it was about 5 minutes long. I thought my DVD player had broken, as if it was telling me to stop feeding such utter horse manure into it.Anyway, avoid this film at all costs. It is THAT bad.",House of 1000 Corpses
497,fieldaustinb,A sign of things to come,7,4 September 2018,"Rob Zombie's directorial debut is a retrospective treat 15 years after its release. Seeing how far the director has come and then revisiting this is a serious reward for anybody who has enjoyed watching his evolution.Known for his wild music career, this is the film that showed us all that he was more than capable and ready to take the world of horror by storm.House of 1000 Corpses, for those who don't know, follows two couples who wind up in the wrong home with the sadistic Firefly family after picking up a hitchhiker on the road. Their terror quickly escalates into torturous madness at the hands of a family that would give those from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre a run for their money.This is an absolutely hellish movie. It's sheer depravity and senselessness creeps slowly into the viewer and leaves behind a feeling of sheer disgust by the time the end credits roll. The introduction of now famous characters such as Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding is a chilling one and perhaps the uneasiest of their portrayals.This is not a perfect movie by any means. Zombie's desire to experiment is strong in this one and, while it is perfectly entertaining, it is easy for the viewer to see that he is still finding his footing and hasn't quite mastered himself just yet. Zombie's more visionary abilities would come out later in films such as The Devil's Rejects and the underrated Halloween remakes, but this is a perfectly acceptable debut, one that shows a spark of genius yet to unfold in its entirety.",House of 1000 Corpses

The imagery in this movie is phenomenal which is why this movie so much better then other films. Most scary movies rely on things jumping out of closets, blood squirting wounds, and eerie music but this movie is scary without any of those things. I don't particularly like to watch this movie all the time because it is creepy, but it's one of the best horror films I've seen. Rob Zombie did an excellent job with integrating comedy into this movie as well. This is not your average wimpy slasher film. There aren't a whole lot of truly creepy and yet very well done movies out there. You have to watch this at least once even you hate scary movies.",House of 1000 Corpses

500,zombie84,A revival of true horror,9,3 May 2003,"Its sad that a film as wonderfully made as this is so grossly misunderstood.
Let me say this right off that bat. If you're idea of a horror film is I know What You Did Last Summer and you consider Scream and The Exorcist to be the most shocking films ever made, this is not a film for you. If you havent seen I Spit on Your Grave, Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead or Last House on the Left, this is not a film for you. If you've never listened to ""Living Dead Girl"" or ""Superbeast"" this is not a film for you.Now having said that, this is a film for me. It is a film for true horror fans, the kind that stay up and watch Dawn of the Dead and The Beyond, who know who Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento and George Romero are. This is a film that was meant to be seen by people like this and will only be enjoyed by people like this. This is not exactly mainstream stuff here. Only a small percentage of people enjoy this stuff, and for those people, this film is a true rivival of classic exploitive horror.Rob Zombie has created a homage to 1970's exploitation/horror films, and he has been extremly successful in achieving that goal. The film borrows largely from Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left, with his own little bits of original demential thrown in and an assortment of other horror film references. The film tells the tale of four teenagers who are terrorized and tortured by a bizarre southern family living in a remote farmhouse in 1977. The film uses all sorts of camera tricks--negative colouring, split-screens and seemingly random inserts of grainy snuff-like footage of various S&M and gore images; the off-the-wall effect is similar to what Oliver Stone did in Natural Born Killers. The film is not about plot, or about characters. Its purpose is to shock and disturb, to serve no other function than to entertain through exploitation and disgusting and bizarre violence. Just as you think the limits of weirdness are approaching, Zombie takes the film a step farther, and before long you surrender yourself to the mercy of the film and just accept things for what they are. The film has the feeling of an out of control freight train being piloted by a madman and the climax of the film is truly bizarre. The reviewers who wrote the film off as overly-sadistic with little in the ways of character development, plot or suspence have come to see a different kind of film, perhaps more at home with titles like The Sixth Sense or Silence of the Lambs. The have no busineness debasing a great film like this.Rob Zombie has created a film that is both a homage and derivative at the same time; most things in the film have been done before, in one shape or another, and the level of gore is a fraction of what was intended, due to its shameful R-rating. To see the inevitable Unrated Directors Cut on video is going to be a true horror experience.But this film is something has hasnt been seen in decades and it has been made with the utmost care that only a true horror fan could provide. It is a film made by horror fans for horror fans, a true labor of love by Mr. Zombie, despite some flaws. If you arent sitting the theater going ""hey, theres Bill Mosely from TCM 2!"" or ""hey, that shot is a homage to the cover of Evil Dead!"" or ""hey, he wears peoples skin like Leatherface!"" then you probably arent meant to be seeing this film. But for those who are, the film is a true gem and a rarity; it is a kind of film that hasnt been seen on the screens in over twenty years and probably wont be for another twenty years. Get out there and enjoy this rare experience while you still can.An instant cult-hit.Grade: AFor true horror fans only. Everyone else just wont get it.",House of 1000 Corpses
501,Gutsngoregalore,Everything you want a Rob Zombie film to be,6,19 May 2019,"1000 corpses has blood, guts, gore and a clown slightly more sinister than Pennywise so everything Zombie stands for. The soundtrack enlightens the films gloomy overtone as well as the use of lighting and editing to really capture the madness that takes place throughout the narrative. I enjoyed the violence however it isn't actually as gory as other films around the early 2000s, it was watchable but it's not exactly for the weak hearted. Overall a 6/10, despite the acting not being the best, Zombie makes up for it with his kooky editing skills as well as the crazy story taking place. Worth the watch as is the films second instalment- Devils Rejects. Especially if you're a horror fanatic who enjoys the bloody mess that these films promise you.The ending of the film is also super messed up but then again I don't think anyone could get away from the fireflies and what they keep under their house.

The only time that I got scared was when otis shot the sherrif after 15 seconds of just sitting there becauee i wasn't expecting it. everything else was just silly. Often times I would find myself laughing at the distorted shots that were placed randomly in the movie for seemingly no reason. This movie also seemed to have no real origional ideas. It was like most ideas and shots were just taken from other movies. This is not a problem if it is done correctly but in this movie it just ruins it.

I hope he was happy with this movie as I love it and wish there were more directors with his taste. Quintin Tarantino can come close, and i love his movies, but Rob does something different. Even if you don't like it, i'd watch it to see how images and music can be used to manipulate how your mind sees things. The dark grunge music and the dirty and sick images getting flashed on the screen really give you a taste of how the characters think.

And I think this movie was really really good and a lot of people put it down but when you see the same people comment on other movies that other movies are great and so on those movies really suck. It wasn't scary for me I just love the way Rob Zombie filmed this it was like one of his videos he is creative and highly intelligent. All the characters are really great Bill Moseley was great as Otis you can tell he put his heart and soul in that role, Sid Haig was funny and yet crazy at the same time as Cap. Spaulding I wish he was in it more like he was in Devil's Rejects, Sheri Zombie kicked but as Baby she really brought that character to life, everybody else they just rocked. There is humor in it and at the same time it is sick. But I love it it is one of my favorites.

There are several scenes in this movie where I wanted to laugh. It sucked. Majorly.I do not suggest you go out and see it, but if you feel you need to, go to a cheap theater and see the cheap show of it. The movie is only worth a couple of dollars and that is just for renting the seat for the time it took to watch it. The only good part of the movie was the cereal box--if you go to see the movie, look at the cereal box. It's hilarious.
But I need to give Rob some credit, it was pretty freaky. Not in a scary sense but more in a weirdo sense. The characters were nuts and almost completely believable and the plot was okay.

The dialogue is rich, the acting is ok (Sid Haig as the great Capt. Spaulding is probably the best in the entire movie), the music is great and the screams and violence is pure delight.

I'm not sure what part actually caused me physical head painWhat is this movie?10% plot 90% visuals50% Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2- This movie seemed to be an homage to that movie- to the point they used Chop Top (Bill Moseley) to play that type of character. It also contains a Leather Face type character, a Grandpa type character, and a flesh wearing scene. It has that awkward humor of the ultimate dysfunctional family.15 % Natural Born Killers- this is because of the spliced in sequences that don't do anything for the plot as far as plot's go- but add a type of visual assault and mood to the film.10% The Evil Dead- what artsy horror film isn't influenced by that movie? The part that really made me think Evil Dead was the creepy laughing by the female villain, and basic plot of hunting young adults, and some of the make-up used.10% Rob Zombie videos- this is- well, a given. A bad ass bimbo in a cowboy hat, attackers wearing bear heads, Halloween type images. It's all there.5% Marilyn Manson videos- this is because of the beauty of decay and some of the more mechanical type costumes.5% The Cell- also due to decay plus scenes of a dreamlike underworld and doll-like women.5% Freaks- this small percent is added to pretty much cover the horror of the carnival.I credit this movie with the longest 15 seconds in a movie- ever. This approximate 15 slowww seconds goes beyond uncomfortable.Also, I credit this movie with a decent use of inappropriate music in disturbing scenes.. Especially using the song `Brick House' for the end credits.Biggest complaint: the ending where it says `the end' and then adds a question mark in a second later. This bit of cheese was not needed.
I love the videos it draws from and I own most of the movies it reminds me of. Would I pay money to own this movie? That is really tough. I will have to think about it. I'm just not sure it's one I could watch more then once every 3 years. I will let it fester.",House of 1000 Corpses

If you're into vintage horror and just love gore - this is a movie for you! The story is simple, classic and great, it's basically the usual - some kids on a road trip doing whatever, end up in hell. Although he added some genius twists here and there. The acting is great, but you have to understand the parts to notice that. Sheri Moon's part requires the kind of acting that either is awful or awesome - she really pulls it of! The rest of the acting is just brilliant.So watch this movie.

I wanted to be scared, and I wasn't. It wasn't an overthrow of gore for my likings, but it just wasn't scary. I thought the first 5-10 or so minutes in the movie were excellent, and it really got be motivated. It started with so much potential, so much so, that I was thinking it could possibly turn out to be one of my favorite horror movies. But it just got boring, and pathetic. After the first 40 minutes, I wish I had a remote control... it dragged. Though, I don't think the movie was too long, it was just too ... artsy, and that sucked the life out of the horror. Maybe if it wasn't edited so much, it could have brought life back into it. I don't know what else to say about it... I'm hoping for a sequel, actually. Maybe it will go straight to video with a NC-17 and then we can actually see Rob Zombie at his greatest.

The movie is an hommage to the old b terrific movies, as Texas Chainsaw. The picture looks old and dirty, and I couldn't even realise that the movie had been shot only two years ago. Not everyone's gonna like this movie, because a few scenes are disturbing, and it don't look like those 'beautiful' horror movies we can see every month in theaters. House Of 1.000 Corpse is definitely a Dark tribute to the Old horror movies with their heavy background that put a lot of pressure on the watcher.

Not particularly aware of what the film had to offer, I still enjoyed it a lot. But is there really more to it then I could've seen back then, or should it have stayed a heart warming memory? It was amazing to see Capt. Spaulding and to hear Moseley yell again. It also felt great to see and hear Sheri Moon Zombie giggle and dance again. I should name all the actors, though. All the way to the tiniest roles... they delivered what was necessary. I was surprised to see Rainn Wilson though, I'm a huge 'The Office' fan so it was fun to see him in such a traditional teenage victim part. Let's spill it out: HO1C is a truly horrific yet insanely funny flick, probably one of the best within the last 20 years. Yes, one of the best.There's a no-bullshit approach which still stands tall. It's a fast paced freak show with plenty of messed up stuff, reminding you of TCM more than once. A big inspiration, there's no doubt. It's a familiar story with likewise parts to be played, and the entire mood is almost as dirty as Hooper did back in the seventies. It has a similar way of keeping things tense, but there's still plenty of room for some typical Zombie-stuff.One of the coolest things I noticed this time around is how the stage-artist experience he had really shows on screen. The house is like a giant stage for all the crazy and fun stuff to come, it's like a horror performance. Zombie's music fits the picture perfectly, it's a huge addition on the already sublime vibe he created with the dark yet comedic setting. Full of memorable characters and quotes to die for.The standard teenagers on a road trip set up works perfectly. The introduction has been kept fairly short and thereby still works like a charm. It's extremely well written, making it a feast to sit through. Introducing new freaks and providing the laughter when they are needed. There's no doubt... Rob's timing is excellent. He definitely earned the respect of the true horror hound with this one.Many of these aspects were kept as he worked on the 'second' film ''Devil's Reject'', which is probably known as the better film. I'll disagree firmly. I love DR, don't get me wrong, but there's really nothing quite like HO1C even though it borrows a lot from other (mainly classic) films. It offers the ultimate experience, with Moseley playing his best role since TCMII and various monstrous appearances which blew my mind.

And it just seems that everytime they meet humans(not that they are one themselves, but who knows) it humors them and they laugh hysterically, sometimes in groups.Well, these four teenagers walk in and Captain Spaulding gives them a tour of the entire house. He tells them the story behind ""Dr. Satan."" It seemed liked that haunted house ride at magic kingdom. Doors opened and these robotic machines that are made to look human are minding their business. They are killing,suiciding and many other things. Spaulding opens one and he says ""Dr. Satan"" would kidnap these people and cut their hands off and would do basically anything that involved blood, obviously.As the first scene was completed, I knew what this movie was leading too, but I still had some hope for it. Maybe something up Zombies sleeve. Well that didn't happen. They jump back in their car, all ready and fixed up and they drive away, none scared by the way. Very rainy day it is and as they drive down, they see a young woman on the side of the road. The driver brakes and asks her where she lives and it happens that she lives 4 miles down and right by may I say this once again is, ""Dr. Satan's"" house. He buys it and he lets her in the car. They stop by her house and she invites them in.Laughing gas must have struck her because for every little thing, she laughs with a very high note and for a length of eighty-eight minutes. They walk in and a Rob Zombie clone is her father and her mother is around 65 years of age. They all sit down in couches and the mother walks in and seems to be attracted to one of them because she sits next to one of these kids and shows some skin(specifically her thighs and some cleavage). Still no plot has arrived in this movie, but plenty of bad acting and comedy has hit us.The next scene they sat around a table with candles and I guess wanted to make contact with the spirits. Some stupid guy with a mask walks in and sits down. They stare at him for 5 seconds. The mother of the blond chick comes in and tells him to leave the room. More comedy and still no true horror. Now, I knew that my 5 dollars and 25 cents were being wasted.Later on the kids enter a room where there is a woman singing(lip singing) which reminded me of the film ""Mulholland Dr"". Which is a masterpiece by David Lynch and should never be compared to pure poop as the ""House of 1000 Corpses."" Well the woman gets on top of one of the teen's boyfriend and she gets mad. She walks up to the girl and knocks her down. The lady singing takes out her knife and points it at the girl and they tell her to calm down and some other non sense.Well, the kids get back in their car and continue driving. They need to make up their mind in my opinion, either stay in a house or stay in the car. By now I would stay in the car and crash it, to end the misery this is putting me through. He hits the brake because something is on the road. He goes to take it away and two humans with costumes walk up to him and the comedy begins again. They walk up to him with a bat like theres no tomorrow. The girls scream and say ""Oh My God"" and they stay inside of course because they know he is not really getting hurt, its just part of the bad acting. After a few minutes the other guy gives it a try to rescue his friend and gets beat even worse. Once thats finished, the two costume guys break the windshield of the car and takes the girls. This then cuts to them tied up. How did they get back to an interior place. Did those guys drive, did they carry them all the way to the house. There's no plot remember, it just happens.I'm really p***ed off at this point, but I'm one that always sees an entire film, I dont walk out of a terrible movie. It's hilarious because my friend next to me kept talking under his breath how bad it is and that he can't take this anymore. Sometimes I wouldn't know if he is talking to me or himself, but I would continue to analyze the film. I had three other friends that came and I think one or two of them were actually enjoying this. Im not sure if it was sarcasm, but I hope it was.As they were kidnapped a few die and they made one of them look like a fish. It was ridiculous. During all this I forgot to mention all the laughing the evil girls bring to this tragedy. Thats all they did. So these people are enjoying torturing these teens and they try to make an escape several times. The evil guys take these kids to a semetary and put them in a coffin. They send them underground and there are zombies and a room full of corpses that they later on discover. The girl somehow gets back up to the ground and she hears voices. The blond girl jumps on her with a knife and stabs her. If I can recall it was about 6 to 8 times, it was an extremely bloody part.The great finale is not much and why would it be, if they messed everything up already. One girl survives and she jumps into a car with Captain Spaulding, the fat bald guy I talked about in the beginning of this review. Shes really beat up and exhausted so she lies back on the seat. In the backseat, the Rob Zombie clone is there and he stabs her. Fades to Black and the screen says the two words that I've been wanting to hear for a long period of time, ""The End.""Zombie expected blood and gore to provide horror to us, but it didnt and instead it was funny. Don't see this movie if your life depended on it. Oh yeah and I'll talk to Hollywood abut changing the genre from horror to comedy. This film was true torture, I wanted to smack the cast, I wanted to smack the crew, I wanted to smack Zombie.Rating: 0 out of 4",House of 1000 Corpses
525,jamesess,Watch it for what it is.,8,1 May 2003,"Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses is everything you wish those 70's horror flicks would have been.  It is a great tribute to horror movies of the 70's and at the same time it fixes a lot of the mistakes in those movies.If you find the hero in most horror movies boring in comparison to the killer then this is exactly the movie to see.  Rob Zombie has thrown out the traditional protagonist/antagonist relationship and made a movie that makes a little more sense.  That is. sense out of senselessness.This movie is a collection of scenes put together in such a way that it doesn't matter if the movie makes sense.  It seems like there is more gore than there really is (there is a lot though) because of the bad taste it leaves in your mouth and the feeling in the pit of your stomach.If you are a fan of the 1970's cheesy horror movie genre you should like this movie.  If you are not a fan of the genre then you won't get it. Rob Zombie fans won't necessarily enjoy this movie.  Horror film fans won't necessarily enjoy this movie.  People who do not enjoy horror will hate this movie.  Those who look for a movie at the video store that isn't mainstream, with a gory picture on the cover and Lance Henrickson's or Karen Black's name on the front will thank Rob Zombie for making this film.  Everyone else will probably be disgusted.As far as rating this movie; For B movie horror it is an 8 out of 10; for mainstream horror it is 6 out of 10; and for competing for the Oscar it may reach 1 out of 10.",House of 1000 Corpses

I loved the fact that if you know the movie clips then you definitely knew what was going to happen next and I thought that was great.  I think to many people took the film way to seriously and if you are looking for more gore then see the director's cut.  It is even better, but I loved the movie and Capt'n Spaulding was great.  I mean, what can but said of a man who will kick your ass while holding a chicken leg.

530,chris99stang,"I like Rob Zombie, but this is missionary sex",5,22 April 2003,"I like Rob Zombie.  I love horror movies.  One would expect a perfect marriage between the two, but this movie is nothing more than a cheap casual fling.  This is the missionary sex of horror movies folks.House pays more homage to the creature flicks of the past instead of trying to benefit or re-invent the genre.  Abundant amounts of old school horror stock footage are laced throughout the picture, as well as an obsession (which becomes an annoyance) of fading in and out of ""negative"" shots. Some might call it gutsy and artistic, I found myself wishing the cameraman shooting the scenes would have had mitts taped to his hands to make it harder to press the special effects buttons.  The only effect I can think of that's more annoying is the ""spinning globe screen transitions"" made so very popular from low budget DIY wedding videos.Want a plot summary?  Kids stop at a ""Chicken and Gasoline"" station on a remote American highway, wind up as guests at a house of murderous freaks. Get killed.  Roll end credits.Now I know that in most slasher flicks, plot and character development take a back seat to the mayhem, but there was hardly any memorable killings and almost zero compassion is felt for the victims.  A more clever movie would have added liberal doses of humour to provide a tongue in cheek campiness (such as in Peter Jackson's amazing Dead Alive). Sadly, the only character worth a laugh (and the price of admission) is the insane but loveable Captain Spaulding, and his performance in the opening scenes teases you into expecting more of that style.A warning about the violence.  If you have any sort of sympathy for violence against women, avoid this movie like the plague (or SARS).  There are some sadistic scenes of naked females being carved and humiliated, and in typical horror movie fashion, they are all severely helpless.  Expect some familiar gore from the other killings, but one thing that bothered me is why a gun of all things is used a few times near the end.  Running out of ideas on how to kill?And now on to the plot.  Without giving anything away, the plot simply falls apart in the end when we are introduced to Dr. Satan.  There is simply no reasoning or explanation for the events that take place from that moment on, but you sort of just blindly accept the non-logics of the movie up to this point and hope something cool happens.I will mention what I liked in this flick.  Rob Zombie does have a flair for some grotesque imagery, including oversized horrific masks.  One scene which was actually quite scary had some ""scarecrows"" on the side of the road come to life when the kids try to escape the house.  I loved the filter used to give that seventies vibe to the flick, and lots of the props had a very creepy, eerie feeling to them.  It's too bad that style can't save a terrible movie, it just makes it slightly more digestible.Reading through some other IMDB comments on this movie, there has been mention of people applauding and cheering right at the end credits.  I don't know what sort of parallel universe this could be, but I imagine it might have been fueled by some sort of illegal substances - the kind that can make a simple jar of peanut butter seem hysterical.",House of 1000 Corpses

Maybe you might like it if you are a ""true horror fan"" but I however didn't.

533,n33m,Eat your heart out Resident Evil Fans,10,19 April 2003,"Anyone who thought Resident Evil was hardcore needs to see this. Why? This film was actually EFFECTIVE.  I left the movie theater feeling dirty and psychologically molested, it was Great!  Some will whine about the use of digital effects, but I personally thought in this rare instance it worked. Many people will also whine that this is nothing more than a TCM ripoff, but those people obviously haven't figured out that there is no such thing as a new story, it is only the presentation of that story that is different. This is a no-holds barred attack on the psyche. The special effects are raw, gritty, and in some cases very simple. Yes the plot is weak but not necessarily predictable.  The visuals are disorienting and disturbing, and the audio adds to this immensely.  The most frequent complaint i have heard is that the ending stinks. I loved it.  I tend to think this movie will be looked upon as a cult classic sooner or later. To sum it up, if you're looking for an oscar winning plot or lots of sparkly computer effects, this isn't the movie for you.   If you want to be scared, grossed out, or prove to your best friend that ""Resident Evil"" was a lame excuse for a horror film, this IS the movie for you.  This is ""degenerate art"" at it's finest. I highly recommend it and hope to see more from Rob Zombie, the new B-movie king.",House of 1000 Corpses

No.  Was I terrified?  No.  Was I disgusted?  No.  There is no fiction that can elicit those responses from this reviewer.  That said, this movie is hysterical.  Capt. Spalding is one of my favorite screen characters ever, no fear, balls of steel bad ass clown.  It's a little light on blood and guts, but I'm confident this will be corrected in the DVD release.  It borrowed from the best of the best of great horror films and wove them together into an unforgettable tapestry of carnage.  There is no protagonist to root for in this film.  The cast of characters includes a slew of antagonists and some idiots offered up for the slaughter.  If you like to root for the bad guy and hope against hopes that no whiney retard survives and laugh along with the killer as he slashes away, then go see this film.  In fact, go see this film anyway.  Don't listen to me, don't listen to the nay sayers, don't listen to your friends, go decide for yourself.",House of 1000 Corpses

And then, when it finally DID come out, the only theater showing it was 40 miles away from me.  So, I went.  What I watched was the sorriest and most pathetic excuse for a film that I have ever seen!  It actually made Humanoids From the Deep (kudos to Doug McClure) look good!  Instead of the compelling horror and gore, the poor audience was subject to a 90-minute version of a Rob Zombie video...and a bad one at that!  Rob Zombie's video style is better suited to 3-minute projects, since that's about how long it takes you to grow tired of this film!  The scariest thing about House of 1000 Corpses is the fact that some studio executive actually decided to RELEASE it!!!  I know I may have expected a little much, but when the only sounds one hears from a Friday night audience of teenagers and young couples is guffaws and groans of ""What the hell is this???"", then you know you've got one bad film. Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses attempts to bring a new-generation Texas Chainsaw Massacre-type franchise to the 21st Century, but with poor acting, choppy editing, and interspersed black-and-white gratuitous nudity, it just doesn't work - unless it's a new Rob Zombire music video on MTV.

536,psychochick,One of the worst movies you could ever see,1,24 April 2003,"... and this is not in the good, B horror film fan sense. I am myself a very avid fan of B horror, so I am not saying that it was too gory or too sick. The bad acting, cheap use of camera special effects and highly exaggerated psychotic behavior is not what made this film bad. It was the fact that this film was even conceptualized and made into reality that dug its own grave.The film starts out classically enough. Four teens are driving along and run out of gas, so they stop at Captain Spaulding's. Here, they are told of a man named Dr. Satan, whose dead body is said to have disappeared the day after he was hanged. The teens decide, in the typical idiotic horror victim fashion we all know and love, that they will go solve the mystery. What happens after this takes up the next unbearable hour of blood, gore, and a cheap excuse to show young girls with words carved into their dead, naked bodies. As horror film fans, we like to either feel sorry for or enjoy laughing at the victims' stupidity, but this film keeps you praying that the last victim will please have the goodness to die so your own suffering will end. Peter Jackson's early film ""Bad Taste"" and even the cult classic ""Manos: the Hands of Fate"" had more plot line than this. It is no wonder that it took 3 years to find a production company naive enough to release this monstrosity. Life is too short, don't waste your precious time or money. My advice to you is STAY AWAY!!!! STAY FAR AWAY!!! Unless you, too, want to become a simple minded horror film victim.To sum up this film in 25 words or less: Rob Zombie is desperately auditioning to become the Anti-Christ, and Satan said ""Don't call us, we'll call you.""",House of 1000 Corpses

538,clough77,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre on acid.,7,15 May 2003,"It's a dark, stormy night.  Four young college students are on the road in search of adventure and good times.  Oh no, what just happened?  One of the car's tires suddenly exploded; how unfortunate.  What are our ill-fated protagonists to do?  They should head on down to the old scary house out in the middle of nowhere and see who's home.  I'm sure you can guess what happens next: The house ends up being inhabited by an eccentric/redneck/serial-killer family who start to torture and maim the poor kids one by one.  No, this grizzly scenario I just described is not The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but rather Rob Zombie's big bloody splash into the world of Hollywood, House of 1000 Corpses.  This flawed, but somewhat enjoyable horror thrill-ride is about twenty minutes too long and that's with a brisk running time of just eighty-eight minutes.Two bumbling wannabe writers, played by Rain Wilson and Chris Hardwick (who some of you might remember from MTV's dating show Singled Out), are dragging their girlfriends from one dirty roadside attraction to the next in order to find material for their book about all the `creepy' stuff you see when people drive cross-country.  They stop for gas and find out they have discovered one of the coolest spots yet:  Capt. Spalding's museum of creature oddities and serial killer fun-ride.  Did I mention they also serve fried chicken?  Of course the naive college students just love it and beg ye ol' Captain to take them for a ride.  All of this is a set up for an introduction to Dr. Satan who is the final killer in the fun-house and the driving plot point of the movie.  Along the way, various other serial-killers are showcased including Ed Gein, whose real life slaughtering and mutilations inspired Chainsaw Massacre.  Apparently Rob Zombie really wanted to pound the Chainsaw motif into the minds of the audience because there is a scene later on where someone walks into a room and instead of bones, like in Massacre, there are various objects hanging crazily from the ceiling by thin strings.Unfortunately the movie doesn't stay in the aforementioned gas station/fun-house but shifts to the Chainsaw Massacre-esce house and that's when the plot begins to go on autopilot.  Zombie also felt inclined to add a large dose of video-effects, or what is sometimes referred to as acid-vision, which is distractingly used throughout the entire film. It's as if he couldn't help but try and extend one his music-videos into a full length feature and the result is dizzying.  There are also snippets of classic horror images, used as filler between cuts or to emphasizes what one the characters is thinking or experiencing, that pulled me completely out of the film; one minute someone's getting cut to pieces and the next Grandpa Munster is in your face yammering on about some whimsical nonsense.The film does redeem itself a little in the third act when the story and the action on the screen become shockingly original, but in essence House of 1000 Corpses is just another Texas Chainsaw Massacre clone that should have been a spooky Halloween special produced by HBO.  Perhaps they'll be able to work out some of the flaws if there's sequel. A fun but somewhat disappointed 3 out 5 stars.",House of 1000 Corpses

But not since the first Hellraiser movie has a film brought gore, blood, sadistic torture, and pleasure to such a level intense ecstasy.I loved every minute of it and if its possible to wear out a DVD, then I will do it with this one. All the classic B movie elements are there, bad guys, stupid college students, and lots of corpses. But I only wish Zombie would have taken a few roles in it.  The dude is destined to be an icon of my generation.When Baby Firefly said, ""...ain't the only thing tasty in this house."" I fell in love. Sure, she is sadistic and likes to kill people, but hey, who doesn't have some quirks to their personality.But get this DVD, tell your friends, and maybe Rob will give us more.Btw, get the CD too.

It's the excellent camerawork of Rob Zombie that makes it scary as well as great. The way he uses inverted colors, splitscreen, and different-color filters adds a freaky, old-school touch to the movie. Acting is brilliant here, and the characters are down-right messed up. The plot isn't very fleshed-out, but that's ok. Most of the scariness comes from the deranged characters. Also, most of the movie has the same idea. The plot doesn't necessarily move forward, it just stays where it is, suspended in the 1 hr. 50 minute runtime while the movie itself continues. Like I said before, though, that's ok. Just watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.The DVD's pretty good, too, with menus hosted by characters. There are a good amount of special features, including cast interviews, director commentary, 2 trailers and a radio spot, a making-of featurette, and a joke reel featuring Captain Spaulding, Baby, and Otis telling the same knock-knock joke about Tiny over and over.

It is predictable, boring and lacks any kind of thought or innovation. Nothing we havent seen before, only much, much better. Sure, theres lots of blood and attempts to stun the audiance with gore, but hey, we have all seen this before, mostly done with greater skill and effect.

You know how you feel after a long day at work, and you get home and play your shoot-em-up video games? Are those to be taken seriously? No! This movie is meant to be a seriously deranged yet at the same time hilarious break from the daily grind.This is not your typical horror flick. Why? Because it is written and directed by non other than Rob Zombie. When you sit down and plop this into your DVD player or your VHS, you have signed a disclaimer.This movie will pick you up, throw you around, scalp you, wear your daddy's skin, and leave you begging for more.Our story takes place in ruraltown, USA. We begin by meeting Captain Spaulding, who writes a map for 4 college-age kids out in the middle of nowhere, and looking for offbeat roadside attractions. He is a crazy yet brilliant character, and from then on...the rest of the movie will take you where it will. It has its share of scares, yet at the same time, absolutely funny.Other people that will then pick up where Mr. Spaulding leaves for a bit include Mrs. Firefly, Baby, Tiny, Grampa, Rufus Jr, and of course the infamous Otis.Overall, this movie is well worth your time, several times.

547,darkblueturbo,Quite simply the best horror movie I've ever seen,10,30 December 2003,"It has everything. It starts in a cheesy 70's vein with bad (but good) jokes: you know the sort. It looks for all the world that this is how it will carry on... Although Otis and his family give you plenty of warning that this could turn nasty soon. And it does - as Bill gets out of the car and the hammer comes down all the light hearted stuff is gone forever and you're taken on a journey that gets darker and darker as the film moves on - even when you think it can't anymore - it does. I never found myself siding with the good guys or bad guys - just watching in horror as events unfolded. At last a horror movie that does it's job correctly.

The ""special effects"" as such were made more poorly than a high school short film, and to be honest.. .the movie was nothing short of just plain disturbing...

I absolutely love the character of Capt. Spaulding (Sid Haig who any Tarantino fan should know). I will grant you that this movie does kind of follow a typical theme in horror (don't tick off rednecks and for the Love of God don't pick up hitchhikers even overly beautiful ones...like that ever happens), but I would say it has some moments that are different. You have to remember that films need to cause some kind of reaction (good or bad) and this does that. You won't forget this film...ever. Some of the characters did stand out (Otis,Spaulding, Baby). The situation is a little campy but I would definitely recommend watching this film twice...first time you will either love or hate it but it can grow on you like some of the bad horror films of the 70's and 80's. Actually can't wait for the sequel..looking violent and artful. R.I.P. Dennis Fimple (Grampa Hugo).",House of 1000 Corpses

I'm so jaded when it comes to horror movies anymore that it's almost impossible to get me off, but I've seen this one 3 time, and twice it gave me nightmares (and that's saying SOMETHING - but then, you don't know me!)

551,raaguilar22,Worst movie ever made...period.,1,29 August 2004,"Need I say more, This movie sucks. Rob Zombie claims it is art, but it is not art. Art is expression, or representation through the implied or the intuitive thought. Apparently what Rob Zombie considers art- is pasting feces onto a film reel, releasing it, and calling it art. What is it expressing, what do we learn or get from it? Nothing but an empty feeling, that the world is going to crap.There was a comment stating that this movie was so scary that he cringed in his seat, and people had to walk out of the movie theatre. I have new for you my friend, this movie had no true elements of fear, just recycled carnage. And it did not borrow from other movies like Kill Bill, or Blade Runner- It stole entire plot lines, namely, ""The Texas Chainsaw massacre."" Also, I doubt the people were leaving due to fear, they were leaving because unlike you, they did not want to sit through garbage. It took me two sittings. I could not watch it through the whole time for genuine fear of losing brain cells. The second time through, I could have sworn that I no longer Knew how to spell the word SUCKS. I had to find a dictionary, but I forgot what books looked like!!! I am a movie goer, and a huge fan of the horror genre, as well as most others, and I have to say this, with true honesty, this is not only the worst horror movie ever made, It is more than likely the worst movie ever made....period.",House of 1000 Corpses

554,areed777,The Zombie Strikes Again: Lyrical Dialogue,8,4 January 2005,"First I'd like to say, I loved this movie. The dialogue was f**king brilliant. Rob's genius set design, directing, and cinematography is not much surprise because of the meticulous work that he does with his music. Captain Spaulding was the most original, brilliant character that I have seen in awhile. Otis' sedition reminded me of myself, in a much more psychotic state of course. The Fireflies, similar to the Sawyer family from Texas Chain Saw Massacre were a hoot. As mentioned before my favourite aspect of this movie was the dialogue. Captain Spaulding cracks me up every time I see him on screen. Otis' slightly diluted redneck, Dr. Leary esquire speeches, were actually somewhat enlightening. The genius acting behind the horror great Karen Black was down right freaky. Even Rob's wife Sheri gave a wonderful acting job as the cute/crazy baby. I enjoyed this movie very much. I highly recommend it to all you freaks and fiends out there.",House of 1000 Corpses
555,lagwagon312,"A Fun Movie, But That's About It.",6,26 December 2005,"Firstly, before I start to review this movie, I'd like to point out that it doesn't really matter whether or not you are a ""true"" horror fan to enjoy this film. A lot of horror fans I know loved this movie, and claim that you wouldn't appreciate it unless you are dedicated to the genre. And yet other horror fans I know hate this movie, saying that it was a total rip-off of earlier classics, yet without real, frightening terror. I, however am not a ""true"" horror fan, yet I enjoy the genre anyway (as well as most genres) as long as the movie keeps me entertained.Okay.. now on to the review. This was Rob Zombie's first attempt at making a movie.. and you can really tell. I had a strong feeling that he had all these twisted ideas and concepts built up in his head for years, and when he got the chance to write and direct his own feature, he shoved them all in there at once. This is what kept me on edge throughout the whole thing. It wasn't at all slow paced. It was just sick and sadistic horror all the way through. And although this may be entertaining at times, the movie lacked substance. Now let me compare this to a soft-core porno that you catch late at night on Cinemax. Before you reach the steamy 7 minutes of a 35 year old woman with short blonde hair getting rammed by the pool man with a pony tail, you have to sit through 15 or so minutes of a painful plot that gives the woman a motive to cheat on her husband. Now, if there was a demographic of snuff-addicted men out there who get off on watching grueling murders and satanic rituals, this is what they would show on late night TV. A 90 minute special that is packed full of shocking horror, and nothing else but a cheesy plot. I guess what I am saying is that I wasn't into the film as much as I wanted to be. It failed to suck me in. I did not care about anyone in this movie, because Zombie didn't give me a chance. But this doesn't mean I wasn't entertained. Although I left the film feeling nothing, during the film I experienced a sick sense of fun. Some of the lines were funny, as well as the performances. I liked the effects and the gore, and I will admit I was frightened at least two times throughout the whole thing. Now this may very well have been Rob Zombie's intention, and if that was the case, then he succeeded. It was also his first attempt, so I will cut him some slack. After all, the sequel is a lot better. It has the sick and sadistic horror that House had, and then some. That is when I finally felt for the characters.",House of 1000 Corpses
556,mniebergall,Please Don't See this movie,1,1 November 2006,"OK, Rob Zombie is obviously a big fan of horror movies..........He has been all over these ""Best Horror Movie Moment"" countdowns lately and lets not forget, Jaws really scared him when he was a kid....This movie starts out pretty good, but by the time the first twenty minutes go by, you really wish that you were one of the victims of his movies, being killed because you wasted your money renting this garbage. It's really sad to see him try to re-create elements from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre: for example, the crazy family who loves killing people, and even the shoes hanging from a tree,(In Chainsaw it was kitchen utensils that hung from a tree). I don't even know where to begin, This movie was as bad as Toxic Avenger and Trolls put together. The last review for this movie gave House of 1000 Corpses a great review...Yeah, I bet it was Rob himself saying that its great. this movie had good elements but it went all over the place and make no sense to anyone with a functioning Brain. If you want to be scared watch THe Excosist, The original Chainsaw Massacre, Wolf Creek, Hellraiser 1&2 , hell watch anything, its better than this crime. House of 1000 Corpses is a crime and so is the sequel, The Devils Rejects. With the annoying Sherri Moon Person and the plot that goes all over the place, watch Charlie Browns, The Great Pumpkin Halloween Special, and its more interesting....What is really scary about House of 1000 Corpses, is that some one financially backed this crime. This movie makes Pumpkin Head and Leprechaun look Oscar worthy................",House of 1000 Corpses
557,pritti_hippie,The most amazing 70's style cult horror film ever.,10,31 March 2005,Who can resist watching this film over and over again. Everyone knows what happens when a group of teenagers go off road when alone at night and this film is exactly that. Sid Haig provides the most amazing personality to Captain Spaulding as the owner of a museum of monsters and madmen and Bill Moseley is just fantastic as Otis. And who can forget Baby's haunting laugh. Rob Zombie's use of camera effects and filters give this film exactly what it needs and the odd mix of soundtracks couldn't be better. Intended to include cliché's of other horrors and giving details of real-life killers I couldn't recommend this film enough. If you liked Texas chainsaw massacre and silence of the lambs then this film is gonna knock you off your feet. Now I just can't wait for the release of the sequel.,House of 1000 Corpses
558,clumsy85,Worse than Zombie's 'Halloween',1,3 December 2008,"Now, whilst I never expected Rob Zombie to be anything more than a glorified music video director (and a poor one at that), 'House of 1000 Corpses' is possibly the poorest example of a 'horror' film I have ever had the misfortune to lay eyes upon. Although fanboys/girls can claim that Zombie's film is a 'tribute' to other such luminaries as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and hearkens back to the very origins of horror, it views more as a poorly executed, shot, edited and acted horror/music video. The quick cuts to black and white shots, interspersed with older footage soon antagonises, but it is the relentless soundtrack that ultimately kills the film faster than Zombie's Michael Myers killed the 'Halloween' franchise. This should by rights be an MTV Halloween special for Cannbibal Corpse fanatics, yet somewhere, somehow, studio execs green-lighted it for a wider audience. Please, please, please avoid like the plague. I couldn't bring myself to watch the end (and I finished 'Friday the Thirteenth: Jason Takes Manhattan).",House of 1000 Corpses

560,Isolated_Bastard,I feel sick...,4,26 July 2007,"...And it's not because of the B-grade gore!First of all I need to address the fact that a lot of people are comparing this movie to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, saying that it's essentially a remake.I just watched it and it probably feels that way because the entire movie is just a pastiche of cult horror... All I can say is that I REALLY HOPE that The Devil's Rejects is better than this, because this movie probably ranks amongst the 10 worst movies I have ever seen (and don't worry, it isn't worse than The Abyss). Reading a review of the movie here claiming that anyone who doesn't like this movie ""just doesn't get it"" and was probably looking for more artsy-fartsy films and [ insert pretentious/derogatory comment here ] really made me feel ill; people are ACTUALLY comparing this movie with greats such as Suspiria and The Dead series?! If you rank this movie with those movies there's nothing wrong with the guy questioning the legitimacy of your rankings... but there's definitely something wrong with YOU!The movie doesn't start out all that bad and has a kind of wacky, goofball-horror that sort of works. Anyone who doesn't either laugh or groan at the moniker of DR. Satan (muahahahahahahahaha *lightningbolts*) has probably never watched B-grade horror or can't appreciate unintentional comedy (and this movie is hopefully not both). When the hook of the movie starts the whole movie begins to plummet into a sea of bad ideas and impulsive directing. The only thing I really like about the movie is the stylized americana feel... it's kind of cozy in a way.All in all this movie is yet another movie of the times, yet don't dismiss it because of the violence; dismiss it because it just isn't that good! Unlike the Saw movies that are ridiculous beyond belief with bad scripts, goofy traps and twists made to make you feel intellectually inferior to the writers this movie is actually all about shock and gore and good ol' fashioned fun at which... it fails. Regardless of how you rationalize it no amount of gore, camp or references to your old faves in the horror genre can save a movie with over-the-top acting, a weak script and uninspired directing. I hold no prejudice towards anyone who likes this movie. By all means, revel in the gore if you so wish! Because when the day is done that is why you watch this movie. Some might call it a study in misanthropy... I just call it an 89 minute waste of life.",House of 1000 Corpses

I was surprised to find that he didn't.Instead the stupid teens pick up a hitch-hiker (ring any bells???) and she leads them to her demented family (ring any more bells???).As i said its not original but its enjoyable and a mindless gore explosion of fun.The plot isn't the strong point but i think the way its filmed and edited is.It uses strange visual styles to compensate.It is not scary (i find no films SCARY but only freaky) but is still an enjoyable film.It combines elements of horror and comedy which makes it only weirder.

I remember it was Halloween in 2004 I was going through a phase of watching really BAD horror movies like ""Killer Clowns From Outer Space"" and enjoying them for how amateur they were.So I was at Blockbusters with some mates and I saw the DVD cover for this. Directed by Rob Zombie a rock musician!!! and Its called House of a 1000 Corpses. Its going to be so bad it will make a brilliant Halloween party right???!! By the end of the movie, all our reactions were the same ""Is it me, or was that actually a good film??"".It was. The best way to describe the film is if Quentin Tarantino did a horror film. The way the characters talk, the intertextual references, ""cool"" music, gore, and some moments of humour and towards the end absolute terror.For those who saw the far superior ""Devil's Rejects"" but haven't seen this film should give it a go.For those who love horror movies but want something DIFFERENT then definitely give Rob Zombie a try. Cos the thing is I find his films have a twist on the genre (for example, Devil's Rejects isn't actually a horror movie, its more of a road movie) and its possible he could be the next auteur of horror films (guys, give up on Hideo Nakata, he's no good anymore!!!) and Eli Roth and co are just dumb.Rob Zombie, whilst understandably selling out a bit for Halloween (which was average) in order to make a proper name for himself in Hollywood , I suspect his next film, Tyranosauras Rex will be his best yet.Shame on IMDb for giving this film such a low average rating.

572,thesearchforbigfoot,"Complete Crap, from the Imagination of Rob Zombie",1,11 March 2006,"****possible spoilers****** The movie spends an absurd amount of time establishing a boring and pointless backstory about some Dr Satan nonsense. You'll probably be so bored after awhile you'll be begging for the psycho hick family to start the killing already.The gore is so over the top, it comes across as laughable. The four main characters, a couple of kids lost in the middle of nowhere, are irritating, have no depth whatsoever, and are just there to die. There's really no one to sympathize with or care about, at all. The situations aren't believable, and there's absolutely no suspension of disbelief. For example, you'd have to be retarded to think two cops and a bunch of kids would go missing, and thousands of state police officers and possibly even national guard wouldn't have descended on the place. It's all highly predictable. And the cinematography is lousy ADHD MTV drivel. Something like that fishboy scene might have been disturbing...if the characters were anything more than cardboard cutouts. The villains from the psycho family have such horrendously bad makeup and one liners that they come across as funny more than anything. Their motivations are never established. They pretty much are insane and kill for no reason. Again, more cardboard cutout characters. You'd have to be high on something to think this was a good movie. Rob Zombie wanted to make a tribute to slasher films of 70s, but he contributed nothing to the horror genre himself. I actually found it pretty boring overall. You should never be bored during a horror film.I borrowed this from a friend because I was curious.

Most classic cult movies have a select audience and a strong response after the first viewing.  Audience's either hate or love this film.  To the average eye, most viewers can't distinguish superior films from average films.  I enjoyed this film for its unique use of camera angles and effects, the editing, the coloring, remarkable sound effects and soundtrack, unbelievable costume and set design, and not to mention a great script that sticks to the basics of any great horror movie (pull your audience into an unreal world and make the unimaginable imaginable by trapping the audience into this world through the use of all of the attributes I mentioned above).In conclusion, I loved ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and I think it will become more popular over the years as more viewers see how this film is not like other big hollywood-blockbuster productions.  The way it was filmed was highly creative and original, which is hard to find in many of today's movies.

Alternating between genuinely funny and menacing, it's a pity he doesn't play a bigger part in the movie.The rest of the movie is a fairly entertaining mish-mash of ideas ripped from other movies. The gore is tame, and the scares are few,, but the profanity filled dialog between characters is pretty entertaining.Rob uses some flashy ""MTV style"" editing that for me never really works in horror movies,, although I did enjoy the quick cuts of half naked goth chicks writhing around :) .Unfortunately, it all falls apart in the incoherent last half hour or so. Imagine walking through a few unrelated attractions at universal studios Halloween horror nights,, and that pretty much sums up the final part of the film.Anyway, it's worth a look,, and I'm looking forward to checking out the sequel. score : 5/10",House of 1000 Corpses
579,reversecard,A film that's existence is cooler than the movie itself,5,2 December 2019,"House of 1000 corpses is a movie that is better to watch in parts on YouTube than as a whole. This is because it has some neat visuals, and some scenes ( in particular the ones with Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding) are pretty entertaining. However it just doesn't work all together. The first scene I ever saw that got me so interested was the one with Slim Whitman's ""I remember you"" playing over three cops untimely demises at the hands of Bill Mosley, one of the most badass cult actors there are. I wondered how it was used in the movie, but it turns out it was strangely thrown in and not even that climatic. The biggest problem is the transitions. They are so random and really distracting. Second is the editing. I know this was rob's first movie, but everything about the editing feels so much like a music video. Third is the story itself. It is heavily ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" inspired, which won't be so bad, but there are zombies and a bunch of other plot lines that start and just go nowhere. Lastly, the acting ( especially from Sheri Moon as baby) can be a little annoying and there are a few scenes that only feel like they are there to increase the runtime that could of been spent building tension, or explaining some plot holes. Despite all of this, I understand why people love it. It screams halloween, the colors, the campy tone, all of this makes it feel very... cool. But to me, that's all it is, cool. Often entertaining? Yes. A great horror film? Me personally, I don't think so. If you just want to have a good time that probably won't scare you, then you could probably get some laughs and some decent kills. But if you are looking for some substance with the style, then this is one hitchhiker best not picked up.",House of 1000 Corpses

I've read all the reviews on here and people talk about how it's not that gory or scary or whatever. Wake up and realize that this isn't how Rob intended the final product to be. It was supposed to be NC-17, which was one of the major delays in getting it out to theaters. For now, we're seeing a cleaned up version (and I can't even imagine what the director's cut will look like) of what he intended the movie to be. Watch it when it comes out on DVD and I bet it'll be more to your liking:) Don't complain about the acting either. He got B quality actors on purpose and for the most part they did well. Why would anyone want Jennifer Love Hewett or some other star in this movie? I think people need to understand the purpose of the film before they start moaning and complaining. When you understand all that, you'll see it's a great movie. It everything a true horror fan would like. Plenty of blood, guts, gore, and T&A. It even had a plot which is rare these days.

I think the last Hellraiser movie had more plot than this; the plot was simply pieced together from Texas Chainsaw, The Funhouse, and even Hellraiser II. ""Ooh, these people are really sick!  Look what they did!""  That's almost every scene.  The problem is that all three of those movies are so much more entertaining to watch and make at least a little bit of sense.  The gore, although I understand it was cut, was never very satisfying.  If the gore was actually intense in this movie, I probably would have liked it a lot, because I just love that stuff, and I think the intense gore would have queued people into watching it as a darkly comedic horror film rather than a boring, predictable film.  Frankly, I expected some originality mixed in with all the homages.  None.  Maybe I will like the director's cut more, but I'm sure the memory of this viewing will keep me away from it for awhile.

A lot of people compare this movie to Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and well, it is quite similar what with the deranged redneck family, the house decorated with body parts etc. however for a film which is basically trying to be its decade's TCM there was a definite lack of meathookings. Ever since i fist saw TCM i've always said that every film should have at least one meathooking in it, even Disney movies (bambi's mother getting meathooked instead of shot with a rifle would have been at least 38 times as cool), but if any movie ever needed a meathooking it is this one. either one of those squealing girls dangling from a big ol' meat hook could have saved this movie, but instead rob zombie decided to take the soft-porn approach to gore. shame on you, rob. on the other hand, this would be a good movie to get if you want to make your girl cuddle up close - just don't laugh during the torture bits and it should be pretty easy to get some... now i have to go watch cannibal holocaust again to get the nasty taste out of my mouth....",House of 1000 Corpses

595,superklown,My #1 horror film,10,8 March 2008,"As a young member of ""generation x"" or whatever you wanna call the millennium nation...This is hands down my favorite horror film.The only movie that's come close to this is Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1 and 2. Devil's Rejects is an amazing sequel because it concludes the story, but it is such a drastic, different, satisfying counter-perspective. In House 1K Rob Zombie glorifies the killers. In Devil's Rejects, as the title implies, he punishes them, and presents them as sinful martyrs... the two films balance each other so perfectly. But since Devil's Rejects isn't really horror, House 1K is one of my top 3 movies along with Clockwork Orange and Apocalypse now. Yeah, I'll rank it that high.I saw it in a fancy theater when I was 16 after hotboxing a car with California's finest green chronic, and it was an awesome experience. I was spooked. The characters are brilliant.... Captain Spaulding, Otis, Mother Firefly, Baby, they all just ooze personality. The victims are also brilliantly realized, they are shown to have such shallow personas and exaggerrated in their manufactured, ""mickey mouse donald duck socks"", empty identities which is such an important, striking commentary on todays college youth. They look like people who deserve to be killed, we don't develop any compassion for them and they are perfect lambs for the slaughter. This movie has a message, but it doesn't get pretentious or overwrought about it. It's more focused on having some pure unadulterated fun, and through the awesome visceral punch of its audiovisual assault -- awesome music to go along with vibrant images that grab you by the throat -- it succeeds brilliantly.I will always love this movie and place it on the pedestal of my favorite horror films... while it is derivative (as every great work of art is) it pushes the envelope and I don't know if I'll ever see another modern horror movie that could outshine this one.",House of 1000 Corpses

While I was never a fan of director Rob Zombie's brand of music, I did hold out hopes that his penchant for the depraved would translate into at least a B grade horror flick. I was wrong. What ensued was something that was perhaps as tasteful and visually presentable as a Rainn Wilson-fish. Now, in defense of the film, it set out its goal of being deliciously trashy (at least I hope that was the goal), but I found that after about 20 minutes, the poor acting stopped being funny, the porno-grade directing was beyond laughable, and the movie was not in the slightest bit interesting. I'm no movie snob, but this movie was much worse than my already low expectations. I was expecting a movie with no substance, lots of gore, poor acting, highly suspect character choices (you're driving away from a house full of crazy people! Why the hell would you get out of the car?!), and most importantly, plenty of startling moments that would make me jump out of my seat.

This film was very unoriginal, I was hoping for some originality.  Everything was so expected due to the ripping off of other films.  Another thing is that the little interview-type deals with the killers and other little clips were so out of place.  They just jumped to them in the middle of scenes for no apparent reason then jumped back to the scene.  I wish i had waited for this movie to come out to dollar theatres or just downloaded it off the internet because i don't feel it was worth the eight dollars that it cost.

It was a good story, I thought the basic plot they came up with was pretty good. And Chris Hardwick, pretty good performance. There. Done with the good.The bad.While the story was good, the screenplay itself, was horrendous. Rob Zombie should have someone do a re-write on this thing. 50% of the diaoulge was good. The other 50% was crap. And when you make a movie, it helps to develop your characters a little bit, or maybe, at all. If you're going to put a character in danger we have to care one way or the other about them. We have to either want to see them make it, or want to see them killed. I didn't give a damn about any of the main characters. So I was bored during every scene they were in peril. I didn't care what happened to them, because they were all simply there to be killed. They never told us anything about them, they never tried to make them anything, I don't even remember their names. How am I supposed to be engaged in the movie if I don't care what happens to the people in it? The family would have been better in small doses. But they spent way too much time with them. They were creepy at first, but then they started old, then they got annoying.Also, Rob Zombie sucks as a director. If had to see one more transisition shot where the focus is off, and the colors are funky, I was going to scream. He didn't do anything with the direction of the movie that hadn't been done before. That's something that I was at least expecting. That he would bring something interesting to the table as a director, but there was nothing.Someone up there said the people in their theater clapped at the end? The theater I was in laughed at the movie. Not during it, where you're supposed to, but after it, while the credits ran. They weren't laughing with it, they were laughing at it.To sum up, good story, but Rob Zombie should have written the story and then gotten someone who knows what they're doing to give it a re-write and direct it. Being gory only takes you so far, sooner or later, there has to be something more to it. If this was how good horror was in the 70s, then I would have hated horror in the 70s.",House of 1000 Corpses
614,saabturbografx,I didn't like this movie,1,2 November 2005,"I thought I'd like this movie. But I didn't, it was all over the place, you could tell it was directed by someone who had no business directing. The only reason people even like this movie is that it is ""a classic horror movie."" And there's plenty of gore. Things in this movie just didn't add up. What's the significance of the fried chicken? What was the point of having the first scene when spaulding murders those thief's? We never know where the four kids are going or coming from. Why did that tall dude with the mask let that girl go? When one of the girls gets thrown into a cage, who are those other girls that attack her? Is Otis Dr. Satan? Did Dr. Satan create all those Zombies? Because why would there be zombies all of a sudden? Who was that old man that took the girls clothes? Why was she even dressed up in a doll costume? What's the deal with the whole fire ceremony after they attempt to bury that guy and girl? But most of all, how the hell could they have murdered thousands and thousands of people? The whole underground cavern was adorned with skulls and bones of too many people. They lived in the middle of Texas or something, there wouldn't even be that many people around. And what's the deal with all those zombies just hanging out underground like that? There was one who seemed to just wait by the door to open it for people. I know that horror movie aren't supposed to make sense, but this one thought it was so cool, so retro, that it didn't really care about all the loose ends.",House of 1000 Corpses

616,azulkitty,"I wanted more gore, but it was fun",10,13 April 2003,"First off, let me say that like a lot of the people that were there on opening night, I had been waiting a lonnng time to see this movie; I think it was worth it. Sure, I would have loved to have seen more gore, but I guess that's what DVD's are for. This movie was fun; there were great shots and awsome music. Sure, I wasn't that original - but anyone that had read anything about it already knew that. Besides, it's not like it was a carbon copy of TCM... it was more like TCM meets a lot of other horror flicks from other decades thrown into a Rob Zombie music video...

617,LexiconDevil,House of 1000 Movies,1,2 July 2007,"If you have not seen a vast majority of horror movies then this movie will probably seem exciting and new. It is most assuredly not. Neither is it scary, creepy, or really entertaining.With a plot pulled from Texas Chainsaw Massacre re-visioned so that it can star Rob Zombie's wife, this film was a disappointment at first and then became comically bad as it progressed. So bad that it is now used as a drinking game for several friends and I as to who can guess which scene in this movie is a direct replica of another movie.Really it all boils down to there is nothing original or even an attempt at original in this film. Instead every camera angle recalls another movie from Evil Dead II to Se7en. This movie seems to be a pandering attempt at teenagers who simply desire some sort of shock and gore with an almost elitist feeling of trying to seem as a homage but just comes off as a cheap bootleg version. I fear for Halloween as from various sources I have read it seems it is heading to the same fate as being a knock-off of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.Of course this is all my opinion. If you have not seen this movie, go ahead and watch it. It is only your time you will be losing and although I dislike it your opinion may be different.",House of 1000 Corpses
618,fetMRish,Muddled Disappointment..,4,9 April 2003,"I'd been waiting for this movie for what seemed like years. It being dropped from one production company to the next. Finally though, someone picked up the ball and we get to see what Rob Zombie visions as a perfect horror movie. We obviously don't see eye to eye.I found the use of lighting distracting with flashbacks and random scenes adding to the muddled confusing mess. Was there even a real plot here? A couple nice visuals, but nothing you haven't seen before. I appreciate Zombie's effort and his work is definitely not the worst I've seen, but it did not live up to my expectations. Perhaps the pedestal I placed it on was too high. A decent horror movie, perhaps Zombie can pick up the slack on a sequel. And maybe hire some better actors.",House of 1000 Corpses

620,KRAKKNAR,Origins of Original,10,1 June 2003,"Is this movie original?  No, not really.  Is it a rip off?  No not really. So what is it then?  Im not sure, but i do know it is GOOD! Similarities can be drawn from the TCM movie, but it is not a Plagiarized copy.  If similar ideas constitute rip offs, then our shelves at the video store would be filled with rip offs.  If you want totall originality in horror film you need to travel back in time to the 70's and early 80's. The films of this era are the cornerstone on which the horror movie genre stands.  Could you imagine if you could only produce a movie that has 100 percent original content?  I think our video stores would be devoid of film. What Mr. Zombie did was take a familiar theme... dumb bored teenagers who happen to get themselves in a bad situation.. also throw in some monkey curiosity, that the murder ride planted in their young minds.. and then there we have it... we get to watch a family of real monsters... people that have no morals, no concept of right and wrong... who kill people for pure pleasure and to revel in their despair.  It is disturbing isnt it?

There might be certain goofs that I would have readily ignored if I hadn't looked at this sight after my first 10 or so viewings of this nearly perfectly gory horror. The characters are built up nicely so that you are drawn into the story more and I can't see many flaws in the film in it's entirety! Rob Zombie is a perfect Director when it comes to horror and at least a lot more happens in this film than big (over-rated) titles such as ""The Exorcist"" or even ""The Omen."" I would put this film in my Top 20 films where I would put ""An American Werewolf In London"" at No.1 and at No.2 I hear you ask? - ""Aliens."" With my films I have always been brought up to value suspense leading to a killing and not just have the killing happen in the blink of an eye but when the killing does eventually come then it does need to be very brutal and as painful (torturous) as possible!",House of 1000 Corpses

Rob Zombie is a brilliant horror writer, so if you are squeamish, please stay away! As far as horror movies go, this is among the best ever made. I compare almost all new horror movies to this one, and few come close to the extremity and violence of this film. People who give this movie a low rating do not appreciate true horror, and therefore should not be taken into consideration when evaluating whether or not to watch this movie. It goes from general nervous horror (like what are those crazy kids doing in that ""creepy country town"") to full out mutilating horror where people are getting scalped and slowly tortured. It leaves out nothing when it comes to messed up killings, Rob Zombie somehow thinks of it all. You don't have to be a Rob Zombie fan to like this movie, anyone I have ever watched this with has been horrified (to say the least) and that is what most people are looking for when turning to a truly scary movie for entertainment. I can't give 'House of 1,000 Corpses' enough praises for stepping outside the box of the general horror movie equation, adding both an intense plot and gruesome (not cheesy) effects. It is a movie that will stay with you, and will stand out in your mind when comparing it to the rest of the new millennium horror films. I absolutely love it!!!",House of 1000 Corpses

625,nowski,sorry I just didn't get it :(,1,16 March 2010,"Terrible acting, thin plot and horrible cinematography. I literally made a IMDb account just to tell people what a piece of trash this movie is. Yes i have seen ""the devils rejects"", ALSO TRASH. These movies have no redeeming qualities. I guess rob zombie got the desired effect, he made my skin crawl. But that was with his wife's acting (and practically everyone else's acting in the ""movie""), and the plot (or lack there of). Right at the beginning i realized it had the same feel as the devils rejects and put two and two together and figured this was the prequel to that piece of crap i had seen a month ago. If you want Gore watch ""seven"" or something, demand your slasher films to have more plot, better acting and a director that doesn't moonlight as a crappy ""musician"" (sorry people thats an assumption I've never heard his music but i bet its crap too). By the way Because of the devils rejects i no longer enjoy the song free bird.

626,aaron-rourke,House of 1000 Other Movies,5,3 April 2003,"Rob Zombie's directorial debut finally makes it to the big screen. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the 3 year wait.What was touted for so long as a return to the disturbing, intense horror of yester-year, becomes just another over-the-top laugh-fest, full of cartoon villains spouting numerous one-liners, and heroes that are dumber than the most avid Adam Sandler fan.Mr Zombie borrows so heavily from the classic ""TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"", that Tobe Hooper must have been very close to calling his lawyer.Throw in Hooper's ""FUNHOUSE"", as well as ""MOTEL HELL"", and you will have a very good idea what to expect from this film.Never once does ""HOUSE..."" gain its own identity. You are forever being reminded of other movies, so the film never leaves a satisfactory impression.Sets remind you of ""TEXAS CHAINSAW 2"", moments remind you of ""PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS"", hell, you even have one of the actors from ""TCM2"". Suits and references from ""PERFORMANCE"", ""SEVEN""-style opening credits, the list goes on and on.All this is directed in a style very reminiscent of Oliver Stone's ""NATURAL BORN KILLERS"", making for a film that just cannot find a voice of its own.Beginning the story in a low-key manner would have also helped, as the over-the-top approach from the opening sequence kills any chance of the film being intense and horrific later on. A sense of dread and menace isn't created in these early sequences, so when the horror does start, you are already numbed, as there is no difference in tone from these scenes from the establishing scenes at the start of the film.Admittedly, ""HOUSE..."" is technically well made, with flashy cinematography and editing, the production design is impressive, and it's great to see veteran actors such as Sid Haig, Karen Black, and Michael J Pollard back on the big screen.Even though you could say it is better than the junk coming out today that pretends to be a horror film, ""HOUSE..."" still makes the same mistake of having too many one-liners and an overly-familiar tone, and has to be classed as a missed opportunity.It will, however, be interesting to see what Mr Zombie does next. Hopefully it will be something he can truly call his own.",House of 1000 Corpses

632,rasmin7,"Well worth the wait, but the DVD will be better",10,12 April 2003,"Wow.  This movie had me hooked from the opening scene.  Captain Spaulding had a freshness about him that was unique to almost any character I've ever seen in a movie.  And his opening dialogue had everyone in the theater laughing.  First off let me explain how difficult it was to see this movie. Where I live there were only 2 theaters showing the movie in a 50 mile radius.  And needless to say it sold out.  I think that the fact that it did sell out helped with the response it got in the theater.  I refuse to give away any spoilers online because the movie just needs to be seen to be appreciated.   But I'd love to talk to anyone about how amazing this movie really was if anyone is interested.  My AIM screename is Rasmin7.  But to finish the story about the movie and my general thoughts on it.  Right before the opening credits I thought the best dialogue of the movie was spoken all by Captain Spaulding who at best could be described as a guy who takes his job very seriously.  It got the audience right into the movie. It was almost Rocky Horror in nature in the way the audience got into the movie.  The scene with the cop and Otis had everyone in the theater at the edge of their seats actually cheering Otis on, it was mad crazy(and actually somewhat scary when you think about it).  The movie earned a standing ovation from the audience and I'm not kidding at all.  I went to the Easton Regal Cinema at the 7:10 show on opening night and if anyone else attended that reads this they could attest to everything I am saying.  Do I think this movie is for everyone....NO.  An elderly lady and like her grandson left right after the opening credits and why they were there to begin with I have no idea.  Another family left with like about 20 minutes to go, which was weird.  I loved this movie, but its not without its faults.  I've read many reviews of this movie and anyone that says its a bad horror movie is either not a true fan of horror or forgot what good horror movies are all about.  First off the target audience was not in attendance at the theater for the most part.  Instead there were about 200 teenagers most of which were too young to be there in the first place, but hey I remember sneaking into theaters when I was younger as well, so I guess the same holds true today.  My biggest complaint about the movie was the total inability to feel sorry for just about any of the protagonists.  There just wasn't enough known about them to really care about them.  I'm hoping that this is fixed when the real version come out but we'll see.  But the feel of the movie is what I enjoyed most about it.  It had an old fashioned feel to it but yet with a new and somewhat refreshing style in its ownright.  There will be lots of people who say its a remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and they aren't far off at all.  But there are plenty of movies out there devoted to Ed Gein and he is even mentioned in the movie.  But overall I think this cast is memorable in their own right and this could very well be the start of a whole new Horror Series.  The ending was not what I expected going into the theater, but by the time it reached the last 20 minutes I had pretty much figured out how it would end.  And who and what it involved I was dead on with in my predictions.  The other complaint people had is that it wasn't scary enough.  Well I say that those people need some therapy.  Cause if I got stuck in that house I'd be pretty darn scared.  The movie wasn't meant to scare more than it was supposed to creep people out.  It was incredibly eerie thus scary in the aspect of many what if scenarios.  I give the movie a solid 9.5/10  Please feel free to IM me cause this movie rocked.",House of 1000 Corpses

Everything you don't do, they did!  I would have walked out, had there have been less people there (I was trapped in a bad movie! AGH!)  It was like all HORRIBLE B-horror movies combined!

634,Doc_West,Total Disappointment,1,14 April 2003,"I wanted to like this film SO badly, but I absolutely do not have one good thing to say about it.  To pay homage to other films is one thing, but I'm not sure there was a single original idea present in the entire rambling, confused, and generally boring 88 minutes (which, incidentally, seemed like 880 minutes).What really gets me though is the inordinate amount of people here claiming that this movie was scary and/or gory.  I'm not sure that we saw the same film.  I'd venture to say that there were literally NO scares and that any attempt at gore was foiled by poor cinematography and poor effects. Furthermore, Zombie clearly has no sense of pacing.  The cut scenes that flash incessantly throughout the movie are absurdly long...i.e., 'female character says something seductive so, rather than flashing one second of said character being scantily clad and looking devilish, let's instead ""flash"" THIRTY seconds of said character and other random women wiggling around the screen until the viewer can't even remember what the conversation was about anyway, but they'll think it's cool because we showed some boobies!'  Give me a break.  No suspense, no startling discoveries, no unexpected surprises....no nothing.I think the guy who said this was like a long music video hit the nail right on the head.  There was just absolutely no substance.  I hated it so much that I'm actually getting angry just remembering pieces of it :)  Please do not see this movie, do not wait for DVD, do not wait for cable, and please, for the love of God, do not encourage Rob Zombie to ever attempt filmmaking again.",House of 1000 Corpses

Taken from a strictly artistic viewpoint it succeeds in its ability to shock, repulse, and occasionly annoy the average filmgoer. As a cinematic vision it more often then not resembles a jumbled together music video or TV commercial.  Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, its just that Rob Zombie knows how to play to todays frequently distracted audiences. Screens of ghoulish slaughter are interspersed with colorful 70's style cuts which are interspersed with old Saturday night creature feature clips.  With this said the movie deserves at least a view based on its artistic merit alone. In a world of tired nature run amok ""Thrillers"" its always nice to see a film with vision and passion, and not a small amount of skill.

At times painful to watch, not from fear but from being so embarrassed for Rob. There's nothing wrong with paying homage to TX CHAINSAW, but to copy it to the extent that Rob did is just sad. He actually had the nerve to use the line ""go get grandpa"" within the film. Did we really need the constant cuts to the villains giving little interviews about ""what they're all about"".(Is this some tv dating show interview session?)

Many compare this to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the comparison is warranted, but I like this film much better as it goes a step beyond.  It is hard to say, but I almost liked all the murderous bad guys in this movie due to the dark humor and attitudes portrayed by Bill Moseley (Otis) and Sid Haig (Captain Spaulding).  If there were ever a Captain Spaulding spin off, I would be sure to attend.  It is chalk full of fun things and a lot of eye candy. Be sure to pay attention to any images and literature in the background or on characters T-Shirts.  I was fortunate enough to attend Universal Studios' Halloween Horror Nights when Rob Zombie had his House of 1000 Corpses haunted house.

The movie reminds me the Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie and some people would say that Rob Zombie try to copy this horror classic.  I'm sorry but this is not my opinion because House of 1000 corpses is an anti-Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It takes some elements of the Tobe Hooper movie but Zombie make them look at the opposite side of the Chainsaw movie.

I think this is the finest horror film in the last 20 years, the plot was perfectly clear to me, and the terror was unrelenting.  So very sick and disturbing, and beautifully designed and shot.  Horror buffs will spot tributes to landmarks of the genre, which don;t detract from the singular nastiness of Zombie's vision. I can;t wait for the original cut on DVD, and then hopefully another gem from Rob Zombie.  Brilliant!",House of 1000 Corpses

647,johnnypvward,Don't expect a story line.,5,22 January 2011,"What spoiled this film for me was the lack of any sort of narrative after the first 20 minutes. Rob Zombie has a lot of ideas, some good, some bad but it seems he tried to shoe horn all of them into one film. The group of teenagers to be chopped up were also of a poor quality. I was actually routing for the family to dispatch them in the most gruesome way possible, perhaps that was Mr Zombie's point. The film is not scary at all, disturbing, a little, funny, a lot. As a homage to slasher movies of the 70's it works quite well as a stand alone horror it falls way short. One last thing. How can a family kill so many people over so many years and get away with it?. They were not exactly the brightest family on the planet.",House of 1000 Corpses
648,jwinslow82,"Weird, demented movie, but important lesson and awesome style and texture",7,6 February 2011,"Rob Zombie's film, House of 1000 Corpses takes us on the grueling journey of events that four teenagers are subjected to while conducting research on serial killers across the world. When they discover the founding place of a legendary serial killer in a small town in Texas in the 70's, they also find that they're in a similar predicament as the victims they have read about. The film introduces us to a twisted family who gets their kicks from murdering innocent young women, but only after they have had their fun with them. This sadistic, twisted tale demonstrates a central theme that acknowledges people's tendency to let their curiosity and desperation override their good judgment.In the beginning of the film, Bill, played by Rainn Wilson, and Jerry, played by Chris Hardwick, convince their uptight girlfriends to go on a museum murder ride displaying many of the local urban legends who have committed various murders. Captain Spaulding, played by Sid Haig, a foul-mouthed clown that operates the gas stop, takes them on the murder ride and shows them the evil that this town is known for. Bill and Jerry, two nerds who are trying to both impress and scare their girlfriends, become infatuated with the stories and the sites they see on the murder ride and want to pursue the whereabouts of the legendary Dr. Satan. Despite their girlfriends, Mary, played by Jennifer Jostyn, and Denise, played by Erin Daniels, opposing this ridiculous idea, they all set off to find the place where this infamous serial killer is buried, but what they find is a demented family that specializes in the torturing and slaying of young teenagers for means of entertainment. After their curiosity results in some unexpected car troubles, their desperation and ignorance leads them to a house where they are introduced into a world of hell that consists of sexually disturbed nymphomaniacs who kill them one by one after humiliating and torturing them.Zombie directed this film in a very unique way. Although he incorporated familiar themes that have been expressed in many other horror films that we consider cheesy and insulting today, it was obvious that he wanted to play off of that but make it his own by modernizing it with morbidly disturbing situations contrasted by ironic music and sound. The fact that Jerry and Bill's curiosity led them into this situation portrays the typical theme witnessed in many other horror films, such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, where their lack of good judgment contributed to their fatal destiny.In the scene when Otis, played by Bill Moseley, is wearing the skin of Denise's father while Denise, Jerry, and Mary are tied up in bunny suits, he makes it a point to tell them that their overwhelming need to find Dr. Satan is was got them into this mess, and he suggests that this is what happens to people who snoop around in other people's business. During this scene, the angle and lighting that was used helped capture the expressions from the horrified teenagers who had realized that they had made the worst, and possibly the last mistake of their lives. The lighting was formatted so the focus was only on Otis and the teenagers in their bunny suits. The background was out of focus and the camera angles gave the viewer up close shots between them to give the scene emotional tone. This was an important part of the film because it demonstrated the main theme of the film and the lesson that Otis was trying to teach them, and it was the turning point of the movie that led to each of their fate.Unlike the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which Zombie based a lot of the story line off of, none of the victims in this film made it out alive. This also ties in with the theme of the film because in the ending scene, when Denise thinks she has escaped and accepts a ride from Captain Spaulding who is ""coincidently"" driving by, she unknowingly puts herself in the same situation that she had just managed to get out of. Out of desperation, she fails to use her good judgment and again puts herself back into danger as we see Otis peak his head out from the backseat indicating that he caught her and was going to finish the job that Dr. Satan failed to complete.The theme that I observed from House of 1000 Corpses is quite universal in that as humans we sometimes think that we are invincible and that nothing bad could ever happen. The truth to this film, and possibly another theme, is that sick, demented individuals like this family really do exist in society today. They may look no different from anybody else and they may seem good in nature, but you can never tell what motives people possess. Although Zombie made this point in a very grotesque and bizarre manner, the moral of the story is clear, if not burned into viewer's conscience.",House of 1000 Corpses

Not for the faint of heart, to say the least, and it does have what many would consider disturbing images (abuse of women, kidnapping, dismemberment), but hey, it is a HORROR movie, right!?! I think this is what horror movies should be about. It takes a lot to scare me, and this movie came the closest to any movie 'scaring' me--it just covers things that COULD happen to an individual, giving a little more reality to these scary movies. It also has some comedy to it--if you call it that--personally I thought much of it was funny as hell!

No.Does this movie have a plot? Barely.Does it copy some ideas from other movies? Yes.What does this movie have that few other movie has? Heart.The one thing that you notice most when watching HOTC, is that it was made by a true fan, and he put his heart and soul into this one. 99.9999% of all movies that come out are just pure crap, and while they may have a plot and ""good acting"", they are just commercial pieces of garbage whose soul purpose is to grab 10$ from you.
""House Of 1000 Corpses"" though was made for one reason only. To make a kick ass movie. And that's exactly what it is:It's fun.It's entertaining.It's got some fantastic scenes you've never seen before.
It's got tons of atmosphere.It's got a cast (of sadistic killers) that you can't help but love.
It's got a killer soundtrack.It all fits together perfectly.And an incredible amount of work was put into each scene.
The movie doesn't try to send you some sort of pompous message. It doesn't insult your intelligence. It doesn't feature all the ""latest boom boom special effects"". It doesn't have any lame twists and turns.
It wasn't approved or written by some straight-out-of-marketing-school-obsessed-with-toilet-humour-needs-to-be-sex ually-degrading-to-women-never-had-an-original-thought-brown-nose-yes-man.It just shows you a good time.And afterall, isn't this why we go to the movies in the first place?",House of 1000 Corpses

This film doesn't even degrade... it sensationalizes gore for it's own sake. It is pornographically violent. The camera zeroes in on blood, agony, and guts the way porn cameras zero in on genitals, semen and 'pleasure.' 'Normal' people may find this film disturbing. 'Abnormal' people may gain ideas from it. Rob Zombie's wife plays a key role in the movie...initially, her funny, twisted sexuality offsets the dark excesses of others in her character's family. Ultimately, her character turns out to be equally murderous and sadistic. This film ain't for the squeamish. My wife literally gagged a couple of times while watching it.",House of 1000 Corpses

656,patlanm,"Lots of blood and gore, typically predictable, somewhat annoying.",1,23 August 2003,"This movie lines up with many others of its genre, e.g. ""A crack in the floor"", for which in my humble opinion the title ""Horror Movie"" is a misnomer. Scary is the last thing applicable to this film, unless you're still afraid of characters like the good ole Freddy Krueger and his boring and trivial massacre techniques. The main characteristics of this movie are the aforementioned blood and gore, as well as obsessive tinkering with bodies, sadism in all its incarnations, serial kidnappers and killers throughout history and urban tales.This whole movie is rather chaotic and superfluous with intermediate, quite insane cutscenes, though in the end it somehow manages to keep track on the plot line and make sense. Beyond the killings which are all very detailed and realistic, nothing else in this movie is realistic or convincing for anyone older than 12.Perhaps the criticism on this movie would have been less killing if it wasn't for its inability to face any comparison with The Horror Movie of the decade (in my opinion), ""The Ring"", which can undoubtedly be called the School for All Horror Fiction. ""1000 Corpses"" fails to produce tension and tingle the nerve like ""The Ring"" does with its amazing background music and less-than-a-second flashing snapshots.In short, I found this movie a disappointment, an annoyance and a waste of good time.

The film does have good cinematography at times and is not totally devoid of entertainment value, but we were expecting something that would keep us up at night, not something that would just make us vaguely nauseated. There are memorable moments and some good visuals, but on the whole it just didn't work for either of us. The sad thing is that the storyline had some real potential, but it wasn't explored sufficiently. If you like horror movies because they scare you, I wouldn't rush out and rent this.

660,illinione,The naysayers missed the point,9,27 October 2003,"I read the comments by some of the others who hated this movie, and have listened to others. There is only one explanation : a complete misunderstanding of this film.First, ""the acting was poor"". This movie was not intended to be performed by a Shakespearian actor. It is a campy movie ...though violent and dark ... that doesn't take itself overseriously. The acting is over-the-top, which fits the film.Second ""too much gore"". There is a fair amount of gore, no doubt. This is a film that would not have worked without the blood, sex and violence. The images are typically distorted or altered in such a way to leave the viewer off-balance ...70's split screen, black  and white footage cut in ...its all there.Third, ""its not a horror film, or its not scary"". To an extent, this is true. Its not scary in the ""boo"" sense, it is spooky. The characters are unbelievably violent, yet at the same time likeable, which is not easy to pull off.Finally, although offbeat and whimsical, there is an underlying dark side to this film that I found interesting. The victims characters were not developed, and the movie made no attempt to get the viewer to identify with them. To the contrary, the 2 women were downright obnoxious. You knew they were all going to die, yet it didn't matter ; the development of the characters, if it exists at all in the film, comes from murderers, and how the viewer comes to understand the nuances of each character.This movie is not for everyone. If you were disturbed by Texas Chainsaw massacre, you won't like this one. The one shortcoming is that it appears to be a copycat of the original. However, if you want to see an over the top horror film unlike the multitude of ones released in the past years, this is for you. 9 stars ot of 10.",House of 1000 Corpses

What was supposed to be an homage to the great (and not so great) cannibal films of the late 70's came off more like a hackneyed recreation of them, with an incoherent plot and highly irritating characters.  The only upside was some pretty good cinematography, via the use of colored lighting -- the style was reminiscent of Suspira and Eaten Alive.But what was up with those way-too-long cut away shots?  Was Rob Zombie TRYING to irritate us?  For a true tribute to the days of cheap exploitation cinema, check out Wrong Turn instead.

664,splattergirl,"A fitting, modern day homage to the 70's/80's splatterfests",10,21 March 2004,"This film is not particularly original, nor is the plot fresh and compelling. The acting is overstated and the story is left somewhat up in the air. However, it is a very slick example of the black comedy splatter movies produced in the 'old days' when a spray of blood could get a movie banned and thus increase its appeal a hundredfold.The story of the movie tips its hat quite strongly to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and even stars Bill Moseley, who was in the '86 sequel to TCM, as Otis (Frankly one of the most sinister characters I've ever seen on screen) and those who have seen his performance as Chop Top will love this darker, more disturbing incarnation. It's not sophisticated enough to fall in with 'classics' such as the original TCM, Nightmare on Elm Street or Hellraiser but it's a perfectly formed tribute to the sequels that followed said films. In every event they were made bigger, dirtier and, more often than not, a lot funnier either by will or by accident and this film certainly captures the essence of such sequels.The characters are richly portrayed, there are gut-wrenchingly violent splatter scenes for us gore-fans, the alarmingly tender family relationships fling you between sympathising with the victims and the murderers, and of course there are some hilarious black comedy moments which have you laughing and worrying slightly that you ought to see someone about finding this so funny.I loved it! I recommend it highly to those who enjoyed such movies as Rabid Grannies, TCM 2 and 3, Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, Brain Dead and Bad Taste, and other such comedy gore-fests and Troma-style productions. If you're looking for a sophisticated, thought provoking scare avoid this one, but if, like me, you go to laugh at people being hacked up with interesting implements then it's a must see!

I believe this movie should be rated 10 because it accomplishes it's goal, which is to be a GREAT horror movie. It keeps the viewers in suspense, it has tons of disturbing images, there are memorable characters, it has the antagonists win in the end, the protagonists are ALL killed, it even leaves some parts open to interpretation. In my personal opinion, the scene where the police officer gets shot execution style after discovering the dead cheerleaders in the shed, is one of the most suspenseful and horrifying scenes in a movie ever. The music is perfectly compatible to the movie. If anyone knows horror, its Rob Zombie. I can understand why some people might not like it, but if you ask me, that only further proves how great of a horror movie it is.

666,chris1029,Truly Appalling,1,2 May 2004,"Stay away. This film was possibly the worst-spent £3 rental I've ever had. I picked it up, and it looked as if it was going to be all-out gore, or possibly have a strong element of humour in it. How wrong I was.The plot was a total bore, and all aspects of it had no resemblance to normal human behaviour, with character reactions being totally impossible to fathom. The few good parts of the movie were stolen from other great films, and still were poorly executed. There was no understandable logic to any part of the film, if it can be described as that, although I think the DVD would be worth more if it was melted down to its raw components.The possible humour I mentioned? Nope. Nothing. How about any emotion then? Sadness? Joy? Maybe some romance in a 'horror' movie? The strongest emotion I felt was the relief, and joy when 'THE END' appeared on my TV.Special effects were used far too much; it seems as if the makers concentrated on fancy effects that make the picture so strange that viewers can't actually tell what's happening, rather than concentrating on the plot, and quality of the film. In all honesty I could have closed my eyes and have been none the wiser with some of the picture effects. If you're after a heavy usage of special effects, watch this film. However if you're after a heavy usage of special effects, but applied correctly, and in the right places, then this isn't for you.The gore element was virtually non-existant, and very disappointing. The ""scary moments"" were not at all scary, and really in my opinion would be quite suitable for toddlers. Very boring in that department. I've seen more gore after a paper-cut.The acting really was terrible. I could describe it in more detail, but my vocabulary doesn't contain enough put-downs to give you an accurate picture of how detrimental and unconvincing the acting is.So - my recommendations. Go for ""The Evil Dead"" or ""Braindead"" a.k.a ""Dead Alive"" if you're after purest gore. If you're more interested in a truly brilliant plot, with some gore, then maybe ""The Thing"" will be more your cup of tea. In fact, pick any film at random, and it will almost certainly be more worthwhile than this one!",House of 1000 Corpses

668,harvey-winder,Defunct in this post-Hostel world,2,15 August 2012,"House of 1000 Corpses shows its age, badly. Less than 10 years after its release its raison d'etre: nihilistic violence, has been so utterly surpassed and the viewer so desensitized by the slew of late 00's horror films that the film appears utterly quaint; to say nothing of its other glaring deficiencies.It was obvious from the outset that this was horror designed to shock and disturb rather than scare; upsetting the viewer with grizzly imagery rather than tense buildup and sudden frights. In this regard it has completely lost its edge to the now well established ""torture-porn"" sub-genre of horror pioneered by Hostel and Saw.Furthermore, despite its relative youth, the film is shot in the vein of a music video from the turn of the century. This makes 1000 Corpses look incredibly passe to a viewer in 2012, reminding them of a Shakira video filmed in the Deep-South. This leaves us with the plot and characters; both of which are trite, underwritten and cliché. Beyond the amusement of seeing a younger Rainn Wilson not playing Dwight K Schrute, the 5 victims are all entirely forgettable and one does not really care what happens once Dwight is gone (they all die). The 'stars' of the show are the dysfunctional family as penned by Mr. Zombie to remove Dwight and his friends from this mortal plain. Unfortunately, 'nympho matriarch', 'slutty teen (in her 30s)', 'albino-serial killer', 'ogre-in-the-basement' and 'some-hillbilly' will long be forgotten in the annals of movie history by the time Leatherface celebrates his 50th birthday. The clown in the opening scene is at least engaging but the actor appears to have made a career in B-movie horror and is no doubt playing a movie persona he refined for himself over the decades.In summary, I don't like this film very much but I had to pretend I did whilst watching it and that made me want to vent my spleen on the internet :(",House of 1000 Corpses

It was House of a 1000 Corpses, a horror movie written and directed by Rob Zombie. It was very bloody which was expected, but the movie looked as if a drunken mule was distracting ever body while a chimp, high off of carnauba wax, snuck into the editing room and took over at the Helm. Now, the scripted seemed as if Rob Zombie hired some illegal immigrants, asked them cut out random words from a newspaper and pieced them together in what ever jumbled order comes to them, then they lost that scripted in a freak fan accident, so Zombie decided to just pick up pieces of the script and hand them to the actors, who I don't think even realize they were filming a movie, which is why the acting reminded me of a kindergarten class doing a finger puppet show. Probably the most horrific part is that the story line to this movie dies a very slow death, then the character have to finish the last 40 minutes or so without it. 4 heroes are introduced (no joke 2 Girls 1 Cup had more character development then abodimation), simply put, you have a murderous family and 4 people who happen to be on their way, the 2 groups meet and that's about it. They hear about Dr. Satan (some guy they mention and then show at the end) and 1 is interested. Then they get kidnapped and killed, all in very stupid ways. The policemen who come to save them are killed in a scene where for some reason very melodramatic music plays, and then a prolonged silence all of which maybe me wonder if the movie froze, but then a gunshot fires ruining my prayers that the movie's awfulness had actually killed my TV. The whole movie has constant flash backs ala Natural Born Killers, and takes other scenic elements from previous famous Horror flicks. Every shred of dignity this movie tried to attain is lost when at the end of the movie, the 2 remaining characters are brought to see Dr. Satan. They are placed in a coffin and lower into some underground tunnel system, where they are attacked by water zombies (yes Water Zombies), what they were doing own there confuses me to the point where I started reading Quantium Physics just to try to solve something simpler. Then the final surviving character runs around in these underground tunnels and see a bunch of dead skeletons standing covered with Comb Webs. for some reason. She enter a room and sees Dr. Satan operating on her friend then is chased by Nemesis from Resident Evil who hacks at her and then tears down a piece of the tunnel on himself. She escapes the next morning only to be recaptured and wake up being operated by Dr. Satan. finally, after and hour and 40 minutes the torture is over and the movie finally ends. I think that Rob Zombie's true intention was to torture his audience into watching the worst possible movie he could come up with. I came up with that theory after I spent 5 minutes hitting my head into the wall hoping that the last hour and a half of my memory would have been wiped out. Then, after a brief meeting with Dr. Kevorkian, I decided I shouldn't have to kill myself instead we should all watch this movie, It could fix the world. Muslims, Jews, Christians, Blacks, Whites, Browns, everyone in the world can unite to fight a common enemy, Rob Zombie and anyone associated with this movie. With the world's approval, we could have a public execution where these people can be burned on the stake then just to be on the safe side we should place the ashes into a concrete box and have it shot at the sun.In conclusion: If you have children and want to punish them ,use this movie.",House of 1000 Corpses
672,zarko14,Excellent movie. Reminds me of old school horror movies!!!,10,14 July 2006,"I totally disagree with the low (5.2) avg rating of the movie. I believe that it is one of the best horror movies ever. It is an all-star of horror movies. Rob Zombie has used all the clichés from old school horror movies, adding great music and directing it superbly. I believe Rob and his team have done a very good job as you can actually see a lot of the old time favorite movies, all packed into one, but updated for the millennium. The feeling of the movie is also sensational. I would really like to see people rating movies for what they are. You obviously cannot compare it to V for vendetta, or other masterpieces, but in the horror movie scene, i believe it is one of the best efforts ever. So rating it as a horror movie would be ideal. I still cannot believe the low rating. Anyway thank u for your time",House of 1000 Corpses

Just when you think it was ""horrid enough"" it gets better *or worse, however you may view it* This movie is sure to become a cult classic. In Devil's Rejects, the sequel, I'm sure Rob will give us more history and insight into Dr. Satan. I'm thrilled and can't wait for the second one to come out! Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but if you haven't seen the movie yet, and like *heck, even love* horror and being shocked this movie is the movie to check out. It starts off with 2 young couples who are writing a book about the strange things you see while traveling cross country. Little did they know when they stopped into a ""museum"" of sorts that they would encounter the ""strange"" things themselves. Their ride into murder and chaos just gets more and more twisted.

The re-make of Texas Chainsaw was not great, however it Citizen Kane compared to this over the top, not frighting, gory film. In particular the incest/face mask scene and the scalping turned my stomach.I can't imagine this film being released after being test screened. I don't have much interest the Heavy Metal music scene and am not familiar with Rob Zombie's work. I decided to be open minded and watch the film since I enjoy the horror movie genre. I couldn't have been more disgusted. It seemed slapped together overnight. Ironicly the music in the movie was sloppy and not entertaining. The acting was not the worst that I have seen.

Bill Moseley and Sid Haig as Otis and Spaulding respectively, reinvent the down home monster for the new millennium. Great performances laced with humor and unbearable dread.The film itself is very linear story-wise, two couples find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time and bring on their own demise after insulting their hosts. Not that the eventual victims are very likable to begin with. Zombie makes sure you hate them from the get-go, while his villains get all your attention and admiration.Excellent visuals include a wonderful stretched out execution style shooting, and nightmare-like snatches of killings and confessions make this one to check out.",House of 1000 Corpses

If you're a fan of sadistic films like The Hills Have Eyes, then this is the movie for you. It's more of a remake of this film than Chainsaw Massacre as others may have written. If you think Tales from the Hood was a good movie, then don't watch this one. If you have deep knowledge of the genre, then by all means this is the movie for you. Can't wait to watch the sequel, although I hear that it is an entirely different film and taken in an entirely different direction. Regardless, ""House of 1000"" is one of my all time favorite guilty pleasures of horror. For his first try at a film I'd say Zombie hit this one out of the park easily.

It's twisted and absurd, just the way I like it. Sid Haig is great as Captain Spaulding, and he really kicks ass, not giving a damn what anybody else thinks about him.

680,allisoncassatta,LOVED IT!!!,10,14 November 2004,"I have to disagree with the last comments made about this movie. It basically sums up every horror movie that we grew up on (in a funny and unique way.) Rob Zombie is one of the sickest minds of our time and I think he did a great job. It wasn't meant to be a SCARY movie. Think about it, the over usage of blood and guts. If it was really supposed to be taken as a scary movie it would be something like Saw or Dee Snider's Strangleland or even Friday the 13th (before Jason was killed the first time.) What I am getting at here is all these movies could really happen and therefore are absolutely terrifying. House of 1000 Corpses on the other hand DOUBT IT!!! I mean yeah there could be some crazy hill billy family living out in the woods killing people but to have all those science experiments living under the ground doubt it... Anyway, ROB IS THE MAN to sum it all up and I will definitely be buying the Devil's Rejects as well (and let's hope that this one is just as good unlike the grand tradition of sequels that usually SUCK)",House of 1000 Corpses

If your a fan of horror movies and watch nothing but, it will probably seem the same as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and as it's own film isn't really worth your time, your better off watching something in the Texas Chainsaw series. It does, however, have one thing that increased my enjoyment. Some of the characters, Captain Spalding for example, make it fun to watch or at least those pieces. My diagnoses: Not necessarily a good film, but as a back story to the sequel, The Devil's Rejects, (itself a brilliant film) it's worth your time.",House of 1000 Corpses
682,combathobo,a well payed tribute to classic slashers,9,23 May 2005,"Rob Zombie through his masterful writing has produced a movie that will find it's way up every viewer's spine. Instead of attempting at the subtle, creepy approach, mr. Zombie decided to put forward a more 'in your face' effort. Ultimately the in your face style accomplishes what it was meant to accomplish. It not only leaves the viewer completely irked and bewildered but it doesn't have to use cheap sound effects and screen flashes to do so.The Rob Zombie music lover in all of us will be delighted to notice some very deliberate relations to house of 1000 corpses and his music videos. From the early neon lighted thunderkiss '65 to living dead girl. The shaky, browned film reel effect is used several times during the film and they are all very appropriate, portraying events happened in the past. The neon lights are used close to the beginning and they really do inspire a sense of insanity amongst their escort.Ultimately house of 1000 corpses is a must see for any slasher fan and a should see for the rest of us. It makes you jump, it makes you squeal, and it makes you cry for your mother. What more can anyone ask out of a horror movie and what else could you expect from the freak show (in a good way of course) that is Rob Zombie?",House of 1000 Corpses

It hasn't exactly got the best plot in the world but there again it isn't confusing to follow the storyline as it goes. My younger brother finds parts of the film funny and I must say so do I. It is gory but I love that in a film, it may be taking bits off of other films but it was done really well in my opinion, this is probably my favourite film, and Rob Zombie's music rocks. The music that goes with the film is amazing, even my mum likes it which is saying something. The atmosphere the music creates is great, it fits in perfectly with the film itself, adding more depth and darkness to the film as it goes.In other words I think the film rocks",House of 1000 Corpses

I have been a fan for years, and I do think that Rob will get better with time. The first White Zombie records were nowhere near what the later ones were, and I feel that his movies may develop in the same fashion. You do see flashes of brilliance in house of 1000 corpses, and the camera angles and tempo changes are pretty cool. If the evolution of his movie making skills goes along the same path as his music, then I think we will see great things from him. I may have had too high of hopes for this movie, and I should have spent more time appreciating the fact that Rob spent the time doing it. The fact that he ventured into this genre was very cool, and I hope he continues to make horror movies...they are a dying art, and us horror movie fans need more of them.!",House of 1000 Corpses

It was not scary, gory, suspenseful, twisted, intelligent, delightfully absurd, or even morbidly funny. There was not a single memorable moment for me - everything in it was directly stolen or borrowed from other movies (by actual clips or in concept), or just plain derivative in their few attempts at creativity. I got the feeling they were trying to make a ""cult"" film intentionally, which is so completely wrong in approach that I wanted to spit at my TV, drive to CA, track down (the director) and skin his dog in spite. As someone who loves horror films, from the greats to the simply gory, I have to say that anyone involved in this montage-and-xerox vomit should be ashamed for making this irritating, pointless, and pathetic thing.

A BRILLIANT effort from Rob Zombie! I was not disappointed at all. This movie was all I expected and more. If you're thinking this is going to be some kind of ""thinking man's"" horror, you got it all wrong. This is straight up mayhem. Nothing to think about, Just an unfortunate sidetrack made by some young'ens, and the hopeless situation that they end up in. Yes, it is very reminiscent of some 70s horror, but who gives a sh*t. Texas Chainsaw Massacre came out over 30 years ago. I don't see any problem with taking the idea and expanding on it. Hell, it seems like every few months now we have a new ""horror"" movie that comes out having to do with a ghost using some innocent to seek revenge for deeds done wrong. Nobody's complaining about that. As for the cast. I loved em. All of them. GREAT casting. Sheri Moon was outstanding as Baby, and DAMN sexy I might add. If my life was getting ready to be taken, looking up into her psychotic eyes would make it all just a bit easier. That shrill of a laugh may take away from the moment, but I'd still make the best out of it. Maybe have her drive a stick into my ears or something. OK... I'm losing my concentration. Bad habit.... I was hoping Moseley was going to play the spastic nut-bag card again like his Chop Top character in TCM2. I was a little bummed that he didn't, but Otis quickly became one of my new favs. A no nonsense kinda guy that'll rip your throat out if you look at him wrong. Moseley was PERFECT for the role. Anyway.... I am a big fan of horror, and I loved this movie. It's not for everybody. My friends who are horror fans loved it also. The others that are more of your mainstream kinda folks, didn't like it. In fact they downright hated it. BUT, I think that's a big plus myself, because I honestly don't think Zombie made this move for the mainstream fan. I think he made it for others like him. HORROR fans. Keep the faith ROB!!

689,loke0110,Great HORROR movie,10,15 April 2005,"To start, this is a horror movie. If you don't like horror movies or are easily offended in any way, don't watch it. Plain and simple...this movie was made for a certain audience and is definitely not for everyone. You have to love horror movies to love this movie. I honestly cant see why anyone other than hardcore horror movie fans would want to watch a movie called ""house of 1000 corpses"".That said, Ill also add that imo, this is a damn good horror movie, if not the greatest horror movie ever made. I say this because i look at movies that are regarded as the best horror movies (exorcist, original Texas chainsaw massacre, nightmare on elm street, and Friday the 13th) and this movie is easily the same level, if not better than those. Some people say this movie has no plot, that its only violence and gore...with no storyline...my response is ""what did you expect?"" and ""why are you watching a horror movie?"" The storyline is actually deeper than most other horror movies, and although this movie is a little gory, it isn't a gore movie (check out cannibal holocaust if you want to see an example of a gore movie) Most of the gore is in your mind if you try and think about whats been going on with this family and how long its been going on, and how many different ways, and how many people, etc. It still has enough on screen to make a squeamish person have problems.Rob Zombie does a great job of actually giving you chills at some points. I cant remember the last movie i saw that made me look with wide eyes in disbelief of what i just saw. The first time i saw the fish-boy scene, or the ""whos your daddy"" scene i was hooked on this movie. Definitely a very creative movie in terms of doing things id never seen before.One great thing about this movie is that although it shows you a lot, it still leaves many questions. Its a horror movie that shows you things that might shock you a bit, but leaves blanks for your imagination to fill in...and these blanks are what really makes this movie good. The more you think about it, the more scary this movie actually is.The only flaw i even saw in this movie is that they could've told you more about the character and filled in some of those blanks. Thats really not a flaw though, since everything that was included in the movie was great.If you love horror movies, this is probably one of the best movies you will ever see. You MUST check it out. If you aren't really into horror movies though, stay away from this one, you'll see it as a waste of time, and probably the worst movie ever. This movie will never win an Oscar so go watch ray charles if you want to see a performance. This movie isn't for people with ""donald duck on one sock, and micky mouse on the other"" I can only hope one day rob will release an unrated version. The version he originally wanted to do. It probably will never happen...if it did i would definitely buy it the day it came out. Id preorder it the day you could preorder it. I cant stress enough how great this movie is.

I feel that the effects were done well and kept the film feeling gritty and delusional. I was also really impressed with the dialogue which really made the characters feel sadistic yet intelligent. I feel that Rob Zombie has done a good job of introducing us to the characters and letting us know that as weird as they are..they are a family and seemed to enjoy doing things together..even if it did involve mutilation and murder. did anyone else feel like tiny was going to save the day?All in all i feel that the villains were fairly likable and this will set us up nicely for the sequel ""devils rejects"" when we will see the villains in a less powerful position and more vulnerable.Great film..thumbs up from me",House of 1000 Corpses

It was great to watch and get a good laugh out of, because it is cheesy, and weird, and really screws with your head as you are watching. Throughout the movie, it cuts from the basic story, to a kind of 'background' on the psychos. If you aren't watching the whole movie, you can easily get lost with how random stuff is, but for a movie to watch when sitting back getting wasted, i think its on the top of my list! Sure, its a rip-off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, as well as others, but then again, what movies today Aren't rip-offs from other movies in one way or another?

It wouldn't be fair to compare this film to NightMare on Elm Street or The Texas Chain Saw Masscre(despite the Satanic rituals the family had!) so anyone who tells you its just another slasher flick is lying.

700,wristtattoo,House 1000 is excellent,10,22 July 2005,"my house of 1000 corpses came yesterday (july 21, 2005), i've never seen it before and bought a copy from eBay for £1. i love it.i love it because i know zombie's music and appreciate what he's done plus found it disturbing the same way i did chain saw massacre / exorcist and appreciate what zombie has created. when i first listened to zombie's hellbilly deluxe i kept thinking to myself 'this is like a sound track to a horror movie' and enjoyed house 1000 a lot. The whole flick seemed to be a visual representation of what goes on in his mind when he writes his music tracks. Loved it, and appalled by the brutality in it. that was made worse when it leaved some to your imagination.if you're not familiar with his music or haven't seen any 70's horror films, this isn't the movie for you. go watch silence of the lambs or something Hollywood.",House of 1000 Corpses
701,mjmccalister,Terrible Movie,1,10 July 2005,"I had waited for this movie to come out way before it was ever released. From the trailers, the movie looked great. I had heard that the movie was not released when it was originally scheduled because it was too intense and violent. So, when it was finally released, I drove 20 minutes to Hollywood to see this movie. I could not be more disappointed. I spent the whole movie checking my watch and waiting for the climax....it never arrived. This movie could have been good (I think there were some cool characters in the film), but nothing happened. Sure, people died and kids got stuck in a f'd up house with a bunch of weirdos, but this movie looked like nothing more than a conglomeration of classic horror movies, only 10 times worse. The only thought that this movie provoked was why did I waste 90 minutes of my life watching this. It was not shocking nor provocative. If you have to think beyond a movie, the movie has not done its job, (thats what a book is for, to use your own imagination). I like horror movies (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Evil Dead, Dawn of the Dead) so that was not the reason for my disgust with this film. If you want to see some excitement and a buildup that has to do with this movie, just watch the trailer and use your imagination (as a previous raver of this movie said was a necessary component for appreciating this film) to think of a better film that actually has a plot, because this one doesn't.",House of 1000 Corpses
702,sXeMSTie,The Best In Years,10,28 November 2005,"I have seen this movie several times now and still can't say anything bad about it. The horror genre has been in a slump in recent years with plenty of fodder put out and very few gems. This is one of those gems. Rob Zombie delivered in BIG fashion in this. There has been talk amongst a lot of horror fans out there that this is a rip off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is a complete misconception. What Zombie did was make a horror movie that is a throw-back to the gritty '70s and '80s type of horror flicks... movies like The Hills Have Eyes, Texas Chainsaw and Last House On The Left. But, House Of 1000 Corpses is by no means a rip off of any of them. This movie will satisfy even the most die hard horror fans. Well... those that aren't ""too cool for the room"" and just know that everything horror made after 1985 sucks. If that's you, this movie isn't for you. If that's you, go watch Texas Chainsaw for the 5432564123rd time. Everyone else, if you want a great horror movie that will delight you horror nuts and scare the rest... check this one out. From beginning to end, House Of 1000 Corpses doesn't have one misstep. It is straight ahead, in your face horror. The performances from Sid Haig, Sherri Moon, Bill Moseley and Karen Black are all top notch. Don't sleep on this one.",House of 1000 Corpses
703,johnny_xXx,read this,10,20 July 2005,"OK, so i thought this movie was incredible. the plot was a little crazy but it came together well. i don't understand how people say this is a TCM rip-off... it takes elements from many REAL serial killers and puts it into these characters. tiny would be a pathetic excuse for a leatherface as well. if anything... that TCM re-make ripped this movie off.,, making the whole town part of it and all... just like this movie is, which came out before the TCM remake. the movie was shot and acted cheesy for a reason... to try and replicate the late 70's early 80's B-slasher flick, which it did a really good job of creating. the characters give you a definite sense of who and what they are. they're written extremely well. same as the plot, it gets you guessing a little and explains a lot really well. there's some stuff that gets left out, but that's why there's a sequel. so everyone's entitled to their own opinions, but i just think people dislike this for the wrong reasons. it's kinda cheesy cu it's supposed to be. it's really messed up cu it's supposed to be. the only way it's like TCM is that's it's villains are based off of real serial killers (mainly ed gin, which also influenced Hitchcock into writing psycho, but would you say psycho is a rip-off of TCM?). why do you think they have that murder ride trip that they show? so you can see the similarities between these characters and the real killers. so if you don't like it, fine... but if you're gonna call it a TCM rip-off or hate cu it's acting is cheesy... do some homework before you post stuff for other people to see. and BTW, this movie was in theaters.",House of 1000 Corpses

You have got to either be kidding me, or have never watched any of those films. Those films are interesting and contain true inventiveness and soul. House of a Thousand Corpses contains none of those things. The scares are cheap and the killings are torture porn. If you liked ""Hostel"" or ""Salo"" then you would probably like this too. I consider none of these films to be ""Horror"" though. In fact I think they give the Horror genre a bad name.Mosely and Haig's acting are excellent but they don't save this film. If you consider yourself a horror fan but don't ""get"" or ""like"" torture porn, skip this one. Not only would I not consider it a classic among the likes of Argento or Fulci, I can think of MANY cheesy horror gems of the 80s that rank above this.

Ask anyone who would put this in there top 100 list for horror and it wouldn't even make it. Rob Zombie did a perfect job on his debut as a director, he chose a perfect cast, a perfect time line in the 70's, the soundtrack is great, the characters are awesome, and its funny and its something for a true horror fan. House of 1000 Corpses has that feeling to it that is disturbing and when you watch the movie it makes you want to go visit Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen. And its when you watch this movie and really look at it you start to see a lot of Rob Zombie's influences everything from the Universal Monsters to The Munsters.

I should have known better than to take a 14 year old's advice with a huge lump of salt. This has got to be hands down the biggest waste of time ever. There was no plot and the villains were pathetic. Whatever part of the movie he DIDN'T rip off from other better horror/slasher movies was just a 5th grade exercise in ""bet I can gross you out more"" The ""horror"" of rob zombie is so childish, I was laughing at how stupid it was. Unfortunately it wasn't funny enough to make up for the hour of my life I will never get back--I tried to watch the entire movie; instead I went back to Blockbuster and demanded my money back.

Instead, I left thinking ""I wasted my time on THIS??"" Sadly, the movie was filled with incoherence and monotony, instead of suspense and excitement. This movie is nothing more than a pathetic attempt at the horror genre by someone who thinks that these types of movies can be considered successful by how much blood stains there are on someone's shirt, or by the amount of disfigurements each character obtains.

709,guarrdian,Total waste of time watching this!!,2,12 August 2005,"You shithead, how can you say the music there is great!! It completely spoils the whole movie - makes it a comedy instead of a horror. It's the damned modern style of a movie - many flashes of a scary moment and simply that hectic style of progress typical for the recent movies. Too many changes from one scene to another, those slow motion passages and mainly the TERRIBLE music (kind of country), all of this and also lack of suspense contribute to comedic character of the movie and spoils its horror essence! Some of you may like it but I better recommend you not to watch it and save your time. Simply there's not consistent progress as opposed to the great 70s and 80s horror movies that are consistent and have suspense in them (Suspiria and other Argento's movies from that time).

Now, I know its typical of these movies directed by a guy called ""Rob Zombie"" to be sadistic and shocking. But this movie is overkill. I didn't like it, nor do I recommend it. See it if you've seen every other movie in the world. Or if you're a goth. I don't think this movie is aimed for a general audience, but for more sadistic psychos. Saw was a sadistic movie, and it was GREAT. But this one is so hopelessly creepy(not the good creepy) its a hard pill to swallow while watching. It just makes you sick to your stomach you don't like it. Some very gory scenes were in the movie....in the wrong way!

I spent the fist half hour hoping it would get better, this soon turned into waiting for the entire duration of the film for it to get better. I would go as far as to say it was formulaeic but no other film I can think of has used a formula this awful. The constant ripping off of other horror films (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre being the most blatantly obvious) got on my nerves at the best of times, and the constant grungy, grainy photoshop-esquire filters start to hurt the brain after about 10 seconds.

The creator of this movie must have a twisted personality and mindset. What does all of those arms, heads, legs, and bodies scattered around this death hole symbolize; the ""1000"" corpses. Give me a copy of Animal House or Blues Brothers any day!What really got me though, was that these innocent people are preyed upon by this psycho-killer who still has not been executed. Come on this movie is set in Texas, and Texas takes out any means possible to kill people guilty of extreme crimes (i.e. murder, manslaughter). I find this movie to be extremely fake. Number 1, if there was this extreme of a serial killer and the government knew about it, wouldn't they send in some sort of SWAT or military forces to obtain these people and return this location to peace. Number 2, this serial killer isn't dead yet, as the story wen't this guy was killed or they tried to kill him yet he is still alive; like I stated earlier, this is Texas and Texas has one of the cruelest death penalties within the United States.This movie was terrible, it sucked, don't watch it.",House of 1000 Corpses

Bill Moseley is the ultimate in crazy. There could not be a better person for the roll of Otis Driftwood. I also liked Karen Black and hate to hear she is not in the new ""Rejects"" movie.

718,fatgerman-1,An adolescent mishmash,1,17 November 2005,"Yes, this film tries to be a pastiche or homage to the gore-fests of the 70s but it fails on so many levels. Firstly it takes itself far too seriously to work as pastiche. Nothing about it is tongue in cheek. After the opening scene (the best in the movie by a long shot) you are left thinking that this will be an amusing and reverent homage to some of the movies that Zombie obviously loves. But then as it unfolds you realise that Zombie does not care about his characters, he does not care about making a coherent film. All he cares about is creating a gory freak show where the 'normal' people are used as slabs of meat and the freaky family are there solely for us to gawp at. If anything, most of the movie is a pastiche of its own opening scene and that's not postmodern or clever, it's just stupid.There's nothing here you haven't seen before if you've seen enough horror flicks and watched a few documentaries about serial killers. Which is basically what Rob Zombie does in his spare time, I reckon.Yes, it's supposed to be camp and base like all the best horror films, but that's no excuse for not having the skill or wit to make us care about the characters. The freaky family are too horrid, annoying, and clichéd for us to care about them. If we don't care about them why should be be horrified by what happens to them or by what they do?Yes, the film tries to create a sense of disorientation with its 'slick' editing and preference for visuals over storyline. But again that's no excuse for not caring about the storyline. The films that it borrows from all had storyline, they all had development and plot. This film has none of these. Without characters we care about, without storyline and development how can a movie engage with its audience? Only at the level of a music video. The only way this movie affects you is by shocking you with its scenes of torture and gore and the fact that anyone actually thought this was worth doing. Ultimately, it's boring unless you like the soundtrack or enjoy watching White Zombie or Marilyn Manson videos for hours at a time.Yes, there's an idea in there. I may not quite 'get it' but I can see what he was trying to do. Unfortuntately he does it with all the flair, wit, skill, and literacy of a 14 year old and that's ultimately where it failed. I'd love to see this movie re-shot by someone who knows how to make films because somewhere in the core of this dross is a pretty good horror pastiche, but in Zombie's version it's wearing the dead skin of a hundred adolescent fantasies.",House of 1000 Corpses
719,lwalton-2,one of the worst movies I have ever seen.,1,23 November 2005,"This film starts out as if it might be interesting. The first fifteen minutes you are introduced to very interesting characters. You think this could be a very entertaining movie. Surprise the first fifteen minutes are almost independent of the rest of the film. The story line is ridiculous. The events are absurd, the plot is essentially non-existent. A popular technique in art is called suspension of disbelief, a fine concept that asks you to suspend judgment and accept the story as told. You would need to be retarded (IQ lower than 70)to be able to suspend your disbelief enough to think any of this movie is plausible. Just the missing cheerleaders would have triggered 100's if not 1000's of law enforcement and volunteers, search and rescue teams, civil air patrol, and probably national guardsmen to have been combing the area. After the disappearance of law enforcement those efforts would have significantly increased. In this film school kids and cops disappear and it only rates a mention in the newspaper not any actual action. There was no reason given for the insanity of the characters, no reason for their behavior, everything appears to happen at random and the main characters are 2 dimensional killers who happen to have mental illness but are totally self sufficient and able to avoid detection by law enforcement, journalists, and other interested parties. Watching this film reminded me of ""Plan 9 from outer space"", generally considered the worst film ever made. This film gives it competition. The day after I saw this film my brother called me to complain about this complete piece of crap that he had watched last night. We had seen the same showing at the same time, we both got hooked by the intro scenes which were light years better than the rest of the film. I seriously wonder how someone could have written this story and not immediately trashed it as a terrible attempt at art. Then you've got to wonder what kind of moron would have bank rolled it, and who would have directed it. Rob Zombie makes some decent music but I wouldn't force my worst enemies to watch this obscenity. Obscenity defined as without social or cultural or artistic value.",House of 1000 Corpses

The editing, pacing, and choices of music are all very jarring and cause several scenes to conflict tonally. Sometimes I laughed out loud at parts im sure were supposed to be taken seriously, whereas jokes all fell flat. The film tries to get you to like both the victims and the family of crazies, but doesn't do a good job of fleshing anyone out or justifying anything. A movie isn't bad for being graphic, if the gratuity is justified and says something. In this, there are several random acts of violence that do nothing but make you hate the characters and wonder what in the world is going on. Thankfully the film is mercifully short, though it's apparent that some scenes were added or extended so they could just reach the feature length.

This cinematic insult makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" look like ""Citizen Kane"".I have the feeling that Mr.Zombie went on a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Top Secret"" bender and came up with this pile of fecal matter. I understand Rob's fascination with gore,blood and the like,as I have seen him perform live with his band,and they were quite good,but for the love of God,Rob,stop making movies.
