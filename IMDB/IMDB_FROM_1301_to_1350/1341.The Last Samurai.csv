0,TheLittleSongbird,Spellbinding,9,4 October 2009,"A beautifully done film, and a sweeping and spellbinding epic in every sense. The Last Samurai is exquisitely shot, with stunning locations, wonderful cinematography and well designed costumes. The music by the ever reliable Hans Zimmer is gorgeous, dramatic in the battle sequences, and poignant in the slower scenes. Speaking of the battle sequences they were extremely well staged and came across as spine tingling. The story is strong, and the performances and direction are too. I have never really liked Tom Cruise, but here he gives one of his better performances ever in this film, sometimes I forgot that it was him acting. Billy Connelly also handles his role well, though I usually associate him with comedy. However, it is indeed Ken Watanabe who captivates, and easily walks away with the acting honours. The script is well crafted, and while the Last Samurai is sometimes overly idealistic and a tad stereotypical, me and my brother cannot help deny this is a superbly shot and well performed film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Last Samurai
1,bkoganbing,The Saga of Saigo Takamori,9,19 February 2006,"Although the central character is American mercenary Tom Cruise, the story of The Last Samurai is about the little known to occidentals event of the Samurai revolt of 1877 led by Saigo Takamori who operates under a different character name and is played flawlessly by Ken Watanabe. Changing his name much like the way Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan were under different names in Inherit the Wind allowed for some dramatic and historic license.Japan was undergoing a tremendous transformation at this point in time. The United States had with Commodore Matthew Perry's voyage in 1853 opened Japan and cracked her isolationist policy. Over 200 years before the Japanese government had instigated a policy of isolationism in regard to the countries of Europe. It seems as though they looked askance at the Christian missionaries and their activities. They put an almost total embargo on trade or contact of any kind with the west.The Dutch who had very specifically not sent any missionaries to Japan were allowed some extremely limited trading rights in the city of Shiminoseki during this period. So in a limited sense the Japanese kept up with western technological developments. Firearms in fact unlike in the film were in some use in Japan even at the time of Perry's voyage. The Samurai did make some use of them.Cruise is an American Civil War and Indian War hero who's making a living shilling for the Winchester Rifle company. He gets an offer to go to Japan to train a modern army for a whole lot of money and he accepts. In between Perry's voyage and the events of this film, a new Emperor came on the throne. The Emperor Meiji was anxious indeed that his country catch up with the rest of the world and not become a colony of some modern technologically advanced western country. He also did not want to lose sight of old traditions. Duelling advisers competed for his heart and mind in the film and in real life.Cruise's trained troops the first time they're in battle with the professional samurai turn and run. He's taken prisoner, but while in captivity grows to respect and admire Watanabe and what he represents. He also falls in love with a Japanese woman and I have to say his romance made a whole lot more sense than the one John Wayne had in The Barbarian and the Geisha.The final battle scene is impressive, the samurai's own Alamo to put it in American terms. In defeat Saigo Takamori though a rebel became a folk hero in Japan. The Last Samurai is a great story and Americans should see this story about a Japan they only know from World War II films, both good and bad. Tom Cruise should be given a lot of credit for using his star power to bring this story to American audiences.",The Last Samurai
2,Leofwine_draca,Stunning war action and a hard act to follow,10,16 August 2016,"I was feeling a little disheartened about the state of the box-office in 2004; after watching RETURN OF THE KING, I knew nothing could better that movie and there was nothing really interesting on the horizon, either. Now, after watching THE LAST SAMURAI and noting the series of historical epics on the way, I'm starting to feel much, much better. THE LAST SAMURAI is a great movie, a breathtaking epic that equals Jackson's masterpiece in places, and certainly the frequent action scenes are shot in a much more violent, realistic and easier to follow way than in that fellow classic. THE LAST SAMURAI is a brilliant example of what Hollywood can do when it gets things right, recalling countless other epics such as BRAVEHEARt.The film, which is long, is slowly paced, which makes a pleasing change. There's time for scope here, plenty of characterisation, sparkling and meaningful dialogue, and a handful of characters you really get to understand and care about. Tom Cruise is basically doing his heroic self, but there's nothing wrong with that these days. This is definitely his best in terms of performance though, and he fits the role like a glove. However, this isn't a film about Cruise: instead it's a film about the Japanese, and Ken Watanabe shines in particular as the fierce, proud and deeply honourable rebel leader. Watch out for Japanese cult hero Hiroyuki Sanada, second only to Sonny Chiba in terms of bad-assedness, as a real cool warrior who nobody can beat.The trio of western actors are good, too, as is every performer in this movie. Sure, it's pretty downbeat with some tragic elements, but the action is just so breathtaking that I was moved every time. The camera-work and the sweep of the orchestral score just adds to the beautiful experience. The fights are gory, with decapitations, impalements and the like, and there are some real adrenaline-pumping scenes: a wounded Cruise fighting off half a dozen samurai; the amazing ninja attack; and most of all the final battle, which is one of the best that I've seen on the screen. A great movie and a real cinematic experience, this is definitely a hard act to follow.",The Last Samurai
3,SnoopyStyle,Acceptable but not great,6,5 April 2014,"It is 1876. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a returning veteran after slaughtering indians. He is haunted by his past, and is now a suicidal drunk hocking guns for the manufacturer. Then he is hired by the Emperor of Japan to train his troops to fight renegade samurai who opposes modernity. He is forced to send his men to battle before they are ready. Then he is taken prisoner by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).Drunk acting is arguably one of the most difficult, and Tom Cruise doesn't do it well. He overacts. One can see his acting rather than inhabiting the role. Once he is taken prisoner, the movie moves along too slowly. There is a little too much simplification. Too many minds may be the better option. However, one cannot deny the beauty of this movie. If you're looking for semi-realistic battles between samurai and ninja or samurai and civil war era soldiers. This definitely has that going for it. However there is something wrong with who the last samurai is. There is something off-putting about this movie.",The Last Samurai
4,claudio_carvalho,A Reasonable Adventure With Wonderful Photography and Arithmetic Problem,7,26 June 2004,"In 1876, the decadent and alcoholic Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a former officer from the American army, invited to train the troops of the Emperor of Japan to fight against the samurais. The Japanese troops are sent to the battle field before they are ready and Nathan is captured alive by the samurais. He stays with them in their village along a year and assimilates their culture and becomes friend of their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). On the next battle against the Emperor's army, Nathan fights in the samurais' side. This movie is a reasonable adventure, having a wonderful photography. The choice of Tom Cruise for the role of Nathan Algren does not fit well, since this character is supposed to be at least an older man. Further, with the advent of the use of computer for battle scenes, the exaggeration rules most of the present films. In this story, for example, before the last battle, Katsumoto tells Nathan that there are approximately five hundred samurais ready to fight. However, we see lots of them dying, and lots more continuing to fight, in a typical arithmetic problem. I suggest the directors of this type of movie to see the combat scene on the frozen lake filmed by Eisenstein in his 1938 `Aleksandr Nevsky' and learn how to choreograph a realistic battle scene. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): `O Último Samurai' (`The Last Samurai')",The Last Samurai
5,classicsoncall,"""I think a man does what he can until his destiny is revealed to him.""",8,19 April 2018,"The theme of honor and integrity run throughout this picture, with Tom Cruise portraying a former Civil War and Indian Wars soldier who's disillusionment with killing has stripped him of his humanity, leaving him a broken and dispirited individual. Aimless, Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise) accepts an offer to train the Japanese in the art of warfare to put down a Samurai uprising against the new Emperor's quest to modernize his country. What Algren comes to understand following his capture by the Samurai will change his life, one which will offer a renewed dedication to discipline and learning. For Tom Cruise, it's an intense role in a picture that calls to mind the 1990 Western epic ""Dances With Wolves"" in it's examination of a foreign culture and how becoming familiar with the unknown can be a life defining experience. Perhaps even more charismatic than Cruise is his opposite in the story, Ken Watanabe as the Samurai Master Katsumoto Moritsugu. From Katsumoto, Algren attains a spiritual view of life that he never had before, grounded in values deemed noble, like honor, loyalty, and personal integrity. When it comes time to test Algren's new resolve, he joins the Samurai quest to turn back the forces that would diminish or destroy an entire culture for the sake of elusive modernization and monetary gain. Perhaps most notable is the manner in which Algren earns the eventual trust and admiration of his Samurai hosts by learning the language and adopting their martial art tactics. The Samurai way is emphasized a number of times in the story with the ritual seppuku performed by General Hasegawa (Togo Igawa) following an early American defeat by the Samurai, and later on as Katsumoto accepts death as his spiritual reward on the battlefield. What influences the story most is the ever present honor among a people to maintain their traditions and way of life.",The Last Samurai
6,gavin6942,Excellent Period Piece,7,9 February 2015,"An American military adviser (Tom Cruise) embraces the Samurai culture he was hired to destroy after he is captured in battle.Say what you will about Tom Cruise. We all know that despite his popularity (or former popularity) he was never a good actor. A very successful, very highly-paid actor, but critically rather bland. This, however, is one of his more interesting roles (even if he is nothing special in it).Is this remotely historically accurate? Probably not. Granted, it has some nice touches (such as correctly calling Custer a colonel and not a general). And it showcases the samurai culture very nicely. This may be the only American film that has ever made such an attempt. (Fittingly, of course, because what American director would want to compete with Kurosawa?)",The Last Samurai
7,jboothmillard,The Last Samurai,6,21 March 2011,"I knew about this film purely because of the theme and the leading actor, and it was rated four out of five stars, so I had to try it, from director Edward Zwick (Glory, Legends of the Fall, Blood Diamond, Defiance). Basically set in Japan in the 1870's, cynical American Civilisation war veteran Nathan Algren (Golden Globe nominated Tom Cruise) works for anyone, and he finds himself hired by the Emporer of Japan. His job is to train his troops, and they will be the first army to use modern warfare, using firearms, and they will also be trying to eradicate the Imperial Samurai warriors. After a big battle or two against what are supposed to be the enemy, Algern winds up with the Samurai army, I think he is captured, and he finds himself impressed with their ways. Along the way of learning the world of the Samurai he is guided and finds friendship with the leader Katsumoto (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ken Watanabe) who spared his life. This newfound liking for the opposite side seems to place him in between two worlds and two eras, including during battle, and the only thing to guide him is his honour, which he keeps until the end when he returns to the Americans, seemingly as The Last Samurai. Also starring Timothy Spall as Simon Graham, Billy Connolly as Zebulon Gant, Tony Goldwyn as Colonel Bagley, Hiroyuki Sanada as Ujio, Koyuki as Taka, Shichinosuke Nakamura as Emperor Meiji and Shun Sugata as Nakao. Cruise is noble and cool throughout, and from what I remember Watanabe is certainly a worthy award nominee, I may not have understood all the story, but for all the battle sequences and the really good costumes and scenery it is a worthwhile period action drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Hans Zimmer. Good!",The Last Samurai
8,rmax304823,Generic.,6,28 December 2010,"In 1990 ""Dances With Wolves"" was released. It was about an officer who fought the Indians on the plains in the 1870s, became disgusted with the war, and joined the Indians, learning their language, their culture, their mystical ways. It garnered all sorts of critical praise and commercial rewards.In 2003 there appeared ""The Last Samurai."" It's about an officer who fought the Indians on the plains in the 1870s, became disgusted with the war, and joined the Japanese fundamentalists, learning their language, their culture, their mystical ways. Maybe it garnered one kudos less but it still made money. Thirteen years is an eternity in the minds of many.But ""Dances With Wolves"" isn't the only model for this film. There have been numerous others in which an American or European it swept up in an alien culture and discovers its hidden virtues. The vices are ignored or minimized. In ""Broken Arrow,"" it was Jimmy Stewart. In ""A Man Called Horse"" it was Richard Harris. In ""Black Rain"" and ""The Yakuza,"" Michael Douglas and Robert Mitchum, respectively, learned all about honor from the Japanese.There's usually a good-looking woman in the alien culture. The native beauty serves a couple of purposes. (1) She provides a focus for those in the audience looking more for romance than blood; ie., the female audience. (2) A chance for a little nudity and simulated sex for the men. (3) She serves as an index of the white guy's integration into the alien community. (4) She's there to demonstrate that, by falling in love with her, our boy is not a racist.Tom Cruise is hired by the Japanese court to train civilians in the use of guns so they can put down a nativistic rebellion of a group governed by the code of the Samurai. After a clash with the rebels, Cruise is captured and harshly indoctrinated. He proves his worth. All the generic conventions apply.I didn't stick around until the end because another officer in the US Army, about half way through, shows Cruise the new model of the Gatling gun -- two hundred round per minute and it doesn't jam. The rebels are armed only with swords and bows and arrows. I could see some unpleasant scenes in the offing. I quit watching when Cruise made an ominous reference to Thermopylae.Maybe I was wrong and the rebels, whom we've come to respect and admire, didn't get slaughtered. However, that would be going against the generic current. It would take the inner gyroscope of a Samurai to do that and I don't think this movie has the guts.",The Last Samurai
9,Tweekums,Tom Cruise becomes a samurai warrior,8,8 May 2016,"By 1876 Captain Nathan Algren, a decorated hero of the American Civil War, has become an alcoholic; haunted by the atrocities to took part in against the Native Americans. He is making a living helping to sell rifles until he is offered a position helping to train the Japanese army who are trying to put down a rebellion by the few remaining samurai. These warriors cling to the old ways and fight with traditional weapons but can't admit that their time is over. Algren quickly sees that the Japanese conscripts he is training aren't ready to fight but they are ordered into battle anyway. He joins then and after they are routed he is captured by the samurai leader, Katsumoto. He is nursed back to health and over the course of the winter he goes to respect Katsumoto, his samurais and their way of life; so much to that he lays down his guns and takes up the samurai sword to fight with them even though he knows that ultimately they cannot win.This might not be an historically accurate film but it is still gripping. The action scenes are very impressive and feel real as men with swords go up against men with guns. Tom Cruise is on top form as Capt. Algren and Ken Watanabe excels as Katsumoto; an honourable man who continues his fight even though he is fully aware that it isn't a fight he can win. The growing friendship between these two characters is a joy to watch. The rest of the cast were good too; I especially liked Timothy Spall's appearance as an English translator/photographer and Billy Connolly's cameo as Algren's friend Sgt Gant. The New Zealand scenery, filling in for Japan, looks stunning without detracting from the story we are watching. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the stars or those wanting a gripping war film with some great action scenes and a fine plot.",The Last Samurai

11,dbdumonteil,the adventures of Tom Cruise in Japan,5,3 May 2006,"1876. A hero of the American Civil War, the general Nathan Algren (played by the famous star whom it is useless to introduce) has however a strong bias for alcohol and is haunted by his murky past. However he is given the chance to start a new life in Japan where he has to command the army of the Japanese emperor who wishes to modernize his country. It is however more his counselor Omura who guides him in his choices and decisions. One day, Algren's army is slaughtered by a platoon of samurais. Algren becomes prisoner of them and is taken to their village. At first mistrustful because he is in a state of captivity, he ends up embracing the samurai way of life and gaining the friendship of the chief Katsumoto, apparently mesmerized by this bearded stranger with long hair with whom he thinks he has a lot to learn. Alas, the emperor (or rather Omura) wants to put an end to this archaic way of life and endeavors of negotiation with Katsumoto come to nothing. The samurai chief decides to attack maybe for the last time the army of the emperor now under Grant's command and as for Algren, he's stuck between a rock and a hard place...Japan exerts a vivacious fascination on American cinema these last years and of course the Hollywood industry couldn't resist it. One year before ""the Last Samurai"" opened, Gore Verbinski made a remake of ""the Ring"" with satisfying results. Would this fascination serve to conceal a block from the most famous cinematographic firm in the world supposed to convey dream and escape? Here, if one goes on uncharted waters or rather uncharted lands at the level of the backdrop, one can't say the same thing for a story which is academic to a fault and to a film full of tasty tastelessness. I don't want to be malicious towards Edward Zwick but it seems to me that his scenario (even with the help of two partners) is like a catalog of clichés and commonplaces about several points. Just check the persona of Algren and his adventures: alcoholic, a mind eaten by past demons, a chance to redeem himself and to find a new sense to his stranded life by adapting to the samurai way of life which he embraces with pleasure and fascination. Then, after the emperor's denial to negotiate with Katsumoto, he's haunted by the sense of honor and sacrifice. So guess what camp he will choose. I forgot that there was also the obligatory idyllic love affair between him and the Japanese inhabitant which put him up under her roof. The story has unfortunately a stale Hollywood whiff which pervades the whole film and makes it formulaic from the first to the last image. I must say that I began to stay out of the film very quickly.Apart from being compelled to the Hollywood codes and trademarks, the story also partly acts as a pretext to make the audience discover the treasures and secrets of the samurai way of life (Cruise is the intermediary between the two faces of Japan the film presents) but I must say that there's absolutely nothing wrong about it if one has kept his sensitivity and his thirst for knowledge about different peoples with different cultures. Zwick and Cruise manage to make us share their fascination for this ancient culture in which silence, patience and wisdom help to an improvement of one's personality.But some qualities emerge of this linear story and this spate of clichés. The cinematography is clean, splendid. The fighting and war sequences are superbly organized and filmed and momentarily get the film out of its lethargy even if the final combat through its organization smells the reheated but Zwick tried to insert at all costs a happy-end to stop the film to end in a bitter way. Given the weight of this happy-end it's an artificial way to end his film.""The Last Samurai"" is also handicapped by weak dialogs and his main star. Tom Cruise is as expressive as a brick wall, except in the sequences when he is supposed to be in anger. Then, he manages to shade his acting. His partners aren't well served because they have to act cardboard characters. Only Ken Watanabe, through the intensity of his looks and the eloquence of his lines is the stand-out of a lackluster cast. He even beats Cruise hands down.So, ""the Last Samurai"" will appeal to you if: a) you are interested in Japanese culture b) you are a Tom Cruise devotee c) you are deeply attached to the standards of the Hollywood industry.The others can easily do without it.",The Last Samurai

13,Coventry,"Routine heroic stuff...Same old stuff, different setting",5,24 January 2004,"I usually get a stomach ache of these overbudgetted and overhyped heroic epics. They often are too loud, too long and especially way too fake. Big budget-stuff with a bunch of unnecessary moral and side plots. The Last Samurai is no exception to this. It's a very pretty decorated, but empty package. Like Braveheart...like Gladiator...only this time is set in the late 18th century Japan. These movies certainly are worth wating if you enjoy breath-taking locations and terrific sound and visual effects. These aspects are ALWAYS superior to the story. The history lesson it tries to tell is loosely based on true events but to please and gain a huge audience, they're throwing in the life story of a fed up American Captain ( Tom Cruise ), a forced romance and a lot of pathetic family values and 'codes of loyalty'. I have to reckon that the battle sequences in The Last Samurai are exiting, though. There's a good amount of blood shed and the chopped off limbs are flying from one side of the screen to the other. That's the least thing you expect from an historical epic, no? It's a real shame that the story which connects these battles is so lame. What I really don't understand is that Cruise is tipped as an important Oscar candidate this year, 2003?!? I thought that he overacted terribly (like he usually does) and that his performance was nowhere near interesting. The British comedian Billy Connely does a much better job, I think. Too bad his character dies really early...The largest part of the characters in The Last Samurai are uninspired and not very believable or convincing. In general, the entire production lacks a few aspects to become as successful as Braveheart or other epics, but it certainly fits into the same category. Well made but mainstream stuff intended to make profit The occasional film fan loves this, but the more developed cinema freak is far from impressed.",The Last Samurai

I know nothing about Samurai history; let alone ancient Japanese history. I'm not even a Tom Cruise fan, but he gives up every ounce he has to give in THE LAST SAMURAI. Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War hero down and out traveling making money on his fame until he is offered $500 a month to go to Japan to revise an untrained army. In no way picking the battle, Algren will fight against a Samurai and after being captured ends up pledging himself to the cause of Samurai Katsomoto(Ken Watanabe), who is bravely facing a vanishing way of life.Beautiful photography. Intensely graphic battle scenes. A romantic vision of a dying way of life and an emotional birth of a modernized Japan. Astonishing direction from Edward Zwick. Cruise may be at his very best to date. Watanabe is strong as the fearless Japanese warrior. THE LAST SAMURAI is an epic in every sense and is well worth the 154 minutes you invest.

15,sunwarrior13,The History Of Japan During The 1800's,9,9 October 2011,"The Last Samurai is a 2003 American epic drama film co-produced,written and directed by Edward Zwick.It is a story of an American military adviser that embraces the Samurai culture after he was hired to destroy it after he is captured in battle. The film stars Tom Cruise in the role of Nathan Algren, whose personal and emotional conflicts bring him into contact with samurai warriors during the wake of the Meiji Restoration in the Empire of Japan.Other actors include Ken Watanabe, Shin Koyamada, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada, Timothy Spall, and Billy Connolly.The film begins with Captain Nathan Algren,an ex-Army captain and an alcoholic,is traumatized by his experience fighting in the Civil War.In the years following his service,he makes his living by relating war stories to gun show audiences in San Francisco.It is an experience which further hampers his mental state.After his employer fires him, he is forced to accept an invitation by his former commanding officer Colonel Bagley(Tony Goldwyn),whom he has a feeling of hatred. Bagley approaches him with an offer on behalf of a Japanese businessman, Mr. Omura (Masato Harada), to help train the new Western-style Imperial Japanese Army. Assisting them are Algren's old army colleague Sergeant Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly) and Simon Graham (Timothy Spall).Under the command of Bagley, Algren and his companions travel to Japan. The newly-formed Japanese Army is a poorly-trained and equipped conscripted army of peasants totally lacking in combat experience. He does his best to remedy this, but before the men are trained to his satisfaction Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) attacks a railroad outside his province. Then,Bagley orders him to lead the inexperienced conscripts to engage Katsumoto. He then points out the army's inexperience and inadequate training. But Bagley dismisses his concerns and then orders a regiment to track down and engage Katsumoto. Yet when his ill-prepared superior force sets out too soon, their panic allows the sword-wielding samurai to crush them. Badly wounded Algren's courageous stand makes the samurai leader spare his life.Once nursed to health he learns to know and respect the old Japanese way, and participates as adviser.The acting in the movie is outstanding especially with Ken Watanabe as the samurai leader Katsumoto.He truly deserves the numerous nominations that he got from this movie.Aside from that,the movie is written very well as the history of the samurai is presented in way far from what normally people perceive them.Aside from that,the production values and battle scenes are worth mentioning.Overall,this movie presents the history of Japan in the 1800's with the ways of the samurai in particular.Highly recommended for people who loves movies about history and Japan.",The Last Samurai
16,LeonLouisRicci,Ambitious to a Fault,7,20 May 2013,"There are some stunning scenes and some nice introspective aspects to this Movie but it may have been just a bit too far reaching and self-conscious to be anything more than a somewhat exciting clash of cultures. The ending may be a tough watch for some and destroy most of what came before.Most of the outstanding parts of the Movie are the quieter ones. But there is one battle scene that starts things in motion that has an eerie, alternate feel that is lacking in the final epic confrontation. This is a complicated Story that is given a good try here but it always seems to push it one beat too far.It is an entertaining, if shallow, attempt to include an Historical paradigm change that is difficult to say the least. There are some touching and dramatic parts and some good Action staging, but in the end it is too ambitious in its many themes that most, but not all, are rendered flaccid, forced and faked.Worth a view in a Movie kind of sprawling escapism, but will no doubt trouble Historians and sticklers for a more accurate and profound rendering of these deep and rich Cultural themes.",The Last Samurai

It mixes truth with fiction in a clever, unsentimental manner - Watanabe's performance is considered and engaging as the man on the cusp of a new era which neither he, nor his people, want or understand. Cruise is clearly the man behind the concept and is to be commended for bringing this gloriously good looking story to the screen; he is not, however, especially good in the lead - the part calls for a sophistication that he, as an actor, simply doesn't possess. There is also a curious role for Scots comedian/actor Billy Connolly who originally enlists ""Algren"" to the cause - with an accent that is all over the place. Masato Harada delivers well as the devious Minister who, in his own way, wants his society to adapt and flourish and Shichinosuke Nakamura gives the person of the Meiji emperor a caring, aspirational vulnerability that helps give the whole film a sense of truth and authenticity. The technical standards - especially during the frequently brutal battle scene are consistently high.",The Last Samurai
18,Boba_Fett1138,The true meaning of honor.,10,14 September 2005,"Quite honestly, I didn't expected very much from this movie when I first saw it. Like so many others I expected a sort of ""Braveheart"" with Samurai swords. The movie however turned out to be so much more than just another 'epic' historical movie. The story is told with almost poetic beauty and lots of visual splendor.This movie also made me realize what true honor is. I understood why it was regarded as a beautiful thing for the Samurai to die on the battlefield and that death is not something that you have to fear. I finally understand the real meaning of dying with honor now. This is thanks to the way the story is told. It takes it time slowly, to explain the way of the Samurai and in the end you really feel somehow related, fully understanding and emotional involved with them.Visually this movie is also a beautiful one. With ""The Thin Red Line"" director of photography John Toll already showed that he can beautifully handle poetic movies and with this movie he shows that once again. You can tell that lots of talent was involved behind the camera's. The art direction, costume design, every thing adds to the beauty and perfection of the movie. The movie is directed by Edward Zwick, who with ""Glory"" already showed how well he can handle this genre. Just like ""Glory"" this movie has its over-the-top moments but also just like in ""Glory"" its done so beautifully that it not becomes a complaint.Unlike many others at the moment, I'm really a fan of Tom Cruise. I mean this guy is basically the best action-movie star at the moment. He has got the right looks and on top of that he truly is one great actor, which he already has shown on several occasions. Also in this movie he is the perfect leading man. Another fine role is portrayed by Ken Watanabe, who even received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. A bit too much credit perhaps but it doesn't take away that he plays his role perfectly.But the movie is not just only beauty, it also is quite action packed and features some nicely filmed battle sequences and a spectacular finale.The musical score by Hans Zimmer and friends also adds to the beauty of the movie and is quite underrated in terms of how well known it is.A splendid looking, almost poetic like movie with still plenty of spectacular moments to also entertain and captivated the more 'casual viewer'.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Last Samurai
19,view_and_review,It made me a believer,9,3 January 2005,"I must say that I watched this movie with nothing but skepticism and I only watched it because my mother said it was good. I remained skeptical for the first 20 minutes or so. I thought that some white guy was going to stroll into Japan, whoop up some highly skilled Samarui warriors, become a Samurai himself and then be their greatest leader ever.Well, it did not go down like that, and I'm pleased it did not. In fact it was quite the opposite. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) was teacher turned student as he had to be humbled by his captors. He learned a lot more than just how to sword fight, he learned honor, respect, humility, and a lot more intangibles that make a people wholesome and good.I was converted, and for that reason I have to rate this movie high. I never was a Tom Cruise fan, but the last three movies of his I saw (Minority Report, The Last Samurai, and Collateral) have given me a change of heart towards him as an actor.",The Last Samurai
20,neil-476,Multilayered,9,29 May 2010,"On its simplest level, The Last Samurai is a straightforward story, well told, of a damaged man trapped by circumstances in a culture clash which changes him profoundly.But this is just one of many layers. There is the political story of late 19th century Japan, still essentially feudal in nature, beginning to interact with the western world. There is Cruise's voyage of discovery and redemption, but there are also the stories of Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and Taka (Koyuki). There is the story of culture clash - explored in Shogun, and still fascinating here. There is the spectacle of battle.And all this is told wonderfully visually, with excellent performances from all concerned - the performance of the nervous Japanese soldier being told by Cruise to shoot him is as well measured as Cruise's own. The film looks good, is gripping throughout, well paced, and moving.One of the best films of its time.",The Last Samurai
21,evanston_dad,A Good Movie Turned Bad,4,29 April 2005,"How disappointing that ""The Last Samurai"" becomes dreadful in its last half, because the first half is quite engaging. This movie is what results when a director with left-leaning sensibilities tries to make a liberal-minded ""message"" movie without the courage of his own convictions. So the movie is not content to merely show us the crisis facing the Samurai in the face of westernization and letting our sympathies lie with them....Oh no, fearful that an American audience would not take to a film centered around Japanese characters, we have to have a white, hot-shot Hollywood actor to root for, who sweeps in to be our hero. We get a token Japanese hero to root for as well, but guess who remains living at the end of the film? Didn't Kevin Costner already make this movie? Tom Cruise's heart is obviously in the right place. He gives an incredibly earnest performance...and that's part of the problem. He's SO earnest that I never forgot for a second that I was watching Tom Cruise, Mr. Hollywood A-List, feeling self-important for attaching himself to such an important film. Ken Watanabe received heaps of praise for his performance, but I fail to see what the hype is about. And the obligatory love story is just silly---obviously, the movie makers thought so too, because they make only a half-hearted attempt to develop it in the first place.I loved the message in ""The Last Samurai,"" but I hated the approach taken to the material. It's yet one more movie in which the creators give the audience not one single amount of credit for having a brain; emotions are force-fed to us through superficial means like slow-motion and thundering music. Not comfortable with any amount of ambiguity, all of the Americans except for Tom Cruise have to be evil, and all of the Samurai have to be entirely noble. The film inadvertently makes the point that killing someone with a sword or a bow and arrow makes you a better person than killing someone with a gun, conveniently sidestepping the fact that killing is killing, regardless of how it's done.My summary: a pretty film with not a brain in its head.Grade: C-",The Last Samurai
22,Uriah43,A Very Entertaining Action Film,8,12 April 2017,"This film begins in 1876 with a Samurai warlord by the name of ""Katsumoto"" (Ken Watanabe) meditating on a hill in Japan and having an eerie vision of a white tiger fighting for its life in an extremely fierce and desperate battle. The scene then shifts to a small town in America where a Medal-of-Honor winner named ""Captain Nathan Algren"" (Tom Cruise) is demonstrating to the crowd the capabilities of a brand new Winchester repeating rifle. Not long afterward he is recruited to come to Japan to teach Japanese soldiers how to fight using Western weapons and techniques to be used primarily against an internal rebellion of Samurai warriors led by none other than--Katsumoto. Accompanying him is a former commander he intensely dislikes by the name of ""Colonel Bagley"" (Tony Goldwyn) along with a respected comrade-in-arms named ""Sergeant Zebulon Gant"" (Billy Connolly). Yet, even though he is strictly a military adviser it is only a matter of time before Captain Algren and his raw recruits meet Katsumoto and his highly-skilled samurai on the field of battle-and neither of them will be the same afterward. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very entertaining action film which managed to capture the turmoil and anguish brought on by the Meiji Restoration in a superb manner. Likewise, the performances of Ken Watanable and Tom Cruise were also first-rate as well. In short, I enjoyed this film and I definitely recommend it to those who might be interested.",The Last Samurai
23,ferguson-6,Neither the perfect bloom nor great conversation,6,14 December 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  I believe this movie is getting such rave reviews because it has the look and feel of a great movie.  Definitely even ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  The mysticism is missing.  I did see this in digital projection, rather than film, and the colors seemed to leap off the screen - especially the sky and landscape.  The one thing that prevented this from being a great movie is Tom Cruise.  He is the only out-of-place thing in the film.  Ken Watanabe is wonderful and the stunning Koyuki (as Taka) leaves the audience breathless in numerous scenes.  Even Tony Goldwyn smirks his way to the desired level of arrogance.  Cruise, on the other hand, is soul-less in his role as a drunken war hero/samurai-wannabe.  One of the most absurd moments I have ever seen on screen is when he appears in the doorway wearing the samurai armour.  Yes I understand the poignancy of the moment ... it just doesn't work.  Cruise's performance reminds me of another over-hyped performance from this season's crop of blockbusters.  Russell Crowe in ""Master and Commander"" is equal to Cruise in his desire to be a movie star, rather than an actor.  The story and character should make the movie - not the celebrity.  I am not sure how much fault to lay on director Edward Zwick.  He seems to have peaked with ""About Last Night"" and TV's ""thirtysomething"", but this movie is just beautiful and might have worked, if not for Cruise.  Very interesting to see an almost unrecognizable Scott Wilson (""The Right Stuff"") as a U.S. ambassador.  Anyway, I am always disappointed when a movie doesn't reach its potential, and ""The Last Samurai"" left me feeling empty, not fulfilled.",The Last Samurai
24,anaconda-40658,Well Done but Full of Clichés.,6,4 February 2016,"The Last Samurai (2003): Dir: Edward Zwick / Cast: Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Timothy Spall: Epic action film that educates viewers on the meaning of samurai. It means to serve and Tom Cruise is sighted as the last server. He is assigned to train soldiers in a war against samurai warriors but they are not ready. Waging into war he watches his troops get demolished until he sinks into exhaustion. Strangely he is treated with respect and wanders freely about a village with an overseer. Although he challenges the leader he comes to realize that the so-called enemies are actually peaceful. Fine setup falls into clichés before its predicted battle where Cruise really becomes the last Samurai. Director Edward Zwick presents great sword play action but the screenplay is weak and seems to xerox the same clichés that are common with these films. Cruise is strong but Ken Watanabe delivers the strongest performance as the samurai leader. Where the film goes off track is when it sidelines its themes for a mindless climax that serves mainly as an action set piece. Also with Billy Connolly and Tony Goldwyn in flat roles that amount to nothing. Technically well made film that dapples between theme and message although the lifestyle of the Samurai at least render a point of view. Despite action clichés the film gives insight upon those who oppress us. Score: 6 / 10",The Last Samurai
25,Wuchakk,"Likable, but Lacks Originality",5,12 March 2014,"""The Last Samurai"" is a story about a Civil War veteran who goes over to Japan to fight the last pocket of Samurai; he is taken captive by the Samurai, but eventually learns to respect this dying culture and adapt to their way of life.WHAT WORKS: The movie is beautiful to look at; the cinematography is magnificent. The story is generally engrossing and it's great to envision how the Samurai may have really lived in Japan hundreds of years ago. Speaking of which, the costumes and sets are outstanding, no doubt about it.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I enjoyed the movie, I did, but the plot is obviously taken from ""Dances With Wolves,"" a very superior film. One could also cite ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Last of the Dogmen"" as films with similar plots. (Although ""Dogmen"" is basically a rip-off of ""Dances With Wolves,"" the story takes place in the modern world, so it definitely possesses its own uniqueness). The scene in ""Samurai"" where the Samurai make their first dramatic appearance is obviously ripped-off straight from a similar scene in ""Dogmen"" wherein the Indians make their first appearance (compare the two scenes for verification).The score in the film is certainly serviceable but parts of it painfully sound like a watered-down variation of the fabulous score from ""The Last of the Mohicans."" BOTTOM LINE: Although ""The Last Samurai"" could be subtitled ""Dances with the Last Dogmen of Arabia,"" it's still quite enjoyable. People who have not seen these other four movies that so-obviously influenced ""Samurai"" will likely rate ""The Last Samurai"" higher than I have. If you really like this film and haven't seen these other movies I've mentioned, I encourage you to pick 'em up ASAP -- especially ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Dances With Wolves,"" which are two of the best movies ever filmed, period.GRADE: C+",The Last Samurai

It also promises at least one epic battle scene, and surely delivers on that note as well.But I appreciated this movie far more during the quiet moments, when Cruise is held captive by his enemies and forced to learn about the samurai ways. It's his scenes with Ken Watanabe that are really worth the price of admission. They're heartfelt as the two warriors learn to appreciate the simple act of conversation.It's brutal, it's violent, but also just as beautiful as the scenery.",The Last Samurai

30,JamesHitchcock,"Historically Dubious, Morally Flawed",5,4 February 2004,"The power of stardom! A civil war in 1870s Japan is not, one can safely assume, a likely subject for a major Hollywood epic. The part played by Tom Cruise in a civil war in 1870s Japan? Now that's a different matter.Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a veteran of the Civil War and Indian Wars, who has become a cynical, disillusioned alcoholic after his part in the massacre of a peaceful American Indian village. He accepts an offer from the Japanese government to train the new Japanese army in the arts of modern warfare, and becomes embroiled in a civil war fought between that army and a rebel force led by the samurai warrior Katsumoto. Although the rebels are only armed with swords and bows, they are at first more than able to hold their own against the poorly trained, inexperienced government conscripts, and in the first battle Algren is taken prisoner. He is held captive in Katsumoto's remote native village, and gradually comes to admire the samurai and their traditional way of life. So much so, in fact, that he commits himself to their cause and fights alongside them against his former comrades.There are many good things about this film. The set-piece battle sequences are well done and much of the film is shot against spectacularly beautiful scenery (actually in New Zealand rather than Japan; after its performances here and in the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy, the New Zealand landscape deserves a special Oscar for `best newcomer'). Although Cruise tends to over-act, there are some very good acting performances, particularly from the Japanese members of the cast. Ken Watanabe brings both intelligence and dignity to his portrayal of Katsumoto, and Koyuki is luminously beautiful as Taka, the young woman whose husband is killed by Algren in battle but who later falls platonically in love with him.The film does, however, suffer from one fatal flaw. Unless it has an overt anti-war message, a war film needs to gain the sympathies of the audience for one side or their cause. Edward Zwick clearly understood this when making his earlier excellent war films `Glory' and `Courage Under Fire', but seems to have forgotten it since. Although `The Last Samurai' obviously invites its audience to sympathise with Katsumoto and Algren, it never gives them any real reason to do so. In reality, of course, the samurai who rebelled against the Japanese government did so because they were a ruling feudal aristocracy who feared that any change in the social order would endanger their power, wealth and prestige. No such base motives, however, are ascribed to Katsumoto; instead, he seems to be motivated by a preference for the old over the modern (traditional Japanese crafts are much in evidence in his village) and a distaste for recent innovations such as railways and Western dress. (He takes his medievalism to such an extent that he even forbids his followers to use guns, although firearms had been part of the Japanese soldier's equipment ever since they were introduced by Europeans in the sixteenth century). A British parallel might be if William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement had spearheaded an armed insurrection against Gladstone's government with a view to undoing the Industrial Revolution.Indeed, the impression is given at times that Katsumoto is simply a rebel without a cause. Those who see death in battle as the highest honour (as he does) do not need a cause in order to fight. Much is made of the rebels' (and Algren's) sense of `honour', but no attempt is made to analyse the moral complexities of this particular concept, which can be used as the basis of an alternative morality in opposition to more orthodox ideas of right and wrong. Just as the gentlemen of eighteenth century England saw nothing wrong in fighting duels over points of honour, despite the fact that duelling was both illegal and contrary to Christian teaching, so Katsumoto uses honour to justify his bellicose lifestyle in defiance of both the laws of his country and the ideals of the Buddhist faith he nominally follows.No doubt Katsumoto's rebellion makes sense in the context of his particular cultural background, and Algren's decision to support him makes sense in the context of his particular psychology; he hopes to atone for his crimes in the Indian wars by fighting alongside the underdogs in another war. Those of us, however, who are neither Japanese samurai nor conscience-stricken war criminals (and I suspect we will make up the majority of the audience) will have little sympathy with the rebels. My own sympathies were with the poor bloody infantry, the government conscripts killed because they stood in the way of Katsumoto's vision of Japan as a medieval theme park, and even with the leader of the government forces, the politician Omura. Although he is portrayed as corrupt and incompetent, Omura represents, however imperfectly, the nobler vision many Japanese of the period had for their country as a peaceful, prosperous constitutional monarchy.There is a chilling ending to the film. The Emperor Meiji, hitherto portrayed as weak and indecisive, announces that in future Japan will combine Western innovations with traditional samurai values. The filmmakers present this as a posthumous triumph for Katsumoto's spirit; they seem quite unaware that it was precisely this combination of modern technology with an archaic warrior code that was to lead Japan over the next few decades to become an aggressive menace to its neighbours. Despite some good qualities, this is a historically dubious and morally flawed film which at times comes close to justifying war for war's sake. 5/10",The Last Samurai

32,=G=,The usual.,7,5 May 2004,"In ""The Last Samurai"", Cruise is a burned out ex-soldier (circa 1870's) who's crawled into a whiskey bottle to escape the guilt he feels for having seen it all, done it all, etc., at the Little Big Horn, etc...blaa, blaa. To pull down some big bucks, he signs on as a mercenary to help Japan get rid of a bunch of Samurais who, for reasons unknown, try to kill the modern Japanese army even though Samurais are peaceful warriors who only fight at the Emperor's command, etc...blaa, blaa. Cruise decides the way of the Samurai is for him because they dig cherry blossoms and mysteriously answer all questions with questions and Americans kill Indian women and children. So, Cruise, who magically learns the Japanese language in less than a semester, gets his mojo going and sets about to make war with the Japanese imperial army and....blaa, blaaa...hence, the title. Things you should know include: 40% of the dialogue is Japanese and that means subtitles. Also, the film is 2.5 hours long (seems longer). When all is said and done,  ""The Last Samurai"" is a pop top Hollywood product complete with hype, an over-rated centerpiece (Cruise), lots of mediocre epic action, and a token hottie. In other words, a typical blockbuster. No more, no less. (B)",The Last Samurai
33,MovieAddict2016,"A rather good story reminiscent of ""Little Big Man,"" although not quite as good...",5,21 January 2004,"After watching ""Little Big Man"" and ""The Last Samurai"" within a week of each other, it seems as though they are both very similar. A man is taken in by another culture, then freed and decides to defend them out of his own free will. Both films bash Custer, too. Edward D. Zwick, the man behind ""Glory"" and ""Legends of the Fall"", directs the latter of the two before mentioned films. Here he creates a good -- although long -- portrait of one man who joined a war not many people know about. It's not a great movie, but it's certainly a good one.The hero is played by Tom Cruise. His name is Nathan Algren, and he is a Civil War hero who is paid to read lines on stage in the year 1876, fascinating onlookers with his knowledge and tales of the war -- when he's not drunk, that is. When his performance is noticed by Sgt. Zebulah Grant (Billy Connolly), he is offered a job to travel to Japan and train hundreds of soldiers in the art of war. Why? Because the emperor of the country wants to modernize Japan, but a band of Samurai are rebelling. They need to be fought, but Japan's soldiers have no knowledge of modern weapons. Nathan does.During a battle between the Samurai and Nathan's battle, he shows great courage and honor and is taken hostage by the Samurai, falling under the care of Taka (Koyuki), whose husband was killed by Nathan in a bloody showdown. The Samurai leader, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), is impressed by Nathan and their ""good conversations,"" and decides to train him in the way of the Samurai.Nathan falls in love (one of the biggest clichés of film history) with Taka, although the romance never goes over the top, which was a pleasant relief.But when Col. Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn) leads an army of Japanese into battle against the Samurai, Nathan has to ask himself whom he will fight for. The answer is somewhat predictable by any standard, and the ending is somewhat ridiculous, but it's a good film and certainly one worth seeing if you enjoy war films.I've never been impressed by Tom Cruise, mainly because I've never seen him stretch his roles. ""Rain Man"" is one of my favorite performances, but Cruise plays Cruise. In ""The Firm,"" Cruise plays Cruise. In ""Top Gun,"" Cruise plays Cruise. And now, in ""The Last Samurai,"" Cruise once again plays Cruise. But at least he manages to do more than a few different facial expressions in this -- he's now added angry and sad to his list. In fact, Cruise does quite well here. The thing is, he has yet to impress me by playing someone...different. When someone can play an entirely different person (like Hoffman in ""Rain Man"") and convince me that they are no longer that familiar actor, it's always a great sign. I wish Cruise would try a more daring film role for once.Tony Goldwyn, who has always played good villains, is perfect here -- really annoying with an evil-like voice that's actually just bland. It gets on your nerves, which is a good thing. If he had played the hero, I would have left the theater. (Or come pretty close to doing that. I've never left a theater, and I never plan to.)Ken Watanabe, who is receiving generous acclaim for his role, is pretty good -- although I wouldn't say that his performance is deserving of an Oscar.
Zwick's downfall here is that he sometimes tries a bit too hard. He had tried to turn ""The Last Samurai"" into both a political message and a rousing epic, but when compared to something such as ""Braveheart,"" it fails miserably. I didn't feel very much for Cruise's character here. And there are too many unneeded scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor.And while I'm picking on the movie, another thing I noticed is that the dialogue is sometimes corny and rather dumb. ""Tell me how he died,"" an emperor asks Nathan. ""I'll tell you how he lived,"" Nathan replies. Seriously, it's just a bit too heavy on the cornball moments sometimes. And are we supposed to believe that Nathan would really survive a Samurai attack, then a battle against an army of Japanese soldiers with guns and cannons, left to be THE last man on the battlefield (hence the title)?But the battle scenes are, for the most part, quite exhilarating; the acting is very good (although I still don't think Cruise has stretched very far from his other roles), and the direction fine. The two factors that reduced this from a great rating to a very good one are the length and sometimes quite silly dialogue. If you can stomach those two things, check out ""The Last Samurai.""4/5 stars.John Ulmer",The Last Samurai

35,KineticSeoul,Excellent fantasy film!,10,19 February 2016,"This isn't a very accurate historical movie and not because it has a white guy playing the Last Samurai. But it's a riveting movie, that has depth and a style that sticks. I remember watching this in theaters and being blown away by how immersive and entertaining this film was at that time. I still watch it from time to time and just doesn't seem to get old. I love films, but a film has to be exceptionally good for me to revisit and check out all over again. And like I said, I watched this movie multiple times. It's like a fantasy movie with historical elements coming to life. And when I mean fantasy, I mean the way they portrayed the samurais in this. They really tried to over glorify and glamorize the samurai and their way of life. It made it appear more like a samurai anime over real samurais in japan at the time. Like they only cared about honor over hierarchy and power. The armor, appearance and the way they dressed was off as well. Yoji Yamada's Samurai Trilogy is a more realistic portrayal of samurais. But that is just what it is, it's a samurai fantasy movie and it's very entertaining to sit through. The film is over about 2 hours and 30 minutes long but feels like a 1 and a half film. While the story being inspired by a real historical figure Jules Brunet, it doesn't even touches the surface when it comes to that area. Watching this is sort of like watching a epic ""300"" movie. Except with more immersive and heartfelt story that strays away from it just being about the action and violence with more character development. Tom Cruise is outstanding in this and was at the time the perfect guy to play the lead role as the emotionally damaged character named Nathan Algren. Who is a captain in this story that fought against the Indians and has guilt trips about it all. This was the breakout role for Ken Watanabe who plays the supporting character in this. As katsumoto who is the leader of the samurais, he brings about charisma and standout presence when he is on screen. Some say this is like ""Dances with Wolves"" except with samurais. However I liked this film more. This is a emotional film about code and honor, that pierces through the screen and has an affect like Hayao Miyazaki films. 10/10",The Last Samurai
36,sddavis63,A Great Movie That Borrows A Bit Too Heavily,8,11 January 2008,"After the first half hour or so, I have to admit that I was very disappointed with this movie. It seemed as though we were being treated to a remake of Edward Zwick's earlier (and magnificent) Civil War movie ""Glory."" Several of the scenes seemed lifted almost word for word and action by action from that script. Think about it: the young officer (Algren, played by Tom Cruise) tormented by his memories of past battles (like Shaw in ""Glory""); the training scene in which Algren demands that the inexperienced Japanese soldier shoot under fire (as Shaw did with Jupiter in ""Glory""); the Samurai emerging from the fog to take on the inexperienced Japanese army (as the Confederates did in taking on the 54th Massachussetts in ""Glory""). ""Glory"" was a great movie, but I really wasn't looking for it to be refilmed in the context of a Japanese civil war. Fortunately after that first half hour the overt references to Zwick's earlier movie faded away (with the exception of one scene near the end of the movie when Algren hands his journal and papers to an observing journalist before going into battle, just as Shaw did before the Battle of Fort Wagner) and ""The Last Samurai"" is then able to take on a life of its own, and it does so very well.There were a number of things I really liked about this movie. It provided an interesting reflection on Samurai culture. (I say reflection rather than study because I have no idea how historically accurate the reflection was.) We see a clear reflection on American history (and particularly on the winning of the west.) Algren was supposedly a veteran of battles against the Sioux, and there are several references to Custer. Obviously, Algren is trying to make amends for helping to wipe out native American culture by trying to preserve traditional Japanese culture. There was also a perhaps inadvertent reflection on the so-called ""Stockholm Syndrome,"" in which a captive begins to increasingly identify with his captor, as Algren clearly does after being taken prisoner by the Samurai.This movie features very good performances by Cruise (with whom I am not always enamoured) and also by Ken Watanabe, playing Katsumoto, the head of the Samurai warriors, and there was an excellent closing battle scene (obviously Zwick - as he showed previously in ""Glory"" - is an expert at recreating such scenes.) The only thing that detracted from this (aside from the lack of originality in stealing too many scenes from ""Glory"") was an ending that was altogether too sappy in a number of ways. I would have ended this on the battlefield, which to me would have been more appropriate. Still, there's no doubt that this is deserving of an 8/10.",The Last Samurai
37,thesar-2,Dances with Swords,8,5 September 2016,"I've worked enough call centers to know their motto: ""Change is Good"" isn't really the case; it's just lies to avoid riots. And here's the proof.I wondered how they were going to explain away the once again whitewashing of American movies made in/about foreign countries. This movie is all about Japan's wakeup call to come to the future (of 1870s, anyways) and revolves aroundTom Cruise. Well, he is short. There is thatBut, no need, it was the whole story of him going to Japan in 1876. Once Japan got hit hard with the new technology of the West – or gunpowder, to be precise – the kid Emperor freaked and sought out America's help to evolve. This led to hiring a troubled U.S. Captain (Cruise) to train their armies against the Samurai, or the Japanese equivalent of Native Americans. Or so he thought.Without knowing the background – which I did a little research following this first screening, I knew where this was going: Captain (Cruise) is caught by the Samurai and guess what happens from thereThe Last Samurai is one gorgeously made movieon the surface. Yes, it's Dances with Wolves deep down, but it's what happened to the old ways of Japan. It's both sad, but in some respects, what needed to be done. Now that said, little did we know then, this all eventually triggered Japan's involvement in World War II in the worst possible way.The movie is 100% believable, includes great acting and you do get a sense of what life was like for the Samurai. It's just pretty darn long and a hard sell to get me to see it again since everything that will happen in the movie is so painfully obvious. This is not a good sign since I blindly bought the BluRay movie on good word of mouth and since I needed to fill up my Amazon order to $25 for discounts. I definitely don't regret seeing it. The stunning cinematography alone was worth it. I just probably should've streamed it firsthand since it really is a one-time viewing. On a completely different note, anyone interested in buying a slightly used BluRay copy of The Last Samurai? ***Final thoughts: Notice how I didn't mention Tom Cruise much upstairs. Meaning, I didn't go into his acting, what he brought to the project and if he enhanced it in any way. The last answer is: Nope. He was okay. Good, perhaps, but seriously, anyone could've played his role. The movie's extreme positives come from the story, scenery and direction. Now, I'm not downing Cruise. He is one of my favorites and I've probably seen his movies more times apiece than any other actor. It's just he was incidental to this project. Make that, fourth or fifth tier to the rest.",The Last Samurai
38,cherold,"grand epic, with flaws",7,24 December 2003,"The Last Samurai is a big, old fashioned sweeping entertainment with big scenery and battles and strong acting and a thoughtful script.  Yet, it suffers from typical Hollywood flaws and one can't help but have some reservations about the story.  First off, I can't take a movie seriously when it makes some American a guiding force in the history of Japan.  I mean, come on.  And the ending drags out a bit; it's the, why-have-one-moving-ending-if-you-can-have-three philosophy of filmmaking.  
Some things are great though.  Ken Watanabe is excellent as the Samurai. While the movie insists on using an American as an entry into this world, in typical Hollywood fashion, the film is mainly acted by Japanese (although oddly enough if you watch the end credits all the top billing except for Watanabe goes to western names).  And you've got to love a movie that avoids the seemingly obligatory sex scene and replaces it with a weirdly-erotic getting dressed scene; that was cool.Fun movie, plenty to criticize but still lots of fun to watch.  I give it 7 1/2 out of 10.",The Last Samurai
39,ElMaruecan82,"Watanabe the warrior-poet, a man of conservation... and conversations...",8,8 November 2019,"In Kurosawa movies, what characterized Samurais was that were both men of action and men from a bygone time as if fighting could only draw the future with the ink of the past. Samurais were the last embodiments of a heritage whose relevance was fading at the dawn of modernity. Maybe that awareness forged their resignation for death for only dishonor they feared. The men lived and perished by the sword, whomever it came from.But remember in ""Seven Samurai"", four of the warriors fell under fired bullets, deaths that actually dishonored the enemy but also marked the beginning of the end. In ""The Last Samurai"", it's not a few bullets but gatling guns that annihilate the glorious but suicidal ride of the last Shogun warriors, including their leader Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe, a composite of many historical figures; supposedly the last Samurai. Still, the film has no pretension to be true to history, but to a philosophy that forged Japan's history for centuries and that more or less prevailed even after the reforms.""The Last Samurai"" was directed by Edward Zwick, the name might not ring a bell, he was the director of ""Glory"" in 1989. And as much as ""Glory"" wasn't about fighting in the Civil War but the idea of fighting for a cause worth dying for, ""The Last Samurai"" also questions the virtues of fighting by confronting two different approaches of warfare, two philosophies of life. It does so with such a contemplative patience that we realize the Western and Oriental civilizations have a lot in common. Or might it be that every civilization built its definition of honor in a way that only a battlefield could give that abstract word its fullest meaning? Is it a blessing or a curse, history provides arguments for both sides, but where does the film stand?It's interesting that the most riveting scenes in the film involve sacrifices, as to show that there was a greater nobility in losing for a just cause than winning. But the film's hero Nathan Algren, Civil War and Indian wars veteran, doesn't start with that mindset. He survived the infamous Little Big Horn massacre and saw Custer's madness killing thousands of Natives. Yet for all the atrocities Algren witnessed, maybe what he resented was the idea that men like Custer were capable to draw other men to their cause in all blind loyalty, history would prove that good causes didn't have the monopoly of sacrifices. and that's a thought-provoking issue the film raises.Ironically, when Algren tells Katsumoto that Custer was ""a murderer who fell in love with his own legend. And his troopers died for it."", the warrior-poet responds it's a ""very good death"". The Samurai is so impregnated by the idea of dying rather than living in shame that anyone accepting the necessity of death is worth admiration. That's not exactly how winning is done but when you follow Katsumoto, you find out life isn't about the cause but about its guidance to find your own truth. When we first see Algren, he's an alcoholic, bitter and war-weary man, channeling a 'Ron Kovic' version of the Civil War vet but later, after a long immersion into the traditional Japan, he gains wisdom and a deeper and more balanced vision of things.The film takes place in 1878, during the Meiji era that turned the old feudal Japan into an industrialized country and an Imperialist nation in the turn of the century. The young Emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura) is confronted to a rebellion from Samurais who reject the new order for the nation's own good though Katsumoto would die for the Emperor if he ordered him so. Japan seeks help from the U.S. Army and so Algren can leave his existential dead-end and train the fresh new Japanese troops under the supervision of Captain Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) his previous commanding officer, a wannabe Custer who despises the savagery of the Orient as much as he did with Natives. He finds an ally in Omura (Masata Harado), a wealthy Westernized industrial and corrupt bureaucrat who takes advantage from the Emperor's age to influence his decisions and allow the U.S artillery to wipe out the Samurai rebellion.So the film is driven by two contrasting moves: Japanese politicians emulating the Western world, and Algren rediscovering the Japanese tradition and within it a salvation for his own soul, as if he could exorcise the very demons that stained America's history and march toward progress, the very one that inspired the Meiji. He owes his survival for his tenacity during a one-to-one fight, won in-extremis, raising the interest of Katsumoto who wants to study the stranger. Watanebe was rightfully Oscar-nominated for a quiet but intense performance as a man in constant quest for truth, not victory, a righteous man who'd die with honor in a lost battle against the tides of history.The film is filled with spectacular fighting sequences but is at its most absorbing during the quiet and introspective moments, when we see Algren's gradual immersion into Japan's roots, learning the language and the art of Kendo, befriending Katsumoto's son, falling in love with his sister Taka (the beautiful Koyuki Kato) whom husband he killed and in an honorable duel. The film doesn't overplay the nobility and righteousness of the Japanese and makes Katsumoto an accessible fellow, with wit and humor, and his 'conversations' with Cruise provide the best moments and raise intriguing but deep philosophical questions about fights and causes.Near the end, the film seems to give in to Hollywood spectacle requirements, the only aspect Roger Ebert criticized but I don't think it ever betrayed the film's soul. And it's not in every movie that you see soldiers respectfully bowing down to the fighters they just killed as if deep inside, they knew it was a page of history that was just turned, and turned Japan to a modern country with all the best to come... and the worst, too.",The Last Samurai
40,dromasca,Too predictable,7,10 February 2004,"Warning - possible spoilers!'The Last Samurai' could have been a great Hollywood movie in the series of films dedicated to the meeting between the Western and Far East civilizations. It does have many of the needed ingredients , and enjoys the participation of two mega-stars of the American and Japanese cinema. For much of the duration of the film, it meets the expectations, especially with respect to the rendition of the atmosphere and in the building of the conflict between the modern world and the old ways of the traditional Japanese culture. Tom Cruise is good as you expect, but does not get to the level of an Oscar performance. The film gets worse in its last part. First it is too long, suffering as many of the Hollywood films lately of the tendency to add the unjustified half hour to our film experience. The historical truth is badly twisted, but this would be no problem if this would buy some real emotions. What happens is that the Hollywood clichees take over any artistic logic - soldiers die in the slow motion we have seen in that many action films, the main hero dies exactly the way you would expect from minute two of the film, and even some dream-like  rosy end is stuck as a final scene without any reason. That's how what could have been one of the great films of Hollywood falls into mediocrity. What a miss! Still a film worth seeing, but only 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",The Last Samurai

With the similar trappings of ""Dances with Wolves,"" and ""Braveheart,"" ""The Last Samurai"" holds to the same level of richness, intensity, complexity, and grandeur as its predecessors. Every few years, a movie comes out that captures a national experience with a foreign flavor that both examines the epic as well as the intimate personal scale of experience. The Last Samurai presents the audience a solid and carefully crafted epic of a nation undergoing dramatic and revolutionary change as well as the complex, subtle trappings of cultural differences (particularly difficult when it comes to a culture such as Japan). With emotional sincerity and respect to Japanese culture and tradition, the high class Japanese language used in the movie captures the level of seriousness upon which those involved cultivated their craft and produced this movie. Unlike its predecessors, it takes a somewhat harder line and perhaps simplified portrait of the evils of society and the trappings of political intrigue as well as a loosening of script towards the end. As with ""Dances with Wolves"" but with an even less effective ending the movies unnecessarily overextends the ending ending by about thirty seconds too long (that is suggestive of American producer and mass audience testing might require or dictate for better word of mouth ratings and profits). While perhaps not exactly reaching the same league of its former film epic giants with its slight blemishes, this movie is definitely the epic adventure movie of the year and maybe the last several years.

I deemed it a sub par imitation of Dances With Wolves. I never cared to revisit it until today. I don't mind admitting I was totally wrong!! This movie is much more than that. It is intelligently written, brilliantly acted and in this day and age, it's an uncommonly thoughtful epic. The full power of the movie is only lessened by an ending that seems like it goes totally against what the movie was building up to. I won't go into spoilers!! That is only a minor gripe though. I can't believe I was so wrong about this movie. Once again Cruise proves he can act and Watanabe is a seriously powerful presence; looking at it now, you could see he had potential to become a bigger star. Tony Goldwyn (always an a$$hole) is as slimy and unlikeable as always, and Timothy Spall is decent in his small but important role, likewise Billy Connelly.

O. P John Toll do fantastic work in helping to bring Zwick's vision to life.There are no surprises as to where Samurai's tale is taking us with Algren's journey back to the light following a path laid out very early on as he and Katsumoto refuse to lay down arms against an ever growing army and hatred swelling against them but that doesn't stop Samurai from a moving and unforgettable final stand that ensures the time we have spent with Zwick's heartfelt tale will be one that lingers long in the memory.Final Say -Undervalued by industry pundits, The Last Samurai is the finest piece of work director Edward Zwick has put together as well as one of Tom Cruise's greatest acting feats alongside a never better Ken Watanabe.

49,johnnyboyz,"Amply unfolded, albeit with a real sense of nuts and bolts execution at work, Zwick's film drags us around but ultimately into a world of alienation and shifting attitudes.",6,26 June 2011,"When we first observe the lead in Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai, he is sitting alone in a small room, looking dishevelled, backstage somewhere, as his presence at the evening's function he is partly hosting is verbally stirred to a large crowd. He looks rather despondent, as if only something akin to that of a house-fire could get him to shift out of his chair; around him, crumpled up American flags of the era lie strewn around encapsulating how it is he feels about both the nation he is presently in and the sorts of things more broadly linked to that of the warfare in which they are engaging. The man makes intermittent use of a bottle of hard liquor, both later whilst on-stage as well as now; each of these things seeing him firmly within a state of disenchantment and dissatisfaction at where he currently is in life. Whom he is, is Nathan Algren, played here by American actor Tom Cruise; what he is, is a fearsome Civil War Captain and all-round warrior figure whose experiences on the front line of America's untamed west in the 1870s has led him to be what he is now. His eavesdropping of the master of ceremonies talk him up as one thing, when it's clear he's something else, goes hand in hand with the erratic nature of his later performance; something which should have seen the reciting of stories from the front but instead, has Algren scare the audience half to death with a loaded rifle – the entire episode acting as the final straw for a change Algren sees fit to apply to his life.That change, or turning of a proverbial page to begin anew, arrives in the form of a couple of cross dissolves; cross dissolves enabling us to leap to the port of Yokohama in an unobtrusive manner after a mite of exposition from those required to provide as such. Thus begins Algren's new existence, an existence allowing him to once again feel good about what it is he does well during the throngs of war thus incurring the reinvention of that drive to get up and fight once more for a cause. Edward Zwick's film goes on to formulate into a neat little war film-come-character study, something with an eye on the grandeur; an eye on the sweeping, all-embracing drama of it all in spite of the actual nucleus of what it is that's interesting here being the intricacies between varying cultures that co-exist as well as beliefs and minute shifts in attitude.The seeds of Algren's arc to a happier existence begins with a small clan of Japanese warriors at war with those of whom occupy similar grounds. He is employed by the existing Japanese Emperor to whip an army of runts into shape; an army of whose recruits are without the necessary skills needed to take on this additional force in combat, of whom are a renegade bunch that have already up-and-gone off into the wilderness under the tutelage of a Colonel Kurtz-sort it's eventually revealed is none other than Ken Watanabe. In beginning with these troops, Algren is able to put aside all his prior problems with alcohol and begin afresh relatively quickly; his abilities as a warrior and skills as a teacher some would say unrealistically coming back to him in no time at all. His point of no return is established via his standing beside a large target and demanding a yet untrained warrior fire off a musket round; Algren is far from being afraid to die, and here displays a real dispassion toward his own life such is where he presently is.The crux of the film arrives when that of the opponents to The Emperor's army arrive; shrouded in armour and ominous looking masks upon greeting the battlefield, they are mysterious and carry with them a preordained aura. Staying in sync with introducing something as one thing before breathing fresh life into them thereafter, the eventual developments see Algren caught and held by this renegade bunch, a bunch whom actually come across as rather nice and are a far cry from the threatening, inhuman introduction they carried. The film beds into a quaint groove of training montages and a flurry of forlorn facial expressions as time ticks by; Watanabe's interests lie in sticking to an older, more traditional way of life away from the modernising and expansion of Japan those of whom in the Emperor's ranks wish to adhere to - the parallels lying with the fact Zwick himself is sticking to a very old, very world weary framework but constructing the whole thing as if he were inventing the damn idea.The film is not without a certain charm, nor indeed degrees of guile in its flicking through the necessary obligatory scenes allowing for one to overcome personal changes we are able to see coming and the conflict we observe nearing. Most of the early exchanges generally call to mind an awful lot of what Zwick did far more effectively in his 1989 film Glory, specifically those scenes involving Broderick's character and a squad of African-Americans, only here it is without the same level of bite. The Last Samurai is hit and miss; a film in which, away from all the obligatory shooting and slashing, lies an intricate character piece which works for what it is in the long run, but does enjoy a good action sequence in spite of the fact it is precisely these things that led its lead to the mind-frame he was in. Yet, the film is difficult to truly get riled about – it treads enough water to keep us involved to its finale and chugs along with a heavy, mandatory feel about proceedings, all too often leading to well executed, if rather tame dramatics.",The Last Samurai
50,filipemanuelneto,A clash of changing cultures.,9,7 September 2015,"This film is set in the late nineteenth century and tells the journey of Nathan Algren, a veteran of the wars against the Native American Indians, to Japan, where he will collaborate in the training of the armies of the Emperor who want to modernize his army in Western patterns. But he will eventually know his opponent, the samurai leader Katsumoto, whom Algren begins to wonder.The opening of the Eastern countries to the West was not easy. China and Japan were two imperial countries with ancient cultures and a special attachment to their traditions, so regarded Westerners with some disdain. What they haven't: advanced military technology. Using the ""diplomacy of the cannon"" and the Opium Wars, the two countries were coerced to trade with western countries (curiously, they already did it, with Portuguese and Dutch, since the seventeenth century, but they refused to open totally to the outside world). When they did it there was a great clash of cultures: if some were displeased, other loved the westerners. This was the case of Emperor Meiji of Japan and this is the historical context in which the film is set.Directed by Edward Zwick (who got here one of the biggest hits of his career to date), the movie features Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe in lead roles (Algren and Katsumoto, respectively). The two main actors, like the rest of the cast, we can only speak well. Cruise and Watanabe got on well and this was reflected in the way they interact each other. The way both embody the characters was also excellent and we must notice that we're talking about characters with a strong psychological and dramatic load. Katsumoto is an embittered man, considered a traitor by those who only wish to serve in the best way and aware that day will come that he will die without knowing if will be understood. Algren is a man who lives haunted by his own military past, feeling that made mistakes and helped an unjust war against innocent people. Only in Japan he will recover from this depressed state thanks to the bravery and nobility of the samurai. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is iconic. The visual and special effects, particularly in combat scenes, are beyond reproach. The costumes were made with all the details and the traditional samurai armor are worthy of special note.For all these positive aspects this film was acclaimed by critics and a successful box office, receiving four nominations for the Oscar (supporting actor, art direction, costume design and sound mixing) and three for the Golden Globes (best dramatic actor, best dramatic supporting actor, best original soundtrack).

It's evident in this movie but if this debate is really acute today for America and Europe, this movie helped me to understand that this question was started already a century ago in the countries that have been colonized. Here, it's Japan and the choice is interesting because there, traditions mean honor.From a different point of view, you can see an American idol (Cruise) turning his back at America and giving his soul to fundamentalist warriors. For a movie post 9/11, it's a courageous choice: Some said it was a hidden plea for his church of Scientology but I don't feel a religious message here: on the contrary, this suffering soul have found inner peace with enemies that welcomes him and it's the power of love and not faith that saves him. Another proof of courage comes from the director who doesn't hesitate to depict US Army as racist and savage killing innocent people. But if the side that has technology always have power, it doesn't mean also victory.Despite of this gloomy and violent world, the movie is also a wonderful moment of peace, wisdom and love. A lot of this tenderness comes from the Japanese cast that are much more moving as new faces that a lot of Hollywood stars (fortunately none in this movie). I was totally touched by their non-verbal communication: it's all in glances and they say much more than with words.Last but not least, the score of Zimmer is a masterpiece: it sounds very Japanese, pure and simple and totally emotional as this movie.",The Last Samurai

I don't think it is a total waste, but it isn't one that I would want in my collection and I wouldn't want to watch the whole movie again.

In this movie, he's Risky Business with a beard and a sword.I did like some of the action scenes, even though there are far too many cuts. The story itself is legit in that the Samurai were dying out at a time when other nations were trying to access Japan and brought with them new technology. One thing to point out is the time era is all wrong. This period had the Japanese using very crude muskets which I guess for the purpose of this movie they had to change because it would have been more difficult to film.",The Last Samurai

54,Anonymous_Maxine,"After thousands of years of war, we are no closer to peace than we have ever been.",10,25 October 2004,"I remember being initially put off by a movie with 'Samurai' in the title and starring Tom Cruise, but like Brad Pitt did in Troy recently, Cruise delivers a powerful performance as a Civil War veteran whose meaningless life takes a shocking turn after being sent on an assassination assignment. We meet Cruise sitting backstage, about to be called on to speak to an adoring crowd about his military experiences, and he stumbles onstage, drunk and belligerent, and winds up pulls out his rifle and firing several shots above the shocked heads of the crowd. So yeah, war had a not so good effect on him and he's not too happy with life.He takes an assignment to assassinate the samurai leader Katsumoto, and after a vicious battle, Nathan Algren (Cruise) is taken prisoner be captors who clearly respect/fear him because he fought a circle of men literally until he could not stand, killing the last one of them while lying flat on his back. The Americans were in the process of aiding Japan's eager transition from the Old ways to the ways of the West, the process of which provides endless opportunities for massive financial gain in areas like weapons and trade. Algren is already disgusted with the military because of a traumatic experience he had in following what he always felt was an immoral order from a superior officer, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), who he never forgives and is never faced with reason to. That particular battle is only hinted at in a series of fast and blurry flashbacks, but it is more than enough to get the idea that it involved sacking a village that Algren believed had nothing to do with their conflict, and it resulted in the deaths of the entire population, including women and children.After being taken prisoner by Katsumoto, he is returned to Katsumoto's village and kept as a prisoner, but here is the difference between the Civil War era Americans and the samurai  the Americans want to know their enemy, the samurai want to understand their enemy, and as the rest of the movie shows, there is a huge difference between knowing your enemy and understanding your enemy, not the least of which is that the former is generally useful toward the purpose of killing them, the latter more useful in the purpose of understanding why they live and fight the way they do.Algren begins his captivity as a prisoner, albeit one with an amazing amount of freedom within the village. He is not imprisoned, but rather allowed to roam the grounds, exploring the area and people, and only reminded that he's a prisoner of war by the studying looks he receives from everyone he passes, particularly as he passes groups of warriors training for battle. Algren gets to know the people and their culture, as do we along the way, and we grow to appreciate their culture and their way of life, the cleanliness, honor, and respectability, especially when it is contrasted by Colonel Bagley's calling them savages armed only with bows and arrows. This juxtaposition of the American prejudices toward the samurai and our developed respect for the organization of their culture is indeed unsettling. I just watched Fahrenheit 9/11 a few weeks ago and have since automatically seen parallels between the events in the Middle East and almost every movie I watch (I even managed to make two connections which you can find in my review of Day of the Dead, of all movies), so I try not to talk too much about parallels in every movie, but the ones here are too much to overlook, especially when America is so occupied with battling what are often called insurgents or savages. Given the videotapes that these people put on the internet, I tend to agree with naming them vicious savages, but The Last Samurai is a reminder that such terms simply cannot be applied to populations or cultures in their entirety. There are savages in EVERY culture.I think this movie may have gone a little far in that the samurai were completely pure, there was no counterpart of Colonel Bagley on their side, for instance, which tends to suggest to me that the movie is more interested in promoting an understanding of cultures that so many people know nothing about. It's scary to watch this movie and see all of the good, moral people on both sides who kill each other and are killed when, as is in this case most demonstrated by Colonel Bagley, the primary reasoning behind it all is a lack of mutual understanding. After spending some time in captivity, Algren comments in a voice-over that he has slept well in this village for the first time in many years, a curious statement which highlights the irony that the only way he found peace was through his experience as a prisoner of the very culture he was sent to destroy. This has to be one of the clearest and most effective anti-war statements I've ever seen in a movie. The relationships that develops between Algren and Matsumoto is, obviously, where the majority of the film's message lies, as they grow from enemies to comrades on the battlefield. There are striking comparisons between the samurai's willing to die for honor (which, in sharp contrast to American beliefs, can be achieved through suicide) and what I think is a more apprehensive view of death on the American side. I believe that Americans see deaths on the battlefield as something tragic, a necessary amount of suffering in the name of something for which we as a people largely believe in (hence the enormous importance that going into war is done for just reasons), while the samurai see death on the battlefield as a good death, an honorable one. The divide is sharp, but the two of them find connection in their values, not their cultures, and especially in their view of honor. Their mutual understanding of deaths in battle as honorable is the seed upon which they are able to build their relationship with each other. Despite so many seemingly uncross-able differences, this one belief leads to their understanding and respect of each other, which personally left me hoping that one day this might happen in the world on a larger scale.",The Last Samurai

56,FiendishDramaturgy,"Beautiful, but still lacking",7,5 March 2006,"I LOVE this movie! But it's not all that it's made out to be. In some ways, it's more, but in others, it's less. Let me explain.This film has been hyped as a masterpiece of cinematic art. It IS wonderfully filmed, with great effects, superior sound, and beautiful location shots. A masterpiece? Hardly. The plot line is too weak, Cruise's character so contrived, that there is little point to this movie.This film has been dogged as completely useless with too many slow spots. It DOES have slow spots. It is primarily a drama, actually, regardless of how it was billed, so there ARE slow areas where story- or character-development are given center stage.It seems viewers either love or hate this movie based on the two basic factors above; however, I find myself somewhere in the middle. I was genuinely surprised with the caliber of performance Tom Cruise turned in. I'm NOT a fan of his work, but this time, his portrayal was quite compelling. I found the story and all and details surrounding the way of life of Japan's past to be interesting, and the action sequences (what there was of them) were stunning. So was the cinematography of this picture. Astounding and the landscape shots were breath taking.All in all, I enjoyed this work, although I don't consider it as art house as the makers (or the Academy) did.

57,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,4 December 2016,"I'm changing my review on this after re-watching it and, well, seeing the politics of today.On one hand, I still really think that we took the wrong side of this, given how the shogunate treated the peasants. And I can't really get behind that kind of oppression. So, I really don't like that part of what they were fighting for.Then again, being older and wiser, I also can't understand the need to exterminate any culture as thoroughly as westernization side was attempting to do. That doesn't fit with me either, especially now when we are seeing a war on culture that has no intent to reform, just destroy.So there is a middle line here and I kind of take that path at the moment. I'm not a fan of the total destruction of tradition and culture of any kind.That being the case...it is a bit melodramatic, but it's not bad. It is done with an eye to beauty and you have to respect that, at least I do. And, honestly, I believe that traditions are worth fighting for, as is a culture.I believe that this teaches a subtle lesson, that it's better to reform what is bad and preserve what is good without an eye to extermination. Tradition and culture need not be eliminated with such brutality, there is no sense in telling a people that their way of life is wrong.""We can not forget who we are, or where we come from,"" and I believe that is true. There is nothing wrong with that statement.",The Last Samurai
58,freemantle_uk,Americanisation of Japanese History,7,13 November 2009,"Hollywood have often found subjects in history and have try to make it into an American story. World War II is often a subject that is tackled to make the Americans look great with the expenses of the role the British and other allies had. This time Hollywood focuses on Japanese history in 1870s where the Japanese starts to modernise, industrialise and contact the rest of the world. It makes out that the Americans played an important part, despite that it was the British and the Germans were actually involved.Set in 1876 and 1877, Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a veteran of the American Civil War and Indian Wars. He performs for audiences in San Francisco and suffers from alcoholism and war guilt. He receives an offer from his out sergeant Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly) and former commander, Lieutenant Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) to go to Japan to help train their new army to fight the Samurai resistance, fighting against modernisation. Early on he makes some progress when training the Japanese conscripts, similar to Edward Zwick's earlier film Glory (including having an Irish sergeant and shooting a pistol to show the soldiers are not ready for battle). But Algren and his regiment are sent to fight the samurais before their were ready. During the battle the new Army is easily defeated and Algren is capture. The leader of the Samurais, Lord Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) keeps Algren alive, hoping to learn about his enemy. Algren is trapped in a small village for a whole winter, but Katsumoto and the village teach him about the samurai culture. Algren goes naviee, and ends up joining the samurais, improving his fighting style and respecting the fighters.Edward Zwick is a respected director, having done some good films in his career. He is an action director, but his films do have a moral core behind them, such as Glory and Blood Diamond. The action in this film is bloody, and well executed. It is excellent viewing in that sense. His cinematographer John Toll also shoots some lovely scenes, with excellent landscapes of New Zealand (a stand in for Japan). Hans Zimmer also conduces a good score to the film. Zwick does show Algern and Katsumoto as out and out good whilst Bagley and the Emperor's adviser Omura (Masato Harada) as the true bad guys in a typical Hollywood fashion other characters are shown to be more mixed. The Emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura) is shown to be a weak-willed young man who needs advise, but respects Katsumoto and is only bringing about modernisation because he thinks that is what is best for Japan. Timothy Spall plays an English interpreter Simon Graham: he starts out as the Hollywood stereotype of an Englishman (which I hate), but shows to be a character who respects both sides and is a more realistic character (except for the Hollywood Englishness). There is a really good cast to the film (except Billy Connolly). Ken Watanabe earned an Oscar nod for his performance and he was really good: he is a talented actor. Tom Cruise offers the typical Tom Cruise performance, which is pretty decent and he is good in the action scenes. They are a number of talented Japanese actors in the film who performed well. Zwick has been good at casting in the past.This is an interesting subject of history, and an area which isn't very well known by people in the West. The film was very popular in Japan and was praised for it's handling of Japanese culture. But there are historical inaccuracies (which I will also score down a film if they are major). As said it was the British and the German who was trained and built up the Japanese military because Britain had the best navy at the time, and the Germans had the best army. The Japanese saw Britain as a model because they were island nations. Japan's first modern alliance was with the British in 1902. Japan also modernised because they did not want to end up being like China who was seen as the sick man of Asia and was being craved up by European nations. Russia was a serious threat to Japan. The Bushidō code also had a darker side to it, which we saw during the Second World War. This was skipped over during the film.The film also reminded me Glory and also trying to be a bit like Dances with Wolves goes East. Zwick did lift some scenes from Glory and placed them in The Last Samurai. That was a bit lazy. Zwick also seemed to try and be like David Lean and Akira Kurosawa when making this film, especially the latter. He wanted to make a grand epic like those two, but more violence. He should have just tried to make a film in his own way.It's a decent enough film, but I think it would have been better as a Japanese film, not a Hollywood film about Japan.",The Last Samurai
59,ebiros2,Best samurai movie in history,10,6 October 2005,"When I first saw the trailer about this movie, it didn't excite me. Tom Cruise and samurai somehow didn't sound like a match, and my guess was that the movie was stereotypical plot about an American going to Japan to kick ass - I was wrong.I just couldn't believe the detail they've put into this movie. Everything looked absolutely real, and even in Japanese made samurai movie you don't see this kind of authenticity (e.g. if you recall plastic looking Armour in Kurosawa's Kagemusha). Given that this movie was made on a budget that's 30x the most expensive samurai movie Japan's ever made, you can still have fouled the plot by making it an ""American"" samurai picture. But no, Ed Zwick's vision is so complete, it overwhelmed me. And Tom Cruise was not a simple hero character, but a character based on principle who found himself in a situation where he didn't know how to get out of (until he gets to Japan).Ngila Dickson and Lily Kilvert did a fantastic job with costumes and sets. Cinematography was beautiful. Props and special effects were flawless. All the casts were absolutely believable. In short, a perfect movie.I truly believe that Hollywood have outdone Japan in its own game with this movie. It's the greatest samurai movie ever made, and perhaps one of the last of its kind. Japanese studios are no longer producing samurai movies due to lack of interest from audiences, and it's doubtful that another movie like this would be made by an American studio. They say that swan's last song is its most beautiful and the saying might just apply to this movie.If you turn off the picture and just listen to the dialog you'll notice that only Algren (Tom Cruise), Omura (Masato Harada), and Higen (Sosuke Ikematsu) are really speaking from the bottom of their person. Others are just giving lip service. Harada is a director and maybe he knows how the craft really works. Sosuke Ikematsu was just so great in his role as Higen. He was blowing away actors who had ten times more experience than him with his acting, and maybe (I hope) he will one day grow into a great adult actor himself. As for Tom Cruise, I guess he's the biggest star in Hollywood because he can bring believability into his character at this level.",The Last Samurai
60,dee.reid,"""The Last Samurai""",10,20 July 2005,"It seems I have only been given a few occasions in my life where I am genuinely ""in"" a film. Edward Zwick's ""The Last Samurai"" embodies the elements of the rousing historical action epic and strong human drama so perfectly I found myself unable to turn away from the glorious battle and sentimental character-driven plot. Where most films of this particularly high caliber sacrifice themselves to Hollywood conventions ¾ of the way through, ""The Last Samurai"" remains consistent and stays with you, even long after the credits and action have ceased.One should also take into account the West's immense fascination with the East too. Samurai pictures, as relayed to Western culture most popularly by Akira Kurosawa, and martial arts flicks from the 1970s, have been the focal point of an intense study by American film-goers in the last half-century. ""The Last Samurai"" remains faithful to the myths of Japanese swordsmen by building on the mystifying qualities that made them so fascinating in the first place and also by carefully shying away from stereotypes.Add to that, it has a magnificent leading actor, Tom Cruise, who is no stranger to action cinema and really threw himself into his character of Capt. Nathan Algren by training in various sword-fighting techniques and learning to speak much of his dialogue in Japanese. Similar to ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990) and in the tradition of fish-out-of-water tales, Cruise's Algren is the disillusioned outsider from American civilization who wholeheartedly adopts the ways and the culture of a ""savage"" people and eventually participates in a grand epic battle against his former walk-of-life.As the film opens, Algren is already a highly decorated Civil War veteran, who of course is suffering from open wounds of his battle time experiences. Living on the bottle and reduced to retelling fabrications of epic battlefield skirmishes (chiefly General George Custer's famous last stand), he makes an a** out of himself on stage and becomes a huge embarrassment to the theater owners.His days as a soldier are not long behind him, however, as he is called to journey to Japan by Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) and a man named Omura (Masato Harata) to aid the Japanese government in crushing a rebellion of the samurai led by Katsumoto (Academy Award-nominee Ken Watanabe, in his first English-speaking American performance). The emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura), a young and indecisive man, has grown an immense fascination with all things Western, which has put the samurai, who have a 900-year history of serving the Japanese government, and their glorious past written out of future accounts of Japan's culture.Algren's job in Japan is to train and act as an adviser for the emperor's army. After very little time training them, Bagley takes the opportunity to see them in battle; Algren says that they are not ready, as proved in a scene that is reminiscent of Zwick's own ""Glory"" (1989). In Japan's hills, a skirmish breaks out between the army and samurai, and in the ensuing chaos Algren is captured.I have always admired films that embrace their subject matter like this one does, and I have to admit I have always admired films about the outsider who embraces an alien culture. Algren writes in his journal, about how he comes to question what he is doing there and how the Japanese and their culture are not so primitive. He engages in deep philosophical conversations with Katsumoto; for the first months Algren is in captivity, he does not speak to Katsumoto, as he still feels his allegiance to his own native America. But he comes to question that loyalty as he witnesses how disciplined and loyal the Japanese are, and how the questioning of own his values eventually makes him comrades with Katsumoto.Where movies like this have failed, the Japanese would be very ignorant and would warm themselves up to the way of the White man and Algren will be the one to lead them to victory; that does not happen here. Algren is merely a participant in something far greater than himself and just as he had been assigned to do with the Americans, he acts an adviser to Katsumoto's samurai.While in captivity, Algren, the outsider, is eventually welcomed into Katsumoto's household and is introduced to his family. Katsumoto's teenage son takes a strong liking to him but Katsumoto's sister-in-law, whose husband Algren killed in battle, is not so forgiving. Eventually Algren finds himself warming up to his captors and their dedication to preserving the Samurai code.""The Last Samurai"" is really one of those movies that doesn't seem to get the praise it deserves. There are many breathtaking action sequences (none of which are stylized in any fashion) and you will not find any trace of the ""modern"" action movie in this film.We are shown here, the way of a dying culture - the samurai. In this film, they are presented to indeed have a strong and dedicated ethic of preserving their history, a glorious history that will be forgotten as Japan moves forward into its modernization with the West and director Zwick shows us this.The performers are excellent, especially Cruise but even more compelling are many of the Japanese actors. Ken Watanabe is simply amazing in his first American role. We actually believe in his strength and dedication to preserving the samurai code. Cruise takes on the role of acting as Katsumoto's outsider general in the film's final, spectacular action sequence between the Japanese military and the samurai.""The Last Samurai"" is a beautiful and rousing epic that will certainly live on as a fantastic samurai film; it almost rivals any Kurosawa action-set piece (just kidding). But ""The Last Samurai"" does raise the bar as far as portraits of the East go in Western cinema. If ""The Last Samurai"" is remembered as the grand epic it surely is, then the East will get its respect in due time.10/10",The Last Samurai
61,meeza,Cruise Cuts!,7,4 August 2004,"There were not an overabundance of moviegoers which bowed to `The Last Samurai'. The film was a moderate box office disappointment despite the fact it starred megastar Tom Cruise. Did Cruise make a risky business decision in taking on a Japanese epic? Did he feel aggravated that the film did not show him the money? Was it a mission impossible for `The Last Samurai' to obtain blockbuster status? Let me cut to the chase: `The Last Samurai' stars Cruise as Nathan Algren, a 19th century Civil War soldier who takes on a job in training a Japanese army in battling Samurais. In a fierce battle, Algren `sword' of gets held captive by the Samurais. Through a gradual & grueling process, he is befriended and welcomed by the Samurai nation and ends up being `sword' of a Samurai himself. Ken Watanabe co-stars as Katsumoto, the fearless & commanding Samurai leader. Watanabe received a Best Supporting Actor nod for his performance here. He had a tyrannical presence here, but I think the nod was not deserving. I `sword' `watanabe' Sam Rockwell of `Matchstick Men' to had received the Best Supporting Actor nod instead. The masterful components of `The Last Samurai' was its breathtaking cinematography, ingratiating sound editing, and cultural costume design. A few critics felt that the Academy was crude to Cruise by overlooking him for a Best Actor nomination. Tommy Boy's sensible & courageous work was notable but not for him to cruise a Best Actor nod. Director Edward Zwick is one slick director with all the effort he put into the film.

There is nothing very Japanese about the feel of the movie  it seems firmly like a Hollywood recreation put together to glorify Cruise's strengths and set in historical Japan  but Cruise puts plenty of work into the part with a performance to be proud of. And historical tosh as might it be (the Samurai were not really as noble as they are portrayed)  it does present the legend quite well, and the legend and the values retrospectively attributed to the Samurai are in some ways more important and interesting perhaps than any reality.",The Last Samurai

64,jimbo-53-186511,"It's a long film, but the rewards are definitely here for the patient viewer",8,16 November 2015,"In a bid to try to improve trade links between Japan and the US Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is hired to train an army to overthrow a rebellious group of samurai led by their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). However, the army that Algren had been training encounter the Samurai before their training has been completed and the army end up being overpowered and defeated by the highly trained Samurai. Algren is the only survivor of this battle and in recognition of his bravery and determination Katsumoto spares his life and invites him to stay with the Samurai. During his time with the Samurai, Algren learns quite a bit about their culture and eventually embraces it and fights back against those that had originally hired him to overthrow the Samurai.Tom Cruise's performances and films tend to vary greatly in quality so I do tend to approach a lot of his films with caution. I can safely say that this is one of his better films and also one of his better performances. Cruise is well-known for bringing a sort of smug arrogance to a lot of his roles and he definitely brings some of that to his role as Captain Algren - although there's only a whiff of it here rather than full on smugness that we've seen from him before. Director and screenwriter Zwick gives Cruise a character he can really sink his teeth into - Algren is obnoxious and rude at the start and shows very little respect for his employees. He's the same with the Samurai at the start, but I think the difference is that the Samurai show him respect and allow him to embrace their culture. The general saying in life is that to 'gain respect you must first give respect' and I got the feeling that this was one of the messages contained within this film.The first 20 minutes or so of this film are slick and fast-paced, but the momentum does slow down where Algren is staying with the Samurai. Although the pace slackens at this point the film never becomes boring and Algren's narrative and the exploration of the Samurai culture were interesting enough to keep me involved with the story. The only criticism I have with this aspect of the story was when the ninjas attacked the Samurai - I just didn't see the point of it and it also seemed to add nothing to the story, but this really is a minor criticism.Much like Seven Samurai, The Last Samurai is a slow-burning film that rewards the viewers patience with a spectacular closing act that is epic, clever and heart-breaking. Technical aspects of the film are also superb most notably the beautiful Japanese scenery and wonderful cinematography.Clearly there are some politics involved here, but the politics are side-lined for the most part to make way for an interesting story about one man identifying more with an alleged 'rebellion' group over his own people. I've no idea how much of this story is true - it certainly references real life people such as General Custer and real-life events such as the battle of little bighorn, but never says anywhere that it's based on a true story. Truth be told, it doesn't matter to me whether the story is true or not because the film has a good story, it's moving at times, it's beautiful to look at, has some wonderful performances and to top it all the final battle is fantastic. Therefore it's very much worth seeing on its own merits.",The Last Samurai
65,yusufpiskin,Bushido,10,27 December 2019,"Edward Zwick is one of the most under-rated directors out there, but I don't feel this is entirely representative of his best work. Not to say it isn't a damn good film (it is), but it's plainly obvious that Hollywood had their hands on this.The tone is inconsistent. One minute, there's a standard, generic Hollywood action scene, shot the same way all standard, generic Hollywood action scenes are shot. The next minute, however, is a very calm, still, introspective montage taken straight from Terrence Malick's playbook. If the movie was either a drama or an action film instead of trying to be both, I think it would have more of an identity. The pandering to the lowest-common-denominator viewer played a large role in preventing that from happening. Some moments feel overly simplified to the point where it almost becomes a detriment to the integrity of the subject matter. Zwick's touch was not entirely obscured; there are plenty of great shots, scenes, and moments that can only be the product of a film-maker of his caliber.The story is not without flaw. The entire set-up is very plain and not all that interesting. The hero lacks motivation, purpose for his goal, has nothing at stake, etc. But once Katsumoto enters the picture, the movie takes a major turn for the better. Even though the hero is not doing much externally for a preponderance of the film, it still captivates due to the strength of his inner journey. Seeing Algren learn about the samurai culture and grow to understand and respect them is without question the movie's biggest strength. His gradual character arc is splendid to behold.Cruise, however, was not a good choice for the role. He did the best job he could (a very good job, in truth), but he still felt entirely anachronistic; he didn't look, sound, or feel like a man from that era whatsoever.A few lax passages early on and several others sprinkled around the second half certainly hold the film back from reaching its full potential. There is a truly great movie in there just waiting to get out. If only Hollywood would just let film-makers make films.Despite their efforts and the flaws contained within, Zwick managed to come away with a quality product that is both meaningful and enjoyable. With more dedication to the film itself and less concern on how many people will go to the theater and spend money, this could have been a masterpiece on par with Glory.PS: the musical score is absolutely fantastic.",The Last Samurai

The premise itself is attracting, it's acted out astutely by the noteworthy cast list. It probably lasts too long, but I never truly got a feeling of it dragging out though.Tom Cruise is fantastic as Capt. Nathan Algren. It's no secret or surprise as we all know that guy can act, he adds a great deal to his character here; especially on the emotional side of things. As for what happens with Algren, it's all good even if the love interest parts are undercooked.Ken Watanabe is splendid in the role of Katsumoto, while Masato Harada (Omura) and Timothy Spall (Graham) give positive performances. It's also nice to see Billy Connolly (Gant) and Scott Wilson (Swanbeck) appear. Hans Zimmer's score is, as presumed, grand. That would be one of a number of reasons why I'd say you should watch this.",The Last Samurai
67,drystyx,Well meaning flop,3,20 June 2008,"This movie has a spirit of realism about it, mixed in with the modernism of blood and gore (not that blood and gore is modern, but the fascination, obsession, and glorification of it is). Cruise plays the ""Steve Martin"" role (as Raymond Burr's Steve Martin was inserted into ""Godzilla"" for an American or English speaking character.) It is his character that probably weakens this movie the most. The film centers on the escapades of traditional samurai in a changing empire. It would definitely have been a stronger movie had the English speaking character not been inserted just for...what was he there for? He serves no purpose, and he is not really identifiable as a character. He is void of personality and evokes no sympathy from the viewer. He isn't bad. He just isn't anything. This is no reflection on Cruise the actor. It is a reflection on a dull, ho hum character badly written. This makes the movie plod along, and the viewer just wants to get it over with. It was well intentioned, but a flop.",The Last Samurai
68,dworldeater,"Tom Cruise is The Last Samurai? Yeah sure, why not?",9,6 January 2020,"Before I sat down to watch the film, thought the premise of Tom Cruise as The Last Samurai was completely ridiculous. But in the context of the film it makes sense and The Last Samurai is a great movie indeed. Tom Cruise is an a self loathing alcoholic soldier that gets a job abroad in a rapidly modernized Japan to train Japanese soldiers. In a battle with their enemy, the last remaining clan of samurai he ends up in captivity. In the months that follow after living with the samurai, he ends up embracing the traditional Japanese culture and changing his ways. This is easily my favorite movie that Tom Cruise has made and he delivers a great performance as the lead. Ken Wantanabe gives a extremely powerful performance in his English language debut as the leader of the samurai clan. The film itself is really well put together and beautifully shot and scored. The battle scenes look fantastic as well. This is really well done epic film making and great entertainment. This is mostly a good story about a man and his personal journey of redemption. But also brings to light western imperialism and racism that runs deep in our culture and how it has effected the world at large. Great movie, really well done.",The Last Samurai
69,caspian1978,Dances with Samurai,6,1 January 2004,"Even though this is a good movie, it is far from a great movie. An interesting look into another film where a man (from the West) falls into a world (the East) and evolves as the man he once was. A Man Called Horse, Tarzan (to a degree), Dances with Wolves, and now The Last Samurai holds these comparisons. Still, the movie stands on its own. With the relationship between Cruise and his female lead, the movie ends more powerful than other Hollywood endings where Tom Cruise would pick up his woman into his arms and carry her into the sunset. Here, we get the powerful close up of the two characters as we fade to black. Great action sequences and character development. The movie may fall short to some members in the audience. The reason? Not your typical action film and it is not your typical drama neither. Unique and worth a watch, the Last Samurai is one of Tom Crusies better movies in the past few years.",The Last Samurai
70,Agent10,One of those films that deserved better,9,28 September 2004,"To see The Last Samurai slip into oblivion is quite a joke. Hollywood's hatred toward Tom Cruise came to a head with this film. I'm not saying Tom Cruise is a great actor, but to deny him in a film where he certainly earned some accolades is a disgrace.First of all, The Last Samurai is formulaic, which means all of the other elements involved in making a film must be tight and perfected. The music, the cinematography and the acting all fell into place, giving the film a certain richness that helped set it apart from the multitude of films that precluded it. The Last Samurai was much better than Cold Mountain or Master and Commander, which to say many people were turned off by the idea of Cruise leading a serious ensemble without explosions and car chases to back up his dialogue. Give the man some credit where it is due. Every dog has his day, and this was certainly it. The first time I watched this film, I was surprised by the amount of talent that went into making this film. John Toll (director of photography), Ed Zwick, and Hans Zimmer all layed their signature groundwork, making this a memorable film. In the annals of remembrance, The Last Samurai will certainly have better staying power than Master and Commander or Cold Mountain, and it will just become another one of those ""should-of-beens.""",The Last Samurai
71,rbverhoef,Terrific but long,8,16 November 2004,"Here is a film that looks very good with its costumes, art direction, set design and cinematography, has some terrific performances, a beautiful score and a fine direction by Edward Zwick ('Glory', 'Legends of the Fall') and unfortunately an ending that could spoil things for a lot of people. If you forget the ending 'The Last Samurai' is a very good movie.In short: Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) becomes a military adviser for Japanese soldiers to defeat some Samurai leftovers. He is captured by the Samurai and starts respecting these real warriors. He becomes a Samurai as well, sort of, and helps the Samurai for their next battle against the Japanese soldiers. Of course there is a women to make things a little more interesting.Although the film is an action adventure it is not really about the action, which is its strength and its weakness. The film is more about honor and such things if you look at the story, but besides that it is all about the things I mentioned above; art direction, set design, costumes, cinematography. Although it is great too look at the entire time, even during the final sequences, the film is too long. It seems nobody wanted to erase some of the beautiful images. But when the action arrives, it is very well done. You can see Cruise trained for a long time for these scenes. Although it is a little too long and has an ending that is instantly forgettable, I enjoyed 'The Last Samurai' more than I expected.",The Last Samurai

74,rosscinema,Film has a Samurai heart and spirit,7,14 December 2003,"This is a film that takes a good hard look at how Japan was starting to change with its business deals with western civilization but the Samurai were still committed to the old ways of Japanese culture. This story is about a former Civil War captain named Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) who is an alcoholic and haunted by the memories of all the killing that was done during his tour of duty. Algren is offered a job in Japan to help train Japanese soldiers how to fight with modern weapons like guns and cannons. He arrives in Japan and starts to help train the soldiers but they are eons away from being ready to go into battle with the Samurai. Algren is told to lead them into a fight even though he knows they are not ready and after a very bloody fight where his army is nearly wiped out Algren is wounded and when a Samurai warrior is about to finish him off Algren kills him. Algren's life is spared when the leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) decides to bring him back to their village so that he can learn more about his enemy. Katsumoto and the Samurai are at war with the Japanese that want to change Japan into a more modern country that has trade deals with the Western culture. Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) is young and envies the pride and traditions of the Samurai but he also wants to do what is best for his people so he is in the middle between the two armies. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Algren spends months living in the village among the Samurai and at first he is quiet but slowly he learns to respect them and their way of life. He is forced to live with Taka (Koyuki) who is the widow of the warrior that he killed and this makes him reflect on his own actions as a soldier. Algren learns to speak Japanese and how to fight with a Samurai sword. During the course of time there is mutual respect between the two and after Katsumoto is taken prisoner by the other side and about to be killed Algren decides to help him escape and fight with him in a final bloody battle.This film is directed by Edward Zwick who also made the very good ""Glory"" and he knows about making films about characters that are questioning their own motives with war as a backdrop. The cinematography is important when your making a film as epic looking as this and Zwick hired the great John Toll who also shot ""Braveheart"" and ""The Thin Red Line"". There are several glorious shots and the battle scenes are extremely well angled with shots from the more fierce infighting to the long shots of a whole landscape of warriors. Cruise is good as Algren but not for a moment did I forget that I was watching one of the biggest movie stars in the world. His conviction to the role is admirable but this is nowhere near as good a performance as ""Born on the Fourth of July"". The best performance in the film comes from Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto and he shows both martial arts skill in the action scenes and screen charisma in the quieter moments. Koyuki as Cruise's love interest is a real beauty and she has natural screen appeal. She shows grace and poise and her understated role is effective. The script does a good job of showing how the Japanese were at odds with themselves as times were changing and the Samurai ideals were looked at as being antiquated. After a very bloody battle the film has a more Hollywood style ending and I do believe that this hurts the impact of the film. It has to do with the character by Cruise and with a more independent minded script this would have been even better I believe. This film still is very impressive looking and it does possess a lot of heart and spirit.",The Last Samurai
75,Rob_Taylor,"An oriental version of Gladiator, but better....",9,30 March 2004,"Don't get me wrong, Galdiator is a great film. But this is better. The themes of honour, loyalty, redemption and responsibility are put forward with a force and certainty that I haven't seen for a long time in a film.<some spoilers ahead>The action pieces are well arranged and Cruise is convincing as a Samurai, albeit an American one. The rest of the cast are all excellentBut where this movie scores points (and for me elevated itself above the typical Hollywood nonsense we are used to) is in its subtlety. Two scenes stand out where, under a less caring scriptwriter or director, this film would have been a disappointment.The first is when Cruise's character is learning to swordfight. With Stat Hollywood Director (SHD) in control, you just know that there would come a point in the training where the student defeats the master, to looks of shock and surprise from all onlookers. Here, however, we are treated not to the besting of the master, but Cruise managing a draw against his teacher, to looks of shock and surprise from all onlookers. It might sound a trivial thing, but it made the movie that little bit more believable and enjoyable.The second scene involved the love interest between Algren (Cruise) and Taka. With jolly old SHD in charge, I would have expected the obligatory sex scene, followed by wailing and gnashing of teeth the following morning when he goes off to battle. Here however we are treated instead to a gentle admission (unspoken mostly) of their love for one another, with nothing more sexual than a simple kiss. Less subtle than the first example, perhaps, but no less telling.All in all this is a great film and, like Gladiator, one that I am sure will stand the test of time and be enjoyed again and again.",The Last Samurai
76,eric262003,Works Well On A Lot Of Levels,8,25 April 2016,"Odd as it may seem, but ""The Last Samurai"" never quite had that much of an impact on me. Which seems unorthodox because I happen to enjoy samurai films. Not only that, but I've been a fan of movies that were directed by Edward Zwick (especially ""Glory""). And Ken Watanabe comes to the table fully prepared in whatever role he plays. So the least I could was give this movie at least a try. The story begins during the American Civil War as eternally inebriated war veteran Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has his life twisted in an indecipherable knot. When he's not gulping down the sauce, the unforgettable traumas come back to haunt him as he can't forgive himself over the murders of several Native Americans. Col. Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) assigns Algren to Japan and guide their army with more advanced military weapons like rifles, muskets and cannons to their advantage. Only doing if for the good pay that comes with it, Algren agrees to it and as way to expunge his troubled past behind him. Much in the same route as ""Dances With Wolves"", Algren is leading a very inexperienced army against a very well-trained group of samurai warriors led by the oracular Katsumoto (Watanabe). Algren's army is defected and Algren is captured. During his abduction, Algren starts to progressively bond with the knowledgeable but understanding Katsumoto as each start to learn more about the purposes of war and what it means to each of them. As time progresses, Algren starts to feel a more spiritual vibe about the samurai way of life and the not so glamorous depiction of war by the Japanese Emperor and what his modernized fighters represent. The events eventually transpires to an all-out climactic battle and who in the end comes out on top. So what was it that stood out like sore thumb about this movie? It must be the fact that Tom Cruise doesn't look like he's cut out for a period piece film. He tries to fit in, but he can't really quite grip in breaking away from the fact he's living in the 1860's and not 2003. His acting is very well executed he just lacks that connection that catches him off guard and that can be a problem when the audience feels it too. Fortunately everything else seems to work out very well. The production values are quite spot on, the locality of this film was top of the line and the costumes and the props give you that feeling that you've returned to the Meiji period in Japan. For a movie just shy of three hours long, Zwick succeeds in keeping the narrative sharp and the editing well packaged and the dialogue the freedom to go at its own pace. The audience also gets to observe what samurai life is like and the predicament that Algren finds himself. This can be done thank to some brilliant photography by John Toll and an excellent score by Hans Zimmer, we know this film is not playing with kid's gloves. The action really keeps the pace go by very quickly and it really flies by that you never once have to look at your watch a single second. Sure those who've studied Japanese history or culture will find a major hole in the plot. It seems that the samurai culture is unapologetic in glorification. It seems the feudal samurai people were dominate over the peasants. What they failed to understand was that the Japanese Emperor was catering modern warfare to all the people of Japan and not just the more wealthy samurai. Some of these civilians see this as an advantage and those who rebelled missed what the intentions were and feared they'll lose what power they've been holding. Overall this is very well made film, however it lack in some areas where it loses some of the more effective ways it could have been. If given the right performer would've made a big difference.",The Last Samurai
77,winner55,The film television actually did better,3,5 July 2005,"There's nothing wrong about this film - except pretty much everything. I.e., the film is fairly well directed, with enough money in production to give it a good look. The problem is that it is poorly thought-through, miscast, and politically and historically ill-conceived.Actually, a much better story along similar lines was produced years ago on American television: ""Shogun"", with Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune. That pains me to say. While I love Toshiro Mifune (hard to dislike, really), I hated Chamberlain and thought ""Shogun"" one of the more boring episodes in American TV history. But, dammit, the writers of that ""mini-series"" actually did their homework and got it right! Anyone familiar with Japanese culture had to give them the grudging respect that they had neither ""Westernized"" it nor subverted it.Alas, the same cannot be claimed for ""The Last Samurai"". Watanabe, at 6'2', and with the most pale skin and bland features of any Japanese actor I can recall, is as about as typical of 19th Century samurai as his co-lead, Tom Cruise, who is as typical of 19th Century Americans as, say, Michael Jackson. Both over-emote embarrassingly. In America, this is as forgettable as Kevin Costner, but in Japan it's virtually criminal.The rest of the actors all do fairly well. The depictions of life in a Japanese farming village are not insulting - they're just out of place. Samurai lived in the manor, they had little to do with the farmers supporting them. The battle scenes are very well choreographed, but utterly detached; I felt I was watching a soccer match between two teams I didn't care for. AS for the politics - did the producers, director, et all., not realize that the writers had essentially written apology for the eventual rise of the Tojo junta, which invaded China (to the tune of 36 million dead), and bombed Pearl Harbor? Not even right-wing novelist (and leader of a failed coup) Yukio Mishma had that audacity! To the Japanese right, Tojo was an embarrassment, to the left a shame. In fact he himself, converted to Christianity just prior to his hanging, hoped he wouldn't burn in hell; but no other Earthling agreed with that hope, even the Emperor condemned him. To be fair, probably even the writers of this distasteful script did not know what they were doing. Neither did the film's investors. or they would never have sunk so much money into such a shoddy script.See ""Shogun"" instead - or, better, rent some films by Kurosawa or Mizoguchi. (Actually, even some early Godzilla movies would be more representative.... Japan has a great culture; Tom Cruise is a bad actor; do the math yourself.)_",The Last Samurai
78,valadas,The Path of Honour,7,22 January 2004,"If you take for granted that a Japanese samurai in 1876 can speak impeccable English you will most certainly love this movie because all the rest is practically flawless and it's a really unmatched work of art, romantic and epic. We watch here the conflict between two civilizations, cultures and ways of life: a dying one based in honour, heroism, valour and loyalty and the other based in greed for power, disloyalty and meanness. The outcome of this unfair fight takes place in the battlefield through scenes hardly reached till now in any movie I have seen before. The brilliant direction of this movie is not affected by the apparent easiness and lightness of the final scenes which leaves us with a few doubts from the angle of the logic and likelihood of that part of the plot. But like an Italian would say: ""se non e vero e bene trovato"" (if it's not true it's well invented). The main character whose role is performed by Tom Cruise is very well depicted, showing us the spiritual evolution of the soldier who goes to Japan with the charge of teaching and training the new army, haunted by the memories of massacres of innocent women and children that he watched in his own country perpetrated by the army he had served till then. In contact with the rapidly changing Japanese reality his mind suffers a complete catharsis which leads him first to abandon alcohol into which he had taken refuge, and then progressively to assimilate the moribund cultural values of the people whom in principle he should help to fight. On the whole a beautiful movie to be seen in terms of images and which will make you think a lot of things over.",The Last Samurai

81,MartianOctocretr5,Well executed movie; one major flaw,5,3 July 2006,"Excellent study of the Samurai culture. While the benevolence of these warriors is questionable from history, this movie makes a very earnest attempt at portraying their intentions as honorable.Ken Watanabe as the leader of the Samurai colony shows intense power and charisma in this crucial role. He is a brave warrior, a gifted commander, and a master of all things Samurai; yet he is fierce and ruthless in battle. He takes a captured US soldier under his wing, and converts that man from an enemy to a friend and ally. His new comrade in arms becomes as imposing a force on the field of battle as himself. The supporting cast of Samurai warriors and their families do magnificent jobs in making their characters believable and sympathetic.The action choreography is handled extremely well, also. When blades are swung at innocent children, you feel intense fear for their safety. The US army serves as the dangerous invader, and this is accomplished well. William Atherton makes a fearful bad guy, as do others.But then, ""Samurai"" dishonors itself with a fatal blunder.It was like the the movie committed hari-kari on itself, casting Tom Cruise as the lead. Usually, Tom's ""deer-caught-in-the-headlights"" stare can be hidden behind intense action or a particularly good performance by other actors. This movie had both, but is still slashed to pieces by would-be-Samurai Tom. He handles a sword like a kid playing T-Ball. His intensity as a Samurai is about as electrifying and believable as a ""Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots"" toy.His performance reveals nothing about the character, why the character changes, why he becomes a traitor, or throws in with his former enemies. It's almost a sin how his lamentable acting job diminishes what could have been a powerful story.",The Last Samurai
82,DJAkin,"Akira Kurosawa, eat your heart out!!",10,20 December 2003,"Ken Watanabe is amazing in this wonderful movie about the Samurai.  As a student of the Samurai ways, I can appreciate the character of Katsumoto. No other character in the history of film conveys the samurai ways more than Katsumoto.   No, I do not fight with swords etc.  But I do live my life in the same thread as Katsumoto!!  I am an actual, real-life samurai who follows the code of the BUSHIDO!!! (Jake doesn't know this that I ama in a way, Samurai). Samurai affiliation is not limited to race, so Tom Cruise being one does not fall into the realm of impossibility. I am a white man and am a samurai. Of course, this amazing movie was shot in Japan, specifically Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan!!  Many of the scenes were shot in California as well.  Anyway, the movie was good.  Sure, it was kind of like Dances with Wolves in a way.  Tom Cruise, as always, DELIVERS THE GOODS.  This is right up there with the best of Cruise.  He looked kick ass in his samurai outfit.  Sure, I know all about Akira Kurosawa and how great he is.  I am the first to admit that I am a student of his methods and have watched the Seven Samurai in great detail.  I have seen the commentary as well.  But let's get something strait, Akira Kurosawa is Akira Kurosawa. Akira Kurosawa is not Ken Wantanbe or Edward Zwick.  The goods were delivered in this movie.  The performance of Ken Watanabe is pure Samurai. I mean, he looked like one.  This movie delivered on all counts in terms of how the Samurai are.   The movie was very accurate.  Samurai do not die in shame.  Samurai are proud.  Samurai devote every waking moment to perfecting their chosen craft.  The Samurai are a very noble people.  It's too bad that the Samurai's values are not more prevalent in today's world.  As for the role of Omura, effortlessly played by Masato Harada, it was nothing short of miraculous.  I was impressed to see how scared he was to get killed by Katsumoto at the end.  In fact, when Katsumoto took his own life at the end, Omura was kind of mad, because in a way, Katsumoto won.  I thought that Tom Cruise was going to kill himself at that moment also.   Yes,  this movie FOCUSED more on the character of Katsumoto than anything.  Katsumoto has the oscar nod this year, not Tom Cruise.   Sure, Cruise was great, but Katsumoto was amazing.   I also liked when Tom Cruise screamed for Sake.  And that fight scene with the wooden swords was great.  Tom Cruise would not give up fighting the amazing Seizo Fukumoto who played the silent Samurai.  That was great.  It was cool how they eventually became friendsand Fukumoto even made sure Tom's armour was on correctly.   If you ever get the chance to VISIT JAPAN, I suggest you DO IT.

84,dunmore_ego,Samurai Hei,7,2 May 2006,"I love sushi. I also love Toshiro Mifune. Guess that makes me a prime candidate for a samurai warrior - at least, that's all it seems to take for a Westerner in this movie to wear kamishimo and wield katana. Despite that annoyance, this film crafts a sincere portrayal of an outsider undergoing an assimilation into Samurai culture without Western disparagement or cheap stereotype satire. *The Last Samurai* is a grandiose film, sweeping, majestic, inspiring - even WITH Tom Cruise in it.The late 1800's saw Japanese businessmen convince Imperial Japan that the shogunate government advocating military rule through shogun and samurai (*bakufu*) - was fettering the country to the dark ages and hindering their financial and technological advancement. In transforming feudal Japan into a modern nation, they did, in fact, hire Westerners to train their outmoded armies in the Way of the Gun.As imbecilic as that may sound (bringing haughty Yankees into a milieu where blade technology had attained a zenith in construction and killing prowess in the hands of the samurai millennia before the Americas were a twinkle in Europe's eye), the gun did historically overrun the sword as the primary weapon of warfare in Imperial Japan.This flensing of *bakufu* came to a head during the reign of Emperor Meiji, by all accounts as naïve, indecisive and ignorant of the best political path for his country as he is portrayed by young Shichinosuke Nakamura in this movie. From this ""historical context,"" this film's plot centers around one last village of renegade samurai, led by Katsumoto (the leviathan Ken Watanabe, out-acting the movie's titular ""star"" by acres), obstructing the Way of the New Government, embodied by Meiji.To combat Katsumoto's outlaws, Meiji's CEO analogues rescue a burned-out lush of a Civil War vet, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), from his Dudley Moore *Arthur* impersonations, to train their ""modern"" soldiery, a conscription of weaselly, panty-wetting nerds, whose ineptitude in battle rivals that of *Star Wars* stormtroopers who trip over twigs and knock themselves unconscious when chased by Ewoks.Ergo, it is no surprise when Algren's Benny Hill-ian troops are decimated during their first battle, Algren being taken alive as Katsumoto's prisoner.Through the winter months, Algren is imprisoned by the natural isolation of the samurai village. Ostensibly to learn of his enemy's tactics, Katsumoto engages Algren in philosophical conversations, whereby Algren  begrudgingly at first - comes to learn the Way of *Bushido*, the samurai honor code, embracing it with a passion when he finds it fills the vacuum in his guts that had turned him to the Way of Dudley Moore's Arthur. In being an American soldier, he found only shame where he thought there was honor (when ordered to kill women and children); now, in this most unlikely place  the village of his enemy  he is startled to find honor once more in *bushido*.It is during this powerfully moving second act that the movie simultaneously excels and fails: excels because of its quietude, its controlled passages defining Algren's recapturing of his humanity lost  and fails because Algren becomes too adept too quickly as a samurai swordsman. There is foreshadowing that he is a marksman and like most Civil War officers, he is issued a saber, yet all it takes is one *Rocky* montage and he is besting his fencing tutor, Ujio (Hiroyuki Sanada, who bears a marked resemblance to Toshiro Mifune, so was aces in my book from the get-go  giving Tom Cruise a beating with a *bokken* in the rain upon their first meeting only increased his net worth.)It would have been enough that Algren embrace the creed and find ""life in every breath,"" but in following the Bushido For Dummies handbook and having Algren become a master swordsman in the space of one winter (and mastering the language to boot), the film ironically adopts the superior westerner stance that it fooled us into believing it was trying to avoid, thereby cheapening the lifelong devotion, dedication and discipline of true samurai.That ain't right.Vainglorious Yankee spirit triumphing once again  from a country where any kind of dedication to a discipline is disparaged; where collective bone-laziness has created such ""time-saving"" devices as the salad shooter, the leaf-blower, the workout video and exercise machines that end up as clothes racks  THIS is the society whom we are meant to believe can send one of its flock into the heart of a millennia-aged culture and assimilate it in one winter? Turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese oh I don't THINK so.When Algren is delivered back into ""civilization,"" he finds he cannot re-assimilate into the shameful *dishabille* of his own people, so allies with the samurai against his own army.Thankfully, no computer warriors were killed on the final battlefield, hence, these rambunctious scenes resembled Mel Gibson's last-of-the-HUMAN battle epics, *Braveheart*. Gloriously so.An unnecessary romance blossoms between Algren and the wife of the warrior he killed before being taken prisoner. Though it might be construed as Algren attaining such a level of respect that the warrior's widow is now considering him fresh meat (when once she considered him as smelly as a pig) the real reason is because this film sports a bankable Hollywood Man-Toy which necessitates a gratuitous romance for the chick demographic.Director Edward Zwick and writers, John Logan, Marshall Herskovitz and Zwick himself might have forged a ten-star movie had they not made Algren such a superlative warrior and then opted for Hollywood Happy Ending protocol; steering so close to immortality, then insulting us with a paint-by-numbers.Still, watching a samurai film without Toshiro Mifune is like eating sushi without fish.(Read this review unabridged at: http://www.poffysmoviemania.com/LastSamurai.html)",The Last Samurai

The Last Samurai is truly an epic action drama that engages you emotionally and soon, everything is felt. Everything.Tom Cruise is really impressive in this film as the role is completely different from what he has played in most films. Yes, he's an action hero once again but with a difference this time. Watch the film and see it yourself. Ken Watanabe is truly the scene stealer. His well written character will be loved. The rest of the cast is also quite decent, but it's mostly these two men who are the stars of the film.The action is beautifully cut, with sword fights, epic scale battles and a number of martial arts fights impressively crafted for a larger than life experience. Dialogues are quite philosophical and deeply impactful in nature.But perhaps the strongest aspect of the film which makes each and every frame so impressive is the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. It' doesn't end with the film. It stays with you. It completely does justice to the film, especially the action scenes and emotional moments.This film is more character driven than plot driven so don't expect a film with twists and turns or heavy plot development. Just enjoy the character drama, soundtrack, dialogues and the exhilarating action. It's one film I'll never forget in my life. Very strongly recommended!",The Last Samurai
86,areatw,Technically great but goes through too many lulls,6,5 August 2017,"There are plenty of positive points to make about 'The Last Samurai'. It's a beautiful film to watch, not only because of the stunning landscapes and setting, but also the way in which the battle sequences are crafted and the impressive attention to detail. It's difficult to fault the film based on its technical merits.From an average viewers perspective, however, it's far from the perfect picture. There are one too many lulls for my liking - dull patches that don't add much to the story or film as a whole. Also, although there's nothing particularly wrong with Tom Cruise's performance in this film, he doesn't really come across as a natural fit to the role. There are a few actors I would have probably chosen over him.",The Last Samurai
87,PatrynXX,Fiction for movie sake.,9,25 December 2003,"(spoilers)While Titanic certainly encouraged the idea.  (fiction stories within real events)  The Last Samurai doesn't do this quite so well.  Not that this is a bad thing.  As the movie is so well made you leave the theater wondering if it was a true story or not.  And it's very hard to find out if it's a work of fiction.  It is.  But it's inspired by legend.  On it's own the movie is a wonderful treat.  I say this without having seen Master and Commander yet. But so far this one takes the cake.  (unless I'm talking Whale Rider of course.  no movie will ever touch that one.  It's what I call a perfect movie.  nothings wrong with it.)  I think this movie is Tom's best since Far & Away.  It's been awhile since then and he needed one.  I might not agree with him on many occasions, but I've always enjoyed his acting.

88,mstomaso,Beautiful,10,21 May 2005,"After my third viewing, I can finally admit that this film has me. I enjoyed it during its theatrical run, enjoyed it more the second time around, and now, I can only say that I love it. The cast is exemplary. Tom Cruise is so good in this film that it is very often easy to forget he is Tom Cruise. Easily his most powerful role and best performance since Jerry Maguire. Ken Watanabe, however, is incredible in every scene - acting with a rare sensitivity and intensity and breathing life into a character much larger and more human than the grand story of which he is a part. Though the entire cast is excellent, I feel that I must also single out Koyuki and Shichinosuke Nakamura for, respectively, the female lead and the emperor, for the subtle strength and believability they each give their very challenging roles.The story takes place during the early modernization of Japan, in the 1870s and 1880s. The Emperor's power has been weakened by the political and economic power of his cabinet, by his young age, and by the political influence of the United States and other western powers pulling the strings of his cabinet and supplying modern weaponry and tactics to the modernizing Japanese army. Cruise plays Captain Allgren, an alcoholic veteran who has seen and participated in too many massacres of innocent people, and is offered an opportunity to reclaim some of his honor by helping to train the Japanese military in the use of firearms. When he arrives in Japan, we learn that the first test of the Japanese army and its new weapons will be against a rebellious group of samurai who believe themselves to be in the service of the Emperor and Japan, but resist the Emperor's cabinet and the influence of western nations. In the power void left by a passive emperor, Japan seems poised to enter into a civil war against its own values, faith and honor. During the first attack on the Samurai, Allgren is captured by the Samurai and begins a spiritual, physical and philosophical journey which will bring him a level of self-respect his own culture could never supply.My interpretation of this journey is that Allgren has found a place and people that offer him redemption, where, in his own world, he can find none. But Allgren's is only a small part of the story - which ultimately revolves around what is right for Japan, for the subjectivity of a whole nation, and how to portray such a subject from its own perspective. Traditional Japan is treated with empathy here, not aggrandizing exaggeration, as some of the film's critics seem to suggest. This is not a film about what is objectively right and wrong, but a film about struggling to understand and empower tradition as a means to control and benefit from change. I find no grand moral statement here, but rather an intense, sympathetic, human drama with a strong sense of honor and sacrifice.Edward Zwick has made a film which operates well at every level, carrying simple but profound philosophical ideas, but avoiding the mistake of making these ideas and the characters that express them super-heroic. Ultimately, this beautifully shot film conveys powerful messages about war, tradition, ethics, honor and culture, which, though not particularly original, are sensitively and intelligently brought forward. There is a lot of action, including some remarkably well-acted sword fighting and martial artistry, but none of it seems unnecessary and the whole film is truly tightly woven. My highest recommendation.",The Last Samurai
89,sarastro7,Phantastic!,9,29 March 2006,"Not being a big fan of Tom Cruise, I put off watching this movie for a couple of years. Now I had the chance to borrow the DVD from a friend, and I just watched it, amazed all the way through. Dammit, this is a movie that delivers! It is the most emotionally moving film I have seen for ages (well, since Monday, anyway... but that was a special case) - I lost count of the many, many scenes that made me misty-eyed -, and at the same time it was a great action movie, containing plenty of both swordplay and gun-play. Not to mention history. It focused on a crucial historical moment, where the old Samurai ways of feudal Japan had to give way to the vagaries of the modern world and its modern weapons and dirty politics.The acting was all-round great, and the production values were simply astounding. A movie of incredible beauty and power.As far as the debate on whether it's an art movie as such; no, I don't feel there is a ""high art"" aspect to this movie. I think of it as a serious - and seriously good - movie, produced by people who understood how to make drama convincing, and who were experts on cinematography. But I will say that it comes CLOSE to being an art movie; it certainly has enough poetic moments, both visually and emotionally, to make such a claim stick. But a movie doesn't have to be an art movie in order to be good. The Last Samurai doesn't suffer from not being an art movie. It is the movie it is supposed to be; a highly competent and evocative one.The only reason I don't give this movie a 10 out of 10 is that it romanticized the Samurai too much. In reality, they too were embroiled in dirty politics, and most often never questioned authority (and if they thought that their authority figures were all honorable, they were fooling themselves). But it is true there is a certain purity in their concept of honor, and in many ways that honor was the basis and the substance of their civilization. The movie does a good job presenting this honor from its best angle, and as a work of art it is most certainly entitled to do so.A triumphant and beautiful achievement. I will buy the DVD tomorrow.9 out of 10.",The Last Samurai
90,jon.h.ochiai,Honor in Life and Death,10,11 January 2004,"In a pivotal scene in ""The Last Samurai"" a key character says ""It's my time..."". That captures Bushido (The Way of the Samurai) in Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise's ""The Last Samurai"": About honor and choosing the path of one's life. Rarely has a major motion picture done so, in such a moving and inspiring way. Edward Zwick directs a wonderful screenplay by John Logan, Zwick, and Marshall Herskovitz. Zwick masterfully weaves a story about a culture, Bushido that values honor, courage, compassion, and a man's life being complete and at peace. Regarding destiny, Tom Cruise's Captain Nate Algren says ""...No... But I think a man cannot know his destiny. He can only do what he can, until his destiny is revealed."" Zwick balances Bushido as ""Life in every breath..."" with LIVING with honor. Tom Cruise gives perhaps his best performance as Nate Algren, the U.S. Captain who becomes samurai.It is 1876, and Capt. Algren (Cruise) is a drunk, burnt out calvary war hero who is a spokesman for Winchester rifles at amusement shows. He is recruited by his former commander Col. Bagley (a very slick Tony Goldwyn) and a Japanese businessman Omura (played with great duplicity by Masato Harada) to train the Japan Emperor's Army in modern warfare to defeat the Emperor's former adviser and Sensei, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), who is samurai. Though Bagley betrayed Algren in the past, he accepts the post. According Algren (Cruise) killing ""tribal"" leaders is his only gift. Algren though broken, demonstrates the samurai spirit. Contrary to Algren's advice an unprepared Imperial Army engages Katsumoto's army, and are defeated. Algren fights valiantly, but is captured.This is where the amazing story telling begins. Katsumoto wishes to learn about his enemy, Algren. In a strange twist of fate, he has his sister, Taka (Koyuki), care for Algren-- her ""karma"". There is more to this (see the movie). In Katsmoto's village Algren trains in the way of the samurai. Zwick illustrates this eloquently. He does not romanticize the samurai, rather paints a complete picture. The samurai would kill his enemy or take his own life in dishonor when commanded. Along with the rigorous martial arts training, Zwick shows the samurai meditating (Shinto and Zen), composing poetry (haiku), in tea ceremony, and practicing calligraphy. Bushido is a dichotomy. I also got an insight into my own Japanese culture that everything is below the surface. During a bokken (wooden sword) training scene with Algren and Katsmoto's second Ujio ( masterful martial artist, Hiroyuki Sanada), he learns one of the keys of mastery-- mu-shin (""no mind""). Cruise performs the martial arts sequences expertly. He intensely trained in Aikido and Iaido-- signatured in his posture and gate wearing the hakama and kimono. All the fight scenes are exquisite. World class martial artists are involved in ""Samurai"".Ken Watanabe is a noble and commanding presence as Katsumoto. He is truly Samurai. He is a great actor-- he is just being. His transformation from Algren's enemy to partner is key to the story. Whether Cruise's Algren fights beside Watanabe's Katsumoto in an assassination attempt or in their personal conversations, their bond embodies the respect of two strong, smart men, who have seen too much war and death. Their relationship is poignant and inspiring. After the winter Algren returns to Kyoto and to the Emperor's Army, but his heart and soul are samurai. Soon he must choose his loyalty as a matter of honor. In a great scene Taka explains to Algren that her son, Higen (Sosuke Ikematsu), is a child who does not understand Bushido, and is afraid of losing Algren. Speaking in Japanese Algren tells Higen that his always afraid in war. It is the paradox of the honor conversation: living honorably is as important as dying honorably.The Japanese cast is incredible. Koyuki as Taka is amazing and stunningly beautiful. She is the traditional Japanese woman who downplays her strength and wisdom. Yet, she is the emotional anchor of ""Samurai"". Shin Koyamada as Nobutada (Katsumoto's son) is brash with a great warrior spirit. Sosuke Ikematsu is touching as Taka's young son growing up samurai.This is Tom Cruise's best performance. Aside from mastering the peripheral elements like martial arts and speaking Japanese, his performance as Nate Algren is captivating. It is not formula. The transformation from burn out war hero to the honorable leader of men is moving. You see it in the actor's eyes, and hear it in his voice as Algren begins to care about and honor people, and himself. Algren's path to be a peace with himself is the most human and noble of all endeavors. Cruise does it right.Katsumoto says at one point in the movie that the Samurai are no longer necessary. Algren says what could be more necessary than honor, courage, and compassion? Zwick and Cruise remind us of this, from a culture long gone, in a very special movie. We honor them for doing so.",The Last Samurai
91,DarthBill,Dances With Samurai,4,17 June 2004,"It's part Braveheart and part Dances With Wolves, this movie deemed both insane and not insane enough. Tom Cruise, in what might be one of his better performances, plays an unhappy Union soldier on the skids who is hired by the Japanese government to come down to Japan and train their men in the way of modern warfare and help them destroy the stubborn samurai who refuse to bow down, namely their charismatic leader Ken Watanabe. But Tom gets captured and he eventually falls in love with the Samurai way of life and the ideals that Ken and his cohorts cling to. He also falls in love with Ken's sister, who's husband he killed. Does it end triumphantly or tragically? Alas I cannot say.Part of me really wanted to enjoy this film and to a certain end that part of me did enjoy the film. The film is far from perfect but it's not bad for what it is even if it does borrow a lot of elements from earlier films and restages them. Ken Watanabe is very compelling even when he spouts bad dialogue (one can only imagine how many more diverse roles he's played in his native Japan).",The Last Samurai
92,Holt344,"The Last Samurai, an acclaimed epic that deserved each nomination.",10,4 August 2020,"The Last Samurai is a fine gem that brings justice to the Japanese culture, it's not 100% historical accurate but its close by the sources I have read. It's about Nathan Algren which is brilliantly played by Tom Cruise, in one of his best performances as an captain that suffers from PTSD and alcoholism. What the writers, director and Tom do the right is that they have made this character you dislike and then we get to follow his journey which makes him a lot more likeable, a good protagonist. Nathan Algren is tasked with training the Japanese army to defeat the rebellion that's lead by the samurai Katsumoto. Both of the leading actors, Tom and Ken was incredible in this movie truly Oscar worthy performances.The whole production is incredible and has so many great crew members that brought this masterpiece to the cinema and to us viewers. Edward Zwick produced, cowrote the screenplay and directed it, he's a capable filmmaker for this large scale epic and he managed to create just that, a large scale epic. There's some stunning cinematography in the movie, so is the sets and beautiful landscape. It was filmed in New Zealand but it really got that Japanese feel to it so I was immersed either way. One of my favorite things in the movie is the huge amount of detail that went into the research in the armors and katanas, it shows their interest in making this as the samurai's look like real Samurai if its the armor, katanas or masks.To one of the big things of the movie, and it's the battles. They are massive, entertaining and Suspenseful, and even emotional. They look real. The choreography is well done and it's execution is even better.To finish off the review, this was the third time watching this masterpiece and it's my opinion. It was my father who showed me it when I was little and here I am having gone back to it years later. Having grown up, I see movies in different light and now I really see the deep story they have written and told. Everyone should watch it once, it's a movie I will never forget.",The Last Samurai
93,petra_ste,Dances with Samurai,5,24 March 2008,"Imagine someone giving you a neatly wrapped, elegant package: you open it and it's empty. That's what blockbusters like The Last Samurai feel like: great photography, costumes and set design, an A-list star surrounded by solid character actors, a few nicely choreographed scenes... and yet it's vapid, pointless fare.Lt. John Dunbar - I'm sorry, I meant Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise) - trains the Japanese Emperor's troops against rebel Samurai led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Of course Algren is the only survivor of a disastrous skirmish caused by his superiors' arrogant incompetence, of course he is captured, of course he discovers the nobility of the Samurai way of life contrasting with the sleazy mediocrity of their enemies - not the young Emperor, who, of course, is misguided but noble, although not as noble as Katsumoto, who of course comes across as a mix between Crazy Horse and Obi-wan Kenobi.Question of the week: what on Earth does an American character have to do with this distinctly Japanese tale? Well, obviously he gives western audiences a white hero to identify with! Because we couldn't possibly relate to a story with only Japanese characters! (Sarcasm detectors should be beeping at this point). It goes without saying Algren becomes an accomplished Samurai in a ludicrously short time, finds the love of a pretty widow - funny how in this kind of movie NOTHING is worth doing (no quest, no fight for an ideal) if you don't get laid in the process - and is quickly worshipped by the same people he had set out to destroy. In fact, there are so many scenes in which he saves the day and is gazed at with awe that I wanted to throw something at the screen.Cruise is a generally solid actor but here he gives a standard ""stoic, brooding Cruise"" performance. Watanabe is excellent, dignified and charismatic; Connolly and Spall are pretty good; the whole thing is as glossy as a luxury car commercial. The result is an oriental remake of Dances with Wolves, only without guts - and, although the last battle is slick eye-candy, hearing comparisons between The Last Samurai and the works of the late Akira Kurosawa is truly depressing.5,5/10",The Last Samurai
94,juliankennedy23,Dances with Samurai,8,9 January 2005,"The Last Samurai score 8/10: I admit I greeted this movie with low expectations. The idea of Tom Cruise as the last Samurai was laughable. The movie completely suspended this disbelief right until the horribly awful last scene. Tom Cruise plays a drunken Civil War hero who hired by the Japanese government to modernize their army is captured by the Samurai rebels and falls in love with their doomed way of life.And what a life. Every shot of the Samurai village is postcard perfect almost to the point of unintended parody. Like Robert Redford's take on Montana in ""Legends of the Fall"", every view is spectacular, every sunset is orange, every leaf is colorful and falls just so and all the characters are freshly scrubbed and dressed in their Sunday best. You wouldn't be half surprised to see Hobbits pop out at any moment. Of course the old time Samurai are romanticized to the nth degree. Historically the Samurai at this point resembled Afghan warlords resisting a long overdue central government rather than the honorable colorfully armored knights that are depicted. (Samurai no more wore armor in the late 18th century than the British army did.) Yet the picture despite one or two faults works. The acting, with one exception is uniformly excellent. The battle scenes are plentiful and full of surprise and the pacing is good. On the dark side newcomer Nakamura Shichinosuke plays the Japanese emperor like he was channeling Michael Jackson. The voice and mannerisms of the gloved one is as out of place for a Japanese emperor than it would be for the Pope. His strangely self effacing dialogue doesn't help his cause, yet it truly is his performance that is cringe worthy. In addition the last scene is an awful Hollywood copout. I still recommend The Last Samurai highly however as a thinking mans action movie.",The Last Samurai
95,gregsrants,An Epic film that is not without its flaws,8,5 December 2003,"While researching for this review, I again marveled at the filmography of Mr. Tom Cruise as I do with each new film to which he is attached.  Like him or hate him, you cannot neglect the fact that this actor likes to change pace and takes roles that are so different from the last.  Just look at his last five films for example.  He has portrayed a detective (Minority Report), a tormented publisher (Vanilla Sky), an inspirational speaker (Magnolia), a doctor (Eyes Wide Shut) and a sports agent (Jerry McGuire). Each role was such a departure from the last and each were successful Hollywood vehicles.  Enter Cruise's next stab at celluloid, The Last Samurai.  When I first heard that he was attempting this film, the title gave me reservations as to whether this was a misguided career move.  After all, those of us that grew up in the 80's remember Cruise more for his young pop-culture roles in films like Top Gun and Cocktail, so to think that he could divert our minds from his Risky Business role dancing in his underwear to being an American Samurai in Japan, is asking a whole lot.But the movie did have something immediately going in its favor.  Edward Zwick, who directed Glory and Legends of the Fall was at the helm and the film was co-written by John Logan who penned 2000's Oscar favorite Gladiator.  So there I was, popcorn in hand as the lights dimmed, and it didn't take long for me to get caught up in the fact based backdrop of the Japanese civil war between the Emperor's troops and the last of the samurai. The movie's plot is really quite simple.  Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a war-hero in General Custards battles with the American Indians, who is recruited by the Emperor to help train his troops using new weaponry from the west (guns, cannons).  Algren agrees for a ridiculous fee, but is forced into battle before he believes his troops are ready, and they are defeated and Nathan is captured by the samurai.While a prisoner in the Samurai camp, Algren begins to respect the ways of it's people (everything they do is to perfection'), and befriends the family of one of the soldiers he killed on the battlefield.  Fall soon turns to spring, and Algren and the leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto (played by Ken Watanabe), have turned their captive-captor relationship into a mutual friendship, and when Katsumoto is taken prisoner by the Emperor and sentenced to death, Algren orchestrates an escape and the two head back to the village to begin a war strategy to fight the oncoming troops.The Last Samurai is a film that will be classified as an epic due to its exotic locations, cast of thousands, costumes, battle scenes and running time (144+ minutes).   Edward Zwick actually does a very commendable job in maintaining a story amongst all the visuals, and Tom Cruise is able to dig deep and put together a fairly convincing portrayal of a man that is torn between honor, love and responsibility.  But for all its positives, there are many flaws also.  The thought of an American riding along side the Samurai just doesn't fit right  especially in today's climate, it was just another example of America putting their nose where it doesn't belong.  The scene where Algren is beaten repeatedly by a samurai warrior and continues to rise every time he is submitted to the ground, played more like something out of a Marvel comic book rather than a real life will to show up the enemy.  The Last Samurai is a good movie despite its obvious shortfalls.  The battle scenes are visual feasts for the eyes and ears, and the, and Zwick moves things at a rather healthy pace leading up to the eventual climax.  It's not as memorable as his last war film, Glory, but The Last Samurai will still garnish a nomination or 10 when it comes time for the Academy to elect the best of 2003.And my final word goes back to you, Mr. Cruise.  Thank you for at least trying new things each time in front of the camera and not stereotyping yourself like so many of the other 80's superstars did in their careers (paging Sylvester Stallonepaging Sylvester Stallone).  Keep it up and we will forgive you for self-indulging yourself with such fare as the Mission Impossible series.",The Last Samurai

It is in these terrifying, agonizing moments of sword-versus-rifle battle that Zwick comes closest to emulating his obvious hero, Akira Kurosawa, and manages to comment on the tragedy and insanity of war.Flashbacks are used unnecessarily to try to enforce Cruise's sense of guilt in participating in the the slaughter of the Indians (so we will understand his desire to defend another endangered species, the Samurai). As the apparent title character, Ken Watanabe pretty much steals the show as Katsumodo, the SAGE warrior leader whom Cruise befriends. A Japanese actress known only as Koyuki plays the heartbreakingly beautiful wife of a Samurai Cruise kills, who Cruise grows close to. But perhaps most amazing of the Japanese cast is the small boy who plays one of her sons. Unexpectedly expressive, emotional, and charming, he's the type of face you would expect to see in a film by the great Kurosawa. Or Lean. Or Ford.All technical aspects, from production and costume design to visual effects, are excellent. Hans Zimmer's score, incorporating traditional wood flutes and thunderous drums, is at times touching and evocative, at times bombastic and unnecessarily loud.

100,FilmOtaku,Dances with Samurai,5,24 January 2005,"Directed by Edward Zwick, ""The Last Samurai"" is the story of Civil War veteran Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a man who is fighting his inner demons that originated from some actions against Native Americans that he didn't feel so good about. So he drinks a lot and is a freelance military adviser. His latest assignment is to go to Tokyo with some former colleagues and train the Emperor's troops in modern weaponry so they can defeat the last of the country's Samurai. During their first battle, he is captured by the Samurai who then take him under their wing, helping him heal his wounds and teaching him how to fight, etc. When the time comes to return back to his ""rightful"" place, he makes the choice to fight with the Samurai, who he now relates to most of all.I'll say it right out of the box I really didn't like this movie that much. The film drowns in clichés: The slow motion fight scenes, the shots of Cruise in silhouette at sundown, practicing his moves, the screams of ""Noooooooooo"" as the incredibly wounded men charge, and Cruise getting knocked down five times during one of his early sparring matches, yet refusing to stay down because he's just a scrappy guy these are just a couple of the things I found myself rolling my eyes at. I rolled my eyes at those scenes, I chuckled at the fact that he managed to keep a perfectly trimmed beard and clothes that miraculously cleaned themselves after a fight in the rain and mud, and was actually howling during Cruise's detox scene in which he yells ""Sake!!!!!!!!!!"" over and over. But I was downright confused after the fight in the alley between Omura's henchmen and Cruise; we experienced the fight once, then suddenly he goes slo-mo and we have to watch the entire fight all over again. Why?! Don't even get me started on the ending. When he walked through the door to chat with the Emperor I almost fell out of my seat; I couldn't believe the film would seriously end that way.I did not hate everything about the film. I thought that Ken Watanabe was phenomenal, and I really liked the fact that they spoke a lot of Japanese. I can't stand it when films think we assume that everyone in the world speaks flawless English. I think that the decision to keep the native language as pervasive as it was, was a good thing. The ninja scene was good, and there were also some great shots; particularly landscapes. However, these things only raise my opinion up from an extremely low position, they don't save the film for me. It was ironic that I watched this when I did because I watched ""Rashomon"" the day before, a film that was made 55 years prior, on a tiny fraction of the budget of ""The Last Samurai"", which got me thinking about Kurosawa. Of course, it is very difficult to compare Kurosawa to most filmmakers of this genre because he is pure genius, but conversely, it is sad that a film that does have the benefit of finances and precedents could make such a pale comparison. Also, when did someone decide that Tony Goldwyn was going to be THE bad guy in every movie ever made? It's become almost cliché at this point; go figure that he would be a part of THIS film.I suppose if you like Tom Cruise, historical epics, or action films you should see ""The Last Samurai"", but it is barely mediocre, and although I had low expectations going in, I was still very disappointed. Merely because of the handful of positive aspects of the film, I give it a 5/10, a generous assignation in my opinion.--Shelly",The Last Samurai
101,EijnarAmadeus,Samurai art,7,15 May 2004,"Tom Cruise is probably Hollywood's most popular actor, and he's been doing movies like COCKTAIL, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, JERRY MAGUIRE, MINORITY REPORT and VANILLA SKY, and well, here he delivers probably his best performance. Although maybe MINORITY REPORT is his best film, this is without doubt then a very worthy second place. Nathan Algren is a retired soldier that's drinking heavily and doesn't have any kind of job. But soon he's back into the military where his mission is to lead a bunch of un-trained Japanese men into battle against the feared samurais. Well, the samurais wins the battle easily and Algren fights for his life alone, but instead of being killed he gets taken prisoner by the samurais and soon lead to their village. Here he soon understands that the samurais is good people, and with bad nightmares and a huge hatred of his old military colleges he makes peace with the samurais, and join them in their fight...A movie that's so beautifully made that you simply can't avoid being charmed by it. The fantastic photo and the fabulous directing makes the movie elegant, delicate really, so while sitting there I just had such a good time. Tom Cruise is brilliant as Algren who suffers of bad nightmares and has to make peace with his mind. Samurais is something I think everybody thinks is pretty cool, and this movie shows a side of the samurais that they're peaceful, relaxed and intelligent people that studies war. THE LAST SAMURAI stands very alone, and is a dead-on movie, and it has got it's competitions; TROY, KING ARTHUR and ALEXANDER THE GREAT are all big movies with big budget and costumes, battles and stuff, so well...if THE LAST SAMURAI will win the four-on battle is a question.

Obviously, the plot is somewhat different, but the basic story line is the same. We have a Westerner teaching the Japanese, who before used only the bow and the sword, to use guns in war. Westerner learns to love the ancient Japanese culture, turning his back on his awful western ways. Sound familiar? This is much better written than SHOGUN (the film) and in my opinion, has superior acting (but then even I can act better than Richard Chamberlain). Cruise is excellent, but Ken Watanabe as the warlord Katsumoto steals the show from Tom. A beautiful Japanese actress Koyuki also does an excellent acting job. A lot of the dialog is in Japanese with English subtitles, but somehow that's not too much of a distraction; it adds to the realism. There are a couple of large battle scenes and, yes, it gets very bloody. But when you hack someone's arm off, they're going to bleed! Overall, very well done but some borrowed or recycled material.",The Last Samurai
103,jdkraus,"A film that demands our surrender to its film-making, acting, story, and above all its romantic vision of a forgotten world!",10,29 May 2006,"This film was no doubt the best film of 2003. It is totally underrated and cheated in the Oscar academy! It is a film that actually has talent and beauty to it from its story to its vision of ancient Japan that has been swept into modernization.the film is about two men. there's Kotsumoto and Nathan Algren. Kotsumoto (Ken Watanbe) is a samurai leader who witnesses his country being overtaken by modernization which leads to a change in the whole country from the new rising power of the Emperor Meiji, who took power for himself over Japan. Kotsumoto and the other samurai feels this is immoral and a disgrace to the motherland of Japan and pollutes the traditions and cultures of Japan. he and the other samurai must restore it to where it originally was before the Americans arrived.Meanwhile, across the Atlantic Ocean, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a drunken, ex-war veteran who drinks to relieve himself from a massacre he was a part of against the Native Americas. By fate, he meets a war friend (Billy Connoly) who found a job for the both of them, which is to train the Japanese army against the samurai, and was arranged by Nathan's old, cruel commander he has a score to settle with (Tony Goldwyn), and a greedy Japanese political figure named Omara.Here, Nathan goes on a journey into the modern rising Japan. As he trains the army without much of a success, they are set on a mission to wipe out the samurai in the mountains. They are ambushed, most of the imperial soldiers are killed, and Nathan is captured by the samurai. Here he meets the samurai leader Kotsumoto and develops a strong relationship with him based upon the samurai code, the meanings of life, and their fates and destinies.The Last Samurai is a powerfully moving film with some of the best acting i have ever seen since the film Gladiator. Ken Watanbe deserved the Oscar for his role of Kotsumoto. The cinematography was beautiful, and depicts the reality of japan's beautiful views of land. the costumes and set-decorations were fabulous, the battle sequences were well choreographed and intense, the story was gripping, and above all the score by Hans Zimer uplifted the film to a scale of grandeur. Easily a **** out of **** If only more films were like this one. This is why we see the movies!",The Last Samurai
104,TheOtherFool,Oh no. It's one of those dying with honour movies again...,4,23 September 2004,"In fairness, if you're gonna watch a movie by Edward 'Glory' Zwick starring Tom 'overdoing it' Cruise, you shouldn't be surprised of the result 'The Last Samurai' is: a powertrip by the last combining the over the top 'dying with honour' crap from the first. And it's exactly that. It's long, it's loud, it's purposeless, meaningless and shallow: it is, really, my worst nightmare.Not that The Last Samurai is a complete waste though: there's some good acting (although the academy award nomination for Watanabe was a bit overdone) and a couple of *decent* (mind you, not *good*) battlescenes. But nevermind the story: overblown pretentious silliness disguised rather poorly as an epic action movie.Perhaps for the people who liked 'Gladiator' (Oh, how I hated that movie), but if I were you I'd stay away from it. 4/10.",The Last Samurai
105,tomimt,More than I bargained for,9,22 January 2006,"I didn't know much about The Last Samurai when I grabbed it from the sales bin and popped it in my DVD player at home. I was expecting something more popcorn, but instead I got well made action drama. The whole seriousness of the film really surprised me.Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is man, who has lost hie belief in humanity. He's washed out soldier for hire who is hired by Omura (Masato Harada) to train Japanese troops in order to dispose a rebellious samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). One thing leads to another and soon Algren finds himself surrounded by samurais, apprehended in a small village in the mountains. Both, Algren and Katsumoto, learn a thing or two from each other, but it really is Katsumoto who changes the destiny of Algren.There actually isn't anything spectacularly original in the movies plot, it's just one growth story among others, but the settings, actors and direction is so fantastic, that it's rather hard not to like this movie. You can say a lot of things about Cruise as a person, but after I saw him in Eyes Wide Shut I've came into a conclusion, that he really is a great actor. I can't pinpoint any bad actor from the cast, Watanabe does great performance and Koyuki does small, but effective role as Taka, Katsumotos sister, who takes care of Algren, even tough he has killed her husband.In all things considered The Last Samurai is among the better movies of Tom Cruise.",The Last Samurai

Not spectacular, but solid.  The rest of the cast were competent enough, and the only real interest by the end was the insight into 19th century Japan when the Western influences started to flood in.",The Last Samurai
107,lawprof,Dancing With Wasabe,5,5 December 2003,"Amusing and enjoyable in parts, ""The Last Samurai"" is ultimately pretentious, indeed silly.  And wooden.  With Tom Cruise in the lead this should be no surprise.1876 was a banner year for Americans as they celebrated the centenary of independence.  Patriotic fairs and festivals dotted the land.  A bump in the rejoicing was Lt. Col (Brevet Major General) George Custer's vainglorious disobedience of orders which led, eventually, to the Little Big Horn National Battlefield Park.  And cemetery.Somehow 7th Cavalry captain Nathan Algren, Tom Cruise, missed the fun at the Grassy Grease and we meet him, trauma-ridden and booze-besotted, hawking ""The Gun That Won the West"" at a carnival.  His inebriation putting paid to this employment he is ordered by his detested superior, Colonel Bagley, Tony Goldwyn, to travel with him to Japan and train the Meiji emperor's new western-style army.  We're in the heady but turbulent first years following the Meiji Restoration when Japan sought to catch up with western nations and, in this film, the American Military-Industrial Complex can't wait to outfit his troops and reap the rewards, mostly monetary.Cruise's Algren is transparently captive to memories - frequent nightmares - of a murderous assault on an Indian village where women and children were slaughtered.  Those familiar with an especially dismal episode in frontier history will recognize Algren's flashbacks as the horrendous so-called Battle of the Washita, a permanent stain on Custer's reputation.  And on the Army's.Algren despises Bagley but he takes his orders, like a good soldier, from him.  He does this for $500 a month (let's ignore the issue that he's a serving army officer and ought not to be privately employed).Not to miss anything formulaic, Algren's recruits are in worse shape than the men generals McDowell and McClellan had to whip into shape as the Army of the Potomac (did I mention that Algren has the Medal of Honor from that internecine conflict?).As so often happens in both real life (tragically) and the movies (expectedly), troops prematurely committed to battle fail the test and the emperor's soldiers here are beaten and routed.  Somehow Algren is captured alive as Samurai-in-Chief Katsumoto, Ken Watanabe, witnesses and respects his extraordinary bravery.  Watanabe is a typical feudal warlord who speaks excellent English and writes poetry.What follows is highly predictable.  With earnest debts to ""The King and I,"" ""Shogun"" and myriad Jackie Chan movies, Algren becomes part, slowly, of Katsumoto's clan.  They don't all love him at first but, hey, he IS Tom Cruise.  Katsumoto's samurai can't co-exist, we're told, with an emerging modern Japan so the stage is set for a titanic battle.A clash of cultures-yes, we have a dawning recognition by Algren, stolidly telegraphed by Cruise, that we should share.  It's that the samurai are not savages, as Bagley claims, but are part of that diminishing cohort of noble natives facing cultural and indeed physical extinguishment at the hands of western, here American, inspired modernity.  We've seen it all before. Thank you Commodore Perry.But I don't want to be too negative.  Sure, we admire the samurai who are desperately resisting destruction whether or not they get with the Meiji program.  But let's look at the bright side.  Without the Meiji steamroller re-make of Japan we might never have had the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, Pearl Harbor, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere or SONY and NINTENDO.There's a fair amount of Japanese dialogue with subtitles.  I'd love to see the reverse when this flick screens in Japan.The cinematography is superb-the country scenes are breathtaking.  The music is Ninja-film standard.Tom Cruise's films make money and so will this one.  Director Edward Zwick was scrupulously careful not to allow any originality to enter into the story.  Anyone who can't predict where this film is going from the first twenty minutes should be condemned to a lifetime of viewing only Ed Wood movies.5/10.P.S.  If any readers don't know what wasabe is, it's one of Japan's greatest culinary gifts, the ultimate sinus-clearing condiment.",The Last Samurai
108,Mr_Sensitive,Quite Impressive.,8,29 May 2008,"Wow, this movie almost made it to my all time favorite movie. It is much more awesome than I could ever hope for. But whatever it is, this got to be one of the best western movies that projected the Asian culture in the more or less the collect way.I understand the fact that it rather tells the story of the movie from the white guy point of view because it is Hollywood movie, but it didn’t quite bother me. After all it was Tom Cruise, the guy never fail in any of his movie (maybe MI: 2 but that it), and in this also he was awesome.I like the fact that the movie seem to put in quite great research on historical fact than some lazy ass screenwriter that would stuffed in anything he thought of Asian culture would be like. The story did came out great to the certain point, though flaws but it still great with lots of emotional scenes and great fight (also some unnecessary and cheesy scenes).For me if this movie got a more profile director (though Edward Zwick does qualify for high profile director) I believe other can and will craft out the movie more beautifully. There are quite great room for improvement cause it feel too commercialize.Otherwise I truly recommended this film; I was having a good time watching it. The best thing is the film doesn’t feel to try too hard to look good. And it is very much re-watchable; with also great score and lighting and setting location. Great costume too.Recommendation: Worth HD-DVD.Reason to Watch: Great Story.Reason Not To: A Bit Too Commercial.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",The Last Samurai

The action was impressive and learning about the Japanese culture was very neat. But there are loads of negatives. One I'll start off, it is very farfetch'd. (Spoilers) The Japanese are riding there horses and charging at the other Japanese soldies. There shooting Algren's men and Katsumoto's men down even Katsumoto. Everyone dies but Nathan Algren, who is played by Tom Cruise. He was shot 4 times, but still survived and of course Tom Cruise always survives in his movies. I also can't stand Tom Cruise in this movie, he is a decent actor playing in good movies such as Jerry Maguire and Risky Buisness. He has terrible lines.              But you know oh well, it's hollywood. I thought the movie was entertaining at least. The ninja battle was very cool and I liked the gore.

112,ruby_fff,The Last Samurai - a labor of love dedicated to the spirit of the Samurai warriors,8,2 October 2005,"""The Last Samurai"" 2003 and ""The Last of the Dogmen"" (1995 d: Tab Murphy, with Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey in the lead) are both films with the theme of the 'last' of warrior spirits (one is Samurai, one is Cheyenne). The production of The Last Samurai is well worth seeing - the glory of a large-scale Hollywood production it is. From the research of the historical Japanese Meiji period, the mannerisms, the way different classes of people dress, the settings, the battle weapons and armory, how the Samurai train and fight, to the study and appreciation of the Art of War - where men of honor and integrity in service to the Emperor is the thing to die for. The film title in three Kanji characters means The Way of the Warrior (Samurai). The one character shown on screen at the very beginning (romanization: Sze) meant in the service of the King. Hence the definition of Watanabe's Samurai lifelong one true goal - to serve his Emperor, one and only, and to die in the service of the Emperor would be an honor.The film, directed by Ed Zwick, is truly a combined labor of love of everyone involved. From the producer-lead actor Tom Cruise and Zwick's film-making partner Marshall Herskovitz, cinematography by John Toll and film score by Hans Zimmer, to the costuming details, diverse casting, location scouting all the way to New Zealand and training of the supporting cast - even the official Web site with extensive production notes - all provide enhanced appreciation of this remarkable film. The storyline and drama of ""The Last Samurai"" evoke various level of emotions, pulling the heartstrings of the audience with high emotional energy - suspense, sadness, smiles, empathy, joy.""Kagemusha"" by Akira Kurosawa, of course, is the ultimate grandeur of a historic Samurai epic. ""The Last Samurai"" is comparable in drama and treatment if not with equal passionate efforts all round. Both are available on DVD with special features of audio commentary and the making of 'featurette' and more.",The Last Samurai
113,shark-43,Cruise & Ego Get To Play Swords,4,3 January 2004,"I am a fan of Cruise. He has done strong work throughout his career (including the powerful psycho in TAPS right up to the nuanced pain of JERRY MAGUIRE)but event though there IS a strong story at the core - a damaged, haunted soldier from the Indian Wars looking for something instead of a whiskey bottle or suicide or both - is quickly brushed aside for the typically hollow, beautifully photographed Hollywood ""epic"" - lots of shots of Cruise practicing with a stick or a sword in front of gorgeous sunsets and snow-capped Japanese mountains. It becomes so predictable and ridiculously close to Costner's immersion with the Indians in WOLVES that it becomes stale and one-note. Sweeping, yes. Some great fight scenes, yes. And the Japanese lead is wonderful. But this Zwick film becomes as tortured and ridiculous as his other bloated ""historical epic"", LEGENDS OF THE FALL.

115,CinematicInceptions,"Could have been a little better, but rises above the precedents of the action genre.",7,17 July 2017,"I was a little disappointed with this movie, but it was pretty good on the whole. Even though I didn't agree with some of the sentiments that the samurai held, I could understand how someone could live their life the samurai way. The people that Algren comes to know display a level of devotion to their lives that is rarely seen in modern civilizations, which is what the movie seems to be all about. The logic behind the samurai obsessing over how they die is thrown into question, perhaps because the samurai seem more focused on their own honor than on what consequences their deaths will have. It does seem illogical, but there is something to the fact that they are willing to die for something. The spirit is there, it's just not channeled in quite the right way.That may seem like a long digression, but the concept is actually pretty important to the film's identity. Although there is enough big Hollywood entertainment in this movie for it to attract action/adventure fans, there is also a fair amount of emotion and ideology that comes into question. The story may not be accurate to historical events, but it brings to light one of the darker parts of American history that is often swept under the rug in a way that feels accurate. Algren's background on the Western frontier plays a major role in his arc as he redeems himself for the pain he caused the Native Americans in the past.Equally important to Algren is the village leader Katsumoto, who becomes the sage of the movie but is not without flaws. He and the rest of the villagers along with their way of life are not perfect and are certainly not modern, but they possess ardent beliefs and a purpose that is lacking in the westernized characters. By the end of the movie, Algren and Katsumoto are not exactly seeing eye to eye, but they each understand where the other is coming from and have partially adopted each other's views.There is a good amount of action present throughout the movie, though it's meant to disgust as much as it is to excite. Laced into all of the action scenes are character moments, mostly for Algren but not exclusively. There's some good camera work that goes into the action scenes, particularly the one in which Algren duels one of the samurai. But the movie does not let itself get too caught up in the action, putting much focus on the relationship between Algren and the family that takes him in. There is also a lot of time dedicated to the conversations between Algren and Katsumoto. There are points where the acting is overly dramatic and the lines feel too written, but that is the movie's only true fault. Not to say that it couldn't have been better, but there is not much to complain about. Overall Rating: 8/10",The Last Samurai

117,buiger,Very Good!,8,12 March 2007,"Finally a movie that depicts the wright values, in the best of Hollywood traditions of times now long gone. This film is about friendship, honor and pride, all of whom unfortunately look so archaic today, almost as if they do not (and according to many, shouldn't) exist any more. Luckily, there are still some of us who believe in such principles and try to live by them. As the movie shows, they may be old fashioned, but some human values are timeless as well as priceless.I am not a great fan of Tom Cruise, but in this film I think he did a very good job. His acting was very good, never over the top, very believable. For an actor so well known and identified by the public with a completely different image, this must not have been easy. Ken Watanabe's performance was amazing, incredibly powerful, definitely worthy of at least an Oscar Nomination. I cannot imagine anybody could have portrayed this for us alien culture any better that he did. My compliments go also to the Director, this film was very well directed and filmed. The sound, camera and costumes should also all receive at least a nomination (amazing, the Academy and I almost completely agree this time). All in all, very good, quality entertainment.

Before writing this comment I didn't bother reading any reviews or try to dig up the movie's lack of historical background, I simply loved ""The Last Samurai"" for what it had to offer. In most part, beauty. The movie is quite long, but I there was never a glimpse of boredom, I devoured every scene because mr. Zwick's effort was so impressive. Oscars all around, I say, everybody who's anybody in the movie steals the show, which is kind of contradictory, but believe me, it makes some sense:) I will not waste more words, you've grasped my enthusiasm by now.

120,PyrolyticCarbon,"Wonderful, powerful movie with amazing performances and an insightful look to Japanese history.",10,28 May 2005,"I was biased from the get go on this movie, totally biased. Tom Cruise playing a hero again, and a movie where the Americans go and teach the Japanese how to fight. I just saw a big epic with Cruise-isms all over it and another movie where anything about the historical aspect of the Japanese is lost in a parade of how great America is and how they saved Japan. I was wrong, incredibly so.The first thing you realise about this movie is that Cruise is going somewhere he's good at, a tormented, bleak and actually quite dark character. For me, these are his best roles. Not the smiling, charming character that's made him so famous, but the kind of character we've seen him play only a few times, and each time he's brought something unique and truly superb to the screen. At that point I perked up and paid a little more attention, this was actually going quite well.After that the next major surprise is that this is not an all American movie, it talks of the massacre of Custer, but also of the massacre he inflicted on so many innocent Indians. No, this does not treat history with an all American paintbrush. At this point I had hope for a good movie, then the unthinkable happened.The movie turns to the Japanese, and looks into their traditional way of life with reverence, intellect and a surprisingly deep understanding. It turns the story around and takes the American deep into the heart of the Japanese Samurai and shows his slow understanding of their customs, traditions and way of life. This treats the Japanese with so much respect you wouldn't think it was a Hollywood movie at all. It was at this point I was noticed leaning forward in my seat at key moments of the movie, keen on not missing a second. I was enthralled.During the movie Cruise looses his big name status and becomes an interesting and deeply engaging actor here, only bettered by the intensity of the amazing Ken Watanabe. I'd never seen this actor before, or rather I'd never singled out his presence in a movie, but here he positively steals every scene he enters into, giving the complete feeling of a real Samurai set on a single course and almost welcoming the fate the Emporer has dealt him. He's deliberate, controlled but there's so much warmth in his performance it's wonderful to watch. Yet that's not to put down the performance of Cruise, he shares the screen wonderfully and shares many of the amazing qualities of Watanabe.The visuals are stunning, beautifully lit, visualised and filmed and the respect for the Japanese and their culture just pours onto the screen from the locations, sets and the smallest of details. The action is slow and measured with larger set pieces orchestrated so beautifully and never distracting from the morality of the tale. At all times it seems that the core of the movie, the Bushido, the way of the Samurai, is kept at the forefront of every scene and the movie makers have crafted the movie so carefully and precisely, as the Samurai would craft their blades.Edward Zwick proves here that he is one of the best Directors in Hollywood. He not only captures a script on film, but he delves into it and understands the story, its surroundings and history and brings it to life in the most epic of ways. He seems to totally drop the modern Hollywood movie production style and really steeps himself in the lore of the story and brings the production to the story, rather than making the story match the production.This movie really has seemed to have been developed with total respect for the history of the Japanese Samurai, and has been crafted together with a real love for movies and the story itself. I can't praise the movie enough, not only is it a wonderfully engaging and immersive tale, but it also carries with it many morales both of the traditional Japanese way of life, and the twisted ways of modern man. It carries with it exceptional performances and amazingly dramatic scenes which are beautifully captured on film throughout the movie. There really isn't a dull, wrong or even Hollywood moment in the movie.The DVD extras are extensive. On the first disc there's a very interesting commentary by the Director Edward Zwick, which provides some great insight into the making of the movie, smaller scenes and some of the actors, as well as getting across his enthusiasm for the great Japanese warriors and their history.The second disc gives us two deleted scenes, both with commentary by Zwick, and one with a how did we do it section, both interesting to see and understand why they weren't included. However, the interesting thing here is not to judge the extras on the content of any one, all the extras ad up to provide a hugely insightful exploration of the movie, actors, and Japanese history. The ideas and comments on one of the extras will come through again and again, referenced throughout bringing together a much larger experience of the movie.Also on the second disc are a number of features examining the costumes, sets, Japanese history, Samurai and Bushido, the actors including Cruise's training to become a convincing Samurai swordsman, and an interesting discussion between Cruise and Zwick, slightly indulgent at times, but very interesting.The movie is wonderful and the extras are a hugely satisfying addition to the film itself. This is definitely a must watch, and a must watch again.",The Last Samurai
121,pfgpowell-1,Dancing With Wolves with sushi - same kind of sentimental guff,6,20 March 2011,"Where would Hollywood be without its all-pervading soundtrack? Often, I think, nowhere. It's no secret that the soundtrack is an important element in any film, but when you get a wall-to-wall sentimental swish of sound such as in The Last Samurai, you know the film isn't half as good as its cracked up to be. This is very much Dancing With Wolves with sushi - the noble reactionary Japanese as symbolised by all that noble samurai history and it noble traditions pitted against the venal modernisers who will stop at nothing to drag their country into the modern age and get their filthy hands on all the gold and goodies the modern age will bring them. The Last Samurai is, sadly, despite some well filmed battle films and some great scenery - even the pouring rain is picturesque, don't you know - pretty much standard fair (and it doesn't surprise me that the saintly Roger Ebert gives it four out of five - he made too many elemental errors in too many reviews for me to be able to take him fully seriously any longer). The story is loosely based on a real-life character, a Frenchman called Jules Brunet, who sided with the shogun in a civil war in the late 1860s. This Cruise vehicle inexplicably postpones everything for ten years and in many other ways simplifies the truth. Nothing wrong with filching and then bastardising history as a basis for your film, story, musical or poem - even Shakespeare did it - and I'm sure it can be well done. But when it comes with that mushy wall-to-wall soundtrack and faux profound lines about 'destiny' you know this is art as popcorn entertainment rather than anything more serious. As usual, the IMDb fraternity and, no doubt, it sorority either loved it - awesome and 'so deep' - or hated it. I did neither. The Last Samurai is a competent actioner with Tom Cruise and an absolutely gorgeous woman as the 'love interest', the widow of the samurai warrior he killed. Our Tom starts off living in her house on her brother's orders - her brother is the top dog - and initially threatens to kill herself if he doesn't leave (she thinks he stinks like a pig). But eventually she softens and falls in love with the reformed drunkard and, were this to take place in America, would undoubtedly have 'fixed him a steak' and shown her all her high school pictures. As it is, she insists he wears her dead husband's samurai armour for the final showdown battle with the venal, nasty, two-faced modernisers. Look, The Last Samurai is a great film for a night in with two bottles of Shiraz and loads of nibbles. It's pretty, has Tom Cruise - part of the prettiness - and that wall-to-wall soundtrack I keep banging on about whose sole purpose is to to keep you happy and informed as to what you should be feeling. It might well be your bag. By the way, I really, really doubt Japanses cities had telephone poles and lines littering their streets as this film would have you believe. So ignore them and get on with the soundtrack. Oh, and by the way: in an odd sort of way the casting of Scotsman Billy Connolly as an Irishman sums up that The Last Samurai doesn't quite add up. Connolly's oirish accent keeps slipping into his native Glaswegian within just a few seconds of him opening his mouth. So why couldn't the producers have simply made Connolly's character a Scotsman? Problem solved (well, except for that bloody soundtrack).",The Last Samurai
122,paulcreeden,It wasn't really about eye candy.,6,19 September 2005,"""The Last Samurai"" (good riddance) is a Japanese Western along the lines of the Japanese samurai genre of the 1930s-1950s. Its visual scale is comparable to the late Kirusawa epics, but its content is a derivative hash of American Westerns and Clavell's ""Shogun"". The most laudable feature of the film is its cinematography. For those of us who admire antique Japanese design, the eye candy is very nice. But the end of the samurai culture was not about eye candy. I think the film misses this point entirely. It also was not about rugged (American) individualism fighting against corporate corruption. These are American stories which could be told again these days. The ending of the samurai culture was akin to the current turmoil in the (Saudi) Arab world. Samurai were xenophobic feudal creatures like Usama Bin Ladin, confronted by an Industrial Age, championed by an emperor who received a modern education for his time. The Hollywood propensity for making everything black-and-white from an antique American (cowboy's) moral viewpoint poisoned what could have been a wonderful film about the complexity of progress and human evolution.",The Last Samurai
123,theshadow908,Great action/war film.,8,15 June 2006,"The Last Samurai is the story of an American soldier who is captured by Japenese Samurais, but as he is kept prisoner there he begins to respect the soldiers and eventually grows fond of them. He ends up befriending the samurais and fighting on their side against the Americans. This is one of the best historical type war movies there is out there, in the vain of movies like Dances With Wolves.The plot of this movie is very good. It shows that there can be understanding between two cultures who are taught to hate each other. The American soldier learns respect for the other culture even as he's their prisoner. And even though he's their prisoner, they learn respect for him. When they end up becoming friends, you can see they'd do anything for each other. The dialogue is also very good, even humorous at times. The fight scenes are perfect. This is one of those movies that puts you right in the battle so you can see what it would really be like.I've always been a Tom Cruise fan. He's a pretty good actor. He seems like a far more down to Earth character in this film though, and it's refreshing. I can't really pick and choose good acting jobs, because they're all good. Overall, this is an amazing film, and I'd recommend it to fans of the genre.8/10",The Last Samurai
124,LivingDog,Appearance of Cruise ruins a perfect movie,9,20 June 2004,"This is as close you could come to making a perfect movie as you could and get a miss.Tom Cruise is a great movie star. I enjoyed him in ""Top Gun."" But he is not up to this part - it is too difficult for him to play against a backdrop of the most beautiful and rich culture on the planet!That's the way it is portrayed. Fine, it's a movie - they can say whatever they want - evil white devils corrupting innocent noble ""savages"" once again. yawn.... great freakin' movie though! was I entertained? was i moved? was i caught up in the action? was it beautiful to look at - there were scenes where I thought my eyes were literally drinking up the images... i could almost taste the ""water"" with my eyes.In my opinion getting a ""metrosexual"" guy like TC instead of a man, like Kirk Douglas (I know) weakened this _entertaining_beautiful_emotion-packed_action-packed_rich-dialog_even-richer-culture_ movie from being a 10+/10 to a 9/10.Lose Cruise and you got a movie that was made for the ages... now all u got is a movie made for certain ages... like 13 yr. olds :/-ZafoidPS: if u don't believe me look at the original ""7 Samurai"" - how many pretty faces are in that? NONE NICHT NADA ZERO! Yet it will be remembered literally _forever_. Ask a film student about ""7 Samurai"" and they will swoon... ask them about ""The Last Samurai"" and they will say: ""yeah, i saw it, what'd ya' wanna know?""pish-posh and piffle.

125,kgprophet,Postcard Fairy tale,6,28 December 2003,"When Edward Zwick made ""Glory"", it was remembered at Oscar time because there were realistic performances that caused the movie to transcend from being merely a period drama or other typical war film.  His latest war drama uses broad brush strokes to depict this era.  Major characters in this film are drawn in a simplistic manner.  While this makes it easy to catch on whom everybody is, it leaves little intrigue.  Most of this film is predictable. However, I have a fascination with Japan, and this film presents many postcard shots of what we would expect Old Japan to look like. Too bad that the film was mostly shot in California, and relies heavily on computer effects.  Some of the effects were not quite there, (a formation of soldiers standing in a field ""jump"" out of place, but nothing that I would complain about).  My biggest problem with this film is the convenient plot points that come about near the end of the movie.  No spoilers, but reality seems to be chucked out the window when it comes to some implausible heroics and romantic notions of political changes of heart.That being said, I enjoyed this movie, as if it were a classic stage production. Cinematography, production design, costumes, and makeup were very well done.  The cast does a great job portraying their symbolic characters.  The story moves along without plodding, although there were a couple moments near the end that I felt weren't worth the time. 
This movie is not as good as Zwick's ""Glory"".  In fact, it seems as though he needed to borrow one of the most powerful scenes from ""Glory"" to add some spark to this movie.  He plagiarizes himself with a scene where a new recruit tries to load his gun while Cruise fires bullets at him.  Effective as that scene was, it was ""Glory 2"".  The music was superficial, with little ethnic influence.  As good as this film is, it isn't Oscar worthy.I give this film a 6.5 out of 10.",The Last Samurai
126,mOVIemAN56,Hollywood's Inaccuracy and Entertainment,8,22 March 2005,"The Last Samurai (2003) I've watched numerous times. The last time (last night) I found the movie a lot better than I remembered. Set mostly in 1870's Japan during a time when Japan was beginning to modernize its country. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is hired along with other US soldiers to modernize the Japanese Army currently caught in civil war with the samurai. Even though this movie is based on actual events the United States had nothing to do with the modernization of japan. It was mostly France, Britain, and Russia. Yet the movie is still good. The portrayal of the way of the samurai is fascinating and the idea of rifles against sword seems utterly insane. This movie is the first movie for Ken Watanabe to speak English in and does a fine job as the Samurai leader Katsumoto. Even though I'm not exactly a fan of Tom Cruise I feel he did a good job with his troubled soldier character. The story isn't original (a soldier trying to find his honor and the right path) yet it's does fine. The action is wild: the first battle in the forest to the last battle with the fires all around.

127,OttoVonB,Shogun Redux,5,9 December 2004,"Last Samurai was the first of many historical epics green-lit after the revival of the genre by Gladiator, and though it shares a screenwriter with that Oscar-winning epic, it hearkens back to something a bit older.I find myself on the fence about this one because it manages to be the very best of Hollywood and the very worst for different reasons. The same can be said of director Ed Zwick, who's brand of earnest schmaltz can result in either a perfectly tuned masterpiece - like Glory - or saccharine dreck - Blood Diamond, another film with excellent ingredients but the same antagonizing flaws found here.Drawing deep parallels with James Clavell's Shoun, and the miniseries that followed (one you quickly become convinced everyone involved with this film was made to watch at some point), Last Samurai follows disabused Westerner to the Empire of the Sun. There he will put his own life and honor code in question and become seduced by local culture - and, of course, a local woman - and redeem himself in heroic ways. Tom Cruise lays it thick as the self-loathing Captain Algren, especially in a misjudged parody of a firing lesson scene from Glory, but then the screen is lit up by Ken Watanabe, and much is forgiven, wrapped as he and everything else is in lush cinematography and a rousing score.Where the film falls flat - like Blood Diamond to a certain extent - is in underestimating our intelligence or cultural openness. Since a non-white or non-American character is apparently not enough to hold our interest, we are made to see everything through Algren's eyes, rather than merely have be our initial conduit into this unfamiliar world. Having Cruise in the role, capable actor that he is, compounds the problem: every scene that tries to make him a Hollywood hero, rather than an actual character, is unconvincing, especially the physics and culture-defying silliness of the ending.An okay Summer blockbuster, but hardly worth remembering.",The Last Samurai
128,jayjaycee,"Fascinating, packing and visually stunning!",8,31 May 2020,"""The Last Samurai"" is a 2003 war action drama directed by Edward Zwick starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe. After having taken a one-week break from watching and reviewing films in order to assemble new motivation and energy for writing, I decided to resume work by watching a film I have had in my shelf for quite a long time but never considered to be high priority. Honestly, I originally didn't even want to buy it, but my father's co-worker, whom I bought it from, insisted and told me it was a good movie, and since it was only one buck I agreed and took it home. Before getting into deep analysis, I can already say that it was splendid decision. It was only yesterday that I realized who directed this flick and that made me expect something. Edward Zwick, known for directing films such as history drama ""Legends Of The Fall"" or slushy romcom ""Love And Other Drugs"", is the man responsible for one of the most inexorable thrillers I have ever seen, the 2006 ""Blood Diamond"" and hence I knew what the director might be capable of. Furthermore, it stars Tom Cruise who happens to be one of my favourite actors, and as I hoped, it turned out to be a fine film. First, I personally love it when films take me back to a long-forgotten time and depict moments in history that are the total opposite of what we know today. In this case, it focuses on the fate of Civil War veteran Nathan Algren who obviously lost all sense of reality in the year of 1876 and doesn't know how to deal with his life after everything he has experienced. He is a drinker, suffers from PTSD and does whatever he can do to earn money. Therefore, he is approached by Japanese delegates that offer him a fortune if he trained the Japanese soldiers so that they can defeat the samurai rebellion in their country. After accepting the offer, he of course is captured by his enemies and instead of despising them, learns to understand their culture and way of life. This is basically everything the film depicts, but as the past has proven multiple times, greatness may result from even the simplest ideas. First of all, the film is mainly carried by two convincing performances of Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe, as the American veteran and samurai lord respectively. They share a surprisingly genuine chemistry and make the whole relationship and friendship between them so touchingly realistic. What many people dislike about this film is probably that it shows the Japanese traditions and culture with a white man in the leading role, but from my point of view this is far away from whitewashing and on top of that what makes it so utterly fascinating in the first place. As someone who also doesn't know much about this culture, I easily could find a connection to Algren, as he experienced everything with the same curiosity I had. It was all done intentionally to depict the events from the point of view of an outsider, and it is one of the key elements of the film's success. To be honest, I followed the whole film with pure fascination and at times even felt like I was in the situation, only that I wasn't. This probably works out so well thanks to the authentic settings and noble costumes they used throughout (seriously, Algren's red samurai armour is without a doubt one of the coolest costumes I have ever seen in a movie), but it isn't only the impressive visuals and the eye-candy that makes this film so great, there is so much more. The overall story and plot development are on the same formidable level and have a lot of important things to say. It is basically a character study of a haunted war veteran who unexpectedly becomes clean, retrieves balance in life and more and more learns about the culture of the people he was originally sent to kill. In some sort of Damascene conversion, he discards his old grudges and troubles of his past and even undergoes the hard training and eventually becomes a samurai himself. Not only is this another superb example of character development, it also makes his character even more relatable, interesting and, most importantly, human. He finds a new perspective in life and a new way to deal with the tortures of his past, and that makes this whole conversion plausible. Without letting it become to cheesy and ridiculous, the film gives as an insight into a misunderstood and bygone culture. Just as the people of this culture treat each other, it does this with immense respect for both the people and traditions they believe in, such as Bushido. From the moment on they were introducd, I rooted for the samurai, simply just because they are respectful and honourable people and I understood what they were fighting for, but there is still this one dilemma the emperor has to deal with that was relatable as well: the question of traditions versus progress? Shall a country keep the old traditional way to respect them or shall a country abandon them in order to embrace modernity? Even though the way the Emperor deals with this difficult question is the wrong approach, it is still something that gives the antagonistic party a certain plausibility in their actions and makes their motives understandable in some way. Another thing that makes this film so extremely enjoyable are the fight choreographies. They are far away from being repetitive and are great to look at all the time. May it be the first battle in the woods where the samurai are first introduced or the invasion of the ninjas, they all had something to them that made them stand out, but by far the best and most packing of them was the climatic final battle in the third act of the film. Although it is obvious that they had not the slightest chance against the gigantic army of Omura, they entered the battlefield of a war that can never be won, nevertheless. In this surprisingly epic sequence, the conflict of tradition and progress is decided in probably the most devastating way possible. Even if they managed to kill a lot of hostiles it is obvious that this war would end with the defeat of the samurai. It was just sad to see the most talented and battle-hardened swordsmen getting killed in an uneven battle. But what do you want to achieve against enemies with firearms as a warrior with a traditional armour and nothing but a sword as a weapon? It was clear from the start that probably nobody would make it out alive, and also Katsumoto and Algren were aware of that, but still it was heart-breaking to see those characters who grew on me a lot dying in such a brutal way. I know that to die in battle was the most honourable thing that could happen to a samurai, but still it was just devastating to me as the viewer. Honestly, it went into an unforeseen dramatic direction and gave me severe goosebumps. The touching sound score contributed to this effect a lot as well. The final scene after the gruesome battle also gratified me as well, as it concludes the character development of Algren perfectly. All in all, this war drama gave a great insight into a long-lost culture and teaches the viewer a lot about respect and honour in the process. Even if it is only more or less historically correct in terms of what it depicts, it is undeniable that the whole film is a feast for the eyes with the wonderfully atmospheric settings and the authentic costumes (the academy award nominations in both categories are absolutely justified!) and radiates this certain kind of flair. Aside from this, it is also a superb character study of a war veteran who manages to leave behind his past and find peace after all the things he has done and been through. He doesn't only find redemption, but also gains a whole new perspective in life and is the best version of himself after all. It is a spiritual journey he embarks on, and like him, it felt like I have also learnt something new in life. Regardless of how accurate his Japanese is, Tom Cruise gives a charismatic performance, just like Ken Watanabe who probably delivered the best performance of his career in this film. It is brilliantly written, has great dialogues, decent brutality (except for one gruesome effect that made me exclaim a single ""Wow!"" once) , a certain kind of symbolism and deals with its topic respectfully. Throughout, it has this mystical flair to it and even included social criticism towards the belligerence of the United States of America. Against my own expectations, I ended up loving it and it sparked this urge to see other features from that genre as well (Akira Kurosawa's film have been added to the list!). What a great way to return to reviewing films. Sugoi!",The Last Samurai
129,jldmp1,The Narcissist,3,23 July 2006,"I didn't expect anything from this to be at the level of Kurosawa. In fact this has no style of its own at all...it's all about reassembling pieces of other movies into a stage for Cruise to strut and fret on. They include Zwick's own ""Glory"", Frankenheimer's ""The Challenge"", & Lawton's ""The Hunted"".You see, Cruise is out to prove he can handle the big budget epic, specifically through topping the physicality of Crowe in ""Gladiator"" or ""Proof of Life"", or Gibson's ""Braveheart"". And that he can top his own ""Mission Impossibles"".The most frequent comparison is with ""Dances with Wolves"", but the similarities are actually quite faint. ""Dances..."" stuck to simple, no-nonsense storytelling; its visual structure was that of a horizontal canvas. This has nothing of interest in terms of perspective (it tries to build vertically, but weakly); and it's loaded with all sorts of post-""Dances"" clichés -- the worst being the pathetic attempts to tap into the 'spirit' of a native people. Cruise comes across as though he's pitching for Honda Motor Co. I know Cruise is not interested in art; he hasn't been for at least 20 years, since ""Top Gun"" showed us all he would ever really be as a leading man. He has only one objective for every production he invests in - that elusive golden statue.But I am interested in art, not stardom. And if you share my appreciation of the visual master who gave us ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Ran"", you'll be equally insulted by Cruise's vainglorious exercise in egotism.",The Last Samurai
130,Dockelektro,Keeping up with the formula doesn't pay off,4,8 January 2004,"Mr. Hollywood woke up one day and realized that his ideas were running thin. He went to his book of history and decided that it was time they did a movie about the samurai. He went to work and activated the movie-making machine, and in it added all the ingredients to make a box-office smash out of the genre. So, in the movie, everything you're expecting to see about the samurai is in fact depicted, even when it makes little sense (Where the hell do those ninjas come from? Who sent them?). Thus, from it comes little effect and result, and probably the most overrated of the year to come. It is simply not genuine, only the best the money can buy. Everything about is enormous, and, as usual, Cruise is the only reason for the movie to justify its existence. Did I mention that they also payed 75 million dollars for him? Well, as expected, he has done his homework well: speaking japanese, fighting with swords, the whole works. But it's a pity that the movie he serves ends up being such a flat effort. Shamelessly ripping off its concept from ""Dances With Wolves"", trying to make it evolve into something with deep emotions and meanings, and creating a movie whose story is predictable from beginning until the end (the trailer only tells half of it) is a fraud, and to me is insulting. Ok so it can be entertaining. But I wasn't entertained. Only hurt, for so much has done so little. A saying in my country says that ""the mountain has spawned a mouse"". And this pretty much sums it up. I rest my case.",The Last Samurai

Why did they even fought? The story was not really self-explaining, many discussions could have been developed better (and oh... my Japanese sucks, could have had subtitles..), but the directors probably though that quantity beats the quality.

133,tburke85,The Last Samurai An Entertaining Action Adventure Drama,9,9 May 2010,"The Last Samurai is an entertaining action adventure drama that was much better than expected. Writer/Director Edward Zwick is admirable in making this action adventure epic tale about Nathan Algren a disillusioned Civil War Captain who goes to Japan to fight the Samurai and instead ends up pledging himself to their cause. Tom Cruise stars as Algren and he turns in probably one of his best performances to date. In recent years he's been getting a lot of crap from the press because of his behavior but Tom Cruise proves to still be a talented actor none the less with this film. Cruise immerses himself into the character Algren who goes through a major transformation and he certainly shows his range as an actor. Well done. Ken Watanabe is equally impressive as Katsumoto, a Samurai leader facing a vanishing way of life, whose destiny becomes intertwined with that of the American Captain. Watanabe proves his talent as an actor giving audiences such a well rounded character in Katsumoto who eventually gains your sympathy because you know this man is willing to die in order to protect his people. Watanabe had nice chemistry with Cruise which really showed on the screen making their growing friendship and respect for each other very believable. Timothy Spall is convincing as Simon Graham a cynical Britich translator in his limited screen time who helps Algren in his quest. He provides a little comic relief from time to time that lightened up the serious mood of the film. Tony Goldwyn does a pretty good job as the villain Lieutenant Colonel Bagley whom Algren deeply hates despite not being given a whole lot to do in his short screen time. Goldwyn does what his role requires though. Billy Connolly does the best he can with his small part as Algren's old army colleague Zeb Grant whose written out rather quickly but like Goldwyn he does a decent job with his brief role in the film. The rest of the cast including the family Algren stays with while among the Samurai and the men who them played all turn in exceptional performances. The epic battle sequences are well executed/paced, intense, and realistic giving audiences a look at what warfare was probably like back then. For a film that's 154 minutes I was worried it would feel overlong like (Artifical Intelligence, There Will Be Blood, or Avatar to name a few) but the story kept my interest making the running time fly by at a steady pace. It's one of those rare two and half hours movies (with the exception of The Departed, The Dark Knight, and Blood Diamond which were about just as long but kept me entertained throughout it's running time) that I can watch easily without getting bored because the film pulls you in with a compelling story and interesting characters. In a way The Last Samurai shares similarities with most recently Avatar but I thought it was much better handled in this one than James Cameron's overlong sci-fi action adventure which was a letdown considering the hype built around it at least to me. The Last Samurai has some flaws the good however more than outweighs the bad with this one. A few characters (Connolly and Goldwyn particular) sort of get the short end of the stick development wise but I guess they're in a long enough so you know a little bit about them. Other than that though there wasn't too much I didn't enjoy about this film. Also worth mentioning is the music by Hans Zimmer which fit the tone of the film perfectly and was full of emotion. The location they chose for the setting was beautiful. It added so much with very little CG which they blended into the story seamlessly without going overboard on the effects (A mistake I feel Tranformers 2 made). Overall The Last Samurai is a well made action adventure drama epic that was much better than I anticipated. It's now one of the my all time favorite films along with The Dark Knight, The Departed, Batman Begins, and Blood Diamond to name a couple which were all epics in their own way. If you're looking for a good entertaining movie to watch than you can't go wrong with the Last Samurai. It has character development, just enough of intense action, drama, some suspense, a little humor, and impressive performances by the cast (especially Cruise and Watanabe) who make this film worth the time to watch. You won't be disappointed with this one.",The Last Samurai

135,daniewhite-1,Tom Cruise is Samurai.,4,25 March 2020,"'The Last Samurai' is a film that does a lot right but so much wrong. Eventually succumbing to the twin perils of becoming a Tom Cruise centrefold vehicle and a painfully over earnest tragedy.Excellent photography and locations throughout the film are matched by lovely sets and costumes. The musical score fits the film better as it goes on and there are two or three very engagingly staged action scenes with lots of well edited cuts, sound effects, practical special effects, extras all generating choreographed mayhem.It is clear to me that 'The Last Samurai' was designed as a very soapy and emotional epic historical tragedy complete with a tone of great deeds and greater losses from the receding past. In effect a soft or sallow hero movie rather than a bombastic or assertive one.In doing this there are large heroic themes played on with this film; themes such as outsiders and outcasts not belonging in their time and place, old vs new, loyalty and humility vs selfishness and dishonesty, damage and redemption, and of course change and the passing of things.These are most obviouse in the person of Tom Cruise's protagonist and in the interactions between different factions of Japanese society and through the captivity middle section of the film where Cruise's character is the hostage of the rebels.All taken together 'The Last Samurai' has so much loaded into it and it becomes mawkish and morose in equal measure as earnest soap and flannel come to a cloying emotional payoff; or series of payoffs. All via the incredibly versatile, indestructible and irresistible Tom Cruise protagonist.So much soap and flannel, so much Tom Cruise, that by the end 'The Last Samurai' has vacated any meritorious territory and is on full orgasmic emotional romanticism.I rate 4/10 because there is a lot of good pumped into this monster but it accumulates into an astonishingly overwrought and overstated mess.",The Last Samurai

The acting is terrific, and I'm not just talking Tom Cruise, whom we've come to expect perfection from. The supporting cast was spot on for everything, even down to the extras.

The musical score evokes feelings within the viewer without being overwhelming. Finally, the script is beautifully written.Oh, yeah, the nasty Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) gets it in the end, and I SO needed that to happen! Bottom line here is that, even though you know what's going to happen, the real brilliance of the movie is the journey there.Usually, I would be giving a movie like this a 10, but somehow, I can't. After watching this movie, I felt like they took 130 minutes to make me start to care about these characters, to become involved with their lives, and then the last 20 minutes, you see how they are killed, even if they do die bravely.",The Last Samurai
137,Brogan,"Great, but not best picture.",8,25 November 2003,"<Possible Spoilers> One of the most anticipated films this Christmas is the new Tom Cruise film, THE LAST SAMURAI.  I personally was very excited to be seeing this movie (along with RETURN OF THE KING), and I am pleased to say that it is worth the wait. Tom Cruise stars as Capt. Woodrow Algren a U.S. Calvary vetertan who's seen his share of bloodshed.  Algren keeps having haunting flashbacks of seeing his fellow officers and commander, Col. Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn) slaughter Native Americans (including women in children).   Algren is offered by his friend Zebulah Grant (Billy Connolly) and Bagly to train soldiers in Japan to fight against the Samurai warriors. Algren who has been drinking in his sorrows and looking for a excuse to die feels that this his is moment, he agrees to take the offer and sails off to Japan.Over there Algren meets English journalist/photographer/interperter Simon Graham (Timothy Spall) who informs both Algren (and the viewer) about the Japanesse customs and traditions.  It turns out that the Japanese government, like America have problems with expantation of the railroad, which railroad workers and the Emperor's soldiers are killed by the samurai from the surrounding areas. Algren's expertise and knowledge of previous war experience is much needed for the Japanesse soldiers who wish to ""finish"" off the samurai and continue to build the railroad, very much like the western civilaztion. Algren trains the men, yet when Col. Bagly informs that Algren must have the soldiers prepare for battle the next morning, Algren disagrees believing and even showing that the men aren't ready yet. Col. Bagly ignores Algren's comments and orders the unprepared men to fight the next morning. Bagly believes that since the Emperor's soldiers have rifles that they can defeat the primitive samurai's with their ""sticks and arrows.""  The next day, as Algren and the soldiers wait for the samurai in the forrest, the warriors arrive and practically kill all of the Emperor's soldiers, at least the ones who didn't retreat with Col. Bagly. Algren stays behind and since he's been looking for a way or reason to die, he figures to fight to the death.  As eight samurai warriors surround Algren ready to strike, Algren takes one of the samurai flags and defends himself with it. This impresses Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) the village leader and head samurai. As Algren is then knocked to the ground and is about to be killed by one of the warriors, with quick thinking, he defends himself by stabbing the warrior in the neck killing the samurai. Katsumoto orders his men to take Algren alive instead of death. As Algren recovers he realizes he is being taken care by a beautiful mother who lives in the village named Taka(Koyuki Kato).  It turns out that the warrior that Algren killed was Taka's husband.  Katusmoto informs Algren that he wants him alive to study the ""western"" way of battle and war.    However when Algren gets is a lesson of the way the samurai lives as well as the traditional way of the Japanesse culture. But even most important, Algren learns the ways of fighting and defending himself like the samurai. Like one of my favorite films this year (SEABISCUIT), LAST SAMURAI is a familar road traveled.  And like SEABISCUIT, it might be a familar road, yet it is a very enjoyable ride.  When I was watching this film I was ready to dubbed it ""DANCES WITH WOLVES GOES EAST.""   Then as the film continued, I enjoyed this film more, simply because the action scenes were more enjoyable. Yet, although both films have the plot of the individual who was a part of the advancement of the modern world, then realizing that they enjoy the traditional world of what was thought to be their enemies.   Having the central character realize that the world and environement he grew up in was wrong. But, I still did highly enjoy this film.  Tom Cruise did a very good job in this film.  However, I don't think he will be getting that ""Oscar"" this year. Cruise wasn't as good as his role in MAGNOLIA, however with LAST SAMURAI Cruise proves that he is one of the best actors working in film. Timothy Spall(ROCK STAR,& VANILLA SKY) did a great job as the ""comic"" relief as well as the sidekick to Cpt. Algren.  Tony Goldwyn (GHOST & THE 6TH DAY)does his usual passable role as the villian. However if anyone comes out of this film deserving a Oscar nomination is Ken Watanabe who played the head samurai, Katsumoto.   Watanabe, coming from Japan, gives a outstanding role as the leader who teaches both Algren and the audience that death is meaningful as long it was done with honor. Listening to the audience members after the film was over, a lot of people were impressed with his performance.   I will say that Ken Watanabe should get recognized for his moving and emotional performance. The directing by Edward Zwick is enjoyable.  Zwick who is no stranger to epics (GLORY & LEGENDS OF THE FALL) does a very good job with this film making the 150 mins. go by pretty fast and entertaining.  But the cinematography by two time Oscar winner John Toll (LEGENDS OF THE FALL, BRAVEHEART, ALMOST FAMOUS) does a amazing job! Some of the scenes and images of this film were just very beautiful with the lighting, the images of the flower blossoms, and the tricks of the trade (TOT) shots.What really impressed me with this movie was the fight scenes with the samurai swords.  Woha!  I am a Akira Kurosawa fan, and seeing the sword fights done in this film makes the fights in the recent MATRIX films look pale in comparison. There is one fantastic scene of a unarmed, yet a trained Algren who is surrounded by government samurai's who all have swords. Watching this as well as a few other action scenes with the samurai fighting were great, making most of the action scenes from most of the 2003 films look boring to silly (except for ITALIAN JOB, PIRATES, & KILL BILL). I do applaud Edward Zwick for bringing the excitement and fantastic samurai fighting from the Kurosawa films. Overall, I think THE LAST SAMURAI will get some Oscar nods (Cinematography, Ken Watanabe; maybe picture & director) and it is that grand epic tradition like GLADIATOR, GANGS OF NEW YORK, and BRAVEHEART. It was at times predictable, but it was a fun and enjoyable ride.   Right now, for me, I would say that SEABISCUIT, MYSTIC RIVER, MASTER & COMMANDER, FINDING NEMO and LAST SAMURAI will be the ""front runners"" for nominations for Best Picture.  But that might change with other films including  Gus Van Saint's TURTLE, 21 GRAMS, and, of course, PETER JACKSON's RETURN OF THE KING.   But compared to the majority of the films out this year (like GIGLI...yeesh!) LAST SAMURAI proves to be one of the more enjoyable and entertaining films of 2003. ****1/2 (out of five)",The Last Samurai
138,Alex-372,Artistic License,7,15 June 2005,"Oh dear. The Last Samurai, directed by Edward Zwick (of the equally problematic Glory, with Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman, as well as the prophetic Under Siege), has directed a movie that is a Hollywood gumbo of historical facts, romantic fabrication and artistic license.The main character, captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), is sent to Japan so his Indian wars AND civil war experience can be put to use, teaching the Japanese modern warfare.One problem is that Zwick plays havoc with the timeline. In one scene, Algren witnesses a samurai having his top knot cut off by a squad of Japanese soldiers in Western uniforms, to which his friend Simon Gray (Timothy Spall) says: 'It has begun'. This then must have been during the Meiji Restoration, when the Samurai lost their privileges, from 1866 to 1869, just after the American Civil War (which ended in 1865), during which the Samurai lost the privilege to wear their top knot and their two swords.However, Algren also claims to have been traumatized, fighting Indians under George Armstrong Custer, who was killed at the battle of Little Big Horn, in 1876, at least 7 years later.I have serious doubts that the Samurai versus modern army battle ever took place, and if it did, it certainly was not after 1876.Then, there is the unlikely Madam Butterfly romance between the Yankee soldier and the wife of the Samurai he killed. At one point, she asks for permission to kill herself. Wouldn't it have occurred to Algren's protector Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), that she may also try to kill him by slipping something into his food or the sake he drinks so much of? Oh and by the way, the Japanese had experience with firearms before. However, because of high casualty rate on both sides, which led to famine (most of the foot soldiers were farmers), they were banned.The movie does however give an accurate picture of how the new weapons (howitzers, machine guns, rifles) made a huge impact in warfare, and made ""modern"" colonialism possible. It is no coincidence that colonialism came to it's high point (with the 1885 Vienna Conference) when these faster weapons made decisively defeating Native forces (Zulus, Native Americans, Indians) possible. The irony of course is that it were these weapons that came back to bite the West and destroy it only 40 years later, in Flanders fields.",The Last Samurai

He is captured by them and learns their traditions and code of honor.  The picture is a magnificent piece of gorgeous photography, the musical score is great, and the acting is superb. I got a bit bored by too much warfare and destruction, although I know that's the way of war.  I found it much too long at 3 hours.  8/10",The Last Samurai

Algrens engrossing passion is swayed when he is caught and held prisoner by the Samurai. When captured though, his passions and ideas are changed by what he sees and then decides to learn of their culture and traditions.The Last Samurai is thoughtful, engaging and totally original.

141,Chance2000esl,Dances With Samurai,6,28 March 2005,"""The Last Samurai"" is certainly a well made film with several excellent scenes at Katsumoto's mountain headquarters. The 'value reversal' of Algren would have been better if he had decapitated Katsumoto during his suicide (see Luke cutting off Darth Vader's hand). Although the loss of traditional values for the 'gain' of modern conveniences (for which the end of the samurai and their replacement by the more 'convenient' guns, rifles and cannons during the Meiji Era is a fitting metaphor) is an important message for us to keep in mind -- as in the West we have been inundated by McDonald's and massive chain store 'conveniences' but at what ethical and social cost?-- the movie is too much a retread of ""Dances with Wolves."" By the way, the 'spectacular Japanese scenery' is actually New Zealand, where much of the film was shot (see end credits).",The Last Samurai
142,TheOny13,"In my honest opinion, one of the best movies ever made!",10,23 July 2020,"You know, there's a feeling when you sometimes watch way too many bad movies and then you watch a pretty good one and you think ""Wow, the best movie I've seen in years!"". But then as the time passes you realize that it wasn't so good after all. You don't hate it but you at least acknowledge that you overestimated how good it was the first time you saw it. That's certainly not the case with ""The Last Samurai"" which for me as the time went by and I rewatched it again and again, it became better and better to the point in which I consider it as one of the best ever. Unlike other reviews where I am breaking the movie's plot in order to point out every single thing the movie does bad, I'm not gonna do that here and instead talk without spoiling the movie in case you want to see it.As a disclaimer, because there are many people criticizing the movie for that, I'm gonna mention this: The movie is not about a white man going to Japan and being the saviour of the country and showing the japanesse people how they could save themselves or show them their true principles which they forgot in the meantime. Nathan Algren portrayed by Tom Cruise is just an american soldier who is witnessing an event in the history of Japan. Even when he appears to show the japanese their old values and reminding them of who they used to be, he is only a mediator who transmits a message from some people to others. This not only builds and develops his character but is also a way of putting the audience in his place and feel what he feels, question themselves the way the main protagonist does. It's a simple storytelling technique but one that is at its most effective. Movie plot on short, The Last Samurai is about an american soldier who witnesses an event in the history of Japan. More detailed and not going into Spoilers teritory, it's about a battle of concepts between the Imperial Japan and the Old Japan who's history and legend of the samurais is starting to die off in favor of the modern imported culture that resembles the ones of the West. I should start talking about the story. The story is simple and the battle of these concepts is so well presented and because of Tom Cruise's character, us as viewers understand that even better. It's full of themes, moral lessons and questions about the nature of humanity when presented with great oportunity of upgrade. And the way the movie presents them, through characters hits hard and impacts the viewer, so much that by the end of the movie, I was a weeping mess. The performances were top notch all round with the highlight from Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise. This is probably the best role I saw Tom Cruise play and it's sad he didn't get an oscar nomination that year. Even the side characters are played beautifully and believably to the point that you feel immersed in a world that is at a conflict of concepts. Next, the soundtrack is pitch perfect. It's certainly one of Hans Zimmer's best soundtracks by far and one that I listen to again and again. The amount of themes and motifs in it is incredible and the eastern japanesse touch to it is fantastic. Next, the action scenes are breathtaking and are not too long or too short. They are beautifully builded and when they hit they don't hit only visually but also emotionally. As for cinematography or editing or directing, they are all as good as they could be and together make for a fantastic movie in general that stays with you long after you've first seen it.All put together this is a fantastic movie which has such a powerfull message about how people shouldn't forget who they are and not destroying their legacy, a legacy that people before us died in order to build. It's a movie about respect, honor and how a man who abides to a moral standard is maybe a better man, a one who finds a small measure of peace that we all search for and few of us ever find. There isn't a single scene or moment in the movie where I was bored or where I was desperate for it to end and go to the next scene. Not a useless moment in the movie. Everything is with purpose and everything ties in together at the end in an emotional and satisfying even inspiring ending to a movie that will stay with me and inspire me as long as I live. Truly one of the best ever in my opinion! 10/10",The Last Samurai

Check this film out as soon as possible, it is well worth the cost.",The Last Samurai
144,ilovedolby,"Starts our rough, but the film improves immensely.",8,7 December 2003,"Advertisements pushed Edward Zwick's `The Last Samurai' as if it were an Oscar worthy film. In some ways it is, in others, it is not. One cannot deny that the film has fantastic battles scenes, lavish sets and costumes and good performances, but the film struggles to find itself because of the main attraction-Tom Cruise. He is an accomplished actor with undeniable talent. But the problem is that he does not fit the character. Combined with a movie clichés, it leaves some disappointment. However, the film does an about face when the samurai enter. 	Nathan Algren (Cruise) is a former Civil War captain turned drunk because of his inability to deal with his past blunders under command resulting in the massacre of a Native American tribe. Now performing as a Winchester Gun spokesperson, he has been offered an opportunity to go to Japan to train Japanese soldiers to fight a samurai rebellion. He chooses to take the assignment because it offers him $500 a month. Soon after beginning their training, Algren is informed that the samurai intend to attack at a certain place and time. He argues that his men cannot fight the samurai because their training is insufficient. Regardless, he is forced to send his men into battle, which they lose easily. Algren is captured and taken prisoner to the village where the samurai live. While there, he becomes friends with the samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and learns of their traditions and why they rebel against the new dreams of modernization by the Emperor. Furthermore, he comes to self-actualization in this land where strength of mind and heart counter all. But he will still have to face his old life and former government on the battlefield once more. Cruise is a good bet when casting a film for his appeal among moviegoers. But one cannot cast an actor for that purpose alone. In the beginning, Cruise comes off as an actor trying desperately to play a drunk. Hardly believable when you have someone reading their lines so phonetically. His character should seem cockier, giving a greater presence of his arrogance and ignorance. However, as the film progresses, he falls into the role better. As such, his speaking so perfectly seems appropriate considering he is living a life that requires him to show respect. Another problem is one that I can only blame on the director-a cliché from one of his best films, `Glory.' In `The Last Samurai,' Algren tries to show his soldier's inadequate readiness for battle by having a soldier try to shoot at him. Obviously the soldier misses, but the scene plays out with Algren yelling at the soldier to load his riffle quickly, although he cannot. Algren yells, `DO IT! DO IT!' This is very similar to a scene in `Glory' where Commander Robert Shaw tries to get an African American soldier to do the exact same thing. Most will not recognize the obviousness of this scene. But to film buffs, it will leave a bitter taste on the part of Zwick's direction. The entrance of the samurai is incredible. They come out of the mist of the forest on horseback in slow motion evoking an eerie, yet astonishing sight. This is wherein the film gets far better and pulls itself out the pits of failure. Between lavish battle scenes, light moments of philosophy, and the improving performance on Cruise's part, `The Last Samurai' becomes an epic in movie quality similar to that of `Seabiscuit'-it starts out with clichés and errors, but quickly turns itself around to become a sweeping epic. ***",The Last Samurai
145,lotus_chief,The Last Samurai  one of the best films of the year,9,8 December 2003,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW!!***Seeing all the previews for this film, I repeatedly told myself `Last Samurai? TOM CRUISE???  No way!  That's gonna be so BAD!!  What is Hollywood coming to??'  After seeing it earlier tonight, Ill just saydon't be fooled. All of the praise and Oscar buzz this movie's been receiving is justified. This is a powerful, moving, engaging movie.  I was very impressed.  Tom Cruise is great in his role as Nathan Algren; he's a hit or miss with me, but he was wonderful.I'd even give him an Oscar nomination.  His performance is his best in a long time.  The person who absolutely stole the show, however, is Ken Watanabe as the last samurai', Katsumoto. He definitely should get an Oscar nod for his charismatic, poised, and extremely convincing portrayal of the rebel samurai.  He was absolutely wonderful.  The story of The Last Samurai is a human one at its core.  The many layers of the story all connect to the human element, and this is the beauty of the film.  I thought Tom Cruise was very convincing as Nathan Algren as he transformed from the drunken, arrogant yet tortured Civil War hero'..to the morally born-again, self-realized, humbled warrior, whose initially reluctant exposure to the culture he must help extinguish, helps him broaden his horizons and grow as a man and ultimately a soldier.  He falls in love with the culture that he and his culture deemed as savage and uncivilized. It's a beautiful story.The way the Samurai are portrayed is the arguably the most realistic and believable I've seen in a movie.  I was very intrigued to learn more about the culture and the way of the Samurai warrior.  I'd have liked the makers to go deeper into this with more detail, particularly on the fighting techniques and philosophies, but it was intriguing nonetheless.  The appearance of the ninja was a pleasant surprise and VERY exciting. 
My only gripe with the movie is that I felt that Nathan Algren should've died at the end.  It just didn't seem very feasible that he lived, seeing that he was the enemy now and they'd already started the job by shooting him several times during the Samurai's last stand.  Why didn't they finish him off?  Because he's an American?  He didn't seem like one when he showed up with the enemy with every intention of betraying and fighting against them!! The US Colonel himself said that he'd be treated like one of them' if he indeed betrayed them, which he did.  I found that to be a little unbelievable.  Then again, who else could've given the Emperor Katsumoto's sword?  There are plenty of names one could throw out easily, but it wouldn't have had the same impact that Tom Cruise had.  In my opinion, if Tom Cruise died, it would not only have been better for the overall impact of the film (note the deaths of Mel Gibson in Braveheart, Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan and Russell Crowe in Gladiator) but also better for the story; the reign of the Samurai does indeed end, they are slaughtered; the fact that he is the lone survivor is kinda lame.I'm sure the reason' is only because he was American.  But under those circumstances there is no way Cruise would've been spared.After Mystic River, The Last Samurai is one of the best films I've seen this year.  It's an epic that doesn't depend on being sappy and melodramatic. The gritty, treacherous tone of the film stays constant throughout, and you're forced to be intrigued throughout.  Sure the battle scenes (which were very well done) reminds us of Braveheart, but they're as exciting and moving as I've seen.  One can always question the historical accuracy of films like this, and The Last Samurai is not immune to those questions.  The cinematography was excellent, with the beautiful backdrops of Japan serving as the perfect canvas for the emotional and spiritual story laid before it. The acting is first-class and the story is rivetingwhat else can anyone ask for in a movie?  With all of the garbage being released by Hollywood, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't depend on CGI and silly gimmicks to get their point across.  I was surprised at how good this was; it was executed very well and I congratulate the makers of The Last Samurai for their great work.  I hope this film is recognized at the Oscars, particularly Ken Watanabehis performance, to me, is unforgettable.***1/2 out of **** stars.",The Last Samurai

147,MF210,I was a little disappointed but I still enjoyed it,8,19 January 2004,"Minor SpoilersMy Rating: *** out of ****. The first trailer I saw of the Last Samurai was easily one of the best trailers I saw last year. By the look of that trailer I had high hopes for the Last Samurai. When I saw the Last Samurai I was a little disappointed but I still enjoyed it. Let me mention the most obvious strength of the film: This is an absolutely stunning looking film. The sets and costumes are completely believable. The cinematography is amazing with many beautiful shots. The battle scene that takes place near the end of the film is spectacularly filmed.
Some people are saying that Tom Cruise's portrayal of Nathan Algren deserves an Oscar Nomination for his work here. I do not agree. Cruise is solid in the role but I do not think it is Oscar Material. However, Ken Watanabe's portrayal of Katsumoto is certainly worthy of an Oscar Nomination. This is a commanding and powerful performance that overshadows Cruise's performance. The rest of the supporting cast is solid. The problem with the Last Samurai is that its a little too long. There was one useless scene that did not go on that long but was really out of place (""Are you a Ladies Man, Bob""). The conversation with the emperor at the end of the film felt like it went on forever. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the Last Samurai. However, it was not a masterpiece and not Oscar Material, except for Watanabe's performance and some technical nods. I do recommend the film though.",The Last Samurai
148,deadbull-95171,"beautiful movie, questionable accuracy",9,20 June 2021,"It's a fine noble thing. Tom and Ken are terrific. It can all be summed up by NOBILITY. Nothing new, but exceptionally well done. Dances with wolves, Grey Owl, Avatar. American as an essentially evil and stupid culture still has a few good men. We've seen this depicted many times and all you have to do is wake up and live here for 5 minutes to KNOW your in the ""Matrix.""If I have any reservation, nothing as strong as a complaint, it is from the little I know of Samurai and Bushido culture. Unlike the American Indigenous people
that you (I surely didn't) massacred and exploited, and who continually tried to trust their conquerors endless lies, the eastern cultures we tried to invade had a more realistic response to loathsome USA policy and were not so receptive to a tear jerk merger as shown here, at least I have not been able to find a citable instance of it. Maybe there is one, but I'm not going to spend years researching to find that needle in that haystack.There are enough metaphoric realities going on and the real excellence of
the Japanese actors, along with Cruise at what might be his very best, a tight epic screenplay, good action sequences all add up to a terrific movie.Like Budweiser Light, this is Epic Light. It encompasses a time frame that qualifies it but not the many years that a full Epic might. Epic, as in Epoch, hence light. It takes a representative slice from the transitional period from Samurai political/military to industrial culture, and then unrealistically portrays a morally centered ex-drunkard American as the LAST of that great
warrior culture.It is a minor and largely irrelevant ""flaw"". I don't go to movies for TRUTH any more then I go to our government for moral or factual compass,it always impresses me when I consider military styles and ordinance going back a few centuries. The courage it took to go toe to toe with ancient weaponry took courage of an entirely different sort then the American sniper, hiding and shooting at a target a mile away etc, when he wasn't falsely claiming punching the Governor of Minnesota in his efforts to cash in........That sort of courage is long gone with the rarest of exceptions.",The Last Samurai
149,Ronin47,Awesome (****),10,12 December 2003,"Akira Kurosawa's 1954 masterpiece ""Seven Samurai"" is one of my favorite films of all time. The word ""samurai"" is in my e-mail address. So I like this kind of movie. Still, for some reason I wasn't expecting much from this film. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that Tom Cruise playing a samurai, much as I like him, struck me as less-than-promising. Whatever the case, I'm glad I went, because not only is it good, it is one HELL of an amazing film. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a Civil War veteran who is known publicly as a ""war hero"", but he is not proud of it. He is an alcoholic and is haunted by the memory of the war, particularly being ordered to slaughter innocent Native Americans. His new job is to go to Japan and train the Emperor's troops to wipe out the last of the country's samurai culture. In the first battle, though, he is taken prisoner by the samurai troops, led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Over a period of several months being their prisoner, Nathan gradually begins to understand their way of life and respect their dedication to honor and nature, and for probably the first time since before the war, he feels like he belongs somewhere. ""The Last Samurai"" is, without a doubt, one of the most visually impressive films of the year. There are many shots that are simply stunning in their beauty, and even if some of them were computer generated, I didn't care. Even in the indoor scenes, the cinematography is perfect. The battle sequences are thrilling and terrifying, and the mournful, emotive score by Hans Zimmer evokes memories of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".
So on the surface, the film is pretty much perfect. Which would be pretty cool on its own, but thankfully the film goes deeper. It takes its time detailing Algren's slow change of mind. It feels realistic because we know that this man had literally nothing but pain in his life, and found something new to live for in samurai culture. Another one of the film's main assets is the moving friendship that slowly evolves between Cruise's and Watanabe's characters. Cruise is very good as usual, but it's Watanabe's breathtakingly passionate performance that gives the film its heart and soul. When these two characters, who began the film diametrically opposed, work together and understand each other, it made me think of the great friendships in the action films John Woo used to make before he became just another Hollywood director. So is there anything in ""The Last Samurai"" that you haven't seen before? Probably not. But I can tell you that this is about as good as epic, mainstream Hollywood filmmaking gets. It's enormously exciting, suspenseful, fast-paced, it has a number of great characters, and it engages all the right emotions at all the right moments without being too manipulative.
You could argue that it's not all that deep (and I might even agree), but there are certainly resonant themes of honor, self-discovery, the death of unfairly outmoded cultures, and the absurdity of war. It's about all those things, but mainly it's about serving you up a great, involving story, and there it definitely succeeds.",The Last Samurai

152,fredericksmith1952,Based very loosely on the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877,10,1 March 2012,"Based very loosely on the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, this two and one half hour epic is one of the closest views to Japanese life before western culture ever shot by an American. Tom Cruise shows us his ability to develop and mature as a character throughout the film, and Ken Watanabe displays the quiet yet powerful acting he is known for. The power and emotion of the film are riveting, and the scenery is incredibly beautiful. Supporting roles are exceptionally acted, with special credit to Billy Connolly for his brilliant, if not brief, portrayal as Sargent Zebulon Grant, the hard nosed enlisted man who is tasked with ""whipping"" the soldiers into shape. The only major flaw I see is a technical one that was added to the film to provide a more dramatic ending, and that is the use of Gatling Guns, which were in use in South America and Europe at the time, but not in the Orient. I believe Mr. Zwick did an excellent job in portraying the Imperial Court politics of the day. Omura is the prime example of a man consumed with greed and power, and his influence over the Emperor Meiji, the boy who has been thrust into the role of living god, is evident in every scene. Rated R for violence and language, this film is probably acceptable for teens who play battle games on their X-Box or Play Stations, but the little ones should probably be in bed or doing something else.

155,jrfranklin01,A Dying Honor from the East,7,17 May 2004,"Like that of Braveheart, The Patriot, and Dances with Wolves, The Last Samurai centers around the struggle a minority faces in standing up for its way of life.  The year is 1876 and thanks to Commodore Perry, the island nation of Japan discovers the ""modern"" world.  The emperor of the great nation, in an effort to modernize his country and bring about an industrial revolution, brings in western influence. But this influence is comprised of self-interested greedy parties who care nothing for Japan's people.  As a result, the emperor is misguided into disbanding the devout Samurai, who have protected the country for a thousand years.  They are asked to give up their way of life and step aside to western influence so that a new unified militaristic army of Japan may be formed.In charge of the task to train this army is Captain Algren (Tom Cruise).  We discover Algren to be a man suffering from horrible nightmares over his actions against the American indians.  He spends most of his time in the bottle to escape his self-torture and guilt. He agrees to be privately hired for the Japan assignment because he knows nothing else than war and that seems to be what he is fit for.Algren begins training the rudimentary new army of Japan but soon finds himself prematurely ordered to march them into battle against the Samurai. The impending defeat of the untrained soldiers comes as no surprise as the Samurai sweep over them in a furious wave of violence.  But Algren's life is spared by the leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto, whose sees him as a remarkable warrior and the physical manifestation of a vision he encountered.Algren begins to undergo a transformation as he is kept prisoner by the Samurai.  Living with them, he begins to see the tribal people for who they are and respects and admires their honor, kindness, discipline, and perfection as a way of life.  He eventually is welcomed into their confidence and begins training in their ways.When the time arrives for Algren to choose whose side he is going to fight for, whether he is an man of the west or the east, Algren chooses that of the Samurai.  He does so as an act of redemption and because he realizes the importance in defending what you believe.   Despite the enormous odds against the tribal people, the Samurai are excited for the chance to make their stand and embrace their way of life to die with honor.Algren and Katsumoto lead the Samurai into battle to die a glorious death, as all Samurai, save Algren, are defeated by the new army of Japan (hence the title).  The weapons of the old (swords, bows and arrows) are defeated by that of the new (cannons, rifles, machine guns).  And in one of the more dramatic and heartfelt sad endings, we see the bravery and dignity of a simple culture mowed down by the technological cowardice of the complex world.  The question this ending poses is whether it is more honorable or foolhardy to fight for a way of life, even in the face of an imminent and gruesome death.  I will let you decide.",The Last Samurai
156,merrywood,A moving celebration of life.,8,17 December 2003,"Overall The Last Samurai is a beautifully written document visualized by some of the top professionals of the film trade. It is a fiction; however, an overlay nesting over a historical period of transition in Japan as it begins to embrace the West after centuries of isolation.
All of the finest production values are in place. My most ardent complaint is the selection of Tom Cruise as the protagonist. At no point in the picture did I or could I forget that I was looking at Tom Cruise playing a part. This single quirk withheld the moviegoing experience from its promise of sufficiency for me.Still, I must recommend the film. It is powerfully moving and produced with the artistry that only the top professionals in the pixbiz can accomplish. More than likely we all know the film's Logline: A man who loses his soul on the killing fields of the late 19th Century Indian Wars of the American West finds it again in the far Eastern spiritual vortex of a Japan also in transition. The movie suggests that those who embraced Samurai and its Bushido Code were all noble, decent men, which is of course not true. Yet embedded within the concept of Samurai (which most us know means ""to serve"") is the idea of honor. In this idea we see that there was never really a ""last Samurai"" in Japan but that Samurai underwent spiritual transition to a work and production ethic. This ethic today leads the entire world in peerless industrial achievement and products that are generally unmatched in quality by any other nation.",The Last Samurai
157,extravaluejotter,Dances With Wolves set in Japan,4,5 September 2006,"In 1990, Kevin Costner directed and starred in ""Dances With Wolves"", a story about a disillusioned American army officer who goes to live with native Americans and learns something about himself. The ""Fish Out of Water"" tale is an old one, but Costner and screenwriter Michael Blake managed to inject some soul into it and the result is now a movie classic.Transplanting the ""Fish Out of Water"" story to 19th Century Japan doesn't work because it has no human or emotional core. All that ""The Last Samurai"" manages to do is provide Tom Cruise with another star vehicle. I reckon that there is more truth about Bushido in the comic book, ""Usagi Yojimbo"". Cruise has acted well in other movies but in this one he merely goes through the motions. He is like a man learning to handle a katana sword without understanding any of the ritual or tradition behind its use.The script is a tired cliché from start to finish. Despite the director's visual flair and the efforts of the actors (apart from Cruise, who faxes his performance in from Palm Beach), the film fails to offer anything more than the odd moment of spectacle. The rest is a mish-mash of cod philosophy and second-rate political thriller filler.The final battle of the film is pure Spaghetti Western and an unworthy tribute to the last real Samurai of Japan.Not a truly awful film but too bland and uninspiring to be rated as highly as ""Dances With Wolves"".",The Last Samurai
158,Pavel-8,The Last Caucasian.,8,19 December 2003,"In my high school writing class, I was told that when writing a paper I should do tell the reader what I was going to say, say it, and then explain what I said. While that is an excellent primer for the written word, the method doesn't translate as well to the big screen, as effectively illustrated in this film of great themes, which is slightly marred by heavy-handed redundancy. **Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**""The Last Samurai"" tells the story of Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, a unhappy and drunk Army captain who is recruited by the Emperor of Japan to train the incompetent Japanese troops in the ways of modern weaponry. The purpose is to combat the (ahem) last samurai, led by the fearsome Katsumoto. Before long, Algren falls into enemy hands, and the bulk of the film follows his experience as the prisoner of the samurai, who indoctrinate him into their culture. As the main character, Cruise plays a part akin to every other role he's had, a cocky yet talented guy who learns his lesson over the course of the film. But he once again nails the part, this time with more human emotion than normal. In a role that could have easily been done in an over-the-top manner, Cruise chose not to do so and proved very effective. I don't think it's an Oscar-caliber performance, but it does rank among his best work. I do think that Ken Watanbe as Katsumoto is worthy of an Academy Award nomination. A new face to American cinema, his pathos-packed performance is the soul of this film, a physically imposing presence who fills the screen literally and figuratively. A la Chow Yun-Fat, he appears primed to make the Pacific leap to stardom in the United States. As is apparent from the advertising, this is intentionally a film of epic scope, and that theme enjoyably oozes through the technical aspects of the movie thanks to an experienced top-notch crew. Director Edward Zwick (""Glory,"" ""Courage Under Fire"") again provides a sure and steady hand in getting what he wants and needs out of all participants. In a musical style reminiscent of his ""Black Hawk Down"" work, Hans Zimmer presents his usual excellent orchestral accompaniment with clear and ear-pleasing tinges of Eastern music. Editors Victor Du Bois and Steven Rosenblum, who both worked on ""Braveheart,"" accomplish the underrated achievement of comprehensibly piecing together chaotic battle scenes. And speaking of that film, Cinematographer John Toll also shot ""Braveheart"" and ""The Thin Red Line,"" and one can see visual similarities between the films. Toll provides the mandatory sweeping battlefield shots, along with numerous slow pans that allow time for the passion of the Japanese culture to bleed through the screen. While some movies thrive with the help of or in spite of their behind-the-scenes aspects, Last Samurai excels because of the firm technical foundation. The main annoyance I have with ""Last Samurai"" is its single-minded intent to hammer the virtue of Japanese culture into the thick American skulls. Within the first half hour, the theme is made evident, but that does not prevent the filmmakers from iterating and reiterating it to the very end of the film. Before long, this wears on the audience, leaving them a bit antsy over the last half hour, which would have been better off shortened or altered, instead dragging down the film in the final act. I don't say this to minimize the importance of culture in this film. In fact, I think it was portrayed very well, but even something done well becomes bothersome when repeated too many times. Bottom Line: This film still attains near-greatness. In a lackluster cinematic year, it will assuredly be on my top ten list, entrenched a cut below the top tier as a film that is better than most and will deservedly earn a handful of nods come January.  8 of 10.",The Last Samurai
159,rcavellero,"TOM CRUISE ASIDE, THE FILM MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR A MEMORABLE FILM EPIC",8,7 December 2003,"I just want to say that I went into this film wanting to hate it. Although I've never really hated a Tom Cruise movie I've always been put off by the fact that he's in them. It angers me in a way. I don't think he's a particularly good actor and his film choices usually seem like crowd pleasing safe ones. Don't get me wrong he's not really a bad actor either he's ranged from the slightly off(Born on the fourth of July) to the decent(Jerry Macguire) and to the even more confident(Eyes Wide Shut). This film presents his performance in various degress from cheesy and melodramatic to inspired and worthy. Sadly enough theres not an overwhelming abundance of the second. But the film fares just fine without it. Edward Zwick of legends of the Fall has created a truly moving epic. It's in the race to be the most depressing film of the year right after Ron Howard's The Missing. Although it seems a bit contrived the film ultimatly delivers on a very emotional epic scale.  Tom Cruise stars as a Captain during the civil war. He suffers from guilt and has turned to alcohol from seeing so many innocent native americans butchered. He longs for his life to have meaning and to find some sort of peace. He's shipped off to Japan to teach their soldiers to defend themselves in combat with guns against the samaurais'. He is unfortunatly captured after a fierce and gory battle and succumbs to their way of life and their teachings. Ultimatly adapting to it and learning to love it and the people around him. It is truly a wonder too see the film progress on an emotional level and no matter who you are it will at least draw a tear or two. The film for the most part is well acted, the script is decent with a few unintentionally funny lines, the direction is simplistic and grand at the same time, the score is moving and the cinematography is lush and mood driven. All in all you must give Credit where credit is due. And although Tom Cruise may not totally deserve it he does do an average to above average job of capturing his charachter's complex emotions. Tom Cruise aside, the film more than meets the criteria for a memorable film epic.",The Last Samurai

Tom Cruise is completely Oscar worthy in this movie he perfectly portrays his traumatised war veteran and really makes you care about him every step of the way. Ken Watanabe is every bit Cruises equal he is so sympathetic and interesting to watch and your just begging that he will ultimately succeed in his cause. The great thing about this movie is the fact that it chooses to focus on the friendship between the two main characters instead of the battle scenes. It gives the film a greater meaning and a deeper message so that your not bored in between the action sequences, which by the way are incredible to watch. The entire second act of this movie is my favourite section of the movie because it gives you a chance to really delve into these characters and builds gradually to the final battle. It's heartwarming to see Cruise gradually build a connection with these people. The final battle is incredible it puts you right in there with the characters and puts you on the edge of your seat. The final scene between Algren and Katsumoto is just beautiful, few times have the editing, score, acting and directing all come together so perfectly and leaves my eyes pouring every time I watch this movie.The Last Samurai could have been a simple war movie but proves itself to be much more than that with amazing performances and great themes that has become one of my all time favourite movies and deserved much more credit than critics gave it.

Normally I miss these type of things the first time around, but there were a few that were just really jumped at me.  I would give this film a 10 if it weren't for the last 15 or so seconds, which I feel was not needed, and for the notoriously bad shot of Tom Cruise on the horse in the final battle.

164,cashbacher,Brutal clash of internal cultures within Japan,10,8 January 2019,"This is a great war movie, the action is fierce, unforgiving and intense. Even though the viewer knows what the outcome of the climactic battle will be, the goal of the ""good side"" is not to win, but to lose gloriously.
As the title suggests, the backdrop is Japan in a time of great transition. Although Japan was closed to foreigners for 200 years, there was enough leakage so that the rulers of Japan were well aware of what the British and other western powers were doing in China, essentially subjugating it. They also knew that they had no weapons that could stand against those of the colonial powers.
Therefore, when the American Commodore Perry sailed into Edo Bay in 1853 and carried out a show of arrogance and force, the Japanese government had no choice but to accede. This led to a national crisis in Japan, where the rulers knew that they had two choices, modernize the country or be subjugated like China was.
The internal conflicts within Japan in the rush to modernize forms the background for this movie. For centuries, the warrior class of Japan were the samurai, skilled soldiers that fought using only hand weapons, most commonly swords, bows and spears. They resisted the modernization efforts, so the government formed a modern army with firearms and cannons to defeat them.
Tom Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a highly decorated soldier that is now in a love affair with the bottle. Algren is recruited to train the fledgling Japanese Army, but after the initial skirmish, he is captured by the samurai leader, Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe. During his lengthy captivity, Algren learns to appreciate the discipline and beliefs of the samurai, taking their side in the hopeless fight against the modern Japanese Army.
The performances of Cruise and Watanabe are superb, the viewer becomes very empathetic towards the samurai, all while knowing that their cause is hopeless. While these exact events did not happen, there is enough historical truth to make it a history lesson. The mindset of the samurai also will help viewers understand the Japanese unwillingness to surrender in World War II. For they were only following the bushido code.",The Last Samurai
165,FilmSnobby,Cruise discovers Kurosawa; audience pays the price.,3,6 December 2003,"Tom Cruise stars in  *Dances With Samurai* . . . er, *The Last Samurai*, a movie that asks us to bemoan Western cultural imperialism while at the same time being a piece of Western cultural imperialism.  But that shouldn't particularly bother American audiences, who are never so happy when spoonfed the same mush over and over.  And boy, is this movie the same mush!  It takes its plot directly from Costner's  *Dances With Wolves*, right down to the Civil War era  (OK, this takes place a little after the War)  and even the journal kept by the hero.  And once again, this movie, like Costner's, proposes the patrician notion that only a scion from Western Civilization can possibly teach the older and presumably more naive culture about just how corrupt Westerners can be.  Again, the hero renounces his own culture and thoroughly steeps himself in the alien one, and again the benefits of the cultural exchange are given primarily one way:  FROM white, TO Other. AND AGAIN  (sorry to keep repeating myself, but  *Samurai*  and  *Dances* are really the same movie), the story tries to have its cake while eating it, i.e. by trashing the Westerners as corrupt while carefully eliding any unpleasant aspects of the older culture it purports to elevate.  Meaning, we see none of the degrading subjection of women, the narrow and limiting tradition of the tribal blood feud, the empty militarism at the expense of cultural broadening, the rigid caste system, the scientific and medical ignorance, etc. etc.  On the contrary.  The village where Cruise is held prisoner during the winter and spring is seen as an idyllic paradise where its inhabitants spend every waking hour doing some self-improving activity or other.  It's a village run by some pretty nice warlords.  Needless to say, Akira Kurosawa wouldn't have made this movie.  (Remember farmer Mifune's excoriating of the samurai in  *Seven Samurai*?)But it's inevitable, and doubtless intended, that this movie will be compared to some of Kurosawa's samurai epics, particularly the later ones like  *Kagemusha*  and  *Ran*.  To give  *The Last Samurai*  its due, the swordfights and the climactic battle are very well executed:  staged intelligently, and throbbing with catch-your-breath excitement.  Director Edward Zwick shows that the superb battle scenes in his earlier  *Glory* were no fluke:  if anything, he has improved as an action director.  The great battle in this movie excels Gibson's accomplishment in  *Braveheart* by a good measure, and even touches Kurosawa's savage beauties.  But that's where the artistry -- and the comparisons to Kurosawa -- end  (or should end, if there's any critical acumen out there).  I'm sorry to say that Mr. Cruise, perhaps even out of a love for Kurosawa's old films, just couldn't resist the ample opportunity to horn in on one of cinema's great traditions. Perhaps the ego dictated that he could  ""add""  to this tradition, or at any rate make it  ""accessible""  to modern  (and American)  audiences.  One hopes the Japanese won't be fooled:  surely they'll see that what this movie is REALLY about is Tom Cruise, not the warrior caste of old Japan.  It's about HIS sufferings, HIS saintly guilt, HIS learning of an alien, old tradition (and HIS subsequent improving of it), HIS romance with the beautiful widows who can't help falling in love with HIM because HE is, after all, Tom Cruise Of The Magnificent Long Hair Blowing In The Wind, and finally HIS moral supremacy over everyone else in the movie.  Armies genuflect to, Emperors and warlords take advice from, HIM.  Or, to sum it all up in a line:  ""SHOW ME THE MONEY!!!""",The Last Samurai
166,jazzest,The Late 19th Century Is Not Suitable For Samurai Epic,5,29 July 2004,"This samurai epic made by American filmmakers realizes an exotic fantasy towards Middle-Ages Japan for some people from the West and an idea of multiculturalism for everyone else, but a late-19th-century setting weakens the film's backbone. While the setting is a necessary excuse for the filmmakers because that was the time when an American could go to Japan and be a part of a guerrilla samurai group, it is apparently not suitable to portray samurai positively, when they are the obsolete people who cannot adapt themselves to the changes. With the emperor clearly pictured as a puppet of the new government, the motivation of Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) to support him and resist the government is unclear and maybe historically inaccurate; throughout the Middle Ages, the nation of Japan had been ruled by a samurai government that also used the emperor as a figurehead.Technical note: Montages are overused; almost all scenes are established by them.",The Last Samurai

In fact, it was necessary for him to do so (To explain how Katsumoto lived to the Emperor, and to show him that he is willing to die for principle).

168,murtaza_mma,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Pride and Honour,9,17 May 2009,"The Last Samurai is a brilliantly crafted aesthetic pleasure, studded with supernal performances from Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise. In fact, Tom Cruise unarguably gives his best ever performance, surpassing his portrayal of Jerry Maguire in the eponymous flick. His plaintive portrayal of Nathan Algren, not only evokes pathos but also seeks sympathy of the contemporary viewer, who can vicariously relate to Algren's disconcertion, owing to his inner conflicts of patriotism vis-à-vis humanity.However, it is Ken Watanabe, who steals the show with his mesmerizing and poignant portrayal of Katsumoto, the leader of the last clan of Samurai. His screen presence and delivery is truly amazing and even outshines that of Tom Cruise, which is a compliment in itself. The scenes between Watanabe and Cruise are pure gold, depicting fluctuating feelings of hostility, compassion and camaraderie. Watanabe's intense and powerful performance in which he displays a wide range of emotions, is definitely worthy of the coveted statuette, but the academy never fails to disappoint. Watanabe's brilliant portrayal, not only mesmerizes the viewers, but also convinces the critics of his acting abilities. The tacit adoration between Algren and Taka (subtly played by Koyuki), enormously adds to the beauty of the movie. All this coupled with some brilliant cinematography and a mesmerizing score, makes it a treat to watch and a truly surreal experience.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",The Last Samurai

The story revolves around a civil war vet in the 1800's Nathan Algren (Cruise in one of his better performance's since Michael Mann's Collateral). Nathan is sent to Japan to help the Japs defend of the Samuri, whom are being a real pain in the ass. Cruise being beaten in battle is now captured by them and learns their way of life from their leader Katsumoto (Watanabe). Nathan's eyes are opened to see who truly is the worse of the two, he is turned against the Japaniese and fights in one of the biggest sword swing, horse riding battles of all time (Just my opinion).

170,Lupercali,Disappointing,6,21 June 2004,"You can't really fault Tom Cruise's performance: once again he reveals that he can be more than adequate without being stellar. It's more the film as a whole; it's general lack of emotional impact.Cruise plays a frontier hero of the American-Indian 'wars', cynical and filled with self-loathing over his part in the atrocities. A large salary lures him to Japan to modernise and train the Emperor's army, and to fight off an insurgent Samurai and his peasant army, who refuse to use firearms.The most obvious parallel that springs to mind is 'Dances With Wolves', but 'Last Samurai' has little of the emotional clout of 'Wolves'. Instead it seems a transparent white liberal attempt to redeem the country from American Indian holocaust by personifying the nation in  Cruise's character. This may have worked if the film hadn't been so inexplicably flat and dull.

172,clydestuff,"Zwick, Cruise, Ken Watanabe and John Toll Give us an incredible experience",10,13 January 2004,"Edward Zwick, the director who gave us the film Glory back in 1989, has in my opinion not quite been able to live up to his capabilities since  that film.  Films like Courage Under Fire and Legends of the Fall were good films but severely flawed at times.  Finally, as director of The Last Samurai, he has given us the film we've been waiting for from him for over ten long years.  Zwick along with writers John Logan and Marshall Herkovitz, have given us two extremely complex characters. Tom Cruise portrays Nathan Algren and Ken Watanabe portrays his adversary Katsumoto.  Cruise is one of those actors that seems never to get the credit that he deserves.  It is the same bit of silly business applied to Paul Newman for many years. His looks and stardom seemed to have deterred and distracted some film goers and critics from understanding the depth of his acting prowess for years. Much of the same can be said when some critics write now about Cruise.  With films on his resume such as Minority Reports, Vanilla Sky, Jerry Maguire and Born on the Fourth of July, Cruise has shown himself to be consistently an actor who is willing to not only take chances but to bring depth to all his roles.  As Nathan Algren he continues in that mold.  Algren is a man tormented by yet resigned to his profession.  He is continually haunted by visions of Indian women and children being slaughtered, yet we are never sure if he feels any particular remorse.  He uses alcohol to numb himself against the demons he is carrying yet he again sells his services as a mercenary to a Japanese country that is quickly modernizing itself.  His job is to help arm and train a Japanese army and assist them in wiping out a Samurai uprising.  In essence, the same thing he has always done and seems resigned to do till he meets his end.The leader of the Samurai is Katsumoto.  He is willing to fight to the death to uphold the traditions of the life he knows much in the same way the American Indians fought.  He fights for the emperor yet it is the emperor who will send an army out to destroy Katsumoto and his warriors.  When Algren is forced to lead his rag tag army into battle against the Samurai before they are obviously ready, his men are quickly defeated.  Algren, however, continues to battle to the very end.  Just before Algren is ready to be killed, Katsumoto impressed by the fierceness with which Algren fights, instead takes him prisoner so that he may understand his enemy.As they learn about each other, we too begin to understand the complexity of these two men and the paths they have chosen.   Ken Watanabe brings Katsumoto to life with such precision and depth, he is able to give us not only an understanding of the Samurai, but makes us admire a world totally different from our own and to sympathize with his cause. 
There is a love story in this film, but unlike most films it is played out beneath the surface.  We know it is there but it is never directly spoken of and simmers continually beneath the surface. Many a director would not have been able to resist the temptation to play this out as a full blown romance, but Zwick admirably keeps things in check thanks in large part to Koyuki. Koyuki plays Taka, in such a reserved quiet performance that we at no time can doubt her sincerity.  There are issues between Algren and Taka, but you'll have to see the film as I'm not one to give away every little plot development.If one wanted to take a lesson in how to stage and film a battle sequence Zwick gives it here.  Many battles in film today are stage and film with the emphasis being on confusion.  Zwick goes in the other direction and it pays great dividends.  John Toll, above all else, with New Zealand passing for Japan, has photographed a world of richness, beauty and grace that alone is worth the price of a movie ticket.If you are one of the many film goers who found it necessary to rush out to see Return of the King and having done that are looking for something else to view during the rest of the winter, you can't go wrong with this film.  I highly highly recommend it.My Grade: A+",The Last Samurai

I remember upon returning to my empty dorm room that I just sat, mesmerized in thinking about how much history some people's cultures contain and how us as Americans have so little.The story of ""The Last Samurai"" is magnificent and I thought that the end battle was incredibly moving. When the galitzers started firing, it really breaks your heart. It is very sad when Katsumoto dies, but it is amazing how he has garnered so much respect that even his enemies bow down to him in his final minutes of life.

175,Ishallwearpurple,A good story for mature people----,9,12 March 2004,"The Last Samurai (2003-D. Edward Zwick)  Tom Cruise is Nathan Algren, a disillusioned officer who fought in the civil war and later, in the Indian wars.  His last battle was at Little Big Horn with Custer.   Now he is drinking hard and giving talks in tent shows about his exploits.  He is asked to go to Japan and help modernize the military there and get rid of the Samurai's and their culture.   The biggest problem is he hates the officer who would be over him, Col. Bagley (played by Tony Goldwyn as a clueless bigot) but takes the job anyway.  After training the raw recruits of the new Japanese army, who have never before held firearms and can't shoot straight, for just a few months he is ordered to take them against the Samurai.  He demonstrates that they are not ready in a great sequence standing in front of a target and ordering the terrified man to shoot at him.  Finally the man does and misses by a mile, but Bagley orders him and the rookies into battle anyway. 
Against the great Samurai these hapless recruits are annihilated, and Algren, wounded, is about to be killed, when the leader, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) orders him brought back to their home in the mountains.   Thus the story becomes about the ensuing friendship and understanding between two very different cultures. For mature people who need a good story with their action/adventure films, this is the ticket.  By the last battle, I was in tears and wanted to shout 'hooray' when Bagley is finally downed, even though we know the battle has been lost.

Ken Watanabe was absolutely fascinating as Katsumoto, and he really deserves plenty of recognition, and deserving an Oscar nomination. The chemistry between Cruise and Watanabe is quite enjoyable, and really does work as they try to get know each other. Also, I thought Koyuki the actress that play the Samurai's wife that was killed by Cruise's character is actually very good. While I do give praises to the chemistry between Cruise and Watanabe, I also do enjoy the chemistry between Cruise and Koyuki; they both played each other really well. The romance between the two really works, especially during some of the quite moments in the movie are actually very well effective. I thought the cinematography is beautifully shot, and really does capture that particular time era as it is set in Japan. Edward Zwick's direction is actually very good, and he does tell a great story. The music by Hans Zimmer is powerful, energetic, and it is beautiful. The battle scene at the end is well done, but I do think that it is a little bit too long and wish if they trim some parts out so it wouldn't be too long. I really do enjoy watching ""The Last Samurai"" and I am giving it a 10 out of 10.",The Last Samurai
179,tomrito,"Great film, until the end",9,11 December 2003,"Went to see the film last night and really liked most of it. For someone who likes historical or cultural period films this is a must see. There are so many good visual pleasures that the two and half-hours seem to go by very quickly. Even the acting, by everyone, was very good. Then comes the ending. I don't know what it is about the people in Hollywood today, but their need to make their own distorted political statement has not only destroyed true historical events but it has rendered them incapable of making a really good classic film. Because of this self serving Hollywood ending they have delegated this film to be just another of their soon forgotten could-have-been movies. For a film that deals with honor and integrity, they have dishonored the Samurai with their false ending.",The Last Samurai

181,ereinion,East meets West...and the East wins!,8,19 February 2005,"This is something I've been waiting for for so long. To see a movie about Japanese culture and samurai tradition succeed in the West. Of course, the only way it could have been done was if it was made by the Americans. And I must say that Edward Zwick and the rest have done an admirable job. This movie is done in an authentic Japanese style and only thing that stands out as un-Japanese is Tom Cruise.The movie is set in the late 19th century and talks about the so-called Meiji-restoration, a special chapter in Japan's history when Japan was made a modern state, partly modeled on Western countries. The error is that Meiji is supposedly impressed with USA and wants to create an army which is modeled on theirs. That was not the case because Americans never trained their army but the Prussians and it's more likely that Meiji and his government were closer connected to them than USA, as it was later shown in Japan's history when they allied themselves with Hitler's Germany. And it is not unlikely because the two countries share many similarities in the way their society and state is modeled.But lets return to the movie itself. Ken Watanabe caught the eye of Hollywood here for the first time and deservedly so, for his performance is impressive at every turn and same can be said about his screen presence. Another pleasant surprise to me was Koyuki, the young Japanese actress who brings her breathtaking beauty and charisma into the film, like a breathe of fresh air in a movie elsewhere dominated by stern and grim-looking men. Hiroyuki Sanada is a pleasure to watch as always, although he gets too little screen time. His fencing scenes with Cruise are a joy to watch and both actors do a great job there. Shin Koyamada is also a pleasant surprise as Katsumoto's son who dies a heroic death ensuring the escape of his father and his warriors in a well shot scene. The ninja attack and the final battle are incredibly well choreographed and shot. Tom Cruise is credible as Algren and although his less-than-imposing presence makes it hard to picture him as a swashbuckling macho hero, he still serves his purpose.""The Last Samurai"" is one of the most positive happenings in the 21st century Hollywood. It recreated a lost culture, a culture that was as admirable as it was cruel and stern. The cherry tree scene is among the most expressive and beautiful I have seen in an American film. Ken Watanabe's Oscar worthy performance, the beauty and charisma of Koyuki and the sweeping landscapes and battle scenes are more than enough to bring you pleasure. 8/10",The Last Samurai
182,jcanettis,A Wonderful Epic,9,22 February 2004,"""The Last Samurai"" is a wonderful epic. The story is about the tale of American army captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) who is sent to Japan in the 18th century, in order to help the emperor train his army and crash a rebellion by disobedient Samurais who straggle to retain the country's cultural purity; Algren's experience in fighting native Indians is considered his ""asset"" for his task. Things begin to work out very differently however, when Algren gets captured by the Samurais, and begins to admire their mission, code of ethics, and way of life.Tom Cruise is astonishing in his touching and grandiose role as Captain Algren, whom we watch transform gradually from a wrecked, semi-alcoholic, and nihilistic person, into an honorable, energetic, and passionate Samurai. The parallels with Kevin Kostner in ""Dances With Wolves"" are inescapable, but the difference here is that the norms and customs of the tribe that Algren joins (the Japanese Samurai) are far less familiar to the Western public, and this gives an extra exotic ""plus"" to the film. The performance of the other actors is also superb, but for me the greatest impact was made by Ken Watanabe as legendary Katsumoto.""The Last Samurai"" has all the necessary ingredients of a great epic: Drama, emotion, action, war, heroism, and love. The high-class photography, scenery, and costumes, complete the perfection. 9/10.",The Last Samurai

At first he doesn't understand the ways of the samurai but when he is held ""captive"" he begins to understand a new way of life and honour.

187,hooma814,Moving!,9,12 September 2020,"I love the Last Samurai. I was surprised to see it get some bad reviews and have a lower than expected rating. This is definitely at least 8/10. After looking into some of the reasons, many are history buffs and snobs who throw away all enjoyment of movie because of historical inaccuracies. Braveheart is one of the most historically inaccurate movies, but is still awesome to watch. The same is true of the Last Samurai. It's not like the movie is trying to claim that everything is true anyway, if it had started by saying based on a true story, then yes it would be more of a joke. But don't take away from the whole when that wasn't it's aim anyway.
It's aim I believe is to tell show us that the Western way of living isn't the only way to live and not even the best way to live, and that in many ways we have lost what was once beautiful and good about life and replaced it with power, greed and selfishness.
Hans Zimmer shows again why he is so highly regarded and is pretty much the greatest composer of all time, in my opinion. I love listening to this soundtrack.
The movie is a slow build. Something that I would imagine many 21st Century people have lost the ability to appreciate, labelling it boring and slow. Some things just cannot be done quickly in a movie, you cannot purchase or quickly buy raw emotion and character development. These things take time, and The Last Samurai is willing to take that time to show you Tom Cruise's development and healing from being a broken solider struggling with PTSD to someone who has found a renewed life and healing. It is a beautiful story and exposes all the evil and wrong parts of Western society that have only gotten worse over the last century. Great to see that this seems more authentically Japanese than other Hollywood movies and the dedication and casting of the crew is excellent.Great movie and also a very interesting time in Japan's history. This movie doesn't need to be 100% accurate. Even the fact that it isn't has made me want to go research more and find out more about the Meiji Restoration and the Asia Pacific War.",The Last Samurai
188,Sfpsycho415,Great Samurai Movie--- 8/10,8,7 December 2003,"I am probably gonna have dreams of being in Japan's beautiful countryside, practicing sword skills and drinking sake after watching this movie. It is a very interesting film, not only because of it's incredible battle scenes, but it's look into old Japanese culture and it's focus on the violent civil war between a modernizing government and rebellious samurai. I don't know too much about that time, but the writers didn't seem to put anything in the movie that was historically inaccurate or too ""Hollywood"". The cast did an amazing job as well. Tom Cruise gives the best performance i have seen him in, but in my opinion, Ken Watanabe steals the show. He is the lead samurai who takes Algren (Cruise) prisoner in a samurai village. I think he deserves the Best Supporting Oscar, or, at the very least, a nomination. Koyuki is a beautiful woman who hosts Algren in her home at the asking of Wanatabe. She brings a peace and beauty to a place that is ravaged by war. The pace sags here and there, but the action and performances more then make up for it. 8/10",The Last Samurai
189,bbbl67,typical Hollywood epic,6,5 July 2004,"This is a typical Hollywood epic: high on visuality, low on novelty. The basic plot is utterly predictable: white man goes to conquer savage backward natives, falls in love with their way of life (and one of their women too) and repents and decides to adopt their way of life. Now where have we seen that plot before? On the good side, this movie is extremely good as a DVD, the photography is stunning, and the audio uses the full range of Dolby Digital sound effects. Also the DVD shows how much attention to detail the filmmakers paid to making sure that all of the weapons used in the movie were authentic looking and relevant. They made sure the Japanese soldiers used authentic rifles of that era, the Samurai used authentic Samurai weapons, and the Ninjas used Ninja weapons. Too bad they didn't pay as much attention to the historical context though. They made it look like the Samurai were some backwards peasants attempting to maintain a agrarian way of life -- equivalent to some native American tribes. But the DVD itself shows up its own flaws: one of the features in the extra features is a documentary showing the historical accuracy of this film and it wasn't too good. The Samurai, far from being peasant villagers, were detested and feared by the general population, and their rebellion wasn't about maintaining their old ways of life but about maintaining their political clout within the empire which was waning.Watch the movie for its special effects, but it's not much of a story.

190,miken-3,Epic!,10,24 January 2005,"In the tradition of the Shogun miniseries, this movie paints a wonderful picture of life under the Japanese Samurai. This time it is darning a time of modernization in Japan. Railroads and factories are being built. A Japanese army is being started, armed by some US entrepreneurs. They hire Tom Cruise, an often drunk army captain, to go to Japan and train the army in the use of the new rifles and to learn American war tactics.He starts training troops that can't hit a stationary target at all. He is told that there is an uprising against the Japanese emperor by a band of Samurai. Cruise is to take the vastly inexperience troops to kill them. Cruise complains that they are not ready but he is told to leave immediately.The attacking Samurai easily wipes out cruise's regiment and Cruise himself puts up an enormous fight. He is badly wounded but keeps fighting until he is unconscious. Just before passing out, he kills one of the most fearsome Samurai warriors.The head Samurai, fascinated to learn more about Cruise, spares him and sends Cruise to mend at his sister's house. His sister just happens to be the wife of the fallen warrior.Everyone in the village hates Cruise, and the woman is repulsed by the foreigner, who has shamed her by killing her husband. Little by little, Cruise becomes fascinated with life in the village and the Samurai training. He feels at peace and is cured of his alcoholic addiction. As he becomes more skilled with the sword he starts to win the admiration of the Samurai and he bonds with the woman's son.Cruise finally, earns his place in the village by being instrumental in driving back a ninja attack on the village. Eventually, Cruise will have to face the emperor's army now armed with cannon and fully training in using rifles.Great directing, action, and a riveting story. One of the best films Cruise has made. Just as good, if not better than the Shogun miniseries.",The Last Samurai

192,Gambitt,Stir Fry,6,7 December 2004,"**Spoilers ahead but not really if you think about it**Start with one pinch of Gladiator, two parts Dances with Wolves, four parts of Braveheart, and a generous serving of Glory. Release the Tom Cruise in all his rabid, teeth-gritting, brow-furrowing intensity. Mix.The result of all this inbreeding is the most predictable movie of the year.Here is what you might guess The Last Samurai is about, given the trailers and assuming you've seen more than three Hollywood movies in the past 20 years:White man is thrown into far-off, exotic culture. White man clashes with the savage locals. White man is eventually moved by aforementioned, exotic culture. White men wins over the respect of the exotic locals by beating them at their own games and revealing his own areas of superiority. White man joins exotic locals in their struggle, they all fight valiantly against impossible odds, but lose anyway because they are a fading breed of far-off exotics. The only expectation LS failed to deliver was a gratuitous sex scene starring white man and a female member of the exotic natives (though yes, he does get her). So yes, this has all been done before. But for the most part, the cliché plot elements are tastefully handled. There were one or two absolutely cheesy scenes that had me retching in my seat, but all-in-all the movie rarely gets too emotionally ridiculous.Towards the end, I realized Cruise's character could have been removed entirely from the movie and it would have been just as good, maybe better. I give The Last Samurai a 6 / 10: worth watching but nothing special.Oh and don't forget to add ninjas, because Americans LOVE ninjas. Remember those turtles?",The Last Samurai
193,AzSumTuk,Well...,8,29 January 2008,"The movie is good. Or it isn't. It all depends on you and how do you accept the American ""samurai"" movies. That is what 'The Last Samurai' is - an American movie. This movie has some great action, pretty good acting, beautiful cinematography but lacks in showing the real Japanese culture. Don't get me wrong, there is the samurai honor and everything else you want to see but it all was made more elementary and easier for the westerners to accept it. And there was the American Super Hero - Tom Cruise... This is a big problem.SPOILER WARNING!!! Algren learnt Japanese in less than two years. This is impossible no matter how good linguist you are. At the same time he became the greatest swordsman in Japan and he learnt everything about being samurai just in a few months. It was him who saved the samurai leader from the ninja. All of the movie's message was destroyed by showing the American as the greatest and the strongest person.The other big problem of the movie is the story. I do not know about historical accuracy but the biggest part of the story was almost directly taken from the great novel ""Shogun"". It is not the first time nor the last time when I see the same story in another book or movie or even comics. I have seen it even in a comics about Conan. But in all of these movies the depth of the original story is just not there. I almost hate it when I see something like this...END OF SPOILERS!!! There are some big problems in the movie but there are some very good things too. As I said before there is some good acting and beautiful cinematography. But the greatest reason to see the movie is the action. There are some of the greatest fights I have ever seen. And they are done by the Japanese way - one strike - one dead enemy. It is just great and you have to see it.I guess you will be disappointed by the movie if you expect some deep story about the confrontation of two cultures - there is not depth. But if you expect great action you will enjoy it.",The Last Samurai
194,name99-92-545389,Avatar the prequel,5,4 March 2012,"This is not an awful movie; however it is an action movie and as such, the demands of the visuals take precedence over all else. If you like action movies, great; but if you were hoping for more, you'll be disappointed.The primary fault is that the movie poses its essential question --- how does a ""primitive"" society cope with modernity --- but has nothing useful to say about solving the problem. The solutions proposed: ghost dance, more perfect adherence to the ways of the ancestors, hierarchy-worship, a servile acceptance that some are born to fight and others are born peasants, and the fetishization of a ""glorious"" death, are all immature and unhelpful.The movie is self-conscious enough (of course being set in the past, and knowing how it all turned out helps) to know that its ""answers"" are not actually useful, but is also completely uninterested in this --- what matters is that we have an excuse for explosions and sword fights. The first hour led me to hope for more, but really, there is nothing more. I recommend abandoning watching after about an hour fifteen, when the movie still seems marginally original.",The Last Samurai
195,lopcar1993,An amazingly beautifully crafted and executed Epic film,10,11 October 2009,"When I first saw this movie I didn't like the concept, I didn't like the idea of an American solider turning on his kind to fight with the enemy. Boy was I in mature! Now seeing it again now more mature and more knowledgeable of history this film has allot of meaning to me. It's epic, sprawling, beautiful, intelligent, brutal, honorable and most of all heart breaking.The Last Samurai chronicles the story of a beaten and battered Civli War hero who's seen one too many innocent lives and people killed during his service in the war. Now in 1870's he accepts an offer to train Japans modern army to battle the samurai's, but soon in some strange twist of fate he finds himself learning form his enemy. It's an intense and heart breaking piece of film making that is of the highest caliber, it's a great and powerful film that tells a story of honor and respect and the way of the samurai. It's grand and spectacular and it gives so much of it's self and of it's story the power that it releases is in small capsules that slowly but surely open one at a time releasing strong and bracing scenes from each of them.Tom Cruise deliverer's one of his finest performances of his career as the battered Civil War hero. Tony Goldwyn is fantastic in the scenes he's in he gives a very good an very convincing antagonistic performance. Billy Connolly(in his small role) does good as always and puts on a very commanding show as the good sergeant. But it is Ken Watanabe who steals the show, his performance is absolutely fantastic and stunning as the leader of the Samurai, he pulls no stops to prove himself and take his game to the next level, he is utterly fantastic. All in all the cast does extraordinarily well in this handsomely mounted film.The Last Samurai is a blend of old traditions and honor mixed with American military strategies. This film put's up a very good fight and pulls no punches when it comes to story, characters, scenery it put's it's self in the middle of the fight as the Samurai did. It's a beautiful and grand film that needs to be cherished as much as it needs to be respected It's powerful in it's execution, beautiful in it's scenery and production and a staggering piece of film making at it's finest Edward Zwick tops all his previous films and creates a great and magnificent portrayal of what true honor is.

196,MsMovie,An epic movie in the mould of Gladiator!,8,26 January 2004,"OK, I was predisposed to dislike this movie, having seen some of Tom Cruise's questionable prior choices, like the bizarre Vanilla Sky, or the appallingly awful Mission Impossible II, yet here I was more than pleasantly surprised.This is Tom's BEST movie for years!But let's ignore the fact that Tom Cruise is in this movie at all and concentrate on just how fantastic this film actually is. It follows the tradition of movies like Gladiator; great music, a great script, fantastic casting, brilliant direction and a wonderful location.Ken Watanabe is magnificent in his role as the leader of the last of the samurai warriors. The action is brutal, but not graphic or gratuitous. The samurai are portrayed in a way that shows them for the noble breed they were, and when the final fight scene ends (and I will give nothing away about what happens), there were a lot of people reaching for their tissues because the director got his point across so well - the samurai were fighting their own people and it was a total waste and should not have been allowed to happen.If this movie isn't nominated for Oscars this week, well, there is something wrong with the Academy, and I think my tip for best supporting actor is Ken Watanabe, he really was fantastic in this film.Go and see this movie if you liked Gladiator, or Cold Mountain, or even Gone With The Wind - it's that kind of an epic, timeless!",The Last Samurai
197,FlorianLaur,Gets a lot of it right,8,20 November 2019,"The Last Samurai (plural). What to say about this film? In terms of historical accuracy, it gets some of it right, but changes some of it or omits it completely. In the script of the movie, the army is eventually reformed and equipped by Germans/Prussians. It seems American movie makers can't stand not to be in the spot light, so they changed that.
The nobility is also cranked up to 11. In some way, it works (especially with Zimmer's soundtrack), but of course it's the old trick of pulling your heartstring.I do forgive most of that though, because at least the movie uses mostly Japanese actors, involves the language and some of the culture. What's kind of misappropriate in my opinion is the quasi-depiction of the Samurai as a mirror image of Indians/Native Americans. They may have shared a sense of courage and may even share some ancestry (Aino), but that seemed like an unnecessary move.In the end, I feel the movie still works though, even if it changes some facts for the American(?) audience and even though we get a hero with plot armour. In my opinion, Cruise should have died at the end, but I get it, they needed someone to bring the Emperor the message. Still, it may have been more powerful if that would have been Katsumoto's remaining family. But similar movies sometimes do a lot worse that way (47 Ronins anyone?), so I can ultimately live with it.I recommend anyone though to read about the history of the events and to learn more about Japan in general.",The Last Samurai

200,filmbuff-36,Cruise and Watanabe conquer with great performances,9,14 December 2003,"It is said that the only thing constant is change. Old ideals die off, and new technologies replace the inefficiencies of yesteryear. The young usually have little trouble adjusting to change, but traditionalists are often dragged into the new era either kicking and screaming or silently resolved to remove themselves completely.""The Last Samurai"" manages to capture a little of both, with Japanese men living in a world in transition from ancient bushido rituals of honor into a more modern empire of industry and trade. A sweeping historical epic that hints at the brilliance of Akira Kurosawa's finest work while also invoking the melancholy of a Shakespearean tragedy, the movie is a reminder of the cost of high ideals and danger of industrial conformity.It's 1876, and Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is an alcoholic wreck of a man. A veteran of the Civil War as well as General Custer's Indian campaigns, he drifts from one situation to another ostensibly looking for work but really seeking refuge from his inner demons of slaughtering innocent women and children.Opportunity knocks in the form of an old Army acquaintance Colonel Ben Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), who has accepted work with a Japanese businessman named Omura (Masato Harada). Omura has been charged with recruiting American war vets as military advisors to the new Japanese Army. Emperor Meiji, under advise from Omura and other parties, is interested in modernizing his nation's military with rifles and other armaments.In order to unify the nation, the powers that be must first take care of civil dissidence within Japan. The samurai, led by charismatic chieftain Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), are violently opposing the invasion of Western culture into their islands. Bagley foolishly sends his ill-trained soldiers into combat against the samurai, and during the resulting massacre Algren is captured and taken to the samurai's village.During the course of the winter, Algren slowly gains the trust of his captors and in turn is given free roam over the village. He fights with Uijo (Hiroyuki Sanada), who dislikes the American from the beginning, and is given food and shelter by Taka (Koyuki), the wife of one of samurai he killed during battle.Katsumoto meanwhile seeks to learn about his enemy, and begins to respect Algren as a fellow warrior. Also interested in the American is Katsumoto's son Nobutada (Shin Koyamada), intrigued by Western culture. Algren finds the first peace he has known in a long time, and begins to adapt to the ways of the samurai. He acts as a surrogate father to Taka's children, learns to sword fight with a kitana blade and begins to respect the culture that he originally sought to destroy.But during Algren's absence the Japanese Army has had better opportunity to prepare themselves, and time is soon approaching that will determine the fate of the samurai and the future of Japan.""The Last Samurai"" is beautifully filmed by John Toll, the same cinematographer who worked on ""Braveheart."" The comparisons are obvious with moments of silent reflection and loud explosions of fury, both powerfully captured on film.Director Edward Zwick brings the same determination to the screen that he did more than a decade ago with ""Glory."" The attention to period detail is near flawless and the movie never releases its grip on the audience.As Algren, Cruise grows from suicidal depression to driven idealist quite realistically, drawing on the standard dishonored warrior archetype while giving him touches of humanity. Cruise's only shortcoming is his lack of dramatic range, and as such it never seems like Algren has any sinister intent even when acting selfishly. Never for a moment is there a doubt that he's destined to be a hero.Cruise is also overshadowed in every scene by Watanabe, who makes Katsumoto a honorable man who is shocked by all the dishonor threatening to overthrow his country. Philosopher, poet, family man and warrior - Katsumoto wears many hats, and is realized through Watanabe perfectly.Other smaller roles are captured by strong performances as well, including Goldwyn who brings class to the standard villain role as Bagley, Koyuki who plays Taka with quiet sadness and torn loyalties between her fallen husband and his killer who she is growing to love, and Koyamada who makes Nobutada young and headstrong but still sympathetic and honorable.""The Last Samurai"" only suffers during a protracted finale that screams of studio interference. The ending smacks of being safe, clean and Hollywood, something that almost betrays to whole film.The movie is still strong enough to become a modern day classic. Like ""The Wild Bunch,"" it speaks to those curious of what became of warriors who outlived their time. Timeless issues of honor, loyalty and redemption as well as the clashing of ancient culture versus new technology remain omnipresent. To remain in the past in foolish, but to forget it entirely is disgraceful.Nine out of ten stars. Destined to be remembered for some time, this movie honorably deals with its subject matter.",The Last Samurai
201,FilmLabRat,Brilliant!,10,4 December 2003,"I was skeptical about this movie because not every high-budget feature with Tom Cruise is guaranteed depth or serious acclaim, although it may gather at the box office.  And Warner Bros put me through TORTURE to see this pic - changes of times AND locations, over and over.  I felt like was on an survival test, an unbearably annoying treasure hunt over weeks and was frankly ready to give it a negative review (which I'm writing on behalf of a publication).  However, I found the movie truly and unequivocally remarkable and cannot contain my review in 350 words.First, the experience was powerful.  Edward Zwick was a masterful director. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  The action, sets, scenery and story - even the dialogue - were riveting.  Clearly, a ton of historical and cultural research and care went into the script, sets, costumes, casting. They didn't just Hollywoodize Kurosowa's ""Seven Samurai"" as a Tom Cruise vehicle.  Nor was it Dances with Wolves or Seven Years in Tibet, two PC-preaching pics of yesteryear.  It was a lot more like Braveheart meets Seven Samurai with elements of inculturation a bit reminiscent of Wolves and Seven Years.Rarely does a movie have excellent acting across the board, but all the Japanese actors were outstanding, and the Americans and Europeans were excellent ... Tom Cruise was at the top of his game.  His Independence Day angst combined with his moral nobility in A Few Good Men and The Firm. Ken Watanabe as co-star exemplifying bravery, wisdom and nobility was outstanding.In spite of this historical epic being ""in vogue"" at present, there were surprisingly few cliché story elements.  Even the requisite (American-made movie) romance with Take (Koyuki in this role was wonderful) furthered the cross-cultural elements of the plot in such a way that neither culture was violated - and above all the `chemistry' was discreet in Japanese fashion, taking a necessary backseat without overshadowing the main story line, actually adding richness to the process of ""going native"" for Captain Algren (Cruise).  The subplot went far beyond an added market draw.  Very tasteful and artful scriptwriting, with many colorful, developing characters.
The thrust of the film was the Western-Japanese cultural divide, differing concepts of value and valor and the political issues surrounding Japan's efforts to ""Westernize.""  [cross-cultural studies have become a cinematic trend: Lost in Translation, Beyond Borders, The Missing, Japanese Story, etc.]  Where most of the other films fell short (and The Statement was an abomination], this film succeeded brilliantly.  The differences between the two cultures were considered and portrayed without completely bashing one (except in the political arena, but even there, the Japanese seemed to be inviting their own downfall, in many ways).  There was no simple scapegoat or cultural domination message.  The American Civil War captain, Nathan Algren (Cruise) goes abroad as not only a war hero but also a cross-cultural and linguistic expert.  Being in Japan, (at first as a mercenary hired to train Japanese in Western ways of war), he takes on the study of the people and their language.  Although Algren's sometimes superhero abilities are a bit of a stretch at times, taking the native language seriously is unique in American filmmaking (and American culture, hence our lowly reputation when traveling).  Usually the American walks into the foreign scene and the pic automatically shifts to all-English.  I was truly grateful to find the dialog half in subtitles because half the characters were Japanese - and Algren was speaking with them.  Secondly, this movie honors both cultures for their recognized strengths, even in their distinctiveness.  For example, when the woman who is hosting Algren (in captivity) makes dinner, he helps her.  ""Japanese men don't do these things,"" she tells him.  ""But I'm not Japanese,"" he says (in Japanese).  Algren is not ashamed to uphold his homeland customs (although this was 1876... pre-sensitive 90s man era, long before women's lib let alone men entering kitchens) when his own cultural customs or inclinations are ways of caring rather than domination. Another and more important example:  Algren demonstrates American resilience and perseverance when he rises again repeatedly after defeat.  This baffles the Japanese who are accustomed to falling on their swords in shame after defeat, for them a noble death.  In these and many other ways, the Japanese Samurai (especially Katsumoto, Watanabe's character) and Algren learn to appreciate each other's ways.  In many respects, the film moves past the usual PC party line [of Dances with Wolves, Seven Years in Tibet and most others of similar ilk out of Hollywood] and reflects on the beauty and dignity in the midst of difference between the two worlds, and how much they need to learn from one another without money or domination as a motive. The dignity of the young Emperor Meiji finding his own cultural center, at the end, was especially moving.  Overall, the film had depth and substance with brilliant work in almost every area of production and performance.  The editing was marvelous - although it's long, there's no unnecessary material remaining.  Not a moment of boredom.  Props all around!",The Last Samurai

203,vvanpo,Tragic Warrior,7,26 January 2004,"Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a drunken shell of a man racked with guilt over his participation in the genocide of Native Americans as a U.S. soldier.  He is convinced by representatives of the Japanese government to train their ragtag troops to fight against the samurai.In their first battle against the samurai, the army is routed and Algren is captured.  He switches allegiance to the samurai after staying with them, learning their ways.  I suspect he is trying to find honor as a warrior by reversing his role into the Indian's.This is where I find it hard to embrace the picture.  I don't think the samurai are noble.  Indeed they are foolish in the face of modern weaponry. And Algren is a tragic figure.  He can't return to America where his demons lie but he also stands apart in Japan as a foreigner.",The Last Samurai

In the Asian Pursuit, is to reunite with their son - the Caucasian man.The last Samurai allows for the visual adaptation and presentation of the pursuit in which all life and cultures are in complete unanimous agreement - the reuniting of The true father (the Asian Man ) with his Son (the Caucasian man).Such a strong and empowering movie.",The Last Samurai

206,Tyson14,Grand & Entertaining a mixture of history and fiction,10,31 May 2015,"The honour and code of the samurai has always been enticing to a Western civilisation that is far removed from such customs, which perhaps makes The Last Samurai such an enticing, enigmatic film. Edward Zwick crafts quite an epic adventure rich in mythology & thematic resonance that while traditionally Hollywood in its construction still manages to exist a cut above many such movies of its ilk, a touch of class surrounding how the story of Captain Nathan Algren is put together, based as it is on several real life legendary American figures who played key roles in the Satsuma Rebellion in Japan during the late 19th century. This isn't a direct re-telling of those events but serves as a leaping off point to construct a tale about a stranger in a strange land, of a man haunted by fighting an unjust war who rediscovers his honour & place in the world through a dying culture. Zwick's film is slick, sweeping, beautifully shot and frequently involving, backed up by a strong performance by Tom Cruise in one of those roles that remind you just what a good actor he can be.In the role of Algren, Cruise begins a dejected man living out of a bottle, bereft of purpose & suffering post-Civil War nightmares of a man touted as a hero despite feeling the guilt of slaughtering Indians crushed under the might of a military machine; in that sense, The Last Samurai is very anti-war in its message, John Logan's story painting the Americans and specifically the Imperialist Japanese not in the greatest light. Cruise takes Algren on a traditional voyage of discovery, first pitted against the samurai code & eventually becoming consumed by it, consumed by the similarity of the way of the warrior between both cultures - and Ken Watanabe's dignified samurai 'rebel' Katsumoto learns from him, as well as the other way around, with Cruise remaining stoic & only getting flashes of a chance to display the usual Cruise charm, but that's OK - Algren isn't the kind of character to benefit from that, Cruise's natural magnetism is enough here. Wit is provided thankfully through, albeit briefly, Billy Connolly as a tough old Irish veteran & chiefly Timothy Spall as our portly 'narrator' of sorts, who serves to help mythologise Algren & the legend itself. Zwick is most concerned with that, you see, the idea of legends and how men become them, exploring that concept alongside digging into the cultural rituals and practises of a changing Japan.Logan's story is placed at a time when the old ways of Japan were shifting, under the pressures of global politics & business; the Emperor here is a naive young man, sitting on an empty throne, looking to Watanabe for validation as his advisor's push to quash a rebellion fighting to preserve the old ways, preserve Japanese interests as America knocks on the door. That's why Cruise's role here is so interesting, his character learning of the samurai code & helping those around him remember their history, and Zwick explores well the concept of national identity alongside personal ideas of myth, legend & destiny. It all boils together in a careful script, never overblown, which neatly develops the relationships involved & helps you fully believe Algren's transformation into the eponymous 'last samurai'. Along the way, Zwick doesn't forget theatrics - staging plenty of well staged & intense fight scenes which utilise the strong Japanese production design, before building to a quite epic war climax with army pitted against army, with personal stakes cutting through it, backed up indeed by another superlative score by Hans Zimmer. It becomes more than just a historical swords & armour film, reaching deeper on several levels.What could have been a slow paced, potentially ponderous movie is avoided well by Edward Zwick, who with The Last Samurai delivers one of the stronger historical adventure epics of recent years. Beautifully shot in many places, with some excellent cinematography & production standards, not to mention an impressive script well acted in particular by Tom Cruise & Ken Watanabe, Zwick creates a recognisably Hollywood picture but for once a movie that doesn't dumb down, doesn't pander and ultimately serves as an often involving, often damn well made story. Especially one to check out if you love the way of the samurai.",The Last Samurai
207,treeskier802,An Incredibly Beautiful And Entertaining Film,10,19 May 2007,"The academy awards really missed the mark with The Last Samurai. This film should have been nominated for best picture, and Tom Cruise should have been nominated for best actor -- and, in my opinion, both should have won.The Last Samurai is everything one wants in a movie. The story was deliberately paced and touching. The acting is superb. The cinematography is high art. The main characters learn and grow throughout the film due to their experiences with one another. The film touches you on a personal level with the character development and it also gives you a nice history lesson about Japanese culture and politics.Tom Cruise's character begins the film a drunken mess, disillusioned with his experiences in battle with Native Americans. He is hired by Japan to train their soldiers modern warfare. However, he is captured by the enemy, the Samurai.At first, not trusting his captors, Cruise is reluctant to open up to the Samurai. Slowly, the Samurai begin to trust him, while he begins to open up to them.Throughout the movie, the audience enjoys the beautiful scenery of the Japan countryside and old Tokyo. We learn about the struggle the Japanese people had in becoming a modern nation while at the same time trying to hold onto its rich and precious traditions.This film is not to be missed.

208,Batkid1,One of the best Adventure movies and an excellent performance from Cruise.,9,29 August 2007,"Sure, Tom Cruise hasn't always been the most respected person in his actual life, but you have to give him some kudos for his performance here as a Civil War vet caught between two opposing sides at war with each other in 1870 Japan. The movie has basically everything: excellent cinematography, skilled direction by Edward Zwick ( GLORY, COURAGE UNDER FIRE ), skilled supporting actors ( Billy Connelly, Ken Watanobe,etc.) and brutal battle sequences. These all flow very well together and, by the end of the film, you'll be crying a river for it's dark history and characters, that the viewer have grown attached, to that will bleed for others and a cause they all believe in.The violence never feels gratuitous and will fit perfectly in your DVD collection of classics.

Otherwise, it is a great story about the culture that keeps a society together.  I'll be frank...The Tom Cruise character could have had a better impact if it was performed by a more adept actor (Russell Crowe really came to mind).  The real star of the film is the Samurai played by Ken Watanabe. His character exemplifies what makes his culture so precious to the Japanese people.  And through the movie, it shows us how the culture of a people make them who they are and can never really be taken from them if they are strong with it.As for the film itself, old TC, though a decent actor himself, never convinced me that he was the character...the film needed a much stronger character for that role.  On the other hand, Ken Watanabe does a beautiful job as the Samurai.  His performance in itself makes this film worth watching.  The supporting characters are also all well chosen.

212,revere-7,"""Success is a journey, not a destination"" - Zen saying",8,30 August 2004,"The Last Samurai is a strictly by-the-numbers samurai epic set in 1876-1877 Japan. All the necessary ingredients are here - beautiful Japanese landscapes and costumes, larger than life battlefield sequences, and eastern philosophy.Although the pageantry is not as beautiful as such samurai epics as ""Heaven and Earth"", it is more than adequate.Do not, however go into this film expecting ""Kill Bill"", grindhouse type swordplay nor the poignancy of a Kurosawa piece. Instead, ""The Last Samurai"" occupies the middle ground; a human story of one Westerner learning to embrace another culture kind of a mixture of ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Shogun"", films from which it derives almost directly. And this is the films greatest flaw. It is utterly predictable. No spoilers here, we all know what happens to the samurai. If not, the title ought to give you a clue. Every scene is one that you were expecting to see. And the ending is the ending you expect.But Zwick and co. still manage to weave an engaging story with panache, and a climactic (despite it's predictability) ending, and that is why ""The Last Samurai"" is such a great film.

214,echozdog,Too bad some Hollywood executive couldn't fall on his pen.,8,22 March 2004,"I liked this movie for the exact same reasons I liked ""Dances with Wolves"". It shows a culture destroyed by modern man. I could only give this movie a 8. Two reasons. 1) It was not original enough (The basic premise take from DWW. 2) The ending. I won't say why I didn't like it as I can't think of a way how to say it with out giving away the ending (I hate spoilers).I'm really turning into a Tom Cruise fan. I could not stand the movies he made from Taps to Top Gun. He seems to care about what he puts himself in now. Movies like Vanilla Sky and Born on the 4th of July I have really enjoyed. This movie is by far his best work. It's the only time I looked up at the screen and was seeing his character and not Tom Cruise. Ken Watanabe and Timothy Spall (Rock Star) do an excellent jobs also.The visuals in this movie are awesome. It has never crossed my mind to see Japan until this movie. The life of the Samurai is told and experienced.
When I come out of a movie feeling very different I usually give it a 9 or 10 (even if I'm feeling really crappy). I consider good art to evoke feelings. This movie got me in the ""Japanese"" mindset. I like being transported to that place in my mind.The only flaws seemed to come before filming and after. The story is a different spin on DWW and the editing seems to be influenced by some Hollywood executive looking for the $. 8/10 Worth the price of admission.",The Last Samurai
215,ks4,A fantastic movie that combines all the best elements of movie making!,9,27 March 2004,"People say this is a Dances Will Wolves copy, what is that about, the movie is obviously inspired by it, but from there the movie is different, even though it draws references to en earlier masterpiece, how is it that wrong, i do not see, there are many movies that has been inspired by story lines from earlier movies and still been good, well never the less, this one is just as good as its inspiration, if not better.Tom Cruise in the movie play a morally troubled man who is troubled by earlier times, he has become a drunk living with his past on his heart, he is then sent to Japan to train the Emperor's army to fight against the last Samurais, the pressure from above forces them into a battle they are not ready for, the weak army leaves Cruise stranded and he is captured because the leader of the Samurai, Katsamuto (Watanobe) wants to learn about his enemy. From there the movie pretty much talks for itself, the movie has a lot of difference great moments, moments of humour, moments of romance (without sex involved, i'm amazed, a hollywood movie without sex scenes), and moments of drama.I was very stunned by this movie, in my opinion it posseses everything a good movie should have, it have drama, romance, moral and action. It's a classic well constructed epic a like movie, and i love epic, honestly, pretty much written after the classic style, but it's so damn nicely directed, clever directing supported by beautiful and engaging Cinematography and a, at times, dramatic, at other times, silent yet beautiful soundtrack.As for the acting, it's well done too, Cruise and Watanobe is doing an amazing job, and another thing i like is that they are true to the language of the natives, they are realistic, talking japanese, combined by english, that also makes for some funny scenes that can make you smile a bit on top of the tragetic layout the movie has, Cruise is actually talking japanese well, i was so surprised, i liked him before as an actor, but now he has showed me and the whole world that he is also a good characteristic actor, maybe his actor is not to many years away.Also i found that the movie had a lot of nice, and for once, obvious symbolic values, the movie was faithfull to the way it portrayed the samurais, as people who puts honor and discipline at a high status, especially honor was well displayed when the Samurai with the long hair (Don't remember his name), who gave Cruise a hard time in the start, got shot, when the other Samurai's wants to help him on his feets, he pushes them away and stands up for himself, i don't know what it was about this scene that was so engaging, but i just simply thought it was great, one of the characters who you maybe disliked a little because he was such a cruel guy, you suddenly have sympathy for.I was constantly thinking that this movie had to be like Master And Commander (Which i gave 7 and found a tad confusing and meaningless), but but after watching this i was stunned and had no idea how i would describe it, i barely ever give 10 to a movie, but i think this one deserves it, even though it has taken a bit of critism from reviewers and other movie goers, i can't deny what i think is the proper solution hehe, stunning movie.10/10",The Last Samurai
216,rachelgallit,"Flawed, but good",7,5 June 2020,"This movie centers around a white man, who saves the lives of another nation. This is problematic on its own. It is not the entirety of the movie, and can, therefore, be simply a demerit, rather than a deal-breaker. American officer Nathan Algren is taken captive by a Samurai village in Japan, and slowly becomes tuned to their way of life. He learns to move on from his past and find stability and peace within himself. This film shows the end of an era, as the ways of the Samurai fall beneath the onslaught of western technology and the Japanese government. Tom Cruise plays the war-worn American well, as Tom Cruise seems to belong in that era, both by his looks and his acting style. A scene that particularly stands out in my memory of the film is the initial encounter between Algren and the Samurai. Algren accompanies Japanese troops through the 'enemy' territory, and they are ambushed and battle with the Samurai's men. The captured general is allowed the chance to take his own life before Katsumoto claims his head in official victory. The middle of the film could have easily sagged, as the action slows down and the plot has to get from plot point to plot point, but it does not. The slower, less sensational portion of the film maintains engagement, as the character growth and skills being learned to carry the film forward. Just as the Japanese custom of Sepukku involves killing oneself to maintain honor in death, this film tanks its ending. The tone of solemnity and genuine emotion that accompanies the end of an era and such a great tragedy, becomes almost saccharine and cliche.",The Last Samurai
217,johnmschofield,Superb entertainment,9,2 August 2009,"I first saw this film on DVD last year and at the time I thought it was good but nothing more. I watched it again about six months later and it was as if it was a different film. I had missed so much on the first viewing and now saw it in a different light. I have never been interested in the technicalities, politics, minor historical inaccuracies or who is playing what part. I am interested in the whole and when I saw this film for the second time I was captivated by the way the story unfolds. The running time is just over 2 and a half hours and in my opinion this film could have been longer to perhaps expand on certain important parts in the film but as it stands it is sufficiently good enough to have told a good story effectively. This film is superb entertainment and if you are going to watch it please avoid being distracted because like most other good films it needs your undivided attention. You should enjoy a very good film.",The Last Samurai
218,Raptorclaw155,Still an Enjoyable Film and even Impressive in Some Parts,7,5 April 2020,"There are many films with similar similar stories to this one, both older and newer. Despite that, however, this film remains to be my favorite of them. My first exposure to this film was in high school when, during our global history class, we watched this as a way to introduce the Japan unit. Of course, there are a myriad of historical inaccuracies which numerous people have already pointed out but there are some aspects and themes brought up by the film which do touch on some very important historical and cultural themes which can't go ignored.The biggest issue I have with this film is how Omura is kind of an evil guy who distorts the wishes of the Emperor and acts on them. In making a historical film I believe that introducing greater nuance in the motivations of the villain might help us understand the scope of the division between the two factions. Katsumoto is afraid that Japan is changing too quickly, but why? There's no explanation about why the Japanese government wants to push for modernization so quickly. The only real explanation- which is all implied- is that the Japanese government and Japanese society as a whole believes the Samurai to be relics of an less-civilized past and should, therefore, be eradicated at any cost. Samurai are treated more like an ethnicity in this film than a class of people and as a result, Japan's move towards modernization appears more to be something to push back from because it is inherently evil with evil intentions. Again, not to criticize this film for historical inaccuracy, but, this missing bit of information could help broaden the film thematically and give a greater impact to the Meiji Emperor's refusal to sign the trade agreement with the American ambassador at the end.As far as the rest of the film goes, on an emotional level, it is quite effective. You feel attached to nearly all the characters Algren meets while in captivity and watching them be slain at the end of the film is surprisingly more impactful than one might expect. For me, this was especially so with ""Bob.""I really enjoy this movie and I can't help but feel that its extensive use of the Japanese language as well as English, for a big budget Hollywood blockbuster in 2003 makes it feel quite progressive in many ways, as we all know multilingual (or non-English) films still have a hard time enticing American audiences in 2020. It's not necessarily the most educational film ever produced, and there is a little bit too much of the glorification of the Samurai and Bushido which would cause trouble (historically speaking- especially during the Second World War) for my liking, but I do still think it offers a close-enough broad overview of what things were kind of like back then. If the history doesn't entice you, then it is still quite a well-made film which is enjoyable to watch simply for the entertainment value or the immersion in this alternate universe of sorts.",The Last Samurai

Macho themes of honor, combat, heroism, revenge, etc., through the whole thing.  And not a single original frame in over two hours of movie film.  It was a combination of ""Dances with Wolves, ""Crouching Tiger,"" ""The Seven Samurai,"" and (a bit of) ""The Natural.""  It also included some material from an obscure little movie called ""The Challenge,"" about a has-been boxer who gets sucked into a battle between a wealthy Japanese man and his brother who runs a traditionalist monastery/karate school over a samurai sword.  Beyond all the stolen concepts, it reiterates the tired theme of a backward, feudal society becoming the equivalent of a giant chessboard for white Western men to use in settling some personal disputes as they ""gift"" the locals with their (obviously superior) knowledge of things like how to kill each other.  I was awestruck by the artistry of it, and dumbstruck by the banality of it (since it was an Oscar nominee).

221,jt1999,Pretty damn good.,8,24 November 2003,"In the hands of a great filmmaker, ""The Last Samurai"" could have been a great film.  As it is, it's a good film -- at times even a very good film -- and that's certainly no small achievement.Director Ed Zwick, of course, is no David Lean -- though ""Glory"" and ""Courage Under Fire"" are excellent films (""Legends of the Fall"" is decent, while I consider ""Leaving Normal"" one of the most mundane films ever made).   Here Zwick has attempted a traditional epic, and as with ""Courage Under Fire"", depicts the horrors of war through a story of personal redemption.  Into this basic story he also injects themes of honor, pride, cultural clashes and technological change versus ancient tradition.Unfortunately, though, no matter how lofty the ambitions, the bottom line here is that in order to transcend the fairly standard hero-goes-on-a-journey-and- undergoes-change plot that we've all seen many times before, something pretty new and special has to be added.  It's a little late to rehash the old ""Searchers""/ ""Emerald Forest""/""Dances With Wolves"" tale of the white man being captured by enemies and siding with his captors -- unless it's aimed primarily at people who have never seen ""The Searchers"" or ""The Emerald Forest"" (Arthur Penn realized this thirty years ago, and made the hero and the journey of ""Little Big Man"" primarily comedic -- one of the main reasons the film works as well as it does).But in the post-Altman/Ashby/Penn era -- where nearly all films -- especially action/adventure films -- have returned to the grandiose seriousness of their 1950s counterparts (with little or none of the wit and satire that crept through in the 60s and 70s), it is therefore pretty much expected that we will get the typical grandiose, serious, high-gloss and overlong treatment all the way through, with very little humor.  And that's too bad.  Because a lighter touch could have gone a long way towards getting the audience more involved, and making Cruise's character more likable (indeed, the few humorous lines and scenes he has are among the film's most memorable moments; they humanize his character and endear us to him).And this is one reason ""The Last Samurai,"" despite a bunch of probable Oscars, is going to miss its target of becoming a beloved classic, an action/adventure epic for the ages.  Just as Sam Mendes did with ""Road to Perdition,"" Zwick has tried a little too hard to impress.  By pouring on the big, movie-type moments, he merely reminds us that he's emulating the greatness of classic directors, without ever equaling them.  Zwick -- as I'm sure he will readily admit -- is merely a student of great filmmakers such as Lean or Kurosawa; he will likely never be one himself.  The sensibility just isn't there, the life experience is missing.Cruise, similarly -- despite his talent -- will never be any kind of substitute for a Flynn or a Gable or a Bogart; Cruise is, after all, the kid from ""Risky Business"" who danced around in his underwear.  The grinning jock with the big nose from ""Top Gun.""  The goofball pool hustler from ""The Color of Money.""  The difference between someone like Cruise (or De Niro, or any of today's top stars) and a complex personality such as Stewart or Fonda or Bogart or Gable is simply immeasurable.  The heart and soul of those great actors is somehow missing from most of today's performers.  So by making a film like ""The Last Samurai"" in an old-fashioned, traditional way, it constantly invites comparison -- to great stars, to great directors, to the great age of studio filmmaking which, like the Samurai, is now gone -- never to return.The sad fact is that the great movie-makers are dying off, leaving us with imitators, not originators.  In the last ten years we've lost Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Wilder, Frankenheimer, Fuller.  In the last six months alone we lost John Schlesinger and Elia Kazan.  Is anyone really expecting to see some sort of masterpiece by a T.V. producer/director named Ed Zwick?!Still, ""The Last Samurai"" manages to succeed in a number of ways -- mainly in presenting nineteenth-century Japan in a remarkably realistic way, and in its brutal battle scenes, shot in gory ""Braveheart""-style by the great cinematographer John Toll.  It is in these terrifying, agonizing moments of sword-versus-rifle battle that Zwick comes closest to emulating his obvious hero, Akira Kurosawa, and manages to comment on the tragedy and insanity of war.Flashbacks are used unnecessarily to try to enforce Cruise's sense of guilt in participating in the the slaughter of the Indians (so we will understand his desire to defend another endangered species, the Samurai).  As the apparent title character, Ken Watanabe pretty much steals the show as Katsumodo, the sage warrior leader whom Cruise befriends.  A Japanese actress known only as Koyuki plays the heartbreakingly beautiful wife of a Samurai Cruise kills, who Cruise grows close to.  But perhaps most amazing of the Japanese cast is the small boy who plays one of her sons.  Unexpectedly expressive, emotional, and charming, he's the type of face you would expect to see in a film by the great Kurosawa.  Or Lean.  Or Ford.All technical aspects, from production and costume design to visual effects, are excellent.  Hans Zimmer's score, incorporating traditional wood flutes and thunderous drums, is at times touching and evocative, at times bombastic and unnecessarily loud.   All in all, ""The Last Samurai"" is an impressive production. And even if it  misses being the cinematic classic it strives towards, all involved can be proud of their accomplishment.And whatever its faults, it's almost a miracle when a Hollywood studio today turns out something even a fraction this good.",The Last Samurai

Tom had a spear at that time with a flag carved with an image of white tiger. When algrin is captured ,kasamoto willfully forced his lieutenants not to kill him. During he is in their custody , he experiences strange time. He is not like a prisoner but a guest. He is made stay and treated at the woman , whom her husband was killed by him, she is the sister of kasamoto. He is surprised when tells kasamoto about a general who took all his cavalry in between swarm of angry Indians and they all were slained. But kasamoto is very impressed. The samurais are very interested to know about the way Mohawk and Navajo Indians lead their lives. Mostly he came to know that the samurais are in opposition of the emperor just because they didn't wanted him to sign on an agreement regarding trade with USA , that would definitely impact the cultural identification of Japanese people. On the other hand inside in their hearts they respected the emperor as their father and mentor, all they want is to make him realize about the welfare and prosperity of Japanese people, to curb an iron hand on corrupt officials and politicians who are willing to malpractice in the cover of the trade agreement. They follo0wed a strict code of honor and preferred death before dishonor. Their spirit and will to fight till the end was so powerful that it even won the hearts and minds of their own rivals. Coz they just wanted to depict and display their own royal army adversaries the spirit of Japanese glory and prestige , they wanted all of them to know the way living the life before death. There is so much to say about this movie but i sum it up that this movie gave very much insight about the japs and i say they are awfully great people at the face of this planet. If u re not moved by watching this film just little only than i am sorry about u but at least i consider it damn good.",The Last Samurai
225,derangedxzombie,"A good movie, if not a bit clishé",7,18 September 2021,"This seems a divisive film, for what it is (a story..not a historical reenactment based to the letter on another culture from another time period) it is good. Not groundbreaking, certainly not awful as some make out, but good. I enjoyed it and I didn't at any point feel bored or want to switch it off. I've seen Zatoichi, 13 assassin's, Blade of the immortal etc (these are great samurai movies) this movie does try to be respectful or informed of Japanese culture for that time period. It may get some things wrong but again; it's a story, not a more realistic reenactment of Japanese culture, or politics like 13 assassin's for instance.Certainly worth a watch. If you want to see a painful, almost propaganda take on the another culture, watch Ip Man 2 - 4's take on the west.",The Last Samurai

this film totally based on early 1800 s culture of japan .
i was totally surprised how they designed so carefully that environment

228,mbanwait,A great movie that showcases some extraordinary battles,9,27 January 2004,"I am commenting on this movie after I have noticed that it received very few Oscar nominations.  That is quite a shame, as the film is quite powerful and dramatic.  I beleive it is one of Tom Cruise's best performances. Unfortunately the academy is not interested in this sweeping, epic drama which has a great score and excellent battle sequences.  I am sure much of the audience found this movie to be intelligent and thought prevoking. It was certainly not your run of the mill action flicks.I think this movie will find an appreciative audience when it is release on dvd.9/10",The Last Samurai
229,m0rg16,I liked it.,7,29 July 2004,"Not really knowing what to expect, I popped this film into my DVD player earlier tonight. I sat down and watched the film quietly during the next two and a half hours, and I was pleasantly surprised. I actually didn't make the ""Dances with Wolves"" connection until I came to these message boards. But so what, if the plot of this film is somewhat similar to that off ""Dances with Wolves"", we can live with that, can't we? This one is differently pulled off and there are many elements in this film that weren't present in Kevin Kostners epic, such as the battle scenes and sword fighting. As well as the many conversations about honor and belief between the characters.The film starts out with a former military hero Nathan Algren being offered a new job in the Empire of Japan. He is to train the Japanese army, so that they can successfully face off, and fight back against, the rebellious Samurai. The Samurai are against the treaty that the Japanese are about to make with the Americans, since it would ruin their great history. But Nathan is just there to train.However, when Nathan is pitched in a battle against the Samurai, and his Japanese army of poorly trained soldiers are defeated, he is taken prisoner by the Samurai chieftain Katsumoto. Now, Nathan ends up spending a lot of time with the Samurai, learning their ways and how they fight.The movie is beautiful. Everything about it. The production design, to the costumes, to the photography. There is not one aspect of this film that the filmmakers missed out on. The plot is entertaining and entangling, even though some people might be disappointed by the lack of action scenes in the middle part of the film. The ending battle should definitely please the action fans, however, as it is one of the best I have ever seen on the screen. Truly great. Unlike some recent war films, however, this film is not afraid to show how horrible battle really is. That is, the blood has not been cut out of the film...Tom Cruise holds up his character well, and you can tell that the script has really succeeded when in the end you just want Tom Cruise to stand up and chop the head off the greedy businessman. Bravo, bravo. Ken Watanabe also deserves to be mentioned, as his portrayal of the Samurai chieftain Katsumoto is really good. He plays the role marvelously, and makes a believable Samurai. All in all, a very enjoyable film. You should see it, regardless what kind of films you like. You'll find a beautiful film with a great script, and some really good action too. Everything about this film is really good.9/10",The Last Samurai
230,glentom1,Better than I thought it would be,8,30 May 2004,"I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, other than A Few Good Men.  He was pretty good in this movie, although my choice for best actor in this movie would be Watanabe.I generally liked the plot, in which Cruise as a war hero has painful misgivings about his role in senseless battles killing innocent American Indians.  His character goes through a coming of age sub-plot, when he finally has a chance to redeem himself by choosing a path of righteousness rather than blindly following orders.I liked the first half of the movie better than the second half, which became a bit unglued (in my opinion).  For example, Cruise is escorted and given safe passage back into town.  Then both Katsumoto and his son (in separate scenes) come waltzing into town and, although not greeted warmly, are generally given the freedom to roam.  It seems that since they had both been hunted throughout the movie, that they would have been killed on sight. Just seemed odd to me given the violent encounters earlier in the film.My favorite part of the film is Algren's stay with the Samurai's.  It overshadows almost everything before and after.  The closing battle is OK, but is pretty much a remake of the battle scenes in every epic movie (i.e., Braveheart, The Patriot, Spartacus, Gettysburg, on and on...), with the only thing left for the viewer is to guess who would come out on top.The ending is fairly rewarding, showing that Katsumoto's sacrifice had meaning.  I did find it rather cheesy when in the end, the narrator said something like ""nobody ever knew what happened to Captain Algren"" then they proceeded to show an ending where Algren ended up with his love interest.  I would think they need to do one or the other, not both.Given my peevish quibbles, I really liked the movie and recommend it highly. It has a thought provoking plot, great scenery, and good acting (especially the Japanese characters).",The Last Samurai
231,ingmarbeldman-753-927212,"Americanized vehicle, saved by it's pure intentions",8,10 June 2019,"As a frequent traveller to Japan -modern Japan but nevertheless - i feel this movie tastes too much like a Hollywood stage. Nothing wrong with that but if you pretend to be authentic, do your homework. This is not Japan, but a too easily produced version of it.But the story's premise - well, there seem to be many - is brought so carefully and impressive, that i reward with an 8. The noble love between Cruise and the widow, the melancholy of a dying culture and the powerful presentation of 'Bushido', it adds to a very satisfying experience.So,
Don't expect a movie about Japan, just feel entertained with a story, set out in a fantasy country, like Lord of the Rings and feel the noble virtues supporting Cruise's character's arc.",The Last Samurai

I simply regret the feeling having to watch this film after 15 years of release. I knew from the beginning that it was an emotional story about the legend of samurai but i had never expected to become such an emotional movie since it was related to war and history. Story , dialogues and scenes with the perfect direction has offered the viewers one of the all time war classic in the name of ""The Last Samurai"".Direction and Story was never boring and it keeps guessing viewer every time. Story is unfolding in a manner it makes the audience more and more bonded to the story or else to the life of samurai people. Samurai Villages and all other locations have this precious scenic beauty which always attracts one's mind and soul. Tom cruise and Koyuki Kato gives a erotic matching without a single nude shot.

234,matthewjloller,A forgotten gem and possibly Cruise's best performance,10,30 November 2019,"This movie should be remembered as one of the all time greats but sadly it remains mostly forgotten except among mostly just film buffs and Japanese history nerds. It is a darn shame too because this is a true tour de force of a performance by Cruise in what is one of the most touching stories ever put to camera. The relationships our hero builds throughout the film are so deeply personal and the character arc moves so perfectly and subtly that one doesn't even feel jarred at any moment yet we as the audience are at a completely different place with Algren by the end of the film. This is possibly the gold standard when it comes to character study films that lead us through an arc with our hero. Watanabe also turns in some of his best work, and it is the relationship between these two men, Katsumoto and Algren, that drive this film and give it the almost unbearably emotional ending that it does. (also Hans Zimmer's most underrated score just sayin)",The Last Samurai
235,brainofj72,A Gentle Epic,8,27 August 2005,"There is certainly no shortage of Hollywood epics these days, and it takes a certain flair in order for one to stand out amongst the rest. ""The Last Samurai"" is a film that most certainly separates itself from the masses.The story follows American Army Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise), a man haunted by the horrors of war, as he is hired by the Japanese to train their army and lead them to victory over the Samurai, who are rebelling against the modernization of Japan. During the first battle against the Samurai, Algren is taken captive and forced to remain in an isolated Samurai village. There, he learns the enigmatic ways of the Samurai and comes to love their unique brand of civilization. He then switches sides and fights along side the Samurai and against his former peers.""The Last Samurai"" is gentle, caring study of how modern society often tramples over ways of the past without even flinching. The film showcases beautiful cinematography and expert pacing. However, it is not without its flaws. The acting is hit-and-miss. Tom Cruise and Tony Goldwyn deliver average performances, while Ken Watanabe is quite exceptional as the peaceful leader of the Samurai village. The film, while excellent, also does have its share of clichés, such as a shaky slow motion scene where Algren remembers the massacre that haunts him. There are also a few moments where you have to wonder if director Edward Zwick is kind of trying to tug at your strings (to release the waterworks, that is).But flaws aside, ""The Last Samurai"" is a film people should most certainly see. The social commentary is very relevant to modern society and the blend of beautiful scenic backdrops and violent battle sequences make this film truly stand out amongst a sea of stinkers such as ""Troy"".8/10",The Last Samurai
236,SerpentMage,An Emotional Roller-coaster Of A Movie,10,4 March 2005,"Having the movie channel for the past five years I get to see all sorts of movies. Some good some bad. However, this one was very very good.As per other comments, this was a great movie and worth the watch. If there is any ""typical Hollywood"", it is the last thirty seconds. But it's only a minor thing and does not really add or remove from the plot. What made this movie for me is that it put me on an incredible emotional roller-coaster.The characters were extremely well played and Tom Cruise was incredible. Personally I am fifty-fifty on Tom Cruise as some of his acting was very lack luster and shallow. Not this movie though. I especially like the fact that the individual characters were stereo-typical, but yet not. You never really knew what was going to happen, and you are glued to the movie.Great movie!!!",The Last Samurai
237,jon2005,The Last Samurai,9,22 May 2006,"A note for the uninitiated: this is not Braveheart (1995) in a different guise. Instead, this is a far more sophisticated piece of art, a film that makes history a subject well worth investigating further. With the Last Samurai, director Edward Zwick has created a film perfectly showcasing heroism at its fullest. Tom Cruise stars in (arguably) his finest role to date, as the American Captain Nathan Algren, who is captured by the samurai warriors he is training the Japanese army to defeat. At first reluctant to explore the new world he has been pulled into, Algren slowly begins to see that perhaps these samurai are not the ""barbarians"" that he has been led to believe they are. Usually when you see a Tom Cruise film, the mega-star status shines through instead of the character he is playing, but in the Last Samurai Cruise has presented himself admirably, as the viewer is sucked into the samurai world with him. He at once shows strength and bravery, but also compassion and a weakness of spirit, not to mention a fine sense of humour, usually directed at his samurai guard, ""Bob"". Algren's development from a drunken waste to a samurai himself is utterly compelling, and comes through at its best when the samurai village is attacked by ninja's, and Algren instantly decides to side with his captor's leader, Katsumoto.The film wastes no time getting to the point of Algren's capture, but when he gets to the samurai's village, the film takes its time showing the samurai's way of life, and many people may think that this is where the film begins to drag, but this is not the case. Throughout much of his time in the village Cruise says very little, but his silent wonderment at the samurai life gives off a dramatic effect unreachable by many effects-driven blockbusters, and it is this part of the film that Zwick shows off his talents as a director. However, the real star of the show is Ken Watanabe's samurai leader, Katsumoto. He is the perfect actor to play a character driven by the need to keep up the ways of his ancestors, and to stop Japan being pulled into an industrial revolution, however futile this may be. He is the true embodiment of the samurai code, never giving up, and sticking to his principles even in the face of certain defeat. Watanabe is a hugely convincing actor, making you want to root for him all the way, despite the fact that the samurai are actually fighting against the emperor.This film is an action film, though. Whilst there is plenty of drama, Zwick proves himself to be an admirable action-director, whether handling the large battles of the samurai versus Japan's army, or the more intimate one-on-one fights that Algren is involved in during his time in the samurai village. The screenplay is very well written; not surprising as it was co-written by John Logan, the writer for the immensely popular Gladiator. Cruise is well backed up by the supporting actors, including Billy Connelly and Timothy Spall, in a film that has been carefully crafted rather than slapped together, producing a film that, despite its relatively unimpressive box office success, is still one of the finest mainstream films that has come out of America for a long time.

238,Syrchek,It fitted my expectations,7,3 June 2005,"The first time I've seen this movie is now almost a year and a half ago. I saw it in a theater with a friend. I probably wouldn't go see it if it weren't for the buzz that it received on this website. At the end the outcome was a lot like I expected it to be. No I was certainly not disappointed but comments like ""absolutely perfect"" or ""flawless"" would not likely come out of my mouth.The Last Samurai is a rather ""hollywoodized"" representation of the changes in Japan that took place in the second half of the 19th century. The first half of the film I thought that a more detailed depiction of the ""leap"" to a more modern Japanese society will be neglected. Later on we see that the samurai were also an important part of the Japanese society at that time and that they were not entirely excluded in participating at important discussions.What I also mean by ""hollywoodized"" in this film is the exposure of the samurai lifestyle and the relationship between Nathan Algren (Cruise) and the samurai. I think that is the most important part of the film. I found Cruise's convalescence, his view and his adaption to the new lifestyle rather clichéd and stereotypical. I thought I've seen it all before.You can call me petty but I think the films biggest plus are the battle-scenes. They were carried out with a lot of attention to the viewer and everything about them was amazing from sound to costumes. I will remember this film particularly because of that. I saw the movie again three days ago on DVD and I realized that I forgot most of the dialog and the content. I even found them more clichéd and ordinary than before. But I still thought that the battle-scenes were amazing or even more amazing than I did before........ - 4/5 .......",The Last Samurai
239,sparsh-hardik,Enjoyable and thoughtful,10,20 August 2019,"There is an argument, that the ways generally Samurais are portrayed in the pop-culture is not truly accurate and many of them were corrupt. They resisted the modernization of Japan in 19th century under the Emperor Meiji, because it was going to take away their privileges as a warrior class. But Meiji's step (somewhat reluctant) was a visionary one and he brought the modern ideas into his country and started the industrialization, so that the Europeans couldn't get opportunity to fully dominate the land of a rising Sun. And till now, it is appreciated how Japan formed a perfect balance between the modern state and a state which values it's cultural identity. That's where India failed, due to lack of centralization of political power in 19th century.This epic scale movie doesn't address that complex situation of that era; however it communicates the idea of the importance of one's own culture and its values. There is something beautiful about the previous generation war movies. They feel more real than today's movies made with the excessive use of visual effects.",The Last Samurai
240,auberus,"Falling in the ""visual over substance"" trap...once again",6,11 March 2004,"""The Last Samurai"" is the ultimate Hollywood machinery to make you fall in the trap of mediocrity without you noticing it...the weapons used are classic once: cheesiness, unrealistic story, pretty pictures, robotic pace, pop corn and coke environment. Your are entertained, some of us will spare some tears in front of this well produced eye for candy film... but at the end this is nothing more than a straight formula very well hidden under a beautiful cinematography... SPOILERWhat's the recipe's like? Chapter one: ""Honor to be restored"" The film start with an extremely corny opening narration where we learn that Japanese ""forgot the very meaning of the word honor."" - 5 minutes into the movie and we've already reached the paroxysm of pretension. Chapter Two: ""Japanese Strategy"" A drunkard is hired by a nation who wants to build a modern army. - Do Mrs. Zwick / Cruise want to prove that Japanese people are silly, because if that's what they wanted they're spot on. Chapter Three: ""The definition of courage"": Tom Cruise gets beaten up by that Japanese Samurai guy, but refuses to stay down - What kind of courage is that? I did not know that the words courage and stupidity were synonyms. Chapter Four: ""I am the polyglot"" During the only time Katsumoto and the Emperor met they choose to speak English rather than Japanese. - Was it an English contest between the two of them? Chapter Five: ""A Samurai is born"" Tom Cruise mastered the katana during one winter. He now can kill 3 Ninjas who trained all their life and kills 5 armed Japanese swordsmen in Kyoto's street in a beautiful and polished to the extreme samurai showdown. Chapter Six: ""Men of Courage"" Katsumoto and is fellow samurai charge at the machine guns. The scene is so breath taking that the Japanese officer is feeling sympathy for them and everyone is now showing ""mucho respecto"" for the guys. - We reached a peak right there where ridicule and stupidity are blend in a ""Hollywoody Superb"". Final Chapter: ""Honor Restored"" or ""The lesson from the drunkard"": A broken Tom Cruise handing Katsumoto's sword to the Emperor and saying the following line ""I won't tell you how he died. I will tell you how he lived."" - Now I am p***ed of as the use of clichés has reached the top of ""Cheesy Mountain"".I will pass on the detail of the perfect Japanese village were everything is clean from the stone to the roof top. I am actually wandering if the dirt and the trees were bacteria free as the village seems cleaner than Michael Jackson's oxygen caisson.

242,orourkec-292-269155,Satisfying filmmaking,7,13 December 2014,"The Last Samurai largely and greatly benefits from its emotionally powerful, exceptional, completely unexpected and knockout ending and the best ending I've ever seen in movies in memory, stunning visuals, thrilling battle scenes and high production values. I love the slick comical touch in the movie and it truly works and suits the movie. The way the characters behave and look at the world around them is interesting. The movie also has a strong feeling and sense of heroism, honor, redemption and vulnerability and I like that. Well done. Now, I would like to comment on something people tend to misunderstand. A few, some or most people say that the ending is ruined and that annoys me because I can easily suspect that these people think too quickly for what it is to them as a first place idea in their mind rather than first trying to uncover its purpose and meaning and find out whether it is a ruined ending or not. Because whether it's a movie ending that we as humans in our nature are generally used to or not, that's not what matters, instead it is the meaning and purpose which is important. The so thought ruined ending isn't there just like that, and it's likely there for a (good (and worthy)) reason. So for those of you who still think of it as a ruined ending, please do what I just said: think deeply before saying. On my side I thought that the ending was great (as I, of course, already said).

243,sweetrupturedlight,What sheer brilliance....,9,22 May 2004,"I complained, was pained, and finally moaned in outrage as this movie was compared to the movie that had become my all time favourite, (LoTR-RoTK).  I found it an insult and an outrage.  Ironically though, i had not even seen The Last Samurai, but i hated it! (Yes, shoot me now - its that human defence mechanism thing kicking in)I have however seen this movie about 5 times to date.  i love it!  I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan, and perhaps that was one of the reasons i was so anti it from the beginning.  the thought of Tom playing a wannabe Samurai just put me off.  Having said that, the movie was amazing.  I never got the impression he was trying to do any such thing.  His performance was real and sincerely done.  I find myself watching this movie again and again. 
The direction is beautiful, surrounded by locations that just enhance the serenity and emotional turmoil enbroiled in the story.Having spoke about Tom's performance, i will say that the shiners come from Ken Watanabe and Koyoki.  Ken was BRILLIANT as Kutsimoto, just BRILLIANT. Every Expression, every gesture, from the shrugging of a shoulder to the wry smile, it was perfectly executed.Koyoki, amazing.  She seemed to have gotten the spirit of what the character of Taka should have been like.  I really watch her performance critically to find a falw, yet i find none.  She too had this innertly graceful way of doing her scences.  She is beautiful and a definite job well done.Everything else, the rest of the cast, crew...it gelled perfectly.What a movie, and one that i have enjoyed emensely.  With that Said however...

244,sweetrupturedlight,One of the finest movies ever,9,22 March 2005,"This review contains spoilers.The Last Samurai. What a movie. From the minute I first lay eyes on the opening scene, something tells me this is going to be fantastic. The music moves me, the scenes unfold. You spot a man, yet unknown, sitting in silent contemplation as a voice-over informs you of the myth surrounding the birth of Japan. You meet another man, desperate in his attempts to sabotage his life it would seem. A drunk. A man confused, with no direction, with what seems like a tiny piece of his soul intact after much hardship. What has he done? What is his story? We don't know yet. But I am intrigued.I have to start by saying that I am not one to critique, dissect and cross-examine movies. I know little of brilliant film-making techniques. All I know is what I like. Sometimes I like trash, sometimes I like movies critically acclaimed as masterpieces. It's a matter of personal gratification and what I get from a movie.The Last Samurai, the story of an American captain  played my Tom Cruise  who after being instrumental in the death of thousands on the battlefield, finds solace in the bottom of a bottle of brandy. He cares neither if he lives nor dies. He is volatile. He is hurt, has no honor and seeks to sabotage his life. He is asked to lead Japanese soldiers into battle against a group of rebellions  the last group of Samurai. It is here that we begin to see where his destiny might lead. The Samurai takes him captive, lead by Katsumoto  played by Ken Watanabe. And the second act of the movie begins. Algren starts to feel again. He is forced to examine the man he has become, and also forced to play an active role in what his destiny is to become. In the Samurai village we see Algren interact with many characters. Katsumoto, Ujio (Katsumoto's general), Taka (his caregiver and the wife of a Samurai, Hirotada he killed in battle), Higen and Magojiro (Taka's son's), the silent samurai 'Bob' and Nobutada (Katsumoto's son). It is here the drama unfolds and we learn as Algren learns. He unwillingly becomes friend, confidant, leader, father and husband. It is an amazing journey, one skillfully brought to life by breathtaking direction.The third act begins as Algren takes up the mantle of his destiny and together with Katsumoto takes a stand against the Emperor and helps the Samurai captain retain his honor, while regaining his own.Having said that I know nothing about the technicalities of film-making, I have to mention that to my untrained eye, the direction of this movie seemed flawless. Using different effects - slow motion, sound, reflection, emotion, and silence  there seemed to be no scene where Zwick didn't use them to perfection. This is a movie of silent complexities. Props are used to give silent messages, characters use body language and communicative facial expressions with eyes that are filled with a story of their own to tell you exactly what you need to know. More than words ever could. A simple shrug by Katsumoto tells you this is a man under intense pressure, but the words are never uttered. The score I found particularly moving. It blended beautifully with this striking story.This movie is beautiful. Simple, yet so complex at the same time. Friendships are at the core. Honor leads the way. And love is redeeming. I am not a Tom Cruise fan. In fact, I rebelled against seeing it initially because I didn't feel like seeing a movie about an American joining the natives, teaching them his ways and winning the hearts of the masses. This is, and was not, what The Last Samurai is about. I love the fact that Algren enters into the world of these amazing people and he learns from them. There are no American heroics. I also love the fact that the movie retains all the respect that these people deserved. There was no out-of-context love story where characters strip naked and go at it to make for more sizzling storytelling. In fact, one of the most beautiful scenes in the entire movie is the unconventional love scene between Algren and Taka, as she dresses him for battle. I love the fact that he movie makes you hunger to learn about this fascinating culture as it is told in a respectful and dignified manner.A word on the acting then. I cannot point to a weak link. Tom Cruise was exceptional as the wounded captain. Just amazing. One of his best performances and may have turned me into a fan. Ken Watanabe. What an amazing actor. He embodied the soul of the Samurai in every gesture and that was breathtaking to see. Koyuki, what a beautiful and graceful performance. The children, especially the boy playing Higen had a depth that made it all seem so real.I find myself able to watch and re-watch this movie from start to finish, and then start again. Its amazing and in my humble opinion, one of the finest ever. I am truly biased at this point. So I can do no more than recommend that you decide for yourself.9/10 perhaps even 10",The Last Samurai
245,colm-hearne365,An underrated masterpiece,9,20 May 2017,"I can't understand why The Last Samurai got mixed reviews by critics because it's such a powerful and beautiful movie. In fact, it's up there with other sword fighting movies like Braveheart and Gladiator. But at least, it was a success with audiences and at least Empire Magazine gave it a five-star review.But all that aside, let me just say that I really enjoyed the film. The two lead actors, Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are superb in their performances. Tom Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a traumatized soldier who finds peace when he's taken prisoner by the samurai warriors and he learns how they live and their culture and language and even becomes a father/husband figure to the family of the samurai that he killed in battle and even becomes a samurai himself. To me, this is Tom Cruise's best performance of his career despite what people might say about him but he's acted well in other movies like Rain Man and Born on the Fourth of July. Ken Watanabe plays the samurai leader, Katsumoto who is in conflict with the Japanese Emperor and politicians because he wants to keep the old culture and traditions and honour of Japan alive and goes into battle against the modern Japanese army and I'm glad Watanabe was nominated for an Oscar for his performance.The action scenes and battle sequences are as compelling as the story. And I like how they depict the locations of 19th century Japan at one side, a revolutionary city and at the other side, a vast and beautiful countryside. The cinematography is shot beautifully and the rest of the cast do really well too. So in conclusion, I just want to say The Last Samurai is one of my favourite movies of 2003 (a rather good year for movies) and I recommend to anyone who likes great drama and action.",The Last Samurai
246,sn319,Dances with Samurai,8,10 December 2014,"The plot behind this movie is best described as Dances with Samurai. An American played by Tom Cruise goes to train Japanese troops in the use of modern weaponry so that they can face off against rebels opposed to the modernization of Japan. What winds up happening? Cruise finds that the rebels are fighting a worthy cause, they should be allowed to continue, and he fights on their side against the much more modern army of the emperor.As a film, it's very well directed and acted. It has a lot of great scenes of action and enough drama to keep you glued to the seat. The romance in it is rushed and unrealistic and I can see many people brushing it off as more of a ""summer film"" with a lot of flash but no substance but deep down I can see that spirit of the samurai coming through. It's a movie that showcases the honor and vitality of the samurai and condemn the more modern approach to warfare. It's also got some historical weight, showcasing a piece of history, the Meiji Restoration, that western films never have touched upon (well, Samurai movies in the west are very rare).I feel that The Last Samurai is an excellent film overall and a definite watch if you haven't experienced it yet.",The Last Samurai
247,sjwest,"And James Brown Said Living In America, Oops, Sorry  Japan'.",8,10 February 2004,"The epic movie seems to creating a lot of interest among producers and when we see this we can wonder no further. These movies are very moving and draw you in with their deep characters and even deeper stories. The dedication required from cast and crew will be far higher than for the regular popcorn movie designed to put butts in seats. If well done this does translate to the audience who become fully engrossed in a good story and will remain transfixed to the very end despite these movies usually long time length.
The Last Samurai' is indeed an epic movie displaying all the necessary characteristics indicated above. Unfortunately the translation to the audiences did not carry through to the Academy and this will be largely due to the fact that The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy has come to end and is due for a few necessary awards. I am not going to look at the look at the reasons for the few Academy nominations, but rather at what aspects made this movie capture my imagination above others.As good as it is - it is flawed in a few places. The one area of particular note is the beginning. It is a logical start to the movie which quickly introduces us to some of the main characters and tries to show us the mental torment of Nathan Algren (Cruise). He is plagued by the memories of the atrocities of the American army when they fought the Indians. The right direction was thus set as this enables the story to ease quite nicely into an interesting clash of cultures later on, but at this point the moviemakers seem intent on quickly moving us through an important part of the film where we see the characters problems of conscious and the shame he holds for his own culture. The scenes splutter across the screen as we are ushered through the obligatory character aspects to the juicy part of the movie which for me is where the unprepared Japanese trainees have to face the formidable Samurai's. From here on, the movie flows gracefully until the final scenes.During the final stand of the Samurais', some of the Japanese soldiers start to exude pity and remorse in the face of the slaughter of their fellow countrymen who are after all only taking a stand for the Japanese way. The acting here is not of the highest caliber and nearly ruined what was a most grand climax. It appears hammed and although this was the right emotion to portray for the moment, it was not strong enough especially in the face of other performances.  Despite the opening scenes, there is a real effort to tell a meaningful story. This is evident through the restraint exercised over the characters. The bad guys do not have cheap punch lines, but as in the case of Algren's superior officer, seems well schooled and sophisticated. The love interest between Cruise and his fallen foes wife is completely devoid of the high testosterone charged skirt chasing reminiscent of some of Cruise's past characters. The only hint at sexual yearning was when she lovingly dresses him for the final battle. The final scene consists of a loving look into each others eyes. This clearly indicated the intent at making a meaningful movie which may mature on DVD stands like a fine red wine.The epic movie needs an epic character and this is provided in the form of Cruise. Complexities of character for the lead role are necessary. To this regard, he portrays a man distanced from his own culture which practices the end justifies the means. The culture which he falls into the capture of has elements which he does not approve of, such as their apparent lack of value for life when they must take their own life in the face of defeat. But he warms to them since they are standing against the predatory culture of which is so ashamed. The Americans and ambitious Japanese see savages while he sees a people who wish to retain their ancient ways which are pure in intent. The characters obstacle of acceptance is great since he has killed one of their best in battle but was ultimately defeated meaning that he should have taken his own life. His spirit and discipline wins them over and they accept him as a warrior worthy of their own. The epic character had found that their belief in similar principles endeared them to each other.Cruise as always has a commanding presence throughout and after the opening twenty minutes truly shows that he has what he takes to win an Oscar. Although it will not be this year, his dedication to making each project that he takes on a success must mean that he will eventually win it. I have always thought of his name on the poster as a quality stamp of approval. Even his less popular movies are still commendable. The Last Samurai' leaves no room for doubt that this is a man who takes his craft very seriously indeed  for a movie of this magnitude, it needed to be.
Authenticity is important for the epic movie and we are not disappointed. The sword fights are well rehearsed and the cinematography is well orchestrated here as we do not stay long with one shot which heightens the action as well as not allowing for evidence of unskilled swordsmanship  not that these guys were that bad, though. The costumes were striking and did not appear to drown the characters as sometimes occurs in period movies.
The acting was solid throughout with a few minor noticeable exceptions. Connolly was entertaining for the short screen time that he occupied. Tony Goldwyn was good as the self  righteous and pompous Colonel Bagley. The Emperor was portrayed very well by Nakumura as being weak and open to influence from the greed of the West. At the end he realizes his heritage and sees the traders for what they are. A lot of acclaim has gone to the supporting actor, Ken Watanabe, and although rightfully bestowed it is for me as already mentioned, Cruise who leads from the front.Depth of character and depth of story is the strongest redeeming elements here. We have a character haunted by a tortured past, disillusioned with his culture and sells' his skills, which were used for suppression, for money. He is captured by a group of rebels who may be different in many ways from himself, but have the same sense of disillusionment with their culture which is losing it's purity for greed. He had finally found himself and was willing to die for it, as were the Samurai. The epic movie must mean that the hero has to have something that he believes in so dearly, that he is willing to die for it. Only by doing this, will he find ultimate fulfillment and become the gallant hero that the audience were wishing for. This story is delivered with a juxtaposition of cultures skillfully crafted leading us not only to the end of the hero's journey, but to teach us something about ourselves as well. Indeed, this is upper end entertainment well worth a place in the DVD cabinet.",The Last Samurai
248,chucknorrisrules,The film that Dances with Wolves is glad it is not.,5,8 April 2009,"SPOILER WARNING!!!When I first saw this movie as a 14/15 year old guttersnipe, I was dead impressed. Exciting, thought provoking, touching, everything an epic needs!Of course, now I am older and wiser and understand that this movie is trying to do what many of these epics have churned out time and time before.132-133 years into the past into Japan in 1876-1877 (well, actually it starts in America), Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise) is parading the brand new lever-action Winchester in fairs around the country as part of America's centenary, (though sometimes losing his PTSD-riddled rag completely) and begins working for his detested and despised commanding officer Colonel Bagley to train the Japanese army in modern warfare.Going over, Algren is peed off that he is ""subduing another tribal rebellion"" while at the same time stating that he ""doesn't give a damn about the Samurai"" (though they pretty much have the lie of the land here and are more than a mere tribe, let's face it! They have dirty great swords for pete's sake!) and after some poor decision making by his superior officers (just like in real life), the hastily-trained Japanese infantry is pitted against the Samurai and is knocked for six.The only survivor who doesn't desert the battlefield is Algren, and Katsumoto (Watanabe) is impressed enough to take him alive. (Though this is also partly to do with the horrendous claptrap that is ""destiny"".)From here on, the story is predictable. Algren is taken prisoner by the Samurai, Algren is impressed at these people as spiritual and self-disciplined warriors. Algren switches sides.Back then, I didn't see the pretentiousness of the ""noble savage"" mantra that is constantly trotted out by unthinking Hollywood execs for unthinking Hollywood-junkie sheep. The Samurai didn't rebel to protect their way of life, the Samurai rebelled because the emperor had slashed their paycheck! Their women had no rights, there were untouchables in their village, progress of the human race isn't necessarily an evil thing, especially if it means that you have no right to carry a sharp sword around to randomly cut someone's head off! (Actually, there is an amusing deleted scene on the DVD where one of the Samurai beheads a smirking passer-by and somehow Algren marvels at him as he walks off - but clearly they realised that this would be a mistake to show in the movie!)A couple of nagging annoyances at this film are as follows:1: The constant defaming of General Custer. Sure, he was a cretin for leading his men into the Little Big Horn massacre, but he wasn't as bad as painted, not necessarily a murderer because he was quoted by an anti-Indian journalist to saying ""if I was an Indian, I'd rather live on the open plains than submit to the confines of a reservation. But I have my orders to subdue them, and return them to the reservations."" He also voiced concern over rough treatment of the Indians on these reservations. The 1868 Washita incident (or - as said and as shown in Algren's flashbacks - massacre) is a rather ambiguous one though, because despite it's depiction in the film being according to the Massacre accounts where the majority of casualties were unarmed women and children, some stories paint a different light that it was a battle, but the women and children were rounded up to a reservation after being used as a human shield from more Indians and were photographed aftewards according to the BBC, so it's hard to know which to believe. But if he is a ""murderer who fell in love with his own legend"" as Algren puts it, isn't the final battle an echo of this?2: The glorification of honour and the literally ""death or glory"" culture of the Samurai is rather dubious to be the basis as an attempt to show them as the ""noble stewards of the land"" when they carry swords that can cut your head off (and would do so just as soon as look at you). I also find the ""Samurai-traditions-good-western-culture-bad"" somewhat confusing considering that the western culture does have bonuses like giving people decent human rights for once! Plus the fact that the Bushido code is the glorification of a code that inspired the Japanese armies to wreak havoc among the Chinese during the Nanking massacre (Look it up if you want the proper details, it is not pleasant!), and to slam their planes into ships long before the Saudis got the same idea to repeat the exercise with jumbo jets and buildings in New York back in 2001!3: The sentimentality in this film is incredible, there's enough of it here to make The Little Mermaid look down to earth! The rubbish about destiny (I believe destiny is a monstrous pile of bull butter) and not even trying to change it (i.e. the reason why the Samurai didn't use firearms - to avoid screwing about with ""fate"", increasing the risk of being massacred!), and the confusing reason as to why a Japanese Samurai wife and caring mother of two would forgive the man who'd slain her husband and actually got with him!Having moaned myself to death however, I will concede that there are some nice touches in this film. The Samurai battles are excellent and riveting, and Billy Connolly is a saving grace as a sadly short-lived Irish soldier character at the beginning of the film with some excellent lines. The settings of post-feudal Japan and the epic backdrops are very well pulled off. So if you have listened to this review and are not put off and still wish to see this film, please switch your brain off before doing so, otherwise you might just drown in a sea of sopping wet sugar!",The Last Samurai
249,thesundance14,A really attractive movie that just doesn't quite get to the mark.,7,10 December 2003,"The problem with mega-epics like The Last Samurai, is to get it ""banked"" it takes a mega draw star.  Tom Cruise is such a bankable star but he may be great in a Top Gun type swaggering stud role but as a staggering drunk turned hero he is not all that good.But he is surrounded by a lot of good things.  The very best is Ken Watanabe, who plays Katsumato the leader of the last of the traditional Samurai warriors. Mr. Watanabe should be nominated if not win the best supporting actor bid for this role.  In short he is powerful!!Tony Goldwyn is a well selected choice of Colonel Bagley, the over zealous commander of the american ""advisors"".The music is very good.  The costumes are authentic and well shown and presented and as such they may get awards too.The Story?  Well it is a bit ""hero based camp"", but that is what action epics are supposed to be, so no complaints there.The location shots are beautiful and...ok...to the not so good part.  That is just it you see...none of it is bad....all of it is just short of really good.  The potential love story is left short.  The adversary/ buddy angle starts well and ends  in an incomplete fashion too. The power of the movie is Watanabe and he is really worth the price of admission and afterward I think you will say it could have been so much better.  Maybe if David Lean had directed it???

251,greenforest56,Well directed picture / mistaken romanticism,8,22 September 2005,"This picture is beautifully directed. Both the long shots, indoor shots and close ups are rich, warm and evocative. The quality of the direction is sustained throughout the picture.The acting is consistently excellent. The picture is well cast, both American and Japanese. Cruise, of course, gives another fine performance. This one lacks some of his usual intensity, but I think this reflects his maturity as a person and an actor. His performance is more subtle and refined. Like fine wine, he is improving with age.This picture is based on historical fact. The theme is the nobility of the Samurai Way and the Code of Bushido. Like any apologia, it overlooks the less wholesome aspects of Bushido. For instance, all the people beneath the Samurai were serfs whose sole purpose in life was to support the Samurai 'way of life'. In other words, a beautiful life.. if you could afford it. And like all feudal societies, the nobility lived on the backs of the peasants.In 1942 the Marine garrison at Wake Island surrendered to the invading Japanese. They had driven off a previous invasion, the only successful defense against an amphibious assault in the entire war.As the prison ship made its leisurely way back to Japan the Marines were taken out, one by one, and beheaded.Bushido.When the United States invaded Saipan there were Japanese civilians living there. As the Americans pressed inland it became apparent they were going to be victorious. The Japanese women took their children to a nearby sea cliff. They threw their children over the cliff then jumped after them. Japanese speaking Americans with bullhorns begged them not to, to no avail. They watched helplessly until all were dead.Bushido.I recommend you watch this film, it is a good picture.There are many admirable aspects of Japanese society. The Samurai Way and the Code of Bushido is not one of them.",The Last Samurai

254,Tulsa90,"Very Overrated, Does not belong anywhere near the Top 250 films!",5,6 January 2005,"Being a movie buff, I have come to love the IMDb website. It is fascinating to review the careers of directors, actors, actresses and to find out about movies that you haven't seen that look interesting. The only bad thing I can say is that there is a strong tendency towards recent or new films being rated highly. This is inevitable as there is a disproportionate number of younger people using the internet who primarily watch only new movies. Even knowing this, it is still a little disgusting to see an average movie like 'Last Samurai' rated in the same company as some true classics and masterpieces from the last 100 years or so of film making. This movie is OK, but I was disappointed in many aspects of the film. I thought that a lot of the scenes that were supposed to be the emotional climaxes of the story were kind of ridiculous and almost laughable (I did laugh a few times when I wasn't supposed to be. Anyway, how can this movie be ranked up there with Hitchcock's classics such as vertigo, Rear Window, etc. and a whole laundry list of much better films? I just don't get it.",The Last Samurai
255,FranktheRabbit,Don't expect Kurosawa,7,20 December 2003,"`The Last Samurai' (2003/Edward Zwick) *** out of ****`If you spent your whole life looking for the perfect bloom, it would not be a wasted life'- Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe)The quote that I mentioned above is one of the many memorable quotes said by Ken Watanabe in the film `The Last Samurai'. The film stars Tom Cruise as a Civil Veteran who is fighting personal demons within himself. He gets an offer from a Japanese official to train the Emperor's modern army, and to help wipe out the remaining Samurai, who hold on to the traditionalism of ancient Japan. After the first battle, Cruise is captured and forced to live with the Samurai for a few months. During this time, he comes to realize what is important in life, and who he should be supporting.
For me, this film was the most anticipated film that I wanted to see this year, next to `Kill Bill'. And I am sad to say that I am somewhat disappointed. I was filled with mixed emotions as I walked out of the theater into the rainy reality. I was hoping this film would be a major Oscar contender, but I don't think it is worthy of any nominations. Cruise's performance was good, but not worthy of a nomination. The cinematography and score, however, were very well done. The directing (Zwick won Best Director at the National Board of Review), was good, but nothing spectacular. The best actor in the movie is not Cruise, but Ken Watanabe, who plays the Samurai who takes Cruise under his wing. He gives a great performance. In my opinion, the film sold its soul to Hollywood with the ending, but the final battle was surprisingly emotional and the film should have left it at that. But instead, it was longer than it should have been. The parts of the film that take place in the Samurai village are by far the best parts. And the use of rain and the sun rising and setting are artful additions to the film's quality. But when the story focuses back on `civilization', that is when the film gets a little dull. It has a few Kurosawa' moments, but don't go in expecting `The Seven Samurai' or `Yojimbo'. Instead, expect a cross between `Dances With Wolves' and `The Patriot'.The film's themes are what really interested me. My knowledge of Japanese History is limited, but I am led to believe that the way of the Samurai' was in fact the way of life in Japan for a long timeuntil the mid 1800's, when this takes place. The film portrays the end of an era. The ending of a way of life, known as the Samurai. The ancient battle between traditionalism and secularism. The film asks the question: Is change always a good thing?The film has ambition and contains some greatness, but much to my dismay, I did not find it to be the best film of the year which I had hoped it would be. But, it was a worthy effort and I recommend it.-30-",The Last Samurai
256,Marthian80,"Beautiful scenery, interesting history and awesome battle scenes makes a great combination",8,7 August 2017,"I missed out on this movie back when it came out and finally got the chance to watch it. It is loosely based on real events about the samurai and Japanese history which sound interesting to me, but how does that combine with Tom Cruise?The film opens in San Francisco in the summer of 1876. Ex-United States Army captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is having troubles dealing with his military past: he drinks a lot and has nightmares of the horrors he has seen, especially the battles against the native Americans. His former commanding officer Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) offers him a job in Japan: train the new imperial Japanese army to strike down the samurai rebellion who are opposing the new western-style changes to Japanese civil life. Although Algren hates Bagley he accepts the job and travels to Japan. He starts training the soldiers but they are very inexperienced and can't hit anything with they're firearms. Despite not being ready for battle, Bagley orders an attack on the samurai. In the battle that follows, the heavily experienced samurai easily overwhelm the soldiers who flee the battlefield in terror. Captain Angler is left alone but to his own surprise he is not killed, the samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) spares his life and he is taken with the samurai into the mountains. Once he is nursed back to health, he learns to know and respect the old Japanese way and develops a friendship with Katsumoto. Soon Algren begins to doubt where his loyalty truly lies.I really enjoyed this movie, all the actors did a good job (especially Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe), it looks gorgeous and the story keeps you glued to the screen for two and a half hours. Everything looks authentic and it really feels like you are in a different time era. I also like that there is actually Japanese spoken in this movie, this makes it all feel more real. One of the best things in this film is the chemistry between Cruise and Watanabe, it really made me feel like two completely different people who slowly develop a friendship. Cruise also did a good job acting out the transition of a man who doesn't care about anything first and then becoming more and more attached to the old Japanese way of life.The only thing that troubled me is that it got a little bit to dramatic at the ending for my taste. It felt to me that they were pushing ""the message"" a little bit to hard. But fortunately they did not make the imperial army that fought against the samurai look like inhuman monsters (like 'the Patriot' did with the English) but just people that did as ordered and thought was best. Perhaps the move could use a little bit more action, but on the other hand they needed to take the time to show the way the samurai lived which was important for the story so it's all good in the end.The Last Samurai is an excellent historical war movie that teaches you many things about the history of Japan, has lots of beautiful scenery pictures and has some very good battle scenes as well.",The Last Samurai
257,directjw,The White Samurai,10,14 December 2003,"First off, let me state that I am Asian, so I am writing about The Last Samurai from the perspective of an Asian viewer.This could have been a great, classic epic about the clash between the East and the West, but the last twenty minutes of the film ruin everything that the filmmakers worked so hard at.  Although I won't give away the end of the film, all I will say is that the film finally succumbs to Hollywood conventions which it worked so hard to avoid prior to that point.  What I will say is that the last two scenes of the film are racist to the extreme in that the White man triumphs over his Asian comrades in the most blatantly offensive manner!  Just watch the film, and you will see what I mean.However, prior to the offensive conclusion of the film, The Last Samurai is for the most part a thoughtful and respectful film about Japanese culture and history.  Also, Edward Zwick did a great job of developing the characters of the lead Samurai and the Cruise character.  Their relationship was endlessly fascinating and enlightening.  Also, the battle scenes were among the best that I have ever seen, almost up there, but not quite, with the master himself, Kurosawa.But I must admit that I am tired of seeing films about the White man who meets the noble savages, and learns to appreciate and eventually assimilate their ways (Dances With Wolves, Last of the Mohicans, The Thin Red Line, Zwick's own film Glory, and the list goes on...).  I guess that this is a standard convention because Caucasian audiences need a lead character which they can identify with.  But, as an Asian viewer, I find this filmic device rather offensive, because if I want to understand another culture, I want to view it through the lens of the culture itself, not through the eyes of a colonizing force from outside the culture.I know that it sound like I don't like The Last Samurai, but as I stated earlier, there is much to admire in the film.  But, I believe that The Last Samurai could have been a classic if the filmmakers disposed of Cruise' character entirely, and just focused on the conflict between the Samurai culture and the modernizing forces of the mainstream Japanese culture at the time.  Oh, and one more quibble, is it just me, or is it extremely offensive and disrespectful when the Cruise character ends up getting romantically involved with the wife of the man whom he killed in battle?  Come, on, guys, this is just wrong.Someone hand over the Last Samurai's script to a Japanese director, and let the Japanese tell their story, please.And Mr. Zwick, I haven't seen Courage Under Fire yet, but please, if you do another war movie, try to avoid racially charged subjects such as Black regiments during the Civil War, and Japanese samurai fighters.",The Last Samurai
258,jeev7882,The Best Film of the Year,8,1 December 2003,"Where to start? Well, lets scratch the surface by talking about the obvious commercial draw of the film: Tom Cruise. This is Cruise's best film in a long career filled with great films. Here, Cruise is able to utilize his unparalleled action skills and showcase his underappreciated acting talent as Captain Nathan Algren. I have always believed Cruise to be one of the best actors in Hollywood; he is the only action star to put so much effort into each and every scene he does. In Samurai, he is surrounded by an equally talented cast headlined by Asian cinema star Ken Watanabe. Watanabe's performance as Katsumoto is one of the best this year and his chemistry with Cruise is incredible. Katsumoto is a man who demands respect with his looks, but obtains it through his actions. Lets put the performances aside for just a second. The overall look of the film is beautiful. Granted, to most western audiences any movie set in the Orient has beautiful scenery, but Samurai doesn't try to just showcase Japan's grand landscapes. Instead, the scenery flows effortlessly into each and every scene and compliments it. Even further complimenting the look of the movie are the simple yet beautiful sets. I cannot comment on the historical authenticity of the sets having only been to Japan once, but regardless the small, simple Japanese homes are adorned with vastly different personalities in each individual room. The transition between the simple Samurai life and the hectic battle scenes is perfect. Some will complain about the shakiness of the camera at times and that the shots are cut to quickly. Even I had that complaint at small parts here and there, but that's how a battle is: hectic, random, and unpredictable. The battles are among the most epic ever filmed, paralleled only perhaps by those in Braveheart. There are a few fight sequences that had the audience, including myself, applauding afterwards. The most well choreographed in terms of swordplay is one that will have the nerds inside many of us bubbling with joy. Just know this: Ninjas vs. Samurai. Usually when you have a western actor in a role that requires eastern skill (ala Keanu Reeves as Neo), there is huge disappointment among the masses. In this case a man like Cruise has worked his ass off so much that his mastery of a katana blade is as good as Watanabe's or anyone else's. Granted, I'd still put my money on someone like Watanabe in an off screen skirmish, but onscreen the two are equals as warriors. Reverting back to the Ninja vs. Samurai scene, the music is similar to the fast drum beats of Yo-Yo Ma in the first fight sequence of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. At the end of the scene my pulse was as high as ever and my jaw was wide open. The quickness and ferocity of the show that Zwick and the fight choreographers will not back down just because this movie is meant primarily for mainstream America. Almost as if to poke fun at that, there is a short but equally heart-pounding sequence where Algren kills a number of Japanese agents with swords. Initially, the scene is showed in real time, but it pauses after, goes back to the beginning of the sequence, and shows everything in slow motion. It actually means to show Algren's reflection or recollection of the fight that just occurred, but the fact that it works on the two aforementioned levels is even more inspiring. The inevitable final battle sequence is just as good mainly because it doesn't follow any of the common clichés found in other epic war films. Enough about the battles, the real brilliance of this film comes from its short and sharp dialogue and its patient but captivating pacing. The biggest surprise I found was that there were not corny dialogues or lines in the entire movie. Usually movies that showcase words like ""honor"" in their trailers have a cheesy scene somewhere in the movie. In Samurai, ideas and themes like honor and courage are practiced, not talked about. There are no speeches, only dialogues. Characters we don't like strike a chord as much as the protagonists. There is a point in the movie when Algren is leaving to go back to the Samurai when his commanding officer (Col. Bagley) asks him ""what is it about your own people that you hate so much?"" There is no answer from Algren, which makes the question and the point it tries to make all the more chilling. The most impressive dialogue is that written for the Japanese characters, particularly the samurai. Japanese characters consistently talk to each other in Japanese, and Algren eventually learns Japanese instead of vice-versa. The samurai dialogue never lapses into the typical ""dumb foreigner"" dialogue that just about every Hollywood movie showcases these days. Instead, the script, penned by John Logan and Marshall Herskovitz, treats Japanese just as importantly as English, and the Japanese just as important as the Americans. A few things both in and out of the screenplay that I appreciated about the film were the realism of injury and the patience and confidence to let the story unfold by itself. At about an hour-and-a-half, Samurai isn't a second too long or a second too short. It owes this to gorgeous editing and directing which allows the movie to start slowly and then take off when Algren reaches Japan. I mention the realism of injury because our main characters are constantly stabbed or shot and actually take time to heal. Algren himself is nearly killed in the initial encounter with the Samurai, and he is shot and stabbed numerous times in the final scene. A substantial part of the movie deals with his rehabilitation at the Samurai town. So, do I have any complaints at all? No. Upon second viewing maybe I'll find something that could have been a little better. Maybe the beginning could have been a little more interesting. Maybe the action could have been just a little less choppy. I don't know, but for now The Last Samurai is as great as epic filmmaking gets. It represents everyone at the top of their game with the utmost confidence in their artistic abilities. Cruise shows why he has consistently been Hollywood's leading man over the past two decades, and the cast of Asian stars and unknowns doesn't flinch for a second. Most people cringe to mention any movie as comparable in brilliance to Kurosawa, but Samurai places itself in those lofty ranks. This isn't just the best movie I've seen this year, it is one of the best movies I have seen from the past decade.

259,thepts,A gem let down by outdated Hollywood tricks,7,11 June 2004,"This could've been a good movie, a really good movie, because the plot, the epoch, the nation, and the historic setting are all very interesting. I'm not saying this movie's terrible, but it's slightly disappointing.My viewpoint: I thought I was going to see a thoroughly made historic action-movie with samurais. The movie does have quite a lot historical atmosphere, but the strongly forced hollywoodian touches (believe me) in plot and scenes brings it down in quality. Typically, you will have a point where the movie is believable and fascinating, then suddenly, one of those Hollywood touches crushes the atmosphere.*slight spoilers*You will easily see what I'm talking about for yourself.. There are certain classic Hollywood-scenes, like the worried boy maturely exiting the room in distress, then being followed for fatherly comfort and philosophical conversation - or the woman doing her chores when she turns to see her hero returning.. (why, oh, why...) And, classic Hollywood-improbabilities: In a strong hierarchy, everyone who skips the ranks will *always* be considered a weasel (like people who cut in line are despised in daily life), and so when a western samurai-slayer becomes best friends and strategic guide of the leader, none of the conservative samurai protest? Really..This movie also bugs me a bit like The Beach did; a movie set in a multicultural scenario - where the good-looking American is the center of every foreigner's attention - and after a while, admiration - surviving everything and getting accepted and respected by everyone. Yay. :)Again: I don't hate the movie! But it was obviously a gem that fell into the wrong hands: A good story to begin with, good performances by Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto), Koyuki (Taka, the widow) and also the people setting up the historical surroundings and costumes. However; horrible, horrible work by the director and probably also producers, for forcing hollywoodian improbabilities on it.. because of that, this movie; a heavy, prestige-filled, atmospheric story, didn't stand lasting >140 minutes.Anyway, I really love movies with a good atmosphere, and there is after all more of that than there is Hollywood stupidity, so I'm going to have to have to give this 7/10.",The Last Samurai

But a huge guilty pleasure.,7,5 July 2019,"Synopsis: Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is an American military officer hired by the Emperor of Japan to train the country's first army in the art of modern warfare.

261,swipht1,The Last Samurai,10,30 November 2003,"The Last Samurai**** out ****Starring Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, Hiroyuki Sanada. Directed by Edward Zwick.I always thought this movie looked great. When I first saw the trailer, I thought to myself, ""I have to see this movie"". I saw a sneak preview last night, and I have to say, it completely blew me away.The drama of this movie was more than I could handle. The way the samurai fought, the way they would never give up until the very death, and the way they loved life. This movie amazed me from start to finish. It starts off a little slow, but this allows you to see the development of Tom Cruise's and Ken Watanabe's characters.The action sequences were very well done. Since there was little CGI involved in this picture, it gave you a very real feel to the battles. They were very gritty, brutal scenes. It really hit you hard when the samurai were being shot with those weapons.In closing, The Last Samurai should be an Oscar contender for next year, and I will remember it as one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.",The Last Samurai
262,Horror-88,Beauty beyond words,10,29 October 2016,"""The perfect blossom is a rare thing. You can spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life.""Honestly, this is my favourite movie. Funny, because 'War' is one of my least favourite genres. But this movie is what I think is perfection. I admire Japanese culture, which probably helped, but this just had something special about it. And I can't finish watching it without tears welling up in my eyes (I think this is the only movie I've ever cried whilst watching). It's sad, it's heartbreaking, and it's very much how the world has been. There are many things that can be learnt from this movie. Ultimately, the movie comes down to people defending something they love and hold dearly, and dying for that and a precious and forgotten code of values - Bushido. It's amazing how the movie takes you down the exact path of Algren (Tom Cruise) - at first you view the Samurai as evil and you're sure you can't forgive them for what they did in that first battle scene, but as you see more and learn more, you begin to love the very thing you thought you'd always hate. Despite other movies being similar (namely 'Defiance'), they just don't hold the same beauty and intricacies of 'The Last Samurai'.If you're looking for something to make you cry, try this. Even if you aren't, watch it anyway. Wouldn't recommend anything more highly.",The Last Samurai

264,tjcclarke,The sword is mightier than the gun (but not the howitzer),7,13 February 2004,"It is always refreshing to see a film that eschews the standard American chest-beating patriotism. The Last Samurai certainly has all the hallmarks of a Hollywood epic: slick production, blood splattering battle scenes and a hefty dose of schmaltz, but its over-riding message is that the West in its bullish over-exuberance, has habitually steam-rollered ancient indigenous cultures in its relentless pursuit of progress.Obviously, this is not a new cinematic idea: a small bunch of stubborn warriors up against vast armies in the defence of some abstract ideal. Mel Gibson gave those nasty Englishmen a good battering in Braveheart (FREEDOM!!!), Asterix and Obelix gave the Romans a pasting on a regular basis - people just love an underdog. Luckily, the soldiers they are up against are generally really crap at fighting, so the little guy often prevails.In The Last Samurai, Tom Cruise is Captain Nathan Algren, a veteran soldier, disenfranchised with American battle strategy after years of bloody conflict with the American Indians. After hitting the bottle in a big way, he is persuaded to help train raw Japanese recruits in modern battle techniques as part of a trade agreement between the two countries. The Japanese authorities hold sway over the young teenage Emperor and are worried about a rebellion led by the legendary Samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanbe).It is soon clear that the men in Algren's charge are hopelessly inexperienced conscripts who cannot even fire a rifle straight. But the Japanese and American authorities led by the unscrupulous Colonel Bagley (Algren's former superior) are determined to crush the rebellion early. Even with guns, the army are no match for the deadly Samurai, and in the ensuing massacre, Algren is captured and taken to Katsumoto's village.During his captivity, Algren discovers that his hosts are far from savages. They are disciplined, honourable warriors who live to defend the Samurai way of life. He stays with Katsumoto's sister, Taka, and her two small children. Even though he had killed Taka's husband in the battle, he is made welcome. Over the following months he immerses himself in the culture, learning the fighting technique and brushing up on his Japanese.Eventually, he is returned to Tokyo, but when Katsumoto is banished from the Emperor's council and effectively exiled, Algren's patience with the authorities finally runs out and he rejoins the Samurai.Algren's running conflict with Bagley is a key part of his decision. To him Bagley represents everything bad about American history and Western short-sightedness. It was Bagley had ordered the cold-blooded killings of Indian women and children that haunted Algren's dreams. Through Bagley, the Americans are portrayed as self-important bullies greedy for power - it is a skewed vision of the American dream - Algren views General Custer as a 'murderer who fell in love with his own legend and his troops died for it.' In a nice twist, it is this animosity that leads him to side with Katsumoto as the Samurai face their own Last Stand against the newly tooled-up Japanese.Cruise is on good form. His transformation from embittered alcoholic to sword-wielding Samurai general is well handled and not too hammy. He has always done a nice line in tortured heroes searching for inner-strength, and in that respect this is the perfect vehicle for him. He is, however, acted off the screen by Ken Watanbe who is immense and totally believable as the rebel leader torn between loyalty to his Emperor and protecting his people's traditions.As epics go, The Last Samurai is admirably unassuming - it is a simple story that is well told. The ending is overblown and far too long and Algren's love interest with Taka seems to have been shoe-horned in to appease the studios, but it is certainly worth a watch.7/10",The Last Samurai
265,owen_twistfield,"Nice scenery, but oh my god....",5,15 July 2004,"Tom cruise acts the part of an ex-army US captain, hero from the civil war, gone drunk. He bouts on what is painful obvious cold tea and swaggers about most unbelievable. Probably never been drunk in his live!Tom, being American is an amazing guy. First he looks down on the primitive ways of the Japanese. But after being captured by the Samurai he is redeemed, of course, when confronted by the blatantly positive painted picture of the Japanese samurai culture. No dark shades here. In a few months he learns a good word Japanese and to fight on par with the best of the samurai (who took probably most of their live to get to that level). To keep the cost down they have one bad guy in the movie, called Omura, who presents the new (and of course abject ways). He seems to be solely responsible for all that is bad and none can oppose him, as he controls the emperor, runs the railways, issues the laws and at the end commands the Japanese force opposing Cruise and friends. Quite busy little man that one, and what twisted picture of Japanese history. Finally the movie closes with a version of the charge of the light brigade or is this a Kagamusha remake? Cavalry charges Gatling guns and howitzers with the predictable results. But what an amount of lead does it take to down cruise. I think he must have received his bodyweight in bullets. Summary: bad performance for Cruise, unbelievable story and characters, bad fighting scenes. Combine this with bad graphics: look at the beginning when the ship puts in: Yokohama is computer generated and so is the army in later scenes) and bad music (strings used in the dramatic scenes!Argg).",The Last Samurai
266,rsa5387,This Is Bushido,9,17 August 2008,"One of my favorite movies ever. Its this generations Dancing With Wolves, with a career highlight performance by Tom Cruise, and a heartbreaking story that shows how the majority of today's nations have forgotten their culture in the process of adhering to industrialization and mass commercialism. Among the films trump cards is the absolutely beautiful score by Hans Zimmer. It reaches its emotional crescendos at the right moments and manages to uplift the films climax a few notches. The cinematography, set design, and amount of research that has gone into the film should also be applauded. The scene's at Katsumoto's village are the best of the picture, amply supported by the organic feel and stunning camera-work of its surroundings. The film's more quiet, poetic moments with Cruise's Soliloquy's are also brilliant. Lastly, Ken Wantanabe is excellent as Kasumoto and nearly overshadows Tom Cruise in a number of scenes they have together. Timothy Spall is noteworthy, as usual, in a supporting role. All in all, this is a wonderful film that I can recommend to anybody.",The Last Samurai

269,lannaheim,Surprisingly good,10,7 October 2007,"I really had no expectations when I got this movie on DVD. Now I am sorry I didn't get to see it on the big screen. Beautiful cinematography, excellent acting, powerful message. And not over-blown in the sense of pounding the viewer on the head with the message (although, in truth, that could have been ratcheted down a bit: we GOT it! Kind of like ""Hotel Rwanda"" or ""Last King of Scotland"" -- yes, there are terrible things which have happened...ow, stop hitting me on the head, you're already doing fine getting your message across). What is so great about ""The Last Samurai"" is that it discusses a code of honor which is a way of life even today, not just a hundred years ago.One must be careful not to confuse the real-life actors with their on-screen work. (I was very impressed by Cruise in ""Vanilla Sky"" and yet lately he has become something of a caricature (this I only know from gleaning popular culture via the mainstream, since I don't watch TV or read the papers). Perhaps he has become somewhat like the character he plays in ""Magnolia,"" a fervent zealot.)) I admit I was prepared to watch another movie instead. Much to my surprise, the film was engaging immediately, and everything subsequent in the story / film was powerful, intelligent, and brilliantly done. The Japanese actors were integral to this. More to the point, the WRITING was key. This was a terrific story, using history and making it into something both visually stunning and ethics-oriented. The Japanese seemed thrilled that their cultural ideals were being touted. (Based on interviews at Japanese premiere.) Also, this film must have cost a fortune to make; all the backdrops were painstakingly accurate. ""The Way of the Warrior"" or Bushido is given an impressive stance. I seldom think a film is a 10, but this was definitely worthwhile viewing.",The Last Samurai

That is why I did not have many high expectations for this movie, as I usually do not have for any. I had many doubts about it, especially with Tom Cruise playing a samurai...come on now. I had a feeling it was going to be good, but not this OUTSTANDING. It was the most powerful movie I have seen in 2003 and in a long time. The direction, music, and acting were awesome. It puts you in the world of the Samurai and Feudal Japan, especially with the accompaniment of Hans Zimmer's BEAUTIFUL score. You know a movie is good when the music keeps playing in your head and the images from it keep flashing back. I have no idea how it could have gotten a 7.9 average from the reviews when it should be up in the top 50. I noticed that the lower grades are from people who mostly hate Cruise, which is pathetic. This movie deserved the Best Picture Oscar, and I have no idea how it was not even nominated. Seabiscuit?? Come on!People actually clapped at the end of the movie, and that is a rarity. Everything about this movie was amazing, and each scene worth-watching. If you like Braveheart and Dances With Wolves, you will surely enjoy this. This definitely deserves an A in my book. If you have better feelings about the movie after reading this, I advise you to get the DVD and watch it over and over.

271,arahman,A classic,8,15 February 2007,"Tom Cruise's career no longer focuses on mind less action movies where the plot revolves around his cheesy grin. Whilst these movies have a place in film action history and have catapulted Cruise to the upper echelons of the Hollywood 'A' list it is safe to say that he now undertakes more complex and varied roles and is also more involved in the production of his films. Hence, one does not know what to expect from him in a historical action epic like the Last Samurai, Cruise can no longer be typecast. The Last Samurai documents the last days of the Samurai in the late 19th century and the simultaneous embracing of Western modernity by Japan. The Samurai are warriors sworn to serve their emperor to the death and whose lives are governed by a strict code of discipline, honour and dedication to their role in society. When Japan develops an arms and trade agreement with the USA the Samurai are the only ones who stand between modernism and the ancient way of life. Nathan Algren (Cruise), a tormented war hero is chosen to lead Japanese forces into battle against the Samurai but once taken prisoner embraces their way of life. The Last Samurai is a visually magnificent movie with fluid battle choreography, stunning landscapes and a detailed recreation of 19th century Japanese architecture and locations. The acting is excellent across the board with Cruise and Wantanbe (Katsumoto) delivering particularly memorable and moving performances. The action sequences are captivating, the dialogue engrossing, the story emotive and the love story whilst understated is so well executed that the movie could be billed as part of the Romance genre. Koyuki (Taka) delivers a brilliant performance as the widow who gradually changes from despising Cruise to caring for him. Whilst she has limited dialogue in the movie her expressions speak a thousand words. Special mention must also be given to Hans Zimmer's score which could actually be the most powerful score that I have ever heard in a film. High octane tracks such as 'Red Warrior' successfully get the heart racing during the film's action sequences whilst more emotive tracks such as ' A small Measure of Peace' seem to be penetrate through to the listeners soul and fit the atmosphere of the movie beautifully. Zimmer has truly out done himself this time and I fear that he will be unable to surpass this achievement. Excellent direction, strong acting performances, visual splendour, engrossing action, emotional depth and a truly beautiful soundtrack combine to deliver a deeply enjoyable and memorable movie experience. Seldom is a movie able to deliver on so many levels and in doing so The Last Samurai should be categorised as a classic in the movie history hall of fame.",The Last Samurai
272,tughan_a,Extraordinary,10,5 October 2017,"This movie is such a movie that you could notice another detail every other time you watch it. The plot has been set so elegantly, set aside the historical discrepancies, i believe it shows a better front and side of Japanese culture and people which are sacred for many Japanese. Please make no mistake, this is not a classical Hollywood heck&slash action movie and there is no popular triumph scene and cliché in the end for you... Everything falls into place brilliantly and every actor/actress in this movie did a great job from top to bottom in my opinion, surprisingly Tom Cruise included, i think this movie is one of the movies he played his part best. The ambiance of the movie is so wonderful, authentic, and historical,the music by Hans Zimmer is so exquisite i think one of the best movie music has ever been created that represents the environment and emotional level of the film. So many detail levels this film has, it just inspires and appeal to your intellect with grace and cool satisfaction. Legend, bravery, romance, dignity, and profound comprehension at their best.

273,LemonLadyR,"Nothing Original, Wooden Cruise",4,11 November 2017,"It's a good thing that Lawrence of Arabia and Dances with Wolves ('Lawrence of the plains') had already been done, else the writers would not have had a ready made script for this movie. And thus there is little that is original here. This too is a ""white savior movie"", with Cruise the savior. But Cruise is just terrible in this movie. He is a one note actor and relies on a few expressions and drama school techniques which all great actors rise above and develop into their own styles, but Cruise never has elevated himself to. He lacks sensitivity and what makes women (and men) fall in love with an actor, so that, in the end, he has no depth, no charisma, no power, and this role demands quiet power. And now, in the 21st century, all I see when I look at him is what he has become, a rabid cult leader (Scientology).The rest of the cast save this movie from a 1-star debacle. Superb ensemble. Ken Watanabe is a powerful treasure. His amazing transformation from this role to his delicate performance in Memoirs of a Geisha shows an amazing range. I think he is why Cruise's deficits are so apparent here. And I would watch Timothy Spall in anything. He may be a poor man's Philip Seymour Hoffman, but for me, he is all his own. It is hard to imagine this is the same actor who played a rock band's lovable road manager in Rock Star, but he finely crafts each role.While I am no fan of white savior movies, I don't mind the implied white apology of some of them. And we Americans do have some apologizing to do, for our extreme hubris and various crimes against humanity. Too bad we can't just get up and say it out loud, apologize, and get it over with, without the racial overtones of movies like this (oh my, the natives/foreigners are really nice and even *funny*, wow!). But until then, our conscience is played out in movies like this. Although hopefully, with less pathos and white dominance than The Last Samurai. Will we ever 'get' it?",The Last Samurai
274,Ray H.,"I (Japanese) love this film, though some scenes seem strange.",10,5 August 2009,"I, as a Japanese born and raised in Japan, and living in Tokyo, have seen on TV and at theaters countless period dramas of samurais for more than fifty years. They all were written and made by Japanese, and their historical descriptions were more precise, real and convincing. Some of them were impressive and unforgettable. The film ""Shichinin no samurai (Seven Samurais)"" (1954) was a typical and the most eminent example.However, I love this film, really enjoyed it and have repeatedly viewed it. The biggest reason must be: This is a story of Japanese, who tried to keep Japanese own spirits and philosophy at the time of the Meiji Restoration in the mid 19th Century (dynasty change from the Shogun Government back to the Emperor), and a story of an American who tried to understand them. The last speech made by the Emperor in the film represents the thoughts and feelings which must have been unchanged during these 150 years for Japanese, who have lived, traveled or worked in other countries than Japan.Tom Cruise was great. His acting in this film was one of his best performances. He well expresses the agony at the beginning, the gradual changes into being healed in a beautiful Japanese village and the resolution to take sides with samurais. The last scene where he pleads with the Emperor to understand the spirit of samurais is really impressive and touching.Another important factor of the great success is Hans Zimmer's music. He has been one of my most favorite composers, but this sound track is ""music in the heaven"" for me. I have listened to it every day, at the time of commuting, more than a hundred times, but never been tired of it.You must see this!",The Last Samurai

276,marzolian,"Very well done, enjoyable despite echoing scenes and characters from other films",8,24 January 2004,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's one of Tom Cruise's best, my favorite since Magnolia and Rainman. Its original setting (for us in the USA, that is) makes me wonder more about the history of Japan, and how it changed from a rural to a modern industrial society.I didn't quite get lost in it, hoping that it wouldn't end as I have done while seeing other epic films. At times, the story strains at my willingness to suspend my disbelief, but each time it backed off just before it ""jumped the shark"". I'm very curious to learn what Japanese audiences will think of it and several unrealistic scenes.The actors complement each other and there are very few scenes where the camera lingers too long on them. Most of the time, I want to see and hear more from these characters.But so many parts of it reminded me of other films, books, even TV shows. Can you say ""derivative""? Maybe I'm just confused because I'm getting older but here's how I remember the story:(a few spoilers ahead)Our hero Lt. John Dunbar (""Dances with Wolves"") / Capt. Nathan Algren goes west, accompanied by an irreverent companion who doesn't last long enough in the film. Rhett Butler (""Gone With the Wind"") / Algren plans to get rich as a mercenary in the Civil War, paid by modern-thinking Japanese business interests (""Rising Sun""), to fight Indians / Japanese rebels. During a battle, Inman (""Cold Mountain"") / Algren suffers multiple injuries that should have killed him, but keeps on going through the winter snow and is eventually nursed back to health by a woman.As Blackthorne (""Shogun"") / Anjin-san (""Shogun"") / Algren recovers, he is held prisoner in a house with a Japanese family who thinks that he is a stinking unmannered barbarian. But Jack Elliot (""Mr. Baseball"") / Algren learns to appreciate Japanese culture, as he wisecracks about guys in dresses (""Tootsie""). Then Danny Larusso (""Karate Kid"") / Algren learns Asian fighting techniques and becomes an adviser to the honorable Indian / Samurai leader in a civil war in Japan, while having flashbacks to his Vietnam / Indian fighting days when he killed civilians (""Blue Thunder"") alongside the arrogant Gen. Custer (""Little Big Man""). He fights against black-suited Ninjas (Tekken, the martial arts video game, and ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"").Finally, in the climactic battle, William Wallace (""Braveheart"") / Algren helps lead the Indians / Scottish / Samurai into battle against the U.S. Cavalry / English / Japanese army, against impossible odds, arrows raining down upon the bad guys. (""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Braveheart"" again, probably a few dozen guys in costume and the rest added using computer effects.)Other viewers can probably pick out even more films that ""echo"" or reverberate in this one. There is even an allusion to a movie that should be made one day; about the military advisers who are supposed to be non-combatants, sent by the USA to Vietnam and other locations around the world to put down the rebels.Even while distracted by all these other movies, I really did enjoy the film, and I look forward to watching it again in a few years.Steven",The Last Samurai
277,kwongers,one of the most moving movies of 2003,10,19 January 2004,"I love this movie.  It's a brilliant, well-made, moving epic.  The movie focuses on a disgraced man, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), who has nightmares about being ordered to kill innocent American Indians.  He is enlisted to help train the `modern' Japanese army to fight against the samurai, who are in rebellion.  In the time he spends with the samurai, learning from them, he learns something about honor and ultimately, about himself. 
The storyline is fantastic, merging great action scenes with a moving story about a man's journey to find his honor.  The battle scenes are convincing and exciting; one battle scene involving a surprise attack on the samurai had my heart going.  Hans Zimmer's music is bold and original; sometimes the music alone brought me to tears.  I haven't heard too much of his work before (it's a travesty, I know!) but I love his work here. 
The acting is top-rate.  Tom Cruise is superb as Nathan Algren, embodying the conflict, pain, anguish, and honor of his character.  We feel his pain and understand why he eventually decides to fight with the samurai.  (His performance is one of my favorites all yearhe's a deserving contender for that Golden Globe.)  And Ken Watanabe is phenomenal as Katsumoto, the leader of the samurai.  He plays Katsumoto with a lot of grace and nobility, and I appreciated that.  Watanabe is nominated for a supporting actor Golden Globe and SAG award and he totally deserves both of them.  His portrayal of Katsumoto is bold, funny, and heartbreaking.   Undeniably one of my favorite movies of the year and the one that touched my heart the most, `The Last Samurai' deserves many, many awards.  It made me laugh, cry (a lot), and truly understand honor.  (Props also to Tom Cruise and Koyuki (Taka) for creating one of the sexiest moments in the movies this year - without the actual sex.)  10/10",The Last Samurai
278,Ironboundfw,Everything everyone says it is... BUT...,4,4 December 2003,"The Last Samurai is everything everyone says it is. Exhilarating, poetic, beautiful to look at, it is like a painting in a canvas, that you look at and wonder at the technique of the artists.  The problem is that I never stopped looking at the technique, I never got involved in the story.  I was not swept away by the directing, rather, forced along...  I really can't put my finger on why it was that I didn't love this movie. Although I did love the battle sequences OH BOY!I am a fan of Tom Cruise, have always been, but I just didn't quite buy him in this role.  He was servicable, he was fine, but he was not the actor for the job.  I kept thinking about the wonderful things Russell Crowe could have done with this role.  And that's when it hit me.  I have seen this movie so many times over the last couple of years.  BRAVEHEART, GLADIATOR, CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, This movie follows a formula which I like to call, the ""Let's go for a best picture nomination FORMULA""...I do think it's one of the top ten movies of the year. Simply because of the way it portrays it's Japanese characters.  Still --- when it's all said and done.  I walked out of the film feeling a little cheated by the experience.

279,dballred,Check Your History at the Door and Enjoy!,7,19 December 2003,"Overall, I liked the Last Samurai--as a story. As a representative piece of Japanese history, though, I'm sure there are plenty of purists out there holding their noses.Hollywood has this real penchant for producing historical figures who are uncharacteristically 21st Century Politically Correct for whatever era they live in. Tom Cruise is no exception in this film. He, with conventional wisdom no older than forty years, had no respect for Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer or his tactics. A genuine military contemporary of Custer, however, would realize he was the youngest US officer to reach the grade of Brigadier General during the Civil War. He didn't reach that rank for having a good filing system.What about the premise of the film? Tom Cruise, a has-been hero from the wild west, is hired to help develop Japan's new modern Army. How does being an individually brave person who can handle a weapon and ride like a trick shot artists translate into being an organizer and trainer of an entire army? Had such a person demonstrated all those skills in military service, he would have been promoted like Custer was.Beyond that, it's hard to believe his purpose for being in Japan: building the Army. The film seems to imply it is for fighting an internal rebellion. Sure, there have been people like Katsumoto in the film known to operate briefly even in modern times (Noted author Yukio Mishima, who committed seppuku about 35 years ago, is a recent example of such a person). Nonetheless, they haven't been a serious threat to Japan's order since the early shoguns a couple of hundred years prior to the Meiji era. Japan developed a modern army, all right, but the purpose was external--there were issues with the Chinese and the Russians. I think the intent here was to turn the tables for the character in the film. He went from fighting on the side with the guns against the side with the bows and arrows to the opposite situation. In that respect, the film succeeds. The characters had depth and the story was fascinating. Unlike many American films with Japanese themes, I would have no problem recommending this film to a Japanese--provided he doesn't take history too seriously. I gave the film a seven.",The Last Samurai
280,garboventures,Good in Parts - Dull and Predictable Finale,6,16 October 2005,"The Last Samurai was much better than I had expected. It was never a film I looked forward to with keen anticipation and I waited until it was on satellite TV before bothering to watch it. This I now see was probably a mistake as the film's panoramic drama would have been more effective viewed on a big screen.Perhaps my small-screen mode of viewing affected my response to this film? Frankly the grand battle-scene finale left me cold, while the more intimate section of the film which detailed Algren's assimilation into Samurai society was much more appealing. I felt sad to see Algren leave his mountain hide-out because I realised that this part of the film was now over - after this I was less interested. Tom Cruise as Algren was OK - still so very much Tom Cruise of course, but then mega-buck uberstars always tend to play themselves; that's Hollywood I guess. Ken Watanabe put in a strong performance - perhaps a little over-hyped - and I enjoyed Higen's characterisation. Scenery was splendid - partly shot in New Zealand, which is always a winner. And the photography was spot-on - although the 'direction' was a little stale at times, even plodding.Obviously there has been some controversy over the portrayal of Japan and Japanese culture - I think this is understandable, and debate is healthy. There is a perpetual instinct for Hollywood to view the world from a US-centric position which in today's globalised world and with the constant threat of US Cultural Imperialism is not especially useful or necessary. However, Hollywood is making films for a primarily US audience - even though worldwide box office and DVD sales are vital economic components. Therefore having an American hero and 'experiencing' with this character what is to him, and to us (assuming most viewers around the world in the 21st century are not tuned into the ancient rules of Bushido) a wholly alien and yet fascinating and wonderful culture is not in itself patronising. Accuracies, misportrayals are a different story, but frankly I don't have the knowledge-base to challenge these - hopefully then this film can inform greater understanding, if only through the subsequent debate.As a piece of entertainment, The Last Samurai has plentiful action and some pleasing moments - I have given it 6 out of 10 only because the draconian Amazon rating system won't allow me to submit a 6.5 which is where I would properly rate it!",The Last Samurai
281,jonnyss,"engaging, poignant, and elegant.",10,3 January 2004,"i found the last samurai engaging, poignant, and elegant. further i loved the way the director pays tribute to classic japanese samurai films. there are, for example, multiple allusions to inozaki's ""chushingura,"" perhaps the greatest of samurai epics: the hero and his son fight together, a warrior is unsuccessfully trying to finish his poem before the last battle, the common folk bow to the samurai at the end. much much better than the trailer and the reviews led me to expect.take just one detail: compare two archers in battle: katsumoto's son and legolas of rotk. no contest for me; katsumoto's son is the more athletic, the more heroic, and even the gentler.",The Last Samurai
282,dennisyoon,Last Samurai? Get Real. I Don't believe the hype.,5,25 December 2004,"It's a decent action flick. The fights are entertaining. Cruise is decent with a bokken but I doubt the good Captain could match a real lifelong practitioner after one season of training. The male bonding is familiar and Watanabe is interesting mostly for his deep voice and macho posturing. The line about spending a whole life looking for the perfect blossom is rubbish--useless words for a Samurai. The Japanese Emperor would not consider an American as one of his subjects back then, either. Yeah, it seems even American white people are tired of the self hating American white guy going native story. Maybe not, though, according to the many favorable reviews. It's hard to justify a fantasy by grounding it in historical reality-- Too many things to nit pick about. They should also avoid pompous statements like Last Samurai if they are trying to be serious. I don't think they were trying to be serious, though. I think they were trying to make a blockbuster movie that people liked, so good for them. I must admit I was biased when I heard the title and then there was a picture of Tom Cruise in Samurai Armor. I was like,""Please, don't go there."" As for all the acclaim, all I can say is Cruise must have some type of mojo. More Power to him. Well, I liked the culmination of the battle near the end. It was like you killed a part of your self and your ancestry and you lost something for it. The resolution of it all is confounding and and contrary to history. Why engage in a war to modernize and then refuse the thing over one Samurai and his sidekick American renegade? History shows the opposite occurred as well. Oh wait, it's a movie...and of course the ugly, greedy guy has to get it in the end. Not Bad. At least it's not Black Rain. Check out ""Yakuza"" with Robert Mitchum. It goes way deeper into Samurai Spirt than this one. That movie deserves all the acclaim this one got and more. Done with a whole lot more believability, craftsmanship and sincerity. Enough said.

285,DarkLugia1969,Tom Cruise And Ken Watanabe Did An Excellent Job!!!,9,5 January 2004,"Note:  This comment may contains spoilers so you have been warned.
Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe did an excellent job in this great film.  Tom Cruise plays a former civil war veteran who was forced to kill innocent women and children native americans causing him to be an alcohol despot.  He gets an opportunity from one of his old civil war friend to train the japanese army against the samurais who were against the emperor working with the Westerns.  During the movie, Cruise is defeated and brought in as a prisoner of war against Watanabe.  Mr. Watanabe studies his enemy per se. Cruise finds himself and then turns against the Japanese army by joining the samurais.  Overall, this movie was simply excellent in two ways:  first that the guilt of individuals rises to the occasion and secondly and most important the honor of the Last Samurai during his life and later his death of not having others take control of the Japanese nation during the 19th century.The Dark Gengar gives this excellent movie from one Gengar to ten Gengars: Nine Gengars  Enjoy the movies one and all!!!",The Last Samurai
286,tipplerunkus,Dances with Samurai,7,11 December 2003,"Few films in recent memory have inspired as much ambivalence from me as Edward Zwick's action epic `The Last Samurai'. Zwick has made his best film since 1989's `Glory', a truly gripping and visually stunning effort. But `The Last Samurai' is frequently undermined by it's extreme similarity to Kevin Costner's `Dances with Wolves'. In fact, the mid-section of `Samurai' could be considered a virtual remake. Admittedly, I am perhaps overly sensitive to this - `Dances with Wolves' is one of the films that most influenced my views on film, and will therefore always stand out in my mind. But to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of Costner's film,. the similarities will be distracting (the decision to have the Tom Cruise character actually keep a journal which is used as the films voice over narration ranks among the worst ideas in movie history).The third act of `The Last Samurai' corrects that problem. While at this point the film actually shifts into something more akin to Mel Gibson's `Braveheart', it is far less blatantly so, and at this point Zwick's movie takes off and assumes a life of it's own, with dazzling action scenes and strong performances from Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe. In fact, the film plays so well at this point that it's tempting to completely overlook it's earlier missteps, which speaks very highly of Zwick's abilities as a director (as well as the abilities of two-timeOscar winning cinematographer John Toll. who will probably win his third statue for this one)..Other than it's derivative nature, the biggest flaw to `The Last Samurai' is that it never clearly demonstrates what exactly the samurai are fighting against. Whether or not you agree with `Dances with Wolves' take on western expansion, you have to admit that IN THE FILM, the Sioux are clearing being mistreated, and their plight is made clear. In `Samurai', we are told that the Japanese Emperor is listening to advisor who `act in their own interests', and that a proposed treaty between Japan and America is `not in the best interest of the Japanese people.' And yet, we never really see or hear exactly why this is true. In the end, `The Last Samurai' is really a dressed-up action movie, and as such, it's one of the best we've had all year.  If you are able to get past the `been there, done that' feel of the mid-section, there is much to enjoy, and despite my reservations I give the film a strong recommendation.",The Last Samurai
287,gwydno,"A good movie, especially because I didn't really expect great things",7,29 June 2005,"I had really not great expectations when I saw this movie. I was just waiting to see another Hollywood smoothed show about exotic cultures, without any real compromise, historic accuracy or deep characters -especially when it was Tom Cruise who appeared as main character. I was gratefully surprised when I saw the story showed the least due respect to History, and towards the social and personal conflicts it depicts. Whether it is arguable that the Samurai philosophy is worth defending it, as a war-based style of living, anchored in a dark past disguised in tradition, the plot focus on the positive aspects that were perceived as endangered along the modernization of Japan. Of course, there is room for Western ""endophobia"", since the bad guy is a Japanese Judas eager to earn money western-style, and as I explained before, it seems that the only way to express Honor and the quest for perfection is a fascist or maoist-like, isolated society. Yet the movie is fair enough to watch at it a second or even a third time. It is entertaining and well made, and it is easy to sympathize with the ideals of the Samurais.",The Last Samurai
288,slappytheclown,This is it,10,9 December 2003,"This movie absolutely blew me away.  A fine, sweeping, emotional story of redemption and sacrifice.  Great acting, powerful story telling and beautiful scenery. It does tend to drag on a bit toward the end, but any problems are easily overlooked by the overall greatness of the movie.  I highly recommend this.",The Last Samurai
289,michaelgrantham,"Brilliant, Powerful Epic",9,28 August 2004,"Having read the critic's reviews of this film, which panned it, as I recall, I found the DVD of this film at my brother-in-law's house while my wife and I were staying there.  I watched it with my 23 year old son (I'm 53).  What a film!  What superb performances!  Tom cruise was excellent as was Ken Watanabe.SPOILERS AHEADThe film tells the story of a US Cavalry officer haunted by the demons of the native Americans he killed while under orders from his superiors.  He is descending into drink when he is recruited to advise the Japanese on how to defeat some renegade Samurai warriors who are rebelling against the emperor. He is captured by them and finds as he lives with them, that he begins to like and respect their code of morals and their way of life. He begins to find peace in their way of life. In the end, he ends up fighting with them against his own people and the westernised Japanese army.The only thing that spoiled the film very slightly for me was the final battle, where the Samurai place their lines apparently just out of reach of the American field guns, but, with a small change of elevation, the guns reach them easily.  As an experienced cavalry officer, Cruise's character would have been well aware of the range of the guns and would have stayed back out of range.The final battle, where the samurai ride directly into concentrated gatling gun fire was again nonsense, as, again, Cruise's character would have known better.Those criticisms aside (which prevented me giving the film a 10) were still small.  The film is a grand epic: Beautiful, involving, haunting and extremely well filmed and played.  I would rate it as one of my all time great films.9/10 from me!",The Last Samurai
290,pensive_englishman,Well done Brother Tom for this yet another great piece.,10,5 June 2020,"Glad to find out another great movie like this tonight which lives up to the expectations and deserves this rating. Four Oscar nominations - can you believe that?Being shot a year earlier (2003) I somehow feel this is the oriental version of Troy (2004). Politics and war, history and culture, love and hate are indeed the topics I enjoy finding from movies. Somehow and sometimes I wonder if I should have been a historian or anthropologist rather than a boring accountant.
The story takes place in the backdrop of a recent Japan in transition from tradition to modernization. Obviously when there is change there is conflict. An American military advisor eventually builds bond and friendship with his once enemies he was hired to kill. What's more dramatic is that he and the wife of the man he killed have formed some kind of subtle affection towards each other. This really shows the boundaries between good and bad, friendship and enmity, love and hate are quite often blurred. What looks completely opposite may not be that far apart in essence. Soldiers kill each other just because they have their duties to carry out. Conflict of interest arises because we serve different masters. What happens as a consequence may not be our intention at all.
Samurai, known as warriors in English were a past thing and no longer serve our modern roles. And the spirit is somewhat obsolete in the modern era where large scale conflicts are largely avoided as we have managed to find middle ground and make compromises. Yet it somehow represents the ideology of ""live by the sword and die by the sword"" which can somehow be interpreted as having your own conviction and upholding your values. As a matter of fact we may be surprised 😮 to find out how many people still have their own faiths and beliefs to cling to. As a person who has my own convictions, rightfully or wrongly, I pay a great 👍 deal of respect to those who do the same, be it politicians, activists, religious practitioners or defense personnel.
Another inspiration from this show is that if you want to make a difference and push for a change you must fight and you must fight hard for it. The samurai fought for their identity to be kept at the sacrifice of their own lives. And that is what makes me a bit teary.
One of the reasons I think 🤔 it achieves such high accolades is that it presents a very eastern perspective from the eyes 👀 of westerners. County Japan, rice terraces, cherry blossoms, rice not potatoes, sake not whisky are all in stark contrast with western modernity in New York and San Francisco. While we enjoy every western convenience of modern technology such as iPhone and Facebook it is definitely a new cultural and visual experience to have a glimpse of oriental landscape and etiquette.
Koyuki is such a pretty asian actress who represents subtle eastern beauty compared with vibrant western charm. Having lived in Australia 🇦🇺 for almost two decades myself and getting used to vast western faces perhaps it is not a bad idea to have a bit of change. The international profile of the whole cast and crew is truly amazing 😉 I have to say. Obviously Tom Cruise 🚢 is undoubtedly the crown 👸 jewel 💎 of Hollywood who not only possesses unchallenged good look 👀 but also is blessed with tremendous acting gift. I can tell he has a genuine passion for acting and as a metaphorical samurai on the silver screen 📺 he lives by acting and will die by acting. Well done Brother Tom. I truly admire an A-lister like you. Whenever you are in the show I must watch it.",The Last Samurai
291,Stefanowich,"Tom Crui$$$e is Rambo, The Last Samurai without fear...",6,19 April 2004,"Pros. The Last Samurai is a nicely crafted motion picture with some truly stunning scenes, the assassin attempt come to mind as a stand out-moment. The scenery is nice as well as the photography.Cons. Fact: Tom Cruise never dies in a movie, thus efficiently removing every last bit of thrill with this ride. It's like wathing Rambo taking on the Soviets in Rambo III or the VC in Rambo, you just know there's no way he'll bite the dust. The Last Samurai without Tom, and without the (WARNING!!! SPOILER!!!) happy Hollywood-ending, would have been a superior movie. As it is now The Last Samurai is just another Days of Thunder where the wheels have been traded for horses, or a Cocktail with bamboo sticks and swords instead of bottles and drinks.

293,jack-964,Misunderstood Perfection,10,21 July 2008,"I bought this DVD a couple of years ago and really like the movie. Its one of my favorites and shows a Tom Cruise in a very different role, where he is magnificent. I had no intention of giving a review on this one, cause its not brand new and there are plenty of reviews. I did not read them all, but i read some of the 'hated it', cause i wondered why it didn't get such high votes as id like it to get and well, i have to say my thing:People complained that it is not totally historically correct and I'm sure it isn't. Never looked at it as if it was. People complained Americans are too ethnocentric, putting Tom Cruise, there in the spotlight and yes they are. But this movie is that ONE Hollywood movie that *tries* to depict another culture, without throwing bombs at it and making it totally bad. Thats exactly the reason i cherish it! It could not be done without giving the American viewers something to identify with. They aren't gonna watch some serious Japanese movie... get real. Surely there will be some flaws in it, so what? The main object is to lay down a nice story, a moralistic story, in another culture, learning how that culture differs from yours and try to accept it, even appreciate it up to the fact that you want to live there! And that is done superbly! Can not be done better! This is exactly the movie that addresses what we are losing today! Our identity, our own cultures, since everything has to become western, 'civilized' capitalism. It is GREAT in showing exactly that what we know is not always best. That NEW is NOT always better! Yes without advancement we would still be apes in trees, i admit, but advancement one way, is going backwards the other. Maybe we would be better off being still apes in trees! NEW is NOT always BETTERIn the DVD set there is also some explanation about Bushido and i think that is far better than what we have here. (the 'west') New isn't always better. Western philosophy died decades ago. Im not saying eastern philosophy is better, cause there is none. Philosophy comes from where the Greeks started, with logic and that is exclusively reserved for that. In the east the knowledge wasn't layed down by logic reasoning that could be followed and deducted by everyone. They were written as simple, one lined moral guidelines. With all our logic reasoning philosophy and societies following with great lag (POST MODERNISM is NOTHING), we will find that west meets east. Or, we would, if the western systems hadn't swallowed everything else. Thats is why this movie is a pearl in an ocean of Hollywood pretentious bogus and drama. Ever wondered why there are so many good movies, more and more, that are about people in our free and tolerant and social western societies that are going totally crazy? It is a mirror of society. We are euthanising ourselves collectively. That is why this captain drank. He had ghosts in his head from killing Indians for the west. A whole culture slaughtered. And he ended up in Japan and saw something else...Now, are you happy? And if not, to which country will you go? Aren't they all the same by now? Is that progression? It surely doesn't give you more freedom...Progression is a movement in a certain direction. We call it development because we think we control where we go and think it is better if we can do this or that. But moral is subjective! Read Nietzsche! THINK! If i walk backwards, i still progress, i still develop, but who is to say if it is better or not? Do i go forward or backward?New isn't always better and yes you may call it hypocrite that this movie could not have been made if we were still apes in trees, but then again, there would not be a need to make it.Do you think Star Trek is realistic? Thats child's stuff. It never widens the horizon on moralistic issues. Hardly any movie does that well, if at all, because it is extremely hard to comprehend, to feel deeply that all we ever made for ourselves is ultimately hell, without any way to escape. Yea who enters here, abandon all hope. No, we rather see lies, cut and dried good and bad. Its easier on the eyes. Sleep well my friends...Thats the main reason i will never let this great movie be put down by ignorant people.Apart from that, it is a great story, well casted, well acted, great shots, great action, good pace, good dialogs, truly a GREAT movie. A MASTERPIECE. As The Japanese leading actor would say: ""Perfect"". as he dies. As it was supposed to be. Perfect.And Tom Cruise stood there and wondered, on the brink of understanding it.

295,josephtheowl,Secularism and Traditionalism,9,13 December 2006,"I thought that the film was one of Tom Cruise's better projects. It didn't need a gazillion special effects (""Minority Report"") to bring the audience into a world that is so visually and culturally different but not unlike our own.One of the biggest issues the movie deals with relates to modern day politics. Who says the Western way of life is better than anybody else's? What right as a freedom-loving people do we have to usurp the freedom of others to live as they want, to pray as they want, to pursue their own dreams and raise their children as they see fit? Religious and secular bureaucracies have imposed their will over different peoples under the guise of White Man's Burden. The Inquisition. McCarthyism. The Final Solution. Segregation. These so-called Manifest Destinies have often employed less than scrupulous methods in the name of god, government, and ""bringing civility to the savages"". Though history need not wonder who truly is the savage.When a society begins to move toward modernization, often times it drifts little by little away from tradition, and not just religion or spirituality, but its roots. Knowing where we've come from, knowing our own cultural identity can help us understand where we're going as a united people and establish a balance between the past and present, secularism and tradition.",The Last Samurai
296,stedrazed,Meh.,6,15 December 2003,"I remember the first time I saw the trailer for this film, at a midnight screening of THE MATRIX RELOADED (which, I must admit was far more disappointing). I happily took in the beautiful Japanese landscapes and Samurai action in the beginning of the trailer, then became disappointed, and even mildly outraged, at the appearance of Tom Cruise onscreen. Seeing the film tonight was much the same experience. I found myself really enjoying the first act of the film, then my enthusiasm kind of dropped off steadily from there on in. I guess it was because I already knew from the trailer where this portion of the film was leading, so predictability was no complaint. The sequence in which Cruise remorsefully ponders his so-called heroism is honestly moving. Also, I really liked Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader. But the dialogue and denouement are too typically cliched and predictable, much like John Logan's most well-known screenplay, GLADIATOR, and the score is awful. The main problem with the film, though, is its triteness, trading heavy orchestral chords by Hans Zimmer for real emotional moments of magnitude, and nicely choreographed battle scenes for an original story. I mean, come on, this is basically just DANCES WITH WOLVES in Japan, complete with voice-over diary entries. Oh, and also not as good. Sure does look pretty though.",The Last Samurai
297,kbohna,Must see even in 2018,10,29 January 2018,I almost feel guilty making a review of this movie but I feel that one should be made after all this time. I had always kind of been a fan of Tom Cruise like many others and when I found out his religious Scientology background it kind of threw me off as I'm sure many of you felt the same way. I just wanted to tell the majority that this movie is more than Tom Cruise it's fabulous it has something that everyone wishes to achieve maybe it's Harmony I'm not sure but it definitely conveys a great message. With all the different things that are going on in our world it's nice to kind of go back to the beginning of simpler things.,The Last Samurai
298,Axel-9,"Powerful, emotionally moving with some brutal cracking action",8,24 January 2004,"The film starts in a standard Cruiser style, with Tom doing Tom and pretending to be drunk and acting a bit mad, but his performance improves all the way through, following the arc of his character as he becomes a changed honourable man. He is also helped by some cleverly done flashbacks, showing the war crimes his character Captain Nathan Algren has committed. This makes the pain he is feeling far more believable than his attempts at drunken rambling. Once in Japan he really catches fire as he starts to immerse himself in Japanese culture.It is at this point though that we meet the real star of the film, Ken Watanabe playing Samurai chief Katsumoto. He is the heart and soul of the movie, and it is an immensely powerful turn. I can't recall seeing Cruise take a back seat for so much of a film before, but he is put in the shade here. Watanabe is able to use simple facial expressions to take control of scenes and his dialogue is powerfully delivered. When the action comes he is more than up to the task, slashing at ninjas (in perhaps the movies best sequence) as they raid the samurai village and charging lines of rifle wielding troops. He fully conveys the values and coda of the samurai, and it is a performance worthy of awards recognition.The film itself moves from harsh battle scenes to gentle moments as characters are developed and friendships forged. The growing mutual admiration between Algren and the samurai is well portrayed. Edward Zwick's direction is at times cheesy, but for the most part it is powerful and gets a strong message across, something along the lines of preserving ancient cultures against the tide of growing consumerism, which is certainly relevant in today's climate. There is one piece of direction I particularly like, when Algren has defeated four opponents, Zwick cuts to Algren replaying it in his mind, shown from a new angle. This finishes with an enemy shown to be still standing as Algren finally finishes him.There is also some wonderful cinematography of the landscapes and of the epic final battle sequences, as 500 samurai take on the American guns and mortar rounds of the newly formed Japanese army. I thought these were incredibly moving moments, interspersed with some fairly brutal combat. It actually reminded me a bit of the Last of the Mohicans, but raised to another level.With strong supporting players, there's a decent turn from Timothy Spall as a British expert on Japanese culture as well as numerous Japanese actors filling out the samurai group, The Last Samurai is a very strong package, at times viscerally brutal and honourably emotional.

Had no great expectations (bought a previously viewed copy yesterday at video store for only five bucks) but friends who saw it in the movie theater had mentioned its powerful energy and vision.  Turned out to be a very enjoyable way to spend two and a half hours.  A near perfect spiritual journey of a damaged soul to enlightenment. Beautiful photography full of colorful and meaningful images. Well directed and paced by Edward Zwick. Tom Cruise should have been nominated by the Academy for Best Actor and was a great pick for his role.  Ken Watanabe truly deserved his Academy nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

His acting doesn't come across as a very believable cavalry soldier, who comes to revere his captors, (akin to a Patty Hearst syndrome, or the realization of who are the real heroes in a feudal war of commerce). When he dons the samurai gear for battle, it's almost laughable, (or pathetic). The real star of the film, is without a doubt, Ken Watanabe. Powerful, and a visual delight, as leader of the last samurais, he commands the screen in every scene. His Japanese compatriots and supporting cast are, also, extraordinarily attractive and accomplished. The cinematography is authentic and gorgeous. The costumes should have won an Oscar.

At the time Japan is going through the Meiji Restoration is at conflict from tradition versus modernization. You see the Samurai believe they are serving the Emperor by trying to stop this new way of life by standing by their Bushido. After Algren is captured by the Samurai he is transformed into a new man who believes in the Samurai and their ways. Nathan is at constant struggle with the memories of his role in the massacre of Wounded Knee where he got his title of war hero. Ken Watanabe is also great as Katsumoto the Samurai leader.

303,shinymc_shine,Another Civil War Hit For Zwick.,8,25 February 2004,"Edward Zwick's ""The Last Samurai"" is an epic, dramatic, war film set after the American Civil War in which a disillusioned soldier is hired to instruct modern warfare to the Japanese. The opening sequences perfectly and succinctly introduce Tom Cruise's character, the time and place the film is set and the violence that is to come. Co-screenwriter John Logan is certainly the flavour of the month, or should I say decade, with past credits that include Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"", Oliver Stone's ""Any Given Sunday"" and ""Star Trek: Nemesis"". Not to take away from Zwick's involvement who has created a beautiful, humouress and gentle film that is punctuated by moments of graphic brutality. Over the last couple of years we have been introduced to a new Tom Cruise. The pretty boy of the past who inundated us with arrogant, always heroic characters has been replaced with an older but wiser thespian who's not afraid to disfigure his globally known face. Here he plays an alcoholic, emotionally scarred, Civil War veteran. Not your usual Cruise role. He tried to change his image twice before. In 1989 he portrayed Vietnam War veteran/protester Ron Kovic in Oliver Stone's ""Born On The Fourth Of July' to much acclaim. Then in 1994 Anne Rice adapted her own novel for Neil Jordan's ""Interview With The Vampire"" in which Cruise starred as Lestat much to Rice's dismay. After viewing the movie Rice changed her mind and thoroughly endorsed their choice. Now with Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"", Cruise has made the leap from movie star to actor. His choices as an actor and producer are quite bold, challenging, even intellectual. He provides a stand out performance as a tortured man ruining his body, losing his will to live but with a never say die attitude on the battle field. This is a complex character and Cruise has obviously paid special attention to crafting a very real, compassionate and moralistic soldier. The other star of this film is Ken Watanabe. This is his first English language role and he commands attention with a quiet but powerful screen presence. He physically conveys the ideology of the Samurai to an audience that may be clueless as to what Samurai do or stand for. Along side Cruise he stands his own and in some cases steals the scenes they have together. Scottish comedian Billy Connolly appears in a supporting role as a fellow serviceman of Cruise's. There is something quite pleasing about seeing Connolly in a big budget Hollywood production. He always brings a smile to your face whenever he enters frame. After some strong performances in previous dramas, John Madden's ""Mrs Brown"" for example, you no longer let out a little giggle when you see Connolly's name up on the big screen. His laid back persona and loud, sometimes controversial stage performances serve him well as an actor. He fits his role perfectly. I only wish that he could've sticked around a little longer. Also in support is Mike Leigh regular Timothy Spall as an Englishman abroad who fell in love with the Japanese culture. Spall has always been a likeable actor with a natural flair for comedy. He's in some part the comic relief but also a Caucasian teacher of basic Japanese life for Cruise and the audience. Tony Goldwyn and William Atherton also appear. The special effects are certainly worth noting. It's getting tougher to figure out whether crowd scenes are real extras or computer simulated people. Unfortunately there is one shot that screams it's a blue screen effect. When Cruise is standing on the boat coming into port there is something extremely artificial or cartoonish about the background especially the sunlight shining over the horizon.This is not the first time that Zwick has tackled the subject of the American Civil War. ""Glory"" was a brilliant film about the first black regiment in which Denzel Washington won the Academy Award for best supporting actor. That film was a very tragic tale and one of the most horrific aspects was that they seemed to have no knowledge of strategy. So it comes as a surprise in this film when Cruise's character turns out to be a brilliant tactician. Majority of what he knows about tactics comes from Greek history. But with ""Glory"" in mind you have to ask yourself how intelligent or educated were the soldiers at that time. One film portrays them as unschooled in the art of war while the other has them as genius strategists. What is the truth of the matter?SPOILER ALERT! Some critics have complained about the conclusion of the film saying that it becomes too Hollywood, pandering to it's lead actor. Here's a hint. The film's called ""The Last Samurai"". It's star is Tom Cruise. What did you expect? It's all in the title.",The Last Samurai
304,fluffyclown,A flawed performance,7,14 May 2004,"The Last Samurai was a decent enough movie, but I don't think it lived up to the term ""epic.""  It had everything it needed; a time in history with endless possibilities, star power, gorgeous scenery, action filled battle scenes with exceptional stunt work, and even some romance.  But somehow the movie just fell short of being powerful enough to stir up any emotional response from me.  And I think I know why.I have always found the history of Japanese culture to be extremely fascinating.  The traditions, the religion, the framework of their social structure.  It's so different from any other society that it stands out with a unique richness and beauty.  If all the elements of this society were woven together, the tapestry created would be full of vivid color and breathtaking images.  It would be ""epic.""  The problem with the film is that one key element that was flawed.The story itself is simple enough.  An American soldier is hired to train a new army for Japan.  During a battle he is captured by the enemy.  During his stay he learns the way of the samurai, and eventually embraces it.  All the elements are there.  The problem was Tom Cruise.  His portrayal was so flat that I didn't care about his character or what happened to him.  I couldn't grasp the passion of the samurai, or at least the passion Cruise felt for the samurai, because it wasn't expressed.  So the film fell short. It was good, but it wasn't epic.

307,fundaquayman,tripe sashimi,3,28 February 2006,"take the ingredients of the Hollywood Western, displace it onto Asian shores, and focus it on a misfit who embodies the stereotype attributes: 1) faithless, 2) lacking in morals, & 3) reluctantly gets himself into a situation that calls for the wakening of conscience & the resurrection of his heroic ideals, now add the mythical attractions of the East from the P.O.V. of the West, and continue to enforce the believe that ""we're American, and even though there are lots of us--good and bad, we eventually will make your world a better place""...what do you get in result? a typical Hollywood treatment that caters not just to entertain the audience with a long stretch of some facts with fiction, but an indirect statement that can be inferred as glorification of values that once stood tall as pillars and foundations of the American spirit.Zwick probably did his research, and probably does have a lot of respect for the history, culture, and honors of the Japanese... but the film doesn't show it beyond the ""been there and done that"" plot-points we've seen in so many other films dealing with Americans in Asia (think BLACK RAIN)--""we love your sense of honor and loyalty, and your artwork and etiquette... but we have a better way--better yet, we can adopt your ways and do it better than you, and your women will end up liking us too!"" Tom Cruise hold no candle to the likes of Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada, but they are the support cast? wow, who came up with that formula? The Marketing guys thought hard about appeasing the Japanese audience with their revered thespians... but as a sidecast to Tom Cruise who basically plays the same character in every movie? movies don't have to be history books on film--all facts and no fiction, but I would expect this type of menudo to have been made in the 40's as WWII propaganda... we're in the 21st century now. If not for the innovation, audience do expect more than poorly written scripts that try to do a wool-pull over our eyes with budget and promotion.and on the battle-scenes, even Wong Kar'Wai's ASHES OF TIME (1994), made on a shoe-string budget compared to THE LAST SAMURAI, presented a more compelling and heroic depiction of the warrior's fight.",The Last Samurai

311,mjl1966,Epic fable,8,26 December 2003,"The Last Samurai is a poetic story about redemption, honor, love and the inevitable death of all things.  Ed Zwick weaves a simple tale against the romanticized backdrop of late 19th century Japan when the last vestiges of feudal Japan, and its ancient culture, slip away in the face of Western modernization.The story begins with Capt. Nathan Algren, a cynical whiskey-soaked veteran of the plains wars hawking Winchester rifles to an ignorant audience. The depiction of Western society is vilified to the point of caricature in this film, which I'm not sure was necessary, as the prose of the Samurai culture sings well enough on its own.We soon learn through various flashbacks that Algren is a soldier who has lost faith in himself and his country but still retains the passionate spirit of a formidable warrior.  Spiritually, he is quite dressed up with no place to go.When he is offered a job as a mercenary to train Japanese Imperial troops, he is thrust into circumstances which forge a destiny that finally fulfills who he really is: a warrior who needs something worthy of fighting for. Though duty may call us to sell our soul, we may yet redeem ourselves if but we find the good fight.  Honor best serves that which is honorable, or, perhaps, that which we genuinely love.  These things may be enough to define a life of purpose.The storyline here is not all that clever and is in most respects, quite predictable.  It is the journey of Algren's character within the framework of this yarn that is most compelling and is played to a T by Cruise.
This is a film that is definitely worth seeing.  Though the plot is a touch thin on the ground, the writing is superb, with moral and spiritual questions explored in a thoughtful manner.  The production is mesmerizing and Cruise is well supported by a solid ensemble well directed by Ed Zwick.",The Last Samurai

Great choreography and although it was long, and I knew it would be, I never got bored. The characters are so well-developed and dynamic that you couldn't help but dive right into their stories.

It's always sad seeing movies about the changing times and tactics of war, from honourable one-on-one combat to indiscriminate impersonal machine gun warfare. All in all a great film that will have you hooked.
Funny aside: my bro-in-law asked me what the inscription on the samurai sword said (near the end of the movie) and I replied, ""jolly good"". Then we cracked up laughing. And then my husband said ""does it really?"" which made us laugh even more. It was some good comic relief considering the impending doom that was to follow!",The Last Samurai
314,crberme,"Lot's of Japanese culture and self-improvement, but that's not a bad thing",7,7 September 2017,"I wasn't expecting much from this film, but something cached my attention when I knew about it and I'm glad it did. The Last Samurai is a great package of Japanese culture, action scenes and self improvement.The plot is very typical of this genre: There's two sides at war and our main character gets involved in the middle of the conflict. However, there's a twist here that I really appreciated: This movie is not about good vs bad and a guy becomes a legend, this is more about the process, the meantime, and it's something that even thought is becoming a cliché. It adds value to a film that otherwise would be just a show to make people feel impressed.Also, this film is stunning visually. There's a lot of beautiful landscapes although the action scenes are a little bit bland, and I think it's Tom Cruise's fault, who lacks movement in fight scenes. Talking about Tom Cruise, his presence looks kind of out of place in this role, but I could be possible that it was intentional. If the purpose was to make him look like an outsider, well done. Apart from that, the cast is great, and I wouldn't complain about their performances.To wrap up my review, this is a great movie even thought is nothing transcendental. It also gives a good key message, which is a plus. And if you like long movies you'll be pleased to sit with this one for two and a half hours.",The Last Samurai

I had seen the movie in HD on DirecTV before, so there were no surprises regarding quality, but I was still really impressed when switching between this and the 480p picture produced by my DVD player. The colors are much more vibrant, the clarity is remarkable and it serves to submerse you in a movie that was already great as it was. As a huge fan of the movie as well as of HD picture quality, I was happy to pick this up at Best Buy for $25, but I probably wouldn't recommend getting this if you have it on DVD already unless you're a big fan.

320,DigitalPhreaker,A True Epic,8,10 December 2003,"Nowadays, with these cheap films (and when I say cheap, I mean plot wise, acting wise and so on) coming out, like Bad Boys II, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and so on, it's great to know that there are still filmmakers out there who know how to create a masterpiece of a film.In the early parts of this year, I was drawn into this film through the teaser trailers and posters they would have at the theaters. I just knew from watching the trailers that this movie was going to be big. And was I right.Tom Cruise is amazing. Gone are his days of the cocky teenage roles and stereotypical movies. Tom has grown up and realized that since he is a super star, he can do something more than those kinds of movies, and he has in the recent years. For example: Magnolia and Jerry Maguire, both earning him an Oscar nod. I know for sure that this year is Tom's year. After watching Jerry Maguire again after watching the Last Samurai, I know that the Academy will at least give Tom Best Actor.And Mr. Cruise isn't the only one who's going to be getting some Oscar nods. Ken Watanabe will probably get nominated for best supporting and possibly Ed Zwick as director. However, I doubt that the film will win for Best Picture. Not because it doesn't deserve it, but because it had to be released the same year as Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. It's going to be next to impossible to beat Jackson's film, and I think that that's too bad, because The Last Samurai has Best Picture written all over it.I was drawn into this film immediately when we saw Col. Algren's past come back to haunt him, and I knew that his mission in this film was going to be to silence his lambs, so to speak. Although it was somewhat Dances With Wolves at parts, I felt this to be original, visually stunning, and heartbreaking at the same time. Tom Cruise and everyone involved in this film have done an amazing job and they deserve all the praise they are receiving.10/10. Go and see this movie if you have not already. And if you have, see it again. Because they deserve a lot of money since they won't be taking the Best Picture Oscar home.",The Last Samurai

322,requiem1896,Visual masterpiece,8,9 May 2004,"Edward Zwick's  The Last Samurai is one of those films worth seeing. Regardless of how it sounds [that being ""Tom Cruise goes to Japan""], it is much better than I and other thought it would be.Before I go any further I want to make one point:  The story is accurate toJapanese culture on a superficial level.  That being said, it is very easy to criticise this film because of its accuracy to cultural matters.  Is it historically and culturally accurate?  Depends on how deep you look and how much you know. Suffice it to say, the film's accuracy was sufficient for it to not be a significant [not even minor] problem.Moving on:   As it has been said about many films in the past few years, it is unfortunate for Last Samurai that Lord of the Rings came out the same year. This film would likely have swept Art Direction, Costume Design, and Sound. It also would have garnered nomination a nomination for Cinematography.  Visually, the film has perfectly integrated and flowing imagery from beginning to end.  Ignoring minor issues there is really nothing to complain about in depth.  The Score is phenomenal.  Hans Zimmer should have been nominated for hiswork in this film.   Of the many things this film excelled at, the costume design was by far the best of it.  [In particular, the Samurai armor.]Ken watanabe is another good point.  His work in this film will undoubtedly be the start of a prolific career in Hollywood filmmaking.Problems: Well, quite simply, there is nothing that stands out.   Many have criticized Tom Cruise's performance.  Is it necessary?  Not really.  Could the role have been done better? Well, sure.  But that's true about most roles.  Cruise did a good job. Writer John Logan could have given the character a bit more depth and, indoing so, given Tom Cruise more to do.  Then, criticism of Cruise could bewarranted.  In short, the best criticism one can make of this film was that it could have done with another 30+ minutes of character exposition and study which would havegiven the characters more depth and turned the roles of Cruise and others into Oscar-worthy endeavors.8/10",The Last Samurai
323,ruddy_jim,I can't believe I loved this film,9,4 June 2004,"Let me start by saying, it's nothing personal, but for the record, I can't stand Tom Cruise.  I don't know what it is, but he just bugs me.This is not a perfect movie, but it was thoroughly enjoyable.  The plot is excellent, direction was very good, writing was decent acting was hit and miss, I think based on the writing.  Writing: The westerners (and western leaning Japanese) are demonized as one dimensional greed driven honourless (for lack of a better word) jerks.  I think this is intentional - the typical viewer has to be told from the outset who the bad guys are, but it weakens the overall quality of the movie.  Some of us can think for ourselves...! Tom Cruise as Nathan Algren starts as a drunk military hero with a conscience - nothing too deep here, but as he accepts and assimilates the way of the Samurai, he develops into a deeper, more interesting character. There are (very) few other deep characters, but the ones that are explored are written well.  The plot is good and the atmosphere is historically based.Direction: In one word, great.  'nuff said.Acting: Surprisingly good and bad.  Tom Cruise was at his best, I found myself forgetting that the actor was the normally annoying Cruise.  Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto was excellent.  Many other performances were forgettable or regrettable.  I found the supporting western actors (With the exception of Billy Connolly) weaker than the Japanese cast, but that could just be the writing...Writing 6/10   Direction 9/10  Acting 7/10  Plot 8/10  Overall 7.5/10",The Last Samurai
324,ACMcC24,This couldn't have gotten any better. Masterpiece.,10,16 May 2004,"Considering Tom Cruise hasn't exactly been one of my more favorite actor in Hollywood, I was a little leery of watching this film in theaters simply because he was in it.  Probably one of the biggest mistakes I could've made. I rented it because a military history major I knew said that this movie was one of the more historically accurate depictions of the samurai's life he's seen (in Hollywood at least).  After watching it, I have to consider this movie to be in my top 10 favorites.     I didn't consider this movie to be an ""action"" flick when I saw it, and am rather surprised that it was categorized as such.  Yes, it has action in it, however there is just as much drama with a little bit of romance included.  This combined with Katsumoto's character representing to a certain extent an actual historical figure, Saigo  Takamori, with his legendary - if a tad bit mythical - death and the last stand of the samurai, truly makes this film beautiful and deeply moving on a grand scale.   In terms of the samurai life depicted, I've never felt more moved at watching how they lived their life, their death, and what was lost to Japan within the context of the movie.  As for the acting, Ken Watanabe and Hiro Sanada couldn't have made a better entrance into the American movie industry, and I truly hope to see more of them.  As for Tom Cruise, I couldn't be more impressed with what he's done here.  Even though he's center on the poster with his name in large font above, it's obvious after you watch the film that he shared, if not was overlapped by the secondary plot concerning the samurai.  As for the length of the film, frankly it was perfect for it's detail.  I only wish I could've seen more of the daily life of the samurai depicted.

335,fabio-46,Honor and civilization,9,10 December 2003,"I have to admit that this is one of the best movie I've ever seen. Too bad for the cheesy end. I have always admired different cultures and always loved to know more about them. The movie is a journey into Japan at the end of 19th century, exploring a struggle between the culture and tradition in one side and greed and modernization in the other. Fascinating and utterly gripping! Do not go to see if you expect a ""mortal kombat movie""! I gave 9/10",The Last Samurai
336,wawain,too bad these things are cliches today,7,9 January 2004,"Not exactly the most thoughtful work of art, but well executed (still I liked Dances with Wolves' music better, and there were no buffalo).But while I was watching this film it dawned on me why I am drawn to these types of stories where an old, rich culture is decimated by a new one, simply because the former has outdated technology. If the former is so weak, then what good is it? Honor and discipline? The point is that it is a real community. To me, the culture and spirituality serve one end: effective communication and connection. When two warriers nod to each other, it seems that they understand each other so well they might as well be mind readers. Signs of love between strangers, against the background of quiet toil and discipline all aimed at fundamental survival, take on way more significance than they normally would.In an increasingly global society, we lack the universal codes needed to relate to each other properly. Religion? Which one? There are way too many, as globalization has demonstrated. It seems the best we have is pop culture, the output of a commercialism which is only an economic game. I don't have the answers. Ideally, everyone would try hard to look for answers, in books, abroad, and each other. It would be the trying and the yearning that counts. Everyone needs toil and discipline in *something*, so that when a gesture breaks that discipline, that gesture would be especially meaningful.Anyway, the film, as cliche-laden as it was, was still worth it.",The Last Samurai
337,alba500,"Great Movie, I would give it a 10 but Cruz a bit weak to carry such powerfull role.",9,7 December 2003,"This is a movie about the noble past and the merciless new. Nations like people have to modernize so that they do not fall behind. This movie captures it very well. The 19 century Japan has transformed itself from a backward country into a modern world class power.My only complaint is too much political correctness (the old is good and noble and the new is all cynical and bad) and Mr. Cruz barely fits into a role of a tough and gruff warrior.The photography is breathtaking, the story well written and the clash of the two cultures in the same country is well captured.",The Last Samurai
338,stuckfly,Excellent epic film,8,6 December 2003,"I doubt the historical basis, but the story is plausible and well developed. Performances were excellent.  Battle and fighting scenes are gory but not overly so, and very intense.  Characters have depth, which is a surprising quality these days.There is an annoying historical emphasis against white Americans, which is undeserved from a practical and factual viewpoint, but the story would have been weak without this slant.Recommend keeping the fact that this is fiction in mind, but don't miss this one!",The Last Samurai
339,Naoum,Why do you have to explain everything so explicitly???,6,5 May 2004,"'The Last Samurai' was better than I expected, since the trailer made me think that Tom Cruise would be the Last Samurai which I found to be an offense to my logic!!! However, this is not the case and the film has the potential of becoming a masterpiece until the halfway of the movie, with an interesting plot and intense feeling.The main problems start at about that time, when some logic gaps start to appear (according to my sense of logic that is...) and the movie cannot persuade me about the goal of protecting a culture from imperialistic influences when the origin of the film has already consumed much of that cultural elements that are meant to be protected by Tom. Hmmmm!!!Anyway, another problem is the explicit statement of what the movie is all about and what message is meant to get across. We have to think by ourselves about the meaning and find our own, or not? This movie made me think about the 'Theatre of the Oppressed', a book by Augusto Boal, and why it is politics to make a movie... 6/10",The Last Samurai

Nobody watches a Tom Cruise movie expecting a documentary. Nobody watches a Tom Cruise film to see him die in the first ten minutes. This is a movie meant to entertain, and it does that from start to finish. Wonderful performances all-around, particularly from Watanabe. If you havent watched this movie, you need to. And if you're trying to learn about Samurai or Japanese culture, then pick up a textbook. Don't blame the movie for your own ignorance.",The Last Samurai
342,jscontoyannis,A good Hollywood action epic...,8,17 March 2005,"I have recently started getting into the Samurai genre, starting with the Kurosawa's Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress, Throne of Blood, and Ran as well as Shogun's Samurai(a great, mostly ignored flick) and Sword of Doom. So I finally sucked it up and picked up this movie, curious to see what a mega-sized Hollywood budget could do with the genre. I would have to say that this movie does not compare to any of those previously mentioned, but nonetheless it is an incredibly entertaining action epic, with outstanding costumes, great acting, some fine sword play, and some well-choreographed battle sequences. However, this movie's attempts at philosophy are definitely very simplistic and Western, while Ran, Throne of Blood, Sword of Doom et al examine deeper issues than simple honor and personal redemption.But, I must digress. I am a sucker for action-epics, and this one is certainly that. There are plenty of tense battle scenes, involving everything from ninjas to brutal sparring sessions to daring rescue missions where samurai with bows and arrows and swords must contend with myriad gunmen. I must say, I found it mildly unrealistic that Cruise's Algren could master Bushido in 6 months, but I guess that's what suspension of disbelief is for.Anyways, if you like action-epics, and you are curious about the Samurai film genre, I would highly recommend this movie. Then go see ""When the Last Sword is Drawn"", a Japanese production set in the same time period, which was released in the same year and is a cut above.",The Last Samurai
343,BlackMan90,Excellent,10,30 June 2006,"The Last Samurai is an excellent movie.It's about an American who embraces the Samurai culture and fights against his own country. The script does something that most epics fail to do: Make the story understandable. The viewer can understand what's happening and not be confused.Tom Cruise gives another great performance as the American chief Nathan Algren. He starts off a depressed alcoholic and becomes the fierce soldier that he once was. Ken Watanabe also gives a great performance as the samurai leader Katsumoto. He becomes the character with fierce tenacity and intensity, but also with warmth and respect. They have great chemistry together.Great cinematography, art direction, and costume designs. Good visual effects every once in a while. Brilliant battle scenes.OVERALL: Excellent film",The Last Samurai
344,Niteout23,Ken Watanabe is Great,9,26 December 2003,"I haven't seen a movie I've enjoyed so much in a long time.  Everything worked for me, but mostly Ken Watanabe's performance was absolutely wonderful.  Wow - such a presence!  Cruise was ok, nothing particularly memorable, altho I did enjoy his interaction with the young children.  My only gripe, albeit a small one, is that the scene where Cruise is teaching the warriors how to fire a gun (""faster, faster"") was ""stolen"" from ""Glory"" and I hated that.  Don't they think people remember memorable scenes like that?  I gave it a ""9"" - good, solid acting, and well-written enough that I cared about all the characters. Beautifully done.",The Last Samurai
345,jericho31,"Epic movie, great production, Cruise superbly confident",9,5 December 2003,"Tom Cruise as a samurai? I had my doubts. But, since I love  Legends of the Fall and Glory, I had faith in Edward Zwick's epic storytelling ability and I was not disappointed. This movie is fantastic in almost every way - Zwick was a touch sappy and melodramatic at times, but not enough to be distracting.
Cruise was at the top of his game, wtih a confidence that seems to only increase with age. When I first heard of this movie I was very skeptical one would be able to get past the persona of Tom Cruise and believe he was a samurai. Thankfully the performance left no doubts. Cruise was helped by an extremely strong (and almost assuredly ignored) performance from Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto, theleader of the remaining samurai. The scenes between the two of them as Cruise is beginning to discover the samurai culture are among the best in the movie. Lastly, one cannot say enough about John Toll as a director of photography.This movie is so strikingly beautiful the cinematography is as important acharacter as any.  From the quiet, contemplative scenes while Cruise is aprisoner among the samurai to the unbelievable action sequences which arevery reminiscent of Bravelheart, Toll does a remarkable job. Thecinematography is enough to make you cry, and you add in the great cast andwonderful directing by Zwick, and you've got a great movie.
Do yourself a favor and see this movie on the big screen as epics are intended to be seen. Highly recommended. **** out of  *****",The Last Samurai
346,xiayun,Hollywood at its best and worst at the same time,6,15 September 2004,"The Last Samurai shows Hollywood at its best as well as its worst. The film is very strong technically. The production is grand, and the cinematography is impeccable, although the music score is too loud. It also features a great performance by Ken Watanabe and good performance from Tom Cruise. However, the script is very hollywoodish, from beginning to the end. The story of a man getting captured, becoming understanding of the other side, and then helping them and even falling love with a woman, is nothing new. Overall, I'm disappointed with how traditional the story evolved, but I did enjoy the movie as an entertainment, and the last battle did give me a goosebump. 7 out of 10.",The Last Samurai

What I got was a well acted well directed film with a great plot and amazing action.  I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise I have always found him overrated but this performance impressed the hell out of me.  Cruise does not deserve an Oscar or anything but maybe a nod.  Zwick deserves a nod as does Hans Zimmer for his great score.  The Cinematrography was awesome the movie just looks great.

Has he fights himself, accepting a culture he's not comfortable with, he learns important things about life, honor, victory and defeat.Not gonna say much more about it course i don't wanna spoil the experience of it so just give it a try, I'm sure u're gonna love it.",The Last Samurai
350,dondanhernandez,Great Film,9,14 August 2008,"First off I'd like to comment that this film though having historical inaccuracies is still a damn good film. It's entertainment not a documentary not once did anyone say this was based on a true story. Also being upset over the central character's turning his back on America shouldn't be so upsetting along with claiming he's against Christianity, um enough with throwing religion into this movie for all we know before the character was imprisoned perhaps he was Jewish instead they never show his religious beliefs at any point during this film.Onto the film it's a modern day epic and does a better job than most films Hollywood has attempted to throw out. Yes the story is rather cliché and it gets cliché at times but again it's entertainment and it's a film trying to go back to the old day epics. The story is great along with the acting. A well written modern epic that captures what was great about the great films of the past and adds a few newer things to keep it somewhat original. I'd give it a 10 but the lack of originality and the many clichés take it down a notch.",The Last Samurai

It grabbed me emotionally, visually, musically, and didn't let go until the last possible second.  The intro with the trade fair was kind of quirky, but I guess it worked.  The rest of the movie though was nearly flawless.  I've been a fan of Tom Cruise for years, and I would honestly say that this has been his best role to date.  Most believable character he's ever played by far.  Ken Watanabe was brilliant.  Sometimes a little hard to understand, but that comes with the territory I think.  Again, musical quality was amazing, very fitting with the environment in which this movie takes place.

352,Adrienne85,Tom's better movies; definitely a must-have in your collection,8,31 March 2006,"Tom plays Nathan; a somewhat fearless, ignorant soldier who is asked to train a Japanese army to go to battle against the Samurai. He agrees, but the Samurai are closing in on them too fast and against Nathan's will they get ready to battle with the Samurai. They're doomed to lose and the Samurai capture Nathan. Nathan grows to respect and admire the Samurai, which is what the movie boils down to.There are hints of romance and Nathan's problems with sleeping in the movie, but the latter just disturbs the movie IMO. Tom makes the movie believable, but with good help from Ken Watanabe (Katsumuto). It has a serious tone throughout the whole movie. With a movie like this it is probably hard to make a great ending..it has been done, but not here though. Definitely worth watching, preferably at night when you are doing nothing else.",The Last Samurai

I watched this years ago. I remember that Tom Cruise as Nathan Algren was bitter and twisted because he really didn't want to attack the Indians. He had been injured and was at the end of his military career and held grievances agist his commanding officer because the commanding officer killed the Indians for sport. Nathan Algren had respect for his enemy and foe. He went to Japan to train a private army for a Japanese businessman Omura. It was a Civil War against the well trained but gunless Samurai who thad trained as warriors all of their lives. He was captured by the Samurai on his first fight. They made the general who had trained as a Samurai take his own life. They also beheaded him.This movie was also filmed in New Zealand I can't help but marvel at the beauty of our mountains and scenery.They teach him the way of the Samurai and fight off assassins with the clan. Saving Taka and her two children. He fights together with Katsumoto to save the village.They take him back to Tokyo where Katsumoto is arrested but they break him out of jail and prepare for one last battle in their homelands.. They are totally outnumbered by the enemy. The peaceful village prepare to be attacked on the morrow.Taka carefully dresses him in the armour of her husband. If you wear this it will honour us.

The battles were great, the cultural exchanges were educational, it was a well rounded experience.What this movie did do to me was make me very angry at how it seemed the ruling class in Japan so harshly turned on and destroyed the warrior class (Samurai) so readily. I want to do some more historical research now.I also liked how they included assassins that I would assume were ninja, though I wonder if they were clothed appropriately, since they seemed to be wearing the more modern Soke Hatsumi style outfits versus what I'd expect for the 1800's, but again, I could just have things mixed up.Tom Cruise was kinda dorky in interviews for this movie, particularly with Oprah... he does NOT coke off like that IN the movie, where it's important.9/10",The Last Samurai
356,jansen-aui,The way of the samurai is not necessary any more ...,8,19 June 2006,"Director Edward Zwick's unfairly maligned Japanese epic, The Last Samurai, is one of heart, sweeping beauty, rousing emotion, and a passionate romanticism of the Samurai. There's nothing wrong with romanticising the Samurai, of course, they are a fascinating people after all, and at the end of the day The Last Samurai is a motion picture, and motion pictures are fairy tales  make believe. Critics should forgive Zwick, then, for what may or may not be a lack of historical accuracy both in chronology and behaviour, for not to do so would be to forget The Last Samurai's touching, resonant story about the rise of modern Japan.Set in the late 1870's, the film begins with war veteran Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) of the American army, pitying and drowning himself with liquor for hatred of his past actions. An old friend (Billy Connolly) persuades him to consider an offer from Mr. Omura (Masato Harada), in association with the man responsible for Algren's forgettable past, Lieutenant Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), to train the Japanese military in the use of American firearms. Despite his dislike for his former Colonel, Algren agrees to do so for the money. When Colonel Bagley orders an unprepared regiment of Japanese soldiers to meet a group of ""savages""  Samurai led by the rebel Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe)  in battle, hundreds of soldiers are killed and Algren is captured and taken to the Samurai village, deep in the mountains. Katsumoto, a student of English and war, finds much to learn from Algren and holds him in captivity until the spring, when a safe passage will be cleared for his return. During this time, Algren begins seeing the Samurai in a much different light and by the time of his release, he has been shaped for the better by their gentle, spiritual, and honourable ways.The cinematography in The Last Samurai is breathtaking, shot primarily in the landscapes of New Plymouth in New Zealand, capturing the essence of the Samurai way of life. The performances don't disappoint, either. While Tom Cruise was fine as Algren, and probably at the top of his dramatic game, it's the Japanese actors that stand out: Ken Watanabe, as the leader of the Samurai, delivers with such integrity, and the smaller roles of Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) and Algren's caretaker Taka (Koyuki) are acted with subtle, quiet, and understated power. Throughout the film's 148 minutes, Zwick adopts a slow, meaningful pace and combines his minimalist dialogue with Hans Zimmer's truly majestic score to forge the sense of epic.",The Last Samurai

The Last Samurai is exactly that.Without spoiling anything, I will just say that this is a perfect storm of impeccable acting, an incredible cast of actors, writers, directors, and everyone involved.

I hope that Tom Cruise gets AT LEAST a best actor Oscar nod and for sure an Oscar because he deserves it. Ken Watanabe should get an Oscar for best supporting actor. He was outstanding. I love him! I don't think that the movie would have been as good if those two actors did not work together. The whole cast was incredible. They worked off each other and really made this movie a beautiful work of art.

Go see this movie.,The Last Samurai
364,mega_mike,Would have been great if not so overdramatic,7,10 December 2003,"This is a good film, the acting is good, as well as the story and battle sequences.  In particular, I was impressed with Ken Watanabe's acting as the samurai lord.  The special effects in the battles (standard explosions with horses falling and guys spinning away to their death in sword fights) and 1800's style backgrounds were decent (you can obviously tell the backgrounds in San Francisco and Tokyo are paintings in the background).  The costumes were very well done, and depicted the era quite well.
Now a couple of the fight sequences were not that great.  The opening battle is fantastic, and the end battle is good as well (the Tokyo street fight with Tom Cruise was ok).  The fight when the ninjas attack the village was well done for the most part except for the silly timing of the attacks towards the end of the sequence (the ninjas ran through the door in groups of two, when one group was finished off, the next two jumped through the door to attack).  Some better editing could have made this look less choreographed.  
The only fight sequence that got on my nerves was the escape scene.  This was just poorly done.  Cheesy effects (like the exploding pellets on both sides of the bridge handle bars as Tom Cruise ran down the middle) and the ridiculous repeat shot of guards getting hit with an arrow in the exact same corner over and over.  Coupled with the overdramatic death of one samurai, made this scene just plain annoying.  This over-dramatic death is similar to the prince of Gondor at the end of the first Lord of the Rings movie, but better editing in that movie made that scene more subtle.
Finally, the fact that everyone was on the verge of tears or just plain crying in every other scene was just really overdramatic.  Some would have been fine to show the character's passion, but this was overdone.",The Last Samurai

366,larry-miller,So-so samurai,4,7 December 2003,"If you saw MASTER & COMMANDER you don't need to see this and vice versa. It purports to be about a historical culture clash and accommodation, and about honor. It's really about technology, not culture. What both  movies are, are old-fashioned battle films, gussied up with modern cinema technology.If you love Japanese samurai films, if you know the work of Kurosawa and Mifune and Nakadai and Shimura and Shintaro Katsu (Zatoichi), it will be obvious how much this movie  suffers in comparison.Tom Cruise is a technically gifted actor but there is something cold, as if his performance is predetermined and he does not react to what other actors do. The ""girl,"" Taka, played by Koyuki, is gorgeous and makes lots of goo-goo eyes. The samurai, Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe, is good. But what would Mifune or Nakadai have done to make the part more meaningful?The battle and fight scenes were excellent, though crucial blows were out of frame so it is mostly in our imagination. SEVEN SAMURAI, 1954, RAN, 1985, both Kurosawa, did them far better. I think this is below the standard writer/producers Ed Zwick and Marshall  Herskovitz set with ""St. Elsewhere"" and ""Thirty Something."" Sorry.No horses were injured, it says at the end.

Watch Eyes wide shut, again if you must,you will see. It is better to see than a run of the mills movie. The twist between east and west runs deep. You can see the balderdash of warrior mentality between Tom Cruise's western, and his samurai counterpart Ken Watanabe's eastern influence. Its almost like a modern man meets the pre 1900's Samuria warrior. Am I the only one who caught this? He develops the annihilation of the American Indian to the diminishing samurai. The movie even illustrates the differences. If America was smaller the the honor of the Indian probably would of coalesced into a more cohesive unit. With the Indian honor and family unit we would be negotiating with a totally different people from England, Spain, France, etc...I think the Samurai and American Indians would help make a simpler better world.

Tom Cruise generally stars in pretty entertaining & quality movies, from what I have seen. I didn't see the movie until 11 years later, and I was pleasantly surprised. It is a meaningful, entertaining film. I enjoyed seeing the transition from drunken, arrogant, emotionally damaged leader, to a man at peace who found a place to call home. I don't know the true story of samurais and such, but I sympathize with the so-called ""barbarians"" and ""savages"" who were slaughtered by the big powerful governments and people because they were intimidated by them.

370,TommyTwista,Showcase of Tom Cruise's strengths,8,8 December 2003,"I found this film surprisingly good, despite the luke-warm reviews (e.g. Variety). The storyline was fairly predictable, but that's fine for this type of genre piece. Tom Cruise is, in my opinion, a fantastic one-trick-pony actor. He portrays the testosterone filled American Alpha-male in all his films, and does it superbly in this one. And yet, it is not pro-American. In fact, it is distinctly anti-American in terms of foreign policy commentary. Only an actor such as Cruise could be capable of pulling this off while still being considered a good American.
The similarities with Dances with Wolves are clearly there, but does this really matter? It's been a long time since Dances and this was a fun story anyway. The only negative comment that I have on this picture is that Cruise could have let this be more about Katsumoto, who represented the real-life Saigo Takamori, rather than about a completely fictional American military advisor turned rebel. It was only a 1/3 of the way into the film before I realised that Cruise wasn't the Last Samurai and that led me to research the history of the true Last Samurai afterward.",The Last Samurai

It had all the makings of a great epic if not an Oscar bound flik with love, intrigue, passion, and treachery all combined and woven into a turn of the century feudal Japan story. Could it go wrong? After viewing it, I can honestly say that it is not an OSCAR bound movie but an above average Sunday flik. The characters were very stale and the love between the main characters, Nathan and Taka seem contrived. Poor Nathan can never get killed (even though he wishes it) after being shot multiple times at the end of the movie and pummeled by a wooden stick in another scene. And some of the dialog seemed rather laughable and every time Katsumoto spoke, the English never matched his lips (was it dubbed?). Rather unbelievable at best. The savior of this movie is the cinematography, the well choreographed violence, and the magnificent shooting locations. Did someone mention New Zealand? Definitely worth seeing but I just could net get over the title (and Tom Cruise) being the Last Samurai",The Last Samurai

373,djdavig,"Let's Roll - Don't Walk, Run To See This Movie",10,5 December 2003,"Rarely will you ever see a movie more inspiring than this epic treatise on the nature of good and evil.  In this new millenium ""Braveheart"" it is the greedy, self-absorbed corporate charlatans versus the selfless tribal warriors, who, knowing they are fighting a losing battle, decide to fight on with the utmost honor and bravery imaginable.  You will want to stand up and cheer just like the dozens of people I saw voicing their thanks for this rousing story.  It portrays America as many unfortunately see it in the rest of the world today, as an untrustworthy and greedy bully using its superior technology to stamp down the downtrodden and line its own pockets.  Yet it is an American Civil War hero (Cruise) who redeems his terrible crimes against humanity in the Indian Wars and teaches the brave Asian warriors what it takes to win against a far superior enemy.... not just honor, courage, integrity, and passion.... but faith, hope, and an undying will to see the good triumph over evil, no matter what the odds or the price.  The battle scenes are fantastic, characters sympathetic, sub plots engrossing, and you will wish as I did that the movie would not end.  I walked away a better man, the snickering cynics be damned.  You will too! I doubt any of them have ever fought valiantly in a battle to the death, even when they knew they would probably lose. Remember 9/11?  If only we modern day Americans could live every day like the last samurai, like it was our last fight, and understand that ours is mostly a battle between good and evil within the mind.  Our words are our swords and to die in battle is a ""good"" death.  ""Every man dies, but not every man really lives."" (Braveheart) Let's Roll!!!",The Last Samurai
374,goodm0urning,Awe-Inspiring,10,13 December 2003,"To cut to the chase, there is one very noticeable flaw in this film. There is a scene when a single teardrop falls from the corner of a little boy's eye... the wrong corner.  Teardrops always fall from the inside corner, and this tear fell from the outside corner.  Absolutely unforgivable, the biggest flaw of the film.With that out of the way, here's the good stuff:  Seemingly paradoxically, director Edward Zwick (he of the acclaimed civil war film ""Glory"") successfully melds an epic scope of panoramic battle sequences and lush settings with a character-driven storyline that is deeply affecting, yet charged with energy.  This is like Dances With Wolves, minus the crap, plus some absolutely amazing (yet realistic and never fantastical) battle sequences that are picturesque and intense, without resorting to the dancelike choreography and CGI/wire effects that are popular nowadays.Of course, the biggest question concerns Tom Cruise.  The epitome of the phrase ""star actor,"" there is sufficient cause to doubt his ability to assume a character-driven role... but there is no need to worry.  Cruise has delivered a knockout punch of a performance, perhaps the best of his career--only overshadowed by the virtuosic job done by his co-star, Ken Watanabe, who seems to have stepped into the role straight out of one of Kurosawa's film (compare Watanabe's work as Samurai leader Katsumoto with any of Toshiro Mifune's roles to see what I mean).To sum it up... if you haven't seen it, then what the hell are you waiting for?",The Last Samurai
375,oli_rawlings,"a truly epic film, definitely Oscar worthy",9,15 September 2005,"This film is the best Tom Cruise film ever, alongside Ken Watanabe's superb acting. Though slow paced at first it demonstrates the importance of honour, not judging people on first impressions... This film follows a rather sad story of fighting for tradition and avoiding judging anyone until you meet them. It is full of truly breath-taking scenery in Japan and superb battle scenes. The lead actors are truly amazing which goes very well with a great story. This film really proves that Tom Cruise can act! This film deserves more credit however, it is truly Oscar worthy, for Watanabe's acting and battle scenes mainly.The story is basically about an American captain (Cruise) who is tormented by his gruesome past that is hired to train the army to kill the samurai which are raiding the country. He faces them in battle with rookie soldiers and therefore lost and was captured by the samurai leader Katsumoto (Watanabe) which kept him alive simply because he is like every samurai very spiritual and believes in his dreams and knew their was a purpose for him to live. After a the long slow process of trying to find out information about his enemy, Algren (Cruise) simultaneously begins training in the way of the samurai and comes to love their way of life and develops a friendship with Katsumoto. After a series and turn of events the story develops like a roller coaster ride and fight together for their survival.This film is honestly one of the best dramas/war dramas I have ever seen, combined with a superb story, and action of amazing creativity in the dialogue, setting and all the scenes! Truly Oscar worthy, ashame it didn't win any, they makers really deserved more credit.9/10",The Last Samurai

However, it's also hard to dismiss this movie because of this Hollywood fluff.  The costumes, music, acting, etc. are simply awesome and breathtaking.

381,Diss,Great modern epic,10,9 December 2003,"This movie is fantastic. I really am surprised there are so many complaints about it. I suspect they are stereotyping Tom Cruise from the many bad movies he's done. Don't give this movie a negative review just because Cruise is in it! I changed my opinion of Cruise after Born on the Fourth of July; I suggest watching that movie.Granted, he's not a great actor. His performance in this movie isn't oscar-worthy. But he holds his own and moves the story along believably. I'd say he's done his job. But I liked him a little better in Born on the Fourth of July.But what makes this film really shine is the lack of annoying american actors. Ken Watanabe is unbelievably amazing! I found myself so drawn to his character at the end of the movie. It is impossible not to be moved during the gatling gun scene and when Katsumoto meets his destiny. It takes good acting for me to care about a character, and a whole culture even, like that. There have been complaints about the acting of the widowed wife. You have to understand Japanese culture to understand why the women act like that. It was intended she act that way.As for the story, it is fantastic. Maybe you could say it was scewed a certain direction. I wouldn't call it PC nonsense though. Perhaps I am biased though. I love the Samurai culture and everything about it. So I couldn't find any problems with the story.Cinematography, costumes, and sets were excellent. My only complaint might be one shot in a battle scene that looked like CGI graphics. It looked out of place in this film. But it was only a 1 second shot.And then we come to the ending. While the ending is a bit ""hollywoodish"", it wasn't as bad as I feared from a hollywood movie. I would say that is a good thing. Though perhaps they could have ended the movie after Katsumoto met his fate. That might have worked a little better.Often when I watch a movie and like it I go to IMDB and see negative comments and find myself agreeing with them and myself liking the movie less because of it. But that is not the case with this movie. I have read the negative comments, and could not agree with any of them. Though I can sort of understand complaints about the ending, but at least it wasn't as bad as hollywood normally makes endings- think about it.In summary this is one of the best modern epics I have seen. Many of the complaints from the so called ""purists"" will cite better movies made in Japan, or the old epic movies. I cannot comment on those, I haven't seen enough of those for comparison. But for a modern hollywood movie, this is one of the best.",The Last Samurai

This movie is boring beyond belief, it stops every five minutes or so for someone to look around them or sit thinking sometimes for so long that it practically qualifies as a silent movie. And the plot, what plot, man feels bad about killing people, goes to japan, gets arse kicked, is taught to feel good about getting arse kicked, best friend dies, marries woman who's husband he killed.  The end. One of those movies that is specifically designed for people who hardly ever watch movies, or Oscar voters.

The way in which Tom Cruise carries his role is done spectacularly. The beautifully choreographed fight sequences are worth of praise.The storyline of this movie however is nothing off the charts. In fact, it was down right predictable. However, it was a predictably interesting storyline. Combined with the music of Hans Zimmer, this movie never fails to bring up a few goosebumps or tears from me. Good music almost always equals to a good movie, and this movie has the perfect oriental styled orchestra music to feed your musical needs.The Last Samurai is one of those few movies that delivers a wholesome meal of Samurai action.

387,deepcheck,"An unexpectedly, and admirably restrained, introspective film",9,23 November 2003,"Like many people, it seems, I had severe doubts for this film.  From the trailer, it seemed very much like a Dances with Wolves knock-off at best, and typical Hollywood tripe at worst.  I am grateful to say that this film surprised me and impressed me on all accounts.Having studied in the field of Eat Asian Languages and Culture, I was worried about the film's historical accuracy, or lack-thereof, given the period, but I was very impressed with how closely they managed to come while remaining far enough away from the actual historical record to make the events of the film plausible.  Most of the major characters, with the exception of the Emperor, are either completely fictional, or based on real historical figures, but with different names.  Katsumoto (Watanabe), for example, is obviously based on Saigo Takamori, Japan's greatest cultural hero, and the leader of the 1877 rebellion against the Meiji government (but not the Emperor).In any case, this film is excellently paced, most thanks to the excellent spot-on acting job across the board from the entire cast.  You can actually feel the greater ideas and issues at the core of the conflict, and while many of them remain verbally unstated, they are nonetheless clear to any viewer.  Visually, this film is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, for the breathtaking backgrounds, the vibrant colors, the attention to minute details such as the cut of clothing, and the ugly beauty of the battles.  The soundtrack is perfect.Just as impressive is Algren's (Cruise) own subplot, about his own quest for personal worth that he is pushed into through the events in the film. Despite what could have been a horribly campy plotline, much of the emotional content of these scenes are implied and left completely unstated, but just as apparent.  This act of restraint, so atypical of Hollywood, is one of this film's major strengths.It's obvious I enjoyed this film, but to put aside many people's apparent fear of the ""ethic-woman-loves-minority-killing-white-guy"" syndrome, you will not find it in this film (despite the trailer), at least, not as you might expect.Tom Cruise is excellent in this film, but he is completely overshadowed by the amazing Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto.  It should be expected really, as Saigo Takamori, even after his death, defined the very core of the Japanese national mindset.  There were only two ways that this character could have turned out, and fortunately for the audience, and this film, it turned out the best way.Highly recommended.",The Last Samurai

One must personally appreciate the locales carefully chosen as well.

By entertaining I mean, that every movie is made the same way all other big Hollywood films. They are always making a box-office-hit not a good movie. The movie would have been much better without Tom Cruise stealing the show. He is not that good actor (not very bad either, but this time I had too much of him). It`s true that this is very much like dances with wolves, but there is one big difference. In D.W.W. the film is about indians and the wrong picture white folks had about them. in Last Samurai the focus is on Cruises character. Lot of good things in the movie too: Great fighting scenes, Great music, some Great acting performances, Great japanese scenery...

I figured I'd wait till I had nothing better to do. Well, today was that day, and I was wrong. This is a really good movie.Cruise may have had top billing, but this movie belongs to Ken Watanabe, the rest of the Japanese cast and beauty of the shooting locations. TLS is beautifully shot, and has a very emotional and thought-provoking take on history. (Don't get me wrong, I have an advanced degree in the history of a sorely misunderstood part of the world, so I know better than most not to look to Hollyweird for any kind of historical or cultural accuracy.) But this movie sure makes the history look and sound good, and one does get caught up in the emotion of it all. I think Cruise does an adequate job with his role, and eventually one does come to admire his character in the same way the Japanese do. But really, I never took Allgren as being focal point of the film. The movie gets off to a slow start, but the pace and emotion builds and stays almost to the end. The end was somewhat far-fetched, and disappointing in its way.Overall, a movie worth seeing. I plan to add it to my collection for the battle scenes and armor alone.",The Last Samurai
392,man-man-dot-org,64 slices of American Samurai Cheese,7,11 December 2003,"Definitely not a waste of time or money, but... well, let me put it this way:***Say you build your own house, and fill it with great furniture, and you really really love this house you built. And then one day a whole bunch of guys with bulldozers show up, say they're going to bulldoze your house to make room for a bypass (you've got to build bypasses!) and tell you it's all gonna go. You get, fairly understandably, quite upset and decide to lie down in front of the bulldozers and let them run you over if they must, but this is you Taking a Stand.The day before the bulldozers are slated to knock your house down, some schmuck from the road crew -- let's call him Tom -- wanders into your house and starts touching all your stuff. ""Say, this is a pretty cool house,"" Tom says. ""You've got some awesome stuff here, dude."" Tom is, in fact, so taken with your house that he decides to run outside with you the next day and lie in front of the bulldozer beside you, and nearly gets run over but doesn't. You die horribly. The next day, Tom chastizes the foreman of the building crew, who shrugs and says ""eh, I guess maybe we shouldn't'a knocked over the house, but whatchagonna do. Let's maybe spare that tree over there."" ***Now... years later, somebody decides to make a movie about all this. Would you prefer (a) a film about the beauty of your house, the craft it took to construct it, its elegant and harmonious contents, and your futile yet noble struggle to preserve it, or (b) the story of that schmuck Tom, who wandered into your house, touched all your stuff and became a house groupie?I was hoping for more (a), and I got more (b). So will you. This film may suit your needs well as an introduction to the concept of Samurai or as ""Dances with Wolves II: Spars With Samurai"", but I would have far preferred more respect for the tradition and its history rather than the surface treatment it got.

Because I like epic and classic war movies, also there's one of the top actor, Tom Cruise, played there. But then I heard some comments from the movie critics, not good comments. They said that this movie has not too good story and Cruise's acted was bad. So, I scratched this movie from my A Must See Movie list. Suddenly, somehow I felt in love with Cruise after I watched his movie, Interview with the Vampire and Mission Impossible 2. Then I watched Collateral, Top Gun, and The Firm. I felt in love with his act, his cute face, and his beautiful green eyes. So, I borrowed The Last Samurai vcd from vcd rental shop. When I picked this movie, I scared that I've picked the wrong movie and I'll feel disappointed after I watch it. Then, I watched it and I cried. Really cried. Wow ! This movie was so damn great! The story, the setting, the war, the sacrifice, the costumes. It was great. I think the director knows how to make a dramatic war. It was so emotional and touching. This movie is the first one which its war scene made me cry. And Tom Cruise, he acted very very good. I truly touched with Captain Nathan Algren's personality.

Lately I'm beginning to see some real talent behind that Hollywood smile.OK let's face it Mr. Cruise has made his share of 'look at me I'm the perfect looking hero in a kinda Jerry Bruckheimer type way' movies. But more and more he is beginning to bring some real talent to any venture to which he is attached. The Last Samurai is certainly no exception. Ed Zwick directs beautifully, especially in the middle segment where Captain Algren (Cruise) is won over by the simplicity and beauty of Samurai way of life. Superb support from the ever great Tim Spall and A fantastic turn by Ken Watenabe ensures a thespian delight.Although at times a trifle drawn out and perhaps leaning towards sentiment rather than historical accuracy, this is nevertheless a hugely entertaining movie. The fight scenes are excellent, with Cruise apparently learning 30+ genuine samurai sword moves. This is most noticeable in a scene where he fights 5 armed swordsmen. Although played through in real time with the usual MTV editing, it is then replayed in slow motion in Algren's mind as we are treated to a great fight scene from an actor who is definitely not usually a martial artist.Again I think that with a good script and great direction Cruise plies his trade more than adequately.

Western boy meets world...Western Boy has inner conflict and must choose his allegiance...Western boy effuses emotion in a drawn-out, overacted 40 minute concluding sequence where people can take 40 bullets and still die slowly and in a touching way...Western boy becomes assimilated into new culture and lives happily ever after. Basically, western culture and history are slammed repeatedly by producers who concurrently make their living off of western commercialism in western theaters from hordes of western cola-drinking sheep.The problem is that this movie looks really good artistically. They had a huge budget to get a good cast, beautiful scenes, and good action choreography.

Each day they awake, they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue. I have never seen such Discipline.It is after many years that I have experienced an untroubled sleep. Everyone is polite. Everyone smiles and bows. But beneath this courtesy, I detect a great reservoir of feeling. And although it may forever be obscure to me, I cannot escape the fact that there is something Spiritual in this place.""""Please forgive. Too many mind. Mind the sword. Mind the people watch. Mind the enemy . . . Too many mind. No-Mind! . . . No-Mind!""""There is so much here I will never understand. I've never been a church going man. And what I've seen on the battlefield has led me to question God's purpose. But there is indeed something spiritual in this place. And though it may forever be obscure to me, I cannot but be aware of its power.""""Winter, 1876. What does it mean to be Samurai? To devote yourself utterly to a set of moral principles. To seek a stillness of your mind. And to master The Way Of The Sword.""The Samurai Warrior says, ""And then I come to this place of my ancestors, and I remember . . . That like these blossoms, we are all dying. To know life in every breath, every cup of tea. The perfect blossom . . . You could spend your entire life looking for one. And it would not be a wasted life.""",The Last Samurai

407,Exploited,"One sided, yet true",8,9 December 2003,"Before watching this movie, I was afraid this to be yet another US-distortion of history. However, even though this movie uses a purely US-based view on matters in the japanese civil-war, it turns out to have a relatively pro-japanese viewpoint.Unique in contemporary hollywood filmmaking, one might say.To take this even further, it would be completely understandable that US viewers would hate this movie as it is anti-american. It defends the japanese culture against the american attacks at the beginning of the last century and might even be considered a justification of the Japanese attack against Pearl harbor.Being a european, I must say that I still dislike the purely american viewpoint. In this respect films like ""Shogun"" portrai a more 'general western' viewpoint towards Japanese culture.Even so, I feel the movie portrais a true emotion and standpoint of events and portrais these events in a very apt way. 8/10 by me!",The Last Samurai
408,dickbub@hotmail.com,for americans!,2,11 January 2004,"First I was a little bit reluctant to watch this film but since my friend had to go to the army the next day I agreed finally to go with him. The film was not as bad as I expected when I entered the cinema.The story was quite good told. But there were certain things that really annoyed me. The whole movie was too much Americanized. Sometimes I asked myself how many times we can bear to see these good looking swaggering heroes from the west who are so much skilled again. I mean, is it normal that one can learn such a difficult language like Japanese within e few weeks or that he can fight like a samurai without much training? At the beginning tom cruise killed like six or seven samurai even though he was seriously wounded. E few minutes later he had problems fighting against a young child with a wooden sword and another half an hour  later he was one of the best fighters in among the whole population of the samurai. What is the explanation of this phenomenon? That he is handsome? Or that he is an American? How many times is Hollywood trying to use the halo-effect(which means that we generalise from a specific features such as physical attractiveness to other features such as skills, unconsciously) again before people get tired of it?******spoilers*******But as I have said above the story was no bad in every aspect. I liked the way they showed how old values und standards where wiped out by the invasion of the western culture and the fear of the Japanese people to loose the big part of the cake and for that reason to forget who they were und to sell their own customs and their own past. But what was the worst part of the whole movie was the ending. If it had ended on the battle filed it would have been much better. Why did the last samurai had to be an American? I'm not saying that because I don't like Americans, they are not better nor are they worse than others but I think I would be a little bit ashamed if I was one of them. Would not be glad or even proud to see always and all the time one of my own people being the hero and the best and the greatest and superior to all others and the nicest guy on earth even though it must be very easy and entertaining to identify oneself with him. Maybe it would have been better if the Japanese had made this film by their own because I think that it is an important one. But then it would not be such a great success because we wouldn't understand the motives because they would  not be adapted to our schemes of culture behaviour and honour. Well  that's life. The last shot when cruise met his girl again was dumb too because it made one feel a little bit that the whole thing was a film about the life of a certain man and not about the lost of old values for economical reasons and the dark sides of `globalisation' which is what the movie really is about.But if you do not care about such things I can recommend you this flick without any remorse. Personally I give it (5/10). It is a solid piece of cinematic entertainment. Solid because it is a film like hundreds of others..",The Last Samurai
409,H4nd0,What's Lost In The Story Is Made Up By Just About Every Other Aspect,9,25 January 2004,"Having read other comments lambasting the ""Hollywoodisation"" of the subject area, and yes, I concur there were many thematic similarities from other films but hey ... name me one that is truly unique ... I must say I found this Cruiser very enjoyable and engrossing.Initially, Tom was not as his best pretending to be the drunk, retrograde individual attempting to absolve himself of the  multitudinous North American Indian slayings of his past (has Tom ever been drunk? He never presents an authentic one if you ask me!) or was I watching Top Gun all over again ... but his character stabilised and solidified to be easily overshadowed by the more imposing glacial Katsumoto and Samurai support cast.Read other comments for the plot which I think, to be fair, was quite earnest. Ex. Civil War Captain takes a contract in Japan to teach the newly formed Japanese Imperial Army (if there is any historical merit in the story line it makes me shudder just thinking of the catalyst for the impending 20th century atrocities on the Chinese mainland and throughout SE Asia), they are under-prepared, he gets captured, an affinity is established which drives him to rescue his captor and take them into battle one last time...Now the bits that jump out at me: costume - absolutely stunning - I recently went to the exhibition at the New South Wales Art Gallery where many Samurai relics were displayed including a full suit of 17th century Samurai armour... fantastic and authentic; cinematography - gorgeous - sure you could see some of the paint-ins but the vistas during the final battle were tremendous; the fight scenes - visceral, gristly, gory and realistic - especially the helmeted samurai appearing from the mists to take on the unprepared Japanese army - limbs flying all around; the characterisation (usually missing or at least superficial for most Cruisers) was great - especially Katsumoto and the relationship between Algren and Taka (god, she is gorgeous) and finally sound - I find most people overlook this as cinema is such an intense ocular experience - great surround and effect - the unsheathing of swords, their echo of intertwine - the subtle soundtrack - obviously western with so many Japanese overtones.If you can tolerate a period piece, and a Cruiser at that, with a reasonable but obviously regurgitated story line then this is definitely worth a watch.",The Last Samurai
410,hot-chocolate,Liked it...,8,26 January 2004,"Simple enough, I liked this movie.  I didn't know what to expect when I went in.  Tom Cruise -- some movies you can love him, others you hate him.  I feel he was the big name draw for this movie but that it could have been played by any number of other actors.  His character in the movie will not be one that defines him.  Its just not a Leonardo DiCaprio/Titanic memory.
I enjoyed the supporting cast and the general storyline.  Powerful emotion without the melodrama and over acting.I especially enjoy the spirituality of films like this, much like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  I was moved by the final fighting scene in which Katsumoto sees the blossoms and says ""they are all perfect"".  I guess for me that's the kind of Zen I wish I would like to have.The movie didn't have me looking at my watch -- always a good sign for me! Nor did it have me feeling like the WB should paying ME to be there!",The Last Samurai
411,ladiesman3383,Perfect mixing of cultures,9,19 June 2004,"Great movie! Tom Cruise brings depth to his role. Great directing by Zwick and a great screenplay by John Logan. Very interesting in showing ways of Japanese people and way of the Samurai. Ken Watanbe gives a strong performance of portraying the Samurai leader. Good score as always by Hans Zimmer. Good cinematography,editing, sound, art direction and costume design. As I said, the movie shows a perfect example of an American soldier( Cruise) mixing with the Japanese culture. Spoilers!!!- Cruise plays a post Civil War soldier called on to lead a Japanese squad to defeat the Samurai. As the movie goes on, Cruise gets involved with the Samurai and learns their way and finds out they're not ''savages'' like Tony Goldwyn's character says. Also the film has many impressive fight sequences.",The Last Samurai

An intense storyline infused with action, emotion, and even a tad bit of humor. The acting is superb by not only Cruise, but also the supporting cast. Ken Watanabe (Kasumoto) is brilliant as the Samurai leader, and Tony Goldwyn once again portrays his despicable character so well that you think he should have a patent on it. Easily the best film so far this year. If Tom Cruise does not finally win the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Capt.

415,jackpenmanreid,In My Top 10 Movies Of All Time,10,6 October 2016,"I love this film. Everything about it is spectacular. The film follows the story of Captain Nathan Alrgen (Tom Cruise) who is an American war veteran in the late 1800's and is hired to train Japanese soldiers how to use guns to quell a rebellion by a group of Samurai. The films follows his experiences in Japan. The plot is loosely based on the real life Satsuma rebellion of the Samurai. One of my favourite things about The Last Samurai is the score by Hans Zimmer and it truly compliments the film in its greatest scenes. I do admit I may enjoy this film more than others as I do have a love and keen interest of Japanese culture. The film does a brilliant job of showing Japanese people and culture in a respectful light and paints a brilliant picture of a Japan struggling to find the balance between becoming a modern country and also keeping their identity. Ken Watanabe is brilliant support in the form of Samurai leader Katsumoto but I would say Tom Cruises character and indeed is character progression is the star of the show. Haunted by events prior to the film, the story follows Cruise as he slowly settles in to the Japanese way of life and while originally finding their customs strange and foreign, he learns to love the Japanese way of life and grows to find peace in it. The real life Engyoji Temple is brilliantly used and the director makes great use of the beautiful Japanese scenery. Timothy Spall does a very good job as a supporting character and also as a narrator and gives one of the best openings to a film I have heard which I will repeat: ""They say Japan was made by the sword. They say the old Gods dipped a coral blade into the ocean, then pulled it out again. Four perfect drops fell back into the water, forming the islands of Japan."" I can't recommend this film enough. The battle scenes are epic and very well choreographed. The character of Algren is initially dislikeable because of the actions of his past but his redemption through his love of Japan is very relatable. Give this film a watch, you won't regret it.",The Last Samurai
416,og_swifty,One of my top 10 favorite movie,10,2 November 2016,"This Hollywood epic historical war film was surprisingly more financially successful / critically appraised in conservative Japan than USA. Sure, the term ""Hollywood blockbuster"" usually means stellar cast, epic music, a lot of clichés, monumental battles and lots of beautiful scenery along with highly expensive tricks and effects that cost some heavy dough. I always question myself about its position within my personal TOP10 movies but whenever I get the chance to watch it - I'm clear. I really love historical movies, especially based on some real events. Tom Cruise is probably the best pick from all those Pitts and Depps around (and not only because he's looking like lumberjack here) and when it comes to Asian actors - I didn't honestly know them but they're all cool. I enjoy their conversations led in that gibberish with everything that's part of it (gestures, shouts and whatever). The message of the film and its inevitable (and useless) sad ending is quite showy from the beginning yet it always works and I'm quite soft when it's over. Well, in the end I have to highlight presence of Koyuki who would be a good wife to me - unfortunately I was not quick enough to reach her so her beauty fell to some Asian guy. It's a shame - my shame. RIP heavenly marriage.",The Last Samurai
417,samyy_866,a stunning film,10,14 November 2005,"The Last Samurai is an undoubtedly brilliant film, extremely moving and brilliantly made. Ken Watananbe and Tom Cruise have excellent on-screen chemistry which adds to the films style and character. The costume designer has done a fantastic job and you can really gain an understanding of the Samurai way of life and the meaning of true discipline, which both lead actors portray perfectly. Additionally the film has many spectacular action scenes, which are made all the more spectacular by the simplicity of the special effects.A stunning film in the way that it is serious yet light relief is provided with comedy at strategic intervals - if you haven't watched this film please do so, i cannot describe to you in this comment how utterly spectacular the film was.",The Last Samurai
418,bigeyesforbeauty,a disappointing movie if you have watched Japanese films about samurais,1,25 November 2005,"I like Japanese movies and I like movies about samurais and for some reason after I saw the ads I bought a ticket and went to the cinema to watch it. I expected something like the ""Shogun"" with it holliwoodish but still interesting entertaining exploration of Japanese culture. But what I saw was so cheesy that walking out of the theatre I felt like I start hating Tom Cruise for lurking me into the 2 hour popcorn- for-the-brains show. I always expected Tom Cruise to finally die, but he never did. Instead he went on chopping the samurais (who, supposedly dedicated all their life to the sword fighting art) right and left. The scenes where he trains with the master of sword remind me all those hundreds of cheesy Rambo-Kickboxer movies where the white Americans kick the asses of their Asian adversaries in the field of the martial arts after having trained those arts for some 10 minutes. The movie is quite expensive and has a pretense of being a historical drama, but the plot and the message of it are just way too cheesy. Hollywood clichés are oozing from every scene. The worst part is the ending where Tom Cruise (an Amercian officer who came to teach Japanese the modern Western war technique and subsequently underwent a transformation embracing the ""old ways"" of noble fighting with the katana sword) together with his noble friends dash in their last suicidal charge with the naked swords right onto the machine guns of emperor's army and... what I see: all Japanese are dead and Tom Cruise is still hanging on, all wounded of course, but alive and with this tremendously heroic face he tries to stand up, alone among the corpses of all his friends. Here the director apparently wants us to cry and sympathize with our hero, but all I felt was a creepy feeling that one might feel when observing something so utterly false and cheap cheesy that you want to shudder. So my verdict is: It is bad, very bad. Even for Tom Cruise.",The Last Samurai

423,Shandara,Eastern Braveheart - possible spoilers,10,5 December 2003,"Like many others have already said, this film is akin to Braveheart in its sweeping vistas, rousing fight scenes, and emotional impact.  I attended a sneak preview of Last Samurai with a large group of people and the reaction of probably 90% of us was what an incredible movie this was.  I'll be shocked if this doesn't get nominated for Best Picture, because it definitely should.  Rather than sing this great movie's praises like dozens of others have, though, I'd like to address some of the criticisms I've seen.First, yeah, Tom Cruise does tend to stick with roles that are very similar. He obviously likes playing the hero type.  But ya know what, he does it well, so as far as I'm concerned he can keep doing it.  Where do people get off saying he only plays one kind of role anyway?  I saw Vanilla Sky and I wouldn't equate that character to Algren.  Okay, so it's not De Niro in Untouchables versus De Niro in Men of Honor.  But Cruise kept me enthralled in Samurai, so who cares?And what's with people saying Samurai is humorless?  What about Bob? Or the scene where he's mimicking the samurai and the kid walks in?  My friends and I were loving it!  Okay, so they chose subtle humor over Jim Carrey--big deal.  I'm sorry the humor went over their heads, but geez...!And as to those people who felt that gratuitous sex/romance was lacking, go back to the eighties.  I'm just happy that Hollywood has finally grown up and realized that sex isn't necessary to the success of a movie. Frankly, overt sex/romance would've been terribly out of place in a movie about a culture that prides itself on its restraint.What it all boils down to for me is that I sat in that theater for 2 and a half hours and was disappointed when the credits rolled because I didn't want it to end.  I laughed, I cried, I marveled at the beautiful landscape and the very cool fight scenes, and I will be paying full price at the theater to see it again, as well as buying it on DVD in six months.",The Last Samurai
424,synthetic tom,What's up with the Western score in a Samurai flick?,6,12 December 2003,"The trailer for this movie got me all pumped up.  Set to some Japanese percussion, and wonderfully edited, the trailer sold me on the film.  Too bad the trailer was better than the movie.Not that the inclusion of a westernized musical score should doom the movie on its own, but I think that this decision is very representative of the huge number of poor choices that cause ""The Last Samurai"" to fail.  Funny that the theme of the film is Western civilization's encroachment on the purity of Japanese culture, because the film itself also manages to impose its Western views and Hollywood morals on the world of 1800's Japan, making it laughable in more than one instance.But I'm not going to get all bitter about it.  I still had fun watching the movie.  The locations are beautiful, the fight choreography is pretty good, and the costumes are awesome.  Although it runs a little long, it's not unbearable to sit through, and it's easy to take an interest in the main characters despite the formulaic script.Basically, it's a summer blockbuster-type movie that was released during Oscar season. If you don't go to many movies, don't waste your time with this one, go out and rent Seven Samurai instead.

He delivers a solid performance, especially at the very end.All of the supporting actors do a very good job. The cinematography is wonderful, and the direction is crisp.

Even if you are not a Tom Cruise fan (he's actually quite good inthis one), this is a film not to be missed! I jokingly refer to it as""Dances With Samurai,"" because plotwise, it is  very similar to""Dances With Wolves,"" although really, I think, it is much better. Infact, while the first half of the film is like ""Dances With Wolves,"" thesecond half is more like Braveheart - so if you liked either of thosefilms (or both), you will definitely like this one! This qualifier begs a debate on the merits of remaking oldplotlines for Hollywood movies, but when a film such as ""The LastSamurai"" comes along and is clearly better than its predecessor, Ihave no problem in giving it praise. For fans of historical epics, this will not disappoint - nor will it be adisappointment to those with an interest in Japanese culture, as itfocuses on ""Bushido,"" or the code of the Samurai warriors. Also, one last detail - I enjoy films such as this that do not insultmy intelligence by having the courage to present the actuallanguage of the country being portrayed.

429,krael74,A pretty bit of tedium,4,4 May 2004,"****Some Spoilers Follow****
Here we have the familiar ""Dances with Wolves"" cliche of the American so disgusted with the evils of his own country and past that he seeks enlightenment in a grossly misunderstood and embattled culture.Despite the ruthlessness of their initial introduction, the Samurai are cast almost as misunderstood peasants forced to take up arms against an invasive enemy. Despite the fact that said enemy is the emperor himself, the suggestion of blame seems to lie more with western culture...who have poisoned a gentle people with their railroads and rifles. The samurai's reliance on the sword in the face of superior weaponry seems to personify this, but is not a sword - despite it's glamourous hollywood image - an instrument of butchery as sure as a gun? Are those who carry it not just as capable of abusing it? And wasn't it the Japanese emperor himself who requested the presence of the American officers to modernize his military? Yet we are treated to righteous rebuke of the Americans by the same emperor...as if it were they who had forced themselves on the defenseless Japanese.Cruise's cynicism towards war seems to vanish after his turn. If taken as a rebellion against the acts he had seen and participated against in America, perhaps you'd have a more interesting character. Instead, his turn is treated as an awakening to a higher existence...never mind said existence is leaving just as bloody a trail as the one he left behind. The usual cereal-box treatment of eastern culture is tossed out complete with the gentle imagery of flower blossoms blowing on the wind, gentle snowfall and happy, running children only to be torn apart when the brutal, bullyish forces of the emperor (but not really) arrive to kill, torment and take up swords against little boys...and even among this, we're directed to a hired American officer for our villain rather than the Emperor.
Naturally, in the end, Cruise is the lone survivor of a massacre. Naturally, we're left with western culture to blame...as the American ambassador is sent packing with much bluster. It's familiar ground, just not as well executed.The movie is nice enough to look at, but unless you go in for this ""western root of all evil"" hollywood cliche, I'd skip this one. At one point, our wicked Colonel Bagley asks Nathan Algren what he has against his own people. He doesn't answer. Neither does this movie.",The Last Samurai

I snapped the film up the first day it became available on DVD and settled in to enjoy the film at last...and settled deeper in, and deeper in...is the film unending or does it only seem like it? Tom Cruise is wonderful  and I'm not particularly a fan  and Watanabe is great as his Samurai counterpart and the action sequences are rousingly filmed, but the filmmakers failed to remain true to the spirit of their story and so fall into ham-handed cliches, melodrama, and empty sentimentality. The director and writer, it seems, wanted not only to give the Tom Cruise the glorious death in battle that centers the film, but to keep him alive to save the Emperor from the wicked ways of the west AND to get the girl in the end, too.

I would say that I was a mild Cruise fan before this, and a much bigger one afterwards. This is by far his best movie. I would rate Top Gun as his previous best, but don't let that or the military theme confuse you. This movie is nothing at all like Top Gun in any way. It seems to me that the ""cocky, fall, humility, redemption"" theme that was the centerpiece of virtually all Cruise's movie's up to Jerry Maguire has been put out to pasture.Ken Watanabe was better than magnificent.I have refused to buy a DVD player, as DVD's are more expensive than VHS, and I resent that given that I believe the manufacturing costs are about the same.

Tom Cruise performed the best performance in his artistic career, as he presented a character that you can see yourself in, the character is not just a worrier, this character resemblance of a hurted humen like angry, secretive and confused because of his hideous past,acts that he tries to overlook and forget by isolation and drinking, but his living conscience does not allow him to forget. Indeed, everything is inevitable, and fate has sent Nathan Algren to a people in a completely different world. All they want is to preserve their position, their offspring, and their threatened future, and fate has sent Algren the confused and lost person who has the ability and skill in the war that exhausted his psyche in order to fight against them; But the table have turned and they took him as a prisoner and then turned into a friend! He offers them assistance as the people helped him to find inner peace and the way of salvation to atone for his sins.Let's turn to art. This film presented us with all the arts to the fullest extent. This work is masterpiece and beautiful, calm and escalating story in a calm and logical manner, and presented us with the most beautiful and breathtaking cinematography and showed us the green nature of Japan with a unique character mixed with simple Japanese customs and traditions. The creator Hans Zimmer presented us with music mixed with hope and helps to meditate on some moments that a person suffers from, and then comes the presto mixed with cinematography to replace your unhappy moments with pleasant and positive ones.I liked the film very much, and it contains alot of lessons, judgments, and moral ethics. And I cannot limit the expressive phrases in this movie as meaning to be said, ""Tell me how he died emperor says, I will tell you how he lived algren said."" To this degree, Captain Algren was affected by the samurai leader who was his enemy and turned into his friend by the intervention of fate. Indeed, it is a great work and will not be repeated ever.",The Last Samurai
433,Iverson2001,"Amazing, something enjoyable and most interesting.",10,15 December 2003,"What could I say about The Last Samurai...an amazing movie with great directing and surprising I could say with most confidence that Tom Cruise was meant for that role. Deserves a 8 1/2 stars and should be in the top 100 for such a great and powerful storyline. Also there is great cinematography, along with great acting from other co-actors.",The Last Samurai
434,demonichorde69,A truly fantastic show!,10,7 December 2003,"Walking into the movie i was skeptical, Tom Cruise pulling crazy moves with a sword without making a fool out of himself, not possible.  I was however completely blown away by this movie.  With scenery that compared to Kurosawas action comparing to bravehearts and one of Tom Cruises best performances it is by far one of my favorite movies of all time.  Although the Hollywood aspect is still there and very blatant it is overshadowed by the other elements of the movie.  The companionship, honor, compassion and beliefs displayed by the characters is very moving.  I am 16 and although the opinion of a 16 year old boy may not seem like much to you, let me say this.  I have never cried or even teared during a movie nor have i ever felt much of a twinge of sadness but during a number of scenes in this movie, whether from the beauty of some things or the death of others i felt water building in my eyes.  If you enjoyed the movie Shichinin no samurai (The Seven Samurai) you will like this movie.  Zwick does not let Kurosawa down, using some of his elements and creating some knew ones of his own.
--Spoiler Below--
One of the characters in this movie so strongly reminded me of The Seven Samurai that i had to comment on it.  Its like Zwick used an allusion to this legendary movie and it came out at me with startling effects.  The quiet old man known affectionately as Bob, although a quiet character throughout the movie, was striking at the end.  Throwing himself infront of a bullet, getting shot, and then standing up once again to strike down the one that shot him.  Just as the quiet samurai did in The Seven Samurai. Because of this and many other elements of the movie that seem taken directly from greater movies, with (although somewhat historically incorrect) a great plot line i give this movie a 10/10... if you go see this i guarantee you will not leave feeling ripped off.",The Last Samurai
435,thywerz,it has some good moments,5,11 January 2004,Some of the fight scenes are awesome. The digital effects are pretty good however there are a few problems.

436,kaplara,The last Hollywood waste?,6,26 January 2005,"As may be gleaned from the above title, I was not terribly impressed with this film, which was not to say it didn't have high points.We'll start with what was impressive. Tom Cruise. The scene where he is selling rifles while drunk and half reliving his Indian fighting days had some creepy and impressive acting. When his military superior pulls him aside and Cruise tells him he'd kill him for free, chilling. When the translator asks how to scalp someone, and Cruise shows him, freaky. But these are just a few scenes; it's not that Cruise is bad during the rest of the movie, just that he has few lines which are at all impressive outside of those 3 scenes. Besides, by half way through the movie you're thinking oh not another boring Hollywood plot, which of course it is.Well, I was already started on what's bad, so I'll continue. Essentially although none of the acting is bad, the plot is stupid putrid Hollywood garbage. It is always so sad when a movie starts with promise and ends up being such a fizzle. I mean did he have to live with the wife of the man he killed? I mean if she didn't fall in love with him and just hated him throughout the movie I wouldn't care, but she did fall in love with him, how ridicules! To make matters worse, white boy insists on riding into battle dressed as a samurai, and being the only survivor to return the fallen master's samurai's sword to the emperor. Oh, and who can forget the scene in which all the Japanese military, who just finished the slaughter, bowed to the people they killed, STUPID. Hollywood needs some new ideas, why couldn't they have let the movie progress with good dialog and interesting introspection. I found the scene in which the master of the samurai was looking at the Indian pouch a very telling and powerful moment, no noise, no violence, no campy push for a tear, just letting what is be, and letting that have the power. Towards the end the movie has way too much slow motion death and forced sadness, it's hokey and over-dramatic.While this is no Battlefield Earth, I still could not recommend it overall. Parts of this movie show great potential, and parts reek of Hollywood hype.~Ryan",The Last Samurai
437,siobhandenton,Superb,8,13 July 2006,"What can I say, the only film that starred Tom Cruise during which I forgot I was watching the Tom Cruise show. I cannot believe that Cruise did not win an Oscar for his role as Capt. Nathan Algren a disillusioned civil war hero who spends much of his time drunk and in menial employment. Sent to Japan to fight the Samurai-who are fighting against the emperor's weak-willed natured and his advisers who are determined to westernise Japan; he finds himself joining their cause, and finding meaning in their lifestyle. Not only are the relationships in the film handled with extreme poignancy especially between Taka and Algren. The camera work lovingly shows Japan in all its beauty and you can understand just why Algren would be seduced by such a lifestyle.A truly brilliant film, which went much ignored when released, I urge you to watch this film, especially if you liked Gladiator, Dances With Wolves or The Last of The Mohicans or if you just enjoy a great film and a great story with great attention to detail. Edward Zwick's direction tells the story at a measured pace, it seems unusual in films released today to actually find a great story; however this is certainly not the case with The Last Samurai.",The Last Samurai

You've seen this story a hundred times before, in better films... the fish-out-of-water beginnings, followed by the inevitable reluctant-mutual-respect, and eventually, the rebellious partnership. I don't understand all the praise that has been heaped upon this dull, formulaic action film. Perhaps it's American affinity for Asian culture.

446,CinemaBrit@aol.com,Exactly as you'd expect,8,20 March 2004,"As wholly predictable a picture as i've seen in recent years, this is nevertheless impressive entertainment; criticized heavily by some for attempting to emulate the 'Dances With Wolves' formula in the Japanese world (as if copying what works in Costner's masterpiece is ill-advised), Edward Zwick's 'Samurai' epic unabashedly sweeps all such cliches along in its earnest and often stirring story.Late nineteenth century Japan: US military officer Nathan Algren is hired to train a new imperialist army to fight against rebel samurai warriors. Defeated, his brave stand whilst surrounded arouses the curiosity of the rogue samurai leader, who takes his wounded foe back to his village to recover. Thus begins a relationship that will change Algren forever... offering him a chance to face his haunting past...Tom Cruise delivers a standout performance that recollects moments of his amazing Ron Kovic in 'Born on the Fourth of July'. This dignified actor here showcases an on-screen charisma that few can match in his generation. Ken Watanabe displays searing intensity as the tribal leader who commands the respect of Algren, through both his intelligence and fighting prowess.The fight scenes are incredibly tense and brutal, and the cinematography by turns painterly and immediate. Pretty much what you'd expect then: but when movies are this enjoyable, that is no bad thing.",The Last Samurai
447,with_the_flames_i_die126,Without question one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.,10,27 April 2014,"The 2003 film 'The Last Samurai' is such a great but overlooked and underrated movie. I don't remember hearing much about it when it came out (maybe because I was only 13), but decided to check it out one night from Hollywood Video. After watching it, I can honestly say I have never been so emotionally connected to a movie in my life. I immediately decided I was going to spend the $20 to buy it, and watched it probably close to 20 times over the next 2 years. 10 years later it still remains one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie follows Captain Nathan Algren, an Indian War survivor who has become an alcoholic and theater actor in an attempt to forget slaughtering the innocent Indian tribes he was ordered to during the war. He receives a visit from an old friend with a job opportunity: train Japanese peasants to soldier in order to stop the Samurai rebellion in Japan. He accepts and we now have our character journey. The basic story is one you've seen before, and more than once. A soldier on one army joins/gets captured by the other side, and through spending time with the enemy, ends up pledging to their cause. The Last Samurai uses this formula, but makes it believable and real. While watching the movie, you understand why the appeal of the Samurai are more than that of his own army, and you believe that for the first time in his life he's willing to die for something he believes in. While the story is unoriginal, the characters are what drives this movie. It is very much a character movie, and when something unfortunate happens to one, you empathize with them. Tom Cruise gives an Oscar worthy performance as the lead, but as far as standouts go, Ken Watanabe owns this movie with his performance as Katsumoto. He puts so much into being a tribal leader willing to die for what he believes in, and you buy it completely. Honestly one of the best performances I've ever seen, without question one of my favorites. The movie is worth watching based on Watanabe's performance alone.The supporting cast is just as great too. Everyone from Katsumoto's sister Taka, who has to take care of Algren when he had unknowingly done something terrible to her family, to his son Nobutada, to the American and Japanese generals, everyone does their part to make the characters real and believable. You also feel an emotional tie with all the characters, which is a credit to the acting as well as the writing. Definitely have to give credit to the writers here, they may not have followed history perfectly, but they gave quite a few characters with some serious depth to them, and I felt such a strong emotional tie with them. One final element of greatness to this movie was the score by Hans Zimmer. Easily one of the greatest composers in Hollywood with credentials like The Dark Knight, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lion King, and Inception to name a few, I personally think this might be his best work. Very few soundtracks do I listen to after the movie is over, and this is one of them. The score fits the movie perfectly and does nothing but enhance the performances and ties you feel with the characters. It's such a beautiful and yet somber score, that you can't help but listen to it and almost cry at the same time. I'm listening to it on repeat as I write this now because it's that breathtaking. As I mentioned, I first saw this movie when it came out on DVD in 2004 and watched it numerous times over the next couple years. It's been at least 6 or 7 since I've watched it, so I decided to buy it on Blu-ray and give it a re-watch. The re-watch reaffirmed why this movie is still in my top 5 favorites of all time, a list shared with The Dark Knight, The Prestige, The Return of the King, and Inception. For me, a great movie is not defined by spectacle, it's defined by story and characters. Spectacle should add to a movie, not define it. And that's how I feel about all these movies. They are all strongly built on characters, and it's those movies that give the emotional ties. Out of all of them, this one and The Return of the King probably have had the biggest emotional effect on me, they're 2 movies that I am very likely to tear up during. In closing, there's not enough good things I can say about this movie. Obviously everyone's different and some will like the film more than others, but I do believe the story is strong and the characters are great enough that most people will enjoy this movie on some level. It just so happens that for me it struck all the right nerves, which is why I rate it so highly and love it so much. I definitely can't call it a 'feel good movie' and it is fairly long (about 2 and a half hours) and draining as well. But it is without question worth watching and in my opinion, worth many re-watches. A truly rare gem that never got the recognition it deserves. 10/10.",The Last Samurai
448,ZweiBlumen,Well-done historical action drama with some minor flaws,7,9 December 2003,"""The Last Samurai"" is the story of Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a war hero tormented by guilt for his past deeds and seeking to drown himself in a bottle. Just as things are looking their worst, he is offered a new job: Travel to Japan and teach the Emperor's troops the ways of modern warfare, in an effort to squash a rebellion of samurai led by one Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). The story is fairly predictable: Without going into too much detail, Algren is captured by the samurai and comes to respect their beliefs and way of life, eventually joining their side in an effort to redeem himself for the Native Americans he had killed, and whom he sees mirrored in this proud warrior culture.The movie is beautifully shot, with great care given to the costumes and landscapes. The peaceful samurai village has an almost mystical air, of some far-off legend which cannot exist in the modern world. There is plenty of action and heroism, and a suitably grand battle scene to end things. It's all been done before, but this does not mean the movie is not entertaining.The one problem I have had was the over-use of cheap devices to provoke emotion, which had the action bordering on melodrama on several occasions. We don't need slow, sad music and slow-motion footage every time some character dies or gets hurt. Subtly inserting emotional content is one thing, but this film takes it and beats you over the head with it, then shoves it down your throat. It felt rather insulting and unnecessary, almost like the sad equivalent of a laugh track. But perhaps it was just me.Nevertheless, this was overall an entertaining and well-shot quasi-historical drama / action film, with plenty of enjoyment for all movie-goers.",The Last Samurai
449,pkarnold,"Watch it, smell it, taste it, grasp it!",9,15 February 2012,"This is a movie I will stop and watch again, and understand something valuable that I never noticed before. And that fact alone makes The Last Samurai an excellent movie.First of all, I love cross cultural movies and this is one of the best. You can learn so much from the approaches of people in different cultures, and their interactions. The Last Samurai can be compared to Dances with Wolves. Both movies have an epic quality about them, well directed, wonderfully filmed and scored. Both movies are a cinematic sensual experience. But as strong as these aspects of The Last Samurai are, it is the human life themes that are important. It is the movie's message to the mind that matters.Lieutenant Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, is a post Civil War cavalry officer who suffers from the guilt of killing women and children on the raid of an Indian village. Ironically, he is recruited by Colonel Bagby who led the raid, and by Mr. Omura of Japan to train a modern Japanese army. Omura represents the modernists of Japan, who wish to wrestle away political control from the remaining traditional Samurai war lords of Japan.Algren, who would prefer to drink himself into oblivion and at times wishes for death to take him, is actually a wonderful trainer and leader of men. He knows how to communicate and encourage his young Japanese peasants to become effective fighters. But Omura and Colonel Bagby have their own time-line, because Lord Katsumoto is raiding Omura's railroad. They believe Katsumoto's forces cannot stand up against a modern army with rifles. Algren knows his young trainees are not ready, and this fight will be a bloodbath.If there is a formula for success in recent movies it is action scenes, and this movie has four such action/battle scenes. They are important to the movie's structure, and in the battles many people are killed. Still, the plot structure allows the movie to move to the valleys in between the action scenes, and this is where the beauty of this movie occurs. Characters are explored, and viewers see the growth of people.In the first battle, Algren refuses to retire to the rear and fights with his trainees against a full-blown traditional Samurai force attack. He sees his friend Sergeant Zebulon Gant killed in the charge, and fights to the very end, somehow avoiding death and taking the life of Katsumoto's brother in a last desperate attempt to survive. Katsumoto is moved, perhaps by the tiger banner of the spear that Algren uses to fight off the Samurai's forces, to take the American prisoner.As Algren recovers from his serious battle wounds in Katsumato's sister-in-law's (Taka) house, and in the presence of Katsumoto's son (Nobutada), he also begins to heal spiritually isolated in this village from the rest of the world because the mountain passes have been closed by winter snows. He relates well with the children of Taka's house, and these small personal moments help show the normalcy of daily living salving the captain's troubled soul.He admires the diligence of the people of Katsumoto's village, each seeking to be as perfect in their duties as they are able. He develops a friendship with Katsumoto; Algren understanding the honor and courage of this man, and his people, and Katsumoto and his village admiring the perseverance of this stranger.At one point in the movie, Katsumoto finds out that Algren knew George Custer, and mentions how marvelous he was to fight to the death. However, Algren counters that 'Custer was a terrible general whose arrogance needlessly cost the lives of 200 men.' In that statement there is the contrast of the two cultures. The Japanese culture valued honor and courage in death, while the American saw honor and courage in life.Algren is a good student of the Japanese language, and the use of the Samurai sword, so good in fact that he is able to help defend his adopted family, village, and Katsumoto from a band of ninja assassins hired by Omura. The American has gone from being a prisoner to an honored friend, with respect from each party growing into admiration. When he returns to Tokyo, his loyalty has shifted from Omura and Colonel Bagby to Katsumoto and his village.The third action scene is his helping Katsumoto to escape back to his village, and then Algren organizing resistance against the more highly trained Imperial army that now has cannon and Gatling guns in the dramatic final battle, with Algren somehow again surviving.This movie is about life and death, and honestly writers John Logan, Edward Zwick (director), and Marshall Herskovitz communicate well the beauty, and sometimes the struggle of life; and the terrible waste of life in war. Tom Cruise does an excellent job of understating his character--he is extremely believable. Ken Watanabe is also excellent as Katsumoto, but all the actors in this movie are believable, particularly the villains.This movie is not perfect. Some situations seem a little unlikely. But sometimes real life seems unlikely. A viewer can enjoy the scenery, the musical score, the acting, and indeed the entire film. But hopefully the viewer will also perceive the contrasts of the cultural philosophies, and ultimately the complimentary natures of differing cultural philosophies.",The Last Samurai

The cinematography was excellent; the fight scenes, especially the scene of the samurais vs. the modern Japanese army was outstanding.

I'm generally not a Cruise fan and was not impressed with the trailers for this movie.  However, a few friends said that the film was excellent, so I gave it a shot.I'm glad that I did.

453,olsta1976,Cruise's Finest Hour,8,9 September 2013,"Many people dismiss Tom Cruise unfairly. Yes it's true that he's starred in more than his fair share of Hollywood blockbuster bullcrap but occasionally he appears in the odd gem just to remind audiences that he can actually act. Born on the 4th of July, Jerry Maguire, and A Few Good Men are a few examples. This film is most definitely another.The basic storyline isn't anything you haven't seen before. Soldier goes to war. Soldier gets caught by enemy. Soldier learns to love enemy culture. Soldier fights for enemy against former comrades. We've seen the plot before in Dances With Wolves with native Americans and Confederate soldiers. More recently we've seen the plot in Avatar with aliens and marines. What sets this apart from all the others is the sheer breathtaking beauty of the cinematography, the level of authenticity in recreating ancient Japan, the attention to detail in depicting Samurai culture, and the utterly brilliant Ken Watanabe in the supporting role as the legendary Samurai warlord Katsumoto. On a deeper level the film also serves as a poignant observation of how technological progress and so called civility can destroy century old tradition to the heartbreaking detriment of society.Initially the Samurai are depicted as vicious warmongering savages. However along with the character of Nathan, played by Tom Cruise, we are taken on a journey of enlightenment to the Way of the Samurai so emotionally gripping and compelling that the viewer cannot help but feel completely awestruck by the end credits. This is a film that you will remember for a very long time and that you will re-visit time and again.If you like beautiful visuals, if you like excellent acting, if you like breathtaking action, and if you like historical fact instead of the usual Hollywood embellishment, then this film is definitely for you.",The Last Samurai
454,jharvey-4,"Very Good...But Almost Identical To ""Dances With Wolves""",8,2 April 2004,"About every 3-4 movies, Tom Cruise likes to remind us that he really can act. He did it with ""Rain Man"" and ""Born On The Fourth of July"", and now he's done it with ""The Last Samurai"".""The Last Samurai"" tells an epic story set in Japan during the late 19th's century when the island nation first opened its doors to Western ways and trade, sparking a cultural battle between the old ways epitomized by the samurai and the new ways of the outside world. This is the Japan as seen by Cruise's character, Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War hero haunted by battlefield horrors to the point where he has become a self-hating, alcoholic plugging Winchester rifles for $25/week.Algren is recruited by his former commanding officer to travel to Japan and help train the nation's fledgling army. Specifically, his new employers want their modern army to defeat rebel samurai who aggressively oppose the invasion of Western thought and technology into their culture. With nothing to lose and a significant pay raise to gain, Algren accepts and soon finds himself drilling conscripted Japanese farmers.Against his recommendations, Algren is forced to lead his barely-trained troops against the samurai. Algren's troops are slaughtered even though the samurai fight with traditional weapons (sword, spear, bows & arrows). Algren is captured by the samurai leader, Katsumoto (skillfully played by veteran Japanese actor Ken Watanabe), so that he may learn about his American enemy.It is here that we get to the meat of the story. Algren is held captive in the samurai's mountain village where he gradually becomes more involved and amazed by the samurai lifestyle and philosophy. While he slowly becomes integrated into their culture, he never quite convinces himself that he's one of them. Nonetheless, as his relationship with the samurai switches from being adversarial to deep friendship, and even love, we are treated to a series of rich and emotional transformations for both Algren and the samurai. In most movies, this would be the ""slow"" part between battle scenes. In ""The Last Samurai"" conversation gets balanced with action to keep you involved in both the story and the action.On many levels, it is as much a deftly-told love story as it is an epic adventure. And not just a stock love story. ""The Last Samurai"" wraps the love of ones culture, love between a man and a woman, and the deep, familial bond between soldiers into one story.Considering the barrage of summer/autumn action thrillers, we're not accustomed to films like ""The Last Samurai"". Here we see director Edward Zwick (who also directed 1989's ""Glory"" and 1994's ""Legends of the Fall"") use a more thoughtful pace to let us settle into the story, watch characters interact, and then ramp up the tension with carefully placed (and beautifully filmed) battle scenes. ""The Last Samurai"" leads the audience through a broad range of emotions and shouldn't be compared to the high-octane action films we've watched for the past few months.So, overall it is a very good and powerful story. But as you're watching ""The Last Samurai"" you may get the sense that you've seen this very good and powerful story before. And perhaps you have. It was called ""Dances With Wolves"", another fine epic film that addressed the same themes, conflicts, and even used many of the same character types that are carbon-copied into ""The Last Samurai"".This isn't necessarily a criticism. The story worked for audiences before and ""The Last Samurai"" adds enough new angles to avoid being a blatant rip-off. After all, ""Dances With Wolves"" was ultimately a loose rework of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and no one seemed to mind.",The Last Samurai
455,vatsalspandya,More Picturesque than meaningful,8,10 July 2012,"The picturization of this movie is above all. It has beautifully captured the countryside of Japan. This does make you feel the peace and beauty of the countryside of Japan. Yet , it goes very slow in that part too. Its probably a 30 min content increased to an hour. Even I felt that Tom Cruise struggled in most of the scenes in the countryside and he was more sort of dumb in that part. Common, you can speak thru your expressions which always seems a blank face on Tom Cruise. Though, he rocks in the action and initial scenes. The Samurai fight in slow-mo is amazing. Bow and Arrow is good too. The idea almost comes good of modern vs old weapons but it a little pace could have helped. Also, the story is rather simple on the whole and mostly predictable too in the later stages. But, the plus point of the movie except the picturization is Ken Watanabe. He steals the show whenever on screen. He perfectly fits into Katsumoto till his last breath. Overall, this movie sometimes bores you but it is still pleasing(7/10).",The Last Samurai

You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life."" - Katsumoto It is probably one of the saddest and most inevitable things in this world - war. And though war should not be tolerated at all, a civil war - when brother goes against brother, when those who share the same history, culture and language go one against another, this kind of war is the most horrible and painful.  ""The Last Samurai"", an epic action movie directed by Edward Zwick, is enlightening the events that took place in The Land of the Rising Sun of the late 19th century. The main character, Captain Nathan Algren, a lonely tortured soldier who's been trying to redeem his life back from the atrocities and nightmares of war is being dragged into the whirlpool of a new one far away from his homeland. Times are changing fast, and dictated by the examples of other countries Japan is gradually but firmly going from the old native ""samurai-like"" way of life country to a modern technological western style of living. ""Progress is a stepping stone of civilization"" - some say, but it doesn't mean that civilization itself progresses. Samurais, as the eternal symbol of the Japanese culture and as its guardians protest against the changes that civilization brings. Railroads, western cloth and food, western buildings and technologies, firearms and war tactics - all this might seem to be building a strong country ready to enter the international arena, but these things also tend to consume everything that Japan represents of itself - dedication, discipline, spirituality, philosophy. Katsumoto - the last leader of the samurai clan is trying to convince the emperor in his wrong choice of blindly following all modern tendencies and letting the country be corrupted by capitalism that hides under the mask of industrialization. Allowing other nations to have influence over Japan can be a crucial decision that might lead it onto the road of full obedience and dependence from other ""world players"". But will his words ever reach the emperor's ears, will he ever be able to keep the legacy of his ancestors... is he alone in this fight? The movie focuses on the most important changes in the Japanese society in the late 19th century and tries to show it from the standpoint of the main hero, American captain, who happens to be very far from understanding everything Japan stands on at first, but ends as one who has found peace and comfort in a culture as distant as America and Japan are on the world map. The directors' work is great - displaying every bit of the eastern culture and lifestyle in a slow pace really makes us almost ""taste"" the spirit of the Samurai Epoch. Same can be said of the operators' work - paying much attention to details, whether it's a battle scene or a peaceful one, you will see the whole spectrum of events under different angles and from different points. Actors' work doesn't stop to surprise: Tom Cruise in the skin of Captain Algren - firm veteran of war, who has taken his part in suppressing the Indian rebellion during his war career and already has many sins haunting his mind making him be ashamed of who he has become; Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto - a true samurai by blood and by his heart, dedicated, strong and unbendable, the one who has the strength to follow his way of worldview and to lead others by his example; so different and yet so same, both are children of war, only, one saw it as a merciless, gruesome and unjustly slaughtering reaper, the other - as the way of ideals, morality, perfection, discipline, philosophy, virtue,.. and as the true way of the sword. Their distant roads have crossed to make them both understand what the destiny of a true warrior is. Secondary heroes like Billy Connolly (as Sergeant Zeb), Tony Goldwyn (as Colonel Bagley), Masato Harada (as Mr. Omura), Timothy Spall (as Simon Graham) and Hiroyuki Sanada (as Ujio) also deserve to be praised for building strong supporting characters and the background atmosphere of the movie.  Writing is screaming of majestic delight, unique vision and philosophical beauty. You will probably never find another action movie which concentrates its plot around religion, culture and spirituality that much as this one, and not only concentrates, but depicts it in the most harmonic way possible. Costume design, sets and decorations, makeup, special effects, fighting choreography, staging, views and heavenly gorgeous landscapes of The Land of the Rising Sun - everything is on the impeccable level, interweaving with one another draws a picture of splendid beauty and strikes into your memory forever. Nothing less to expect from a ""hundred-million-dollar"" Hollywood movie with not only technical quality, but a lot of heart in it. The original score. Hans Zimmer. Not many words can describe this cosmic sublimity. It's like lying on a soft cloud with a cotton moon as a pillow, covered with blanket made of mild night with shining stars and angels are coming down from the sky singing lullaby and rocking you to sleep. It's a pure magic dream, where violin is a cloud, flute is a moon, trumpet is a blanket and the angel's voices are a mix of shakuhachi, taiko drums and other national Japanese instruments. Beautifully calm and violently stormy, starting with delicate koto melody, than letting the drums and percussions take over turning the mood from the softly-sweet to the battle-ready, the music emphasizes the spirit of every scene as it accompany the viewer through the film. Taking the breathtaking ""Way of the Sword"" track at the final battle scene - while bullets fly around, Algren holds dying Katsumoto in his arms and music becomes especially tender as though symbolizing his departure and a relief from all the hardships and duties he bared through his life. Fascinatingly crafted Asian-like music - ""The Last Samurai's"" original score will rightfully take its place among the Hans Zimmer's finest works. 4 Oskar nominees (Best Supporting Actor, Best Decorations, Best Costumes, Best Sound Mixing) and dozens of other awards and nominations... philosophical, touching, captive - ""The Last Samurai"" will forever be on the list of the most brilliant movie works of our time!",The Last Samurai
457,mileniumanimator,Wonderful Film,10,13 March 2005,"I disagree with a lot of the reviews of this film. Yes, it is true that it does glorify a lifestyle in an exaggerated and unfairly sublime way, but I think we're missing the point. This film is romanticism vs. modernism. It's purity vs. corruption. It's not so much the premise or believability, but the substance behind it.Tom Cruise is an actor who is both idolized (by fans) and ridiculed (by critics) In this film he dazzles us as a drunken U.S General haunted by a bloody past. I was pushing for him to get an Oscar Nod, but alas, None came. ""The Last Samurai"" wasn't particularly well received and that was disconcerting to me. I'd recommend it to anyone with a taste for romance and for anyone who simply longs for a little less ""celebrity wedding"" and a little more ""help the old lady across the road"".",The Last Samurai
458,eveflower1970,Could've been a masterpiece.,7,2 September 2019,"Edward Zwick's ""The Last Samurai"" (2003) aspires to revive the Japanese epics of the 1950s. It also follows already successful formulas - that of Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" (2000) and Kevin Costner's ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990) - but it doesn't live up to neither of the two.What I specifically wanted to point out was the great potential this film had. Good storyline, interesting characters, and astonishing cinematography. But it eventually fell prey to commercialism, as well as rushed photography and post-production processes.
I'd like to begin with the well-done aspects of this film - the cinematography and the theme. The sets were simply sublime. They could've done so much more with them. The theme is that of old-values-versus-modern-attributes, perfectly suited for the period in which the film is set.Now, the weaknesses of this film - that could've easily been avoided. First of all, they ruined the stunning cinematography with horrendous framing. I prefer to blame this on the limited time they granted the photography process rather than on the director's abilities. Another technical mistake they made was almost always playing the soundtrack. Don't get me wrong, Hans Zimmer did an incredible job crafting the wonderful piece of music for this picture, but it was heavily overused. It suited some of the scenes, but others would've been greater without the accompaniment of a soundtrack.At 154 minutes of runtime, I didn't get to know the characters I was supposed to care for, therefore the final battle didn't feel as dramatic to me. There needed to be more time granted the characters, their backstories, and their motives.And lastly, the casting choice of Timothy Spall didn't enhance him nor the film. Don't get me wrong, he's pretty good in his field of work - comedies, fantasy or overall strange films - but he doesn't benefit such a serious picture as this one.In conclusion, this motion picture shows us what differentiates a masterpiece from just a good movie - it's the little mistakes the average audience person doesn't mind, or detect, for that matter. I believe this movie must be shown in film universities because there are mistakes that aspiring filmmakers can learn from.My rating: 7.1/10",The Last Samurai
459,zarminae-machupeechu,good movie- wont do well in USA b/c of questions it raises- like Minority Report,8,5 December 2003,"Like Minority Report, which raised political questions that most Americans would like to stay oblivious about- this movie, too, will probably not do as well as it should in front of an audience that does not want to face its past and present in its massacre of traditional people's and the politics of trade and the economics of war (the Americans trying to sell a unilaterally profitable treaty to the Japanese emperor and the aim of selling arms).Gorgeous movie- and while I have read some of the criticisms (too short character development of the Tom Cruise character; largely humorless; Braveheart-ish) I tend to disagree with each one of these.
1- They may not have shown each second of his character development, but the course of time narrated during the characters time in ""captivity"" can lead us to conclude that it did not happen in 60 seconds.2- War is humorless, but an audience fed on scatological humor of the usual feel-good crap churned out by Hollywood EXPECTS it.3- Most heroes in most stories are all versions of the same archetypal hero.

460,mdud,A flawed but good film,7,2 July 2004,"A film trying to better Dances with Wolves was always going to have to pull out the stops and for the most part this film manages it. The sweeping vistas, the beautiful countryside are all recurring themes in both of these films, where the Last Samurai actually exceeds expectation is that into the cocktail mixer of plot lines, they have thrown in, for good measure a dash of ""redemption of the soul"". Cruise does his best and is fairly convincing as a military commander who has lost his way, disillusioned by the politics surrounding decisions in war. He genuinely looks peaceful and serene (and who wouldn't be in an idyllic village where all you have to do is exactly what you WANT to do) and is also convincing in major battle scenes.However the film has a major flaw as far as I am concerned and people can criticise the script, the directing, the production, the special effects as long as you like, I really don't care, it's a good film in my opinion. But what REALLY irritated me about this film is that the first half of it is spent building up the fact that the Samurai have been masters of war for a thousand years and that they are highly noble, honourable, self-trained killers. Tom Cruises character comes along and all of a sudden the mighty Samurai leader looks to Tom for ever single battle decision that needs to be made, for either reassurance or inspiration. It's ridiculous! At some moments, Tom actually orders the troops himself without actually consulting the leader! It's yet another ""Thank god the Americans have come along to fight the war for us, we never would have coped without them! which I find utterly hilarious because the Americans have a terrible reputation in war - they haven't won against a major power war since WW2 (Iraq is not a major power) and wouldn't have even won that if it hadn't of been for the British resistance beforehand and afterwards.This film would have been an awful lot better if they had taken the chest beating American stuff out of it.",The Last Samurai

This movie was beautiful, well acted and directed, and the ending got to me. But Tom Cruise is white, not Japanese.When we watched this movie, it was right after Tom Cruises anti-earth rant on TV. In my personal opinion, the guy should not be allowed anywhere where an idea he is against has been proved over and over again, and he thinks that it's all bull. But as an actor, he is great.If not for Tom Cruise, I would've voted 9, and if not for the white guy, 10.But not watching this movie is a far worse offense than anything that Tom Cruise has done, is doing, and will certainly do.",The Last Samurai

Please don't get me wrong - I am of a very high opinion regarding Lord Of The Rings, but... The Last Samurai was much deeper movie, with one of the best acting, especially by Ken Watanabe. Tom Cruise in this movie is also magnificent. Emotions of it affected me much more then any other film I saw in 2003. Besides, the scenery and cinematography is just breathtaking.

Good for you Tom, your movie showed when the substance is strong enough there is no need to get assistance from obscenity. This movie depicts the romance and the elegance of women in the most poetic way. In this age, when women's role and involvements in the society are equal or greater than men, I do feel sorry for famed actresses who had to drop their pants to get where they are. We need to support more movies like this which shows the grace and dignity of the women.  I think the time is overdue for women to voice their opinion in regards to Hollywood making billions of $$ in the cost of women's dignity and in the cost of promoting ""da.."" and stupidity and etc.",The Last Samurai
465,Yagamei,A Brilliant Film,10,15 January 2005,"It's easy to criticize many areas of this film - the fact that Cruise's character is heavily exaggerated, the fact that this film is not by any means 100% accurate to the historical satsuma rebellion, the fact that there is an unnecessary romance that doesn't do much to help the overall plot. It's Hollywood, guys - of COURSE there is going to be some mish-mash to reel in larger audiences.Regardless, this is still, for a mainstream Hollywood picture, a fantastic film. It is filled with gorgeous imagery that will stick in your head for days upon seeing. The acting is superb, particularly that of Ken Watanabe, whose emotions are conveyed perfectly, and realistically. He plays a truly inspirational role of which all of us can learn from. I could go on about how well done this film is, down to its rich musical score, and vibrant camera-work - but I feel it is important to understand the meaning of this film. Japan, for many years, was the only true nation-state in all of our World. Seeing western influences and the flow of time warping what was once a truly admirable and original culture is heartbreaking - and this film captures that painful transition wonderfully. If you open your mind and engage yourself in this film, you will without doubt enjoy it. It is a moving, important work of art that may just leave you reflecting upon your own culture, and how much it has changed over the years. I may just be over-analyzing, but all the same, I will always have the utmost respect and love for The Last Samurai. Forget Cruise. It's all about Watanabe, and showcasing the strength and virtue of classic Japanese culture.",The Last Samurai
466,gunty40,Filmic poetry,10,24 June 2013,"How to write a review that can fully express my appreciation for the last samurai is very difficult.To avoid all the confusion of 'what the hell is Tom Cruise doing in a movie about samurai?', watch the movie with the premise that Ken Watanabe's character is the protagonist and Tom is a translator to bridge the Japanese culture with the west.Upon visiting a Japanese friend in Yokohama, I asked everyone I met if they believed the movie represented the through should of Japan. They all said yes.This is one of those movies where the different elements such as storyline, film score and acting performance enforce each other into creating an unforgettable emotional roller-coaster and climax.The movie artfully captures two clashes; the clash of a modernizing Japan, in conflict with its time honoured traditions and the clash of a warrior that has lost his purpose with a person whose sole purpose it is to be a warrior.Undoubtedly one of Hans Zimmer's finest scores; put on 'a small measure of peace' and simply close your eyes and you will feel what I mean.Simply breathtaking",The Last Samurai
467,le_wizardo,One of the Best Films I've Seen in a While,10,23 January 2004,"Although I may appear biased, I am a sucker for a film which talks about a certain code of ethics -especially if its a japanese one! This film is not the best of its kind, and neither the writer nor the director could fully convey the way of the japanese people. I'm not an expert but I've seen my share of japanese films (and some chinese and korean and I don't mean action movies). I would say that this film is probably one of the closest American films that could grasp -if any at all, the culture of a foreign nation. I would also like to state for the record that the american cinema has been pretty weak for about 5 years now and this is probably one of the few films that I liked since that time (I don't even have to start and mention the awfull fashions of sequels and remakes of old films).I couldn't find a better or worse person than Tom Cruize to take the role of Captain Nathan Algren. His facial feature are excellent for the role but his integrity as an actor I find low (except for his roles in ""A Few Good Men"" and ""Rain Man""). This made me lose some of the seriousness I would have found in his role were it not him playing it. Still, I have to salute Tom for his decision in taking this role -its a good one. People might say that this film tried to convey more than its worth and some may even say that tries to force out a tear or two but I would have to say that although part of that is correct, I couldn't help but think that this film is the first I've seen which could touch the japanese people so close and that is the truth.

American vision of ""honor"" among thugs. This is a repeated theme in American westerns. The ""dignity"" and ""honor"" theme among violent thugs is exposed for what it really is in more complex films like the Godfather and Apocalypse now.Like many of these films it pretends to have a deeper moral message, linked to extreme self discipline and Zen without any real expenditure of thought.No need for a spoiler here, the plot is telegraphed way ahead and anyone with a trace of brainpower knows what is going to happen after about 10 minutes.It's basically a vehicles for Tom Cruise to further his career. He's aware of what consistently sells and he's willing to deliver.

471,canperincekster,Nostalgic Values,8,9 June 2016,"The movie is a juxtaposition of modernism's cruelty and immorality with the feudal/moral values of the past. In other words, it glorifies the nostalgic values (collectivism, honor, morality, kindness etc.) against the modern inhuman, individualist and ""cold"" values. Politically, in the context of Japan, this is a struggle of feudal structure against the central and modernizing state. The movie is very successful at reflecting all these, and positions itself in the ""feudal"" side. Although I suppose that the movie defends the wrong position; it was a great movie.First, it was so long; but as much as it is long, it was fascinating. It was very heroic and emotional, especially the last parts. Musics accompany the movie very great. Visuality was so impressive. It was one of the most impressive musics I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie; by the master, Hans Zimmer.

Perhaps the best film I have ever seen.This film plays well again and again which is a sign of its class. Very few films are good enough for me to say ""I'd like to watch that again"" and very few films move me to tears. This does both.TLS undoubtedly deserves 10/10 and the fact that on this site it does not get that mark is due to some very silly and immature remarks from some 'critics' who either do not like Tom Cruise or have some political axe to grind. The rest of the criticisms revolve around ""It is surely improbable that ....."". Quite lot of them are not accurate; here are a few."" ..... Ahlgren survives the last battle and does so without without suffering a scratch."" Ahlgren does not inevitably survive the battle; the narrator states that ""nobody knows what became of him"" and that he may have died of his wounds. Ahlgren does not survive the last battle without a scratch he is hit in the shoulder and leg."" .... that Ahlgren can learn the art of Japanese sword in 6-9 months.""As a cavalry man and civil war veteran Ahlgren already knew how to handle the sabre for at least ten years before his capture. From sequences it is apparent he is extremely adept and coordinated in movement and he has six to nine months daily practice in Japanese fighting techniques as a prisoner. Its not inconceivable he could turn into a fairly formidable figure."" .... that Katsumoto speaks English.""Katsumoto speaks English - not unusual given he is a daimyo and not a samurai from a local village as some commentator mistakenly says. Katsumoto had been a senior figure in government and Japan had been open to the West for 25 years."".... that Katsumoto speaks English in his final words.""Katsumoto's final words are in English because he is addressing his friend who is American.""... Katsumoto seeks advice in war from Ahlgren.""Not at all - Ahlgren knows the tactics of the enemy far better than Katsumoto.""... Ahlgren could learn Japanese in 6 months""The great Richard Burton remarked that he could ""break the back of any foreign language in a month"". Burton was extraordinary in learning 40 languages. But he proved what can be done - and Ahlgren was credited in the film as gifted as a linguist.""... Japanese were advised by an American in military matters.""Yes, correct, Japan was advised by Germans on army matters and British on Navy ones. So really what we should have watched was a guy speaking authentic C19 German with a Prussian accent and subtitles from beginning. What fun - NOT. People who argue this stuff rarely stop to think that fanatical adherence to historical detail at the cost of rendering a film unwatchable does no good service at all. Historical verisimilitude must be respected as contributing to the film as a piece of art, but when it overrides the mission of the film, it performs no good service. I think Zwicker got this right.If you're one of these historical nerds who watches a film only to see if they've got the shoulder pads right then you must avoid Shakespeare - he has historical anachronisms everywhere.""... that the Japanese wife could come to care for the man who killed her husband""Well Ahlgren did save the life of her child at risk to himself! We can see that Ahlgren killed in the line of duty to defend his own life and that he is a brave & decent man. Perhaps she could see the same - can anyone predict the human heart?One other criticism you will read here - TLS is like ""Dances with Wolves"". And so? Dances with Wolves is no doubt similar to one or more of thousands of previous films. This is the silliest criticism.My advice: go and get the DVD if you have never seen it.

475,sunsetrider,A fantasy of romanticized Japan,7,18 December 2003,"The Last Samurai is an epic that features Tom Cruise, in a film that seems to draw some inspiration from either Dances with Wolves or Lawrence of Arabia. The similarities extend to some degree where these films all share a common trait that features a protagonist who is confronted by an alien culture, but who grows to appreciate it enough to sacrifice his life upon its defense. The similarities cannot resolve the inevitable differences, though, when it becomes clear that the Last Samurai does not delve more deeply into the culture that the movie draws other facets of wonder.The film describes a tribulation of a certain Nathan Algren, who is wasted with guilt for having taken part of systemic massacre of native Americans during the nation's expansion toward the west. He is called upon by his former colleagues to help modernize Japan's army. Despite reluctance Nathan travels to Japan, only to be haunted by his old fears and but this time strives to challenge them...There are more than a few novelties or liberties that can be counted upon when it comes to manipulating the viewer's perspective on a different culture as depicted in film. How Tom Cruise's character, Nathan, survives his first conflict with the Samurai is a prime example of how Japanese code of honor is fused with Western ideals of compassion. How Nathan resolves his guilt with the widow of a fallen warrior in the prime showcase of forgiveness triumphing over a cycle of vengeance is another such example. What amounts to be a fairly detailed and appealing rendition of Japanese culture ends up being a hopelessly romanticized view engendered only for your viewing pleasure. Also, it does not certainly hurt that Tom, an embodiment of the collective conscience of viewing public, embraces the culture fully.For me, however, this implausible and sweeping depiction of the culture is the greatest failing of this movie. It is a fairy tale, and what with one principle character drawn from the real life equivalent in that particular era of Japan, among other things, it is a mishmash of parameters for a setting that confuses rather than informs.However, if one is prepared to accept the setting as it unfolds and view the film with an open mind while negating preconceived notions of anything realistic that one would expect of Japan, this film delivers on many levels. Tom Cruise's acting is fairly sound, although his character does not require him to exert a wide range of emotion. Ken Watanabe plays a superb supporting role as Katsumoto and very much becomes an integral force carrying the film. Other notable roles including subdued yet tender presence of Koyuki as Taka to always enjoyable contribution from Billy Connolly round out an impressive cast, even more so given obvious communication issues and the enactment of numerous battle scenes with fairly hectic swordplay.The camera is obviously enamored with the natural beauties of Japan, of which they are plenty in the film. Set against a backdrop of serene pastoral landscape of Japanese countryside, the panorama of all four seasons are established upon it. Especially in the spring time where cherry blossoms bloom, it is a great sight to behold. Only that they were attributed as an example to some philosophical mumbojumbo between Katsumoto and Nathan is irritating.In summary, this film is a beautiful to watch, except for vicious battle scenes that only ends up providing a stark contrast in a way that has been done in other films of this ilk, but very striking notwithstanding. The story is an illuminating journey of a disturbed man, who is rejuvenated by his admiration for something alien yet compatible with his sense of honor. However contrived and unconvincing the movie finds itself in the end, set against the shameless and incongruous depiction of fictitious Japan, I was captivated by the film's various individual parts each of which are superbly conceived and acted. Feats that their sum, unfortunately, does not fulfill as resoundingly.7/10",The Last Samurai

No spoilers, no in depth scene analysis needed.  Just see it, trust me.  That is all you need to do.  You will see and you will know.",The Last Samurai
481,Bobnease,I got more than my money's worth!!!,10,25 February 2004,"This film stepped far beyond my expectations!  I absolutely loved it!The acting, the cinematography, everything about it was amazing! Tom Cruise deserves much more credit for his performance.  If BillMurray got nominated for an Oscar  because he stepped out of hisnormal acting role, I think Tom Cruise should be right there withhim!And as for Ken Watanabe , he did a marvelous job as well, andstrongly deserves his nomination for Best Supporting Actor.I also thought this film shed an interesting amount of light on theincredibly wrongful Indian massacres which took place in ourcountry after the Civil War, and the effects that it had upon a soldierwho was simply following orders which would scar him forever.If you have not seen this movie, turn your computer off and go seeit right now!  It is worth your money!",The Last Samurai
482,davidstone28,Dances with Wolves...but with Samurai,7,10 January 2004,"Dances with Wolves...but with Samurai. Cruise does Costner and Dances with Wolves but this time with Samurai. The plot is almost exactly the same. Nice photography and battle sequences are very realistic but this film loses so much impact for its lack of originality and is a touch too 'Hollywoodish' with an unncessarily and amateurish narration at the start and finish. Not a bad film, nor a particulary good one either. Above average 7/10",The Last Samurai
483,ichikuo,Best movie of 2003 (haven't seen ROTK),10,30 November 2003,"I'm going to make my comments short about this movie.  It's just so good that I could sit here and type too many things about it.  Basically this is definitely one of the must see movies that should be seen this year.  I waited for about a year and a half for this movie and was not the least bit disappointed, in fact, I was very impressed.  This definitely tops the two Matrix movies and Kill Bill for 2003 and quite possibly could and should contend ROTK.  Tom Cruise does a fantastic job as he always usually does in his more serious sided movies, but the real spotlight here is on Ken Watanabe.  He plays the leader of the samauri.  He should and probably will be nominated for best supporting actor in the Oscars.  In fact, I'm going to go ahead and say that he will probably win it.  The academy loves situations like this: a foreigner who just surprises eveyrone.  Not only do I think he will win I hope he does.  Definitely go see this.  You are doing yourself a disfavor if you don't.  My favorite movie of the year, so far...",The Last Samurai

485,youredg,Much more than a cultural film,8,18 April 2005,"The previous commentaries are right on the money and leaves me with very little to actually say. It should be noted that my take on the movie crossed into the ever-changing scenery that we read about in China and Japan. The ways of the old are much by the wayside and this film does a very good job of delving into that situation both here and abroad. Simply the factor of respecting others for whom and what we are is portrayed very well. It is quite ironic that the film requires all that watch it to take a hard look how things have changed even in many of our Americanized-Industrialized lives here in the United States.In a world where less than ten percent of owners and renters can tell you their neighbor's names, or the last time the family sat down together at the table and spoke to their children about how things were at school today. The abomination of society is truly a socially reflective indicator of what baby-boomer's and post baby-boomer's have forgotten from when we were children. The Last Samurai in this aspect portrays greatly how respect was experienced within a culture and a family. Kudos to the movie and most especially to FilmLabRat stated with great poise many of my respects to the film overall.",The Last Samurai

DO NOT MISS this movie ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of Japanese Anime, I swear it's like watching anime, live action. Acting was top notch alongwith the action sequences... best choreography I have ever seen, brilliantly done.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!Some people have been complaining over a ""plot hole"" in the movie that it wasnt explained what the Samurai's were actually fighting for. Maybe if you come from a society which relies heavily on ""honor"" and the ""way of things regarding destiny"" (like I come from), only then one might notice that there is no plot hole!9/10 ... excellent!",The Last Samurai
488,mightyalgo,"No, the last samurai is NOT Tom Cruise!!!",8,13 January 2004,"In The Last Samurai, we are treated to a glimpse of the effect that modernisation had on the ""old ways"" of the world. We are given just enough of a taste of what things were like that we begin to dread their eventual, inevitable demise. Stealing the show is Ken Watanabe's Samurai general, who starts the movie with a vision of a white tiger fighting for his life - a motif that comes back during his later attempts to sum it up in poetry. This white tiger is revealed to be the deeply damaged American Captain, Nathan Algren. Captain Algren, despite all that you may hear, a wonderful character, and very well played by Tom Cruise (one of the nicest actors I have ever heard of). He is, in my opinion, representative of the conscience of the film; and it's destiny. He is cursed to live on while others may die around him, he is atoning for the sins of his time. He even puts this into words: ""I should have died so many times"". The unlikely escapes throughout the film (yes, there are many) as well as his unerring ability to pick up the ancient art of swordfighting over two seasons are merely, as far as I am concerned, the forces of his destiny at work - he does meet his destiny, but it is not through a death on the battlefield; he achieves it through standing up at last for what he believes in above all else - honour, and acts as a saviour for the honour of the Samurai. As I have said, this is my reading of this film's point - of course he is an unlikely hero, but it not Cruise who is the last samurai; it is Watanabe. Algren is an act of fate - the catalyst for the samurai's salvation and adherence to their code of honour. He is prepared to die but does not fear death, he is told. I believe it is this key issue of Captain Algren's >secondary< role in the events that occur (he sets nothing in motion, remember, until the rescue of the general, so that the general can lead his samurai), that makes the effect of this movie more profound than you would have thought.Having said all that (and there was a lot of it) this is in the end a blockbuster vehicle for it's star. He has so much screen time it's scary, but this is due to the fact that the plot is seen through his eyes and hence we are taken on the same journey he experiences towards his own redemption. That having been said, the casting is entirely wonderful; especially in the samurai camp, though arch ""baddie"" Omura is excellent too. I was especially pleased also, to see ""that guy out of ring; you know, the psychic ex husband"" in a completely different role as the (sadly) hilariously named ""yujio"" - I have worked in computer game sales for a while, so I hope you'll forgive this slur on a perfectly reasonable name. Not a weak acting performance to be found, as far as I'm concerned!It is beautifully, if not particularly innovatively shot, too - a couple of shots smacking (maybe too much) of composition.I do, however, have several complaints to make (hey, what else is the internet for, huh?)I) Too much ""meaningful"" dialogue. In a complex movie like this I can't help feeling that some of the dialogue could have done with a once over by the thousands of ghost writers there must be in Hollywood.II) The ending would, I feel, have benefitted greatly from not showing Cruise at all, but fading out the way it came in, on Japan's gorgeous horizon.III) I don't like narration as a means of showing internal dialogue, but I can't suggest a better way of doing it. Maybe I should shut up?IV) The scale of the battle scenes was all messed up (that didn't look like 4000 troops to me coming round the hill!)V) (the big one) WE DON'T NEED A LOVE INTEREST, FOR GOD'S SAKE! I didn't buy this at all. Just unnecessary.I hope you've found my views interesting, I'm always open to discussion. Give us a mail. In conclusion, I would say that it is really worth seeing this film, it won't change your life, or reveal some secrets about the universe to you, but that isn't what going to the movies is all about. You want spectacle, a well shot and acted film, and to share in one man's journey to redemption I would recommend this film with the utmost pleasure.See you later.Algo.P.S. Remember - the use of machine guns at the end foreshadows the changing of warfare forever - no more cavalry charges!",The Last Samurai

The story line, tho it seemed to have been a slightly recycled one, was excellent. The worst part about the movie is 1. Tom Cruise, though he tried valliently to play this part, I think a lesser known actor would have excelled where he played only a mediocre role. Secondly, I think we could have done without the romance between cruise and the wife of the samurai he killed. Either way I found it to be an excellent movie. definatley  in my top 25 favorite movies.

492,paul__kenworthy,A Great Movie,9,3 September 2004,"i found the last samurai to be a great film, Tom Cruise puts in a very good performance as Nathan Algren, The direction from Edward Zwick is top notch, there is some great scenery, and it is very insightful in to the people of the samurai.Ken Watanabe is perfect as Katsumoto, the leader of the samurai that takes Algren prisoner after a battle in the woods, Algren then learns to respect the way of the samurai and helps them in their cause (to stop the Americans modernizing Japan)The battle scenes in the Last Samurai are very well shot, they are very believable with the amounts of violence that there is, and Edward Zwick refrains from using the type of Samurai sword violence used by Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill. There is also a nice performance by Timothy Spall as Simon Graham, an englishman who helps Algren in many ways, the main way he helps is by translating books about the Samurai for Algren.A lot of the dialogue is in Japanese, so if you are not prepared for this then it may put you off.I would recommend this film, The actors are perfect for their roles, the direction is very good and very large battle scenes. 9/10",The Last Samurai

Anytime a movies impresses me, all the other viewings beyond the initial one is to study and absorb how the film was crafted. In my opinion it was Tom Cruise's finest role and I'm just guessing it was one he is proud of and could identify with. The whole philosophy behind the Samurai history and life was well expounded. It's a long movie but the quality was such that every scene was a delight to watch and important enough to be included.

This is also the first film with Tom Cruse in it that I have seen where Tom does not play a smug little SOB, he should probably try it more often. The landscapes are incredible and the story draws you in, even if you have no love for the culture of Japan.

500,Eirik59,Fantastic!,9,7 October 2005,"First, I'm introducing by saying that I gave the movie only 9/10 because I've recently learned that Last Samurai is built on the same plot as Dances with Wolves, starring Kevin Costner. Since I haven't seen that I don't dislike the movie because it's a ""Rip-off"".The movie starts with this peaceful introduction (Where the narrator says one of my favorite quotes; ""I say Japan was forged/made by warriors..."") and during that time you see beautiful landscapes. Summary: Nice introduction.""So it begins"", the movie continues with Nathan getting sent to Japan to deal with these ""savage rebels with bows and arrows"" but you learn throughout the movie, that savage is the last thing they are, and that these men have more sense of honor than any race to walk the earth. When Nathan gets captured and introduced to the Samurai way of living, he feels somehow relieved to be captured. Soon he's healed from the wounds he obtained through the battle which he was captured in, and starts wandering around (With a guard which he calls ""Bob"") admiring their way of living. Summary: Fantastic continuation, with admirable acting!The whole movie ends with Nathan Algren going to the ""enemies"" side; the Samurais side. He finds himself training to become a Samurai, and learning Japanese so he communicates with his new people. The final battle is filled with emotions, strategy, bravery and last but not least revenge to his captain, which he has hated since Custer fell to the Siouxs.All around summary for the movie: Admirable, truly fantastic and impressive.

What else positive is to say about ""The last samurai"" It has, some nice views, good choreographies in the fighting and battle scenes, some average to good acting with a great performance by Ken Watanabe. The movie can deliver an nice one time evening entertainment.
So normally I would have rated this movie 5 [well done fast food for the general public].But I rated it 1 for the total faultiness of the plot if you look at it earnestly. Starting with a very mediocre basic story, that reminds me a lot of ""Who dances with the Wolves"", the movie deals out some very major historical inaccuracies and tops them all by portraiting its american hero as rescuer of the soul of Japan.A bit more feeling for history, a better talent for telling an epic, a ,much more refined script, a lot less american perspective, a bit less or better none tom cruise at all would have helped to make the plot shine.

The sell-out crowd really seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did. Sure, Tom Cruise might not be the best, but the movie is not all about him, and in any case, I think he did do a good job. It is a surprise to realize that I sat in that seat as long as I did. While the 2.5 hours could not to be said to have flown by, nor was the film a tedious thing, where one looks to their watch to see how much time has elapsed, for when the suffering might end..... Surely some will feel that way, but get real- this movie will not appeal to all (obviously!!). There certainly was gore- yet if you've watched much CSI on CBS, you've seen as much or more. I would say the level of blood is somewhat similar. It was more intense, of course, being on the big screen, and the amount of it- meaning, longer scenes. It was not over- done, in my opinion.

Tom fights with the Japanese troops and learns how to use swords and all that junk.The first thing I learned when watching The Last Samurai was that how realistic it was. No kung fu or fancy sword moves, just brutal Medieval warfare. This is probably how it was for samurai warriors, sept they didn't kill men by the hundreds in one sitting, and that Tom Cruise didn't wear a helmet. Oh yeah that scene with samurai vs. ninjas. I'd expect that from a corny magna.As for the violence goes, I've heard people say ""It's REALLY"" violent"" or ""Last Samurai? That was GORY"". Honestly, it wasn't too bad for a rated R movie.

In my opinion they have either become so ensconced in their lofty position that they have grown out of touch with reality or they are automatons to the special interest of those who can afford the most promotional dollars. Either way, that The Last Samurai was not voted Best Picture or Tom Cruise Best Actor is a gross injustice.Jude Law was better in Road to Perdition, The Lord of the Rings should not be on this list. The Last Samurai had something that is inescapable: It was a masterpiece the Cinematography was excellent, the writing and acting sublime.This film was intelligent, heartfelt and historically significant.Amazingly although the movie was over 2 hours long, there was not one scene that was gratuitous or wasted.Each scene was powerful and insightful each fight sequence was perfectly choreographed and perfectly placed in the movie. This movie was a masterpiece from beginning to end. Seabiscuit Master and commander and Lord of the rings together just equal the spirit and intensity in the Last Samurai.

After searching IMDB and reading a few positive reviews, and the insistence of my friend that Tom was on the receiving end of some praise, I conceded and went to see it.Dang - there goes $14 of my hard earned cash... Ultimately, I wasn't wrong. Cruise was wooden and unconvincing.  I tried and *almost* felt emotional, but nope, the close up of his face wrecked that idea.  I'd be interested to hear from people who speak fluent Japanese to see if his delivery of those lines were as stunted as most of his non-aggressive english ones.  To cap it off, his closing line was delivered with more corn than the Corn-on-the-stick guy at the Rocks Market in Sydney.  
Then again, there was a plenty of polenta sprinkled all over the movie.  The digital special effects would have been impressive 5 years ago (although one of the brief aerial battle scenes wasn't bad), and some of the sets looked just plain fake.  In terms of plot - it was Hollywood 101, but at the same time, given the whole package, it was palatable enough for a DVD rental - just not sure that I got value in my ticket this time round. 
On the more positive side, I did like most of the battle and fight scenes - the subtle Manga influence of blood spraying around was well done, and actually added some character to the sequences.  Cruise looked like he could fight too - he did a nice job of training himself for this movie.

That being said, The Last Samurai is an absolutely wonderful movie. Very good acting overall, I really think Tom Cruise is underrated.

The characters were real enough to the point where you cared for them, the dialogue was believable and intriguing, and the directing was allusive and ingenious.  There are many levels this movie takes and does them all justice.  A hands down nominee for Best Picture for 2003.  Although the feeling still haunts that it, like all the others, will soon hail to the 'King.'",The Last Samurai

Tom was robbed not to get the Best Actor nomination. In my book, this is the best picture of 2003, and 2002, and 2001....  You get the idea.It's rich, it's full, it's got so much going on and all of it is good:  a fascinating love story, war story, friendship story, clash of culture story, fleshed out characters, stunning visuals, exciting action sequences, the sets, the costumes, the music....  We're talking perfection of detail.  In a word: WOW!!!!!Tom has never been better and more appealing onscreen.  When I'm watching a movie and I FORGET that it's ""Tom Cruise,"" that's good acting.  I wasn't watching Tom Cruise.  I was watching Nathan Algren.  And I sure liked the guy.  Every emotion the character was experiencing was real, tangible and convincing.  Tom was really, really just GREAT in this role.  Ken Watanabe was super, as well.This movie is definitely one to add to my collection.  I say hurry to the theater to catch this one, if you haven't already seen it.  I give it 9 out of 10 stars.",The Last Samurai

517,patrickhhanlon,"Solid, deep spectacle",9,29 November 2003,"I had been looking forward to this movie for sometime, having been a former resident of Japan and relatively familiar with this chapter of Japanese history. We all have similar experiences of going into a movie with high expectations, either because of the hype, the word of mouth or some other reason only to come away disappointed and wondering really what the fuss was all about.  It did not disappoint me despite my high expectations. Leading up to it, I've heard comparisons to Dances With Wolves and there are some similarities in the story, but another comparison I overheard was that it was similar to Braveheart.  A fitting comparison, however, the supporting characters in Samurai are developed well enough to make for a much deeper and richer movie than Braveheart was in my opinion.  The action scenes, whether hand-to-hand combat or the larger scale battles were vivid and there were a few homages to Kurosawa and hiscinematographer throughout the movie as well.  Brilliant.",The Last Samurai
518,reviewsbyjeff,The best of the best for 2003,10,30 November 2003,"Having piled maximum superlatives on `Master and Commander', now wish I had not done so.  Hindsight is a beautiful view when comparing two films side by side.  After viewing the Russell Crowe effort, I anointed `Master and Commander' the best film of the year.  I did however leave myself some wiggle room by mentioning two other films in the distant landscape. Those films are `Cold Mountain' the Jude Law and Nicole Kidman Civil War epic to be released on Christmas day.  The other title is the `Last Samurai' the Tom Cruise epic about honor, duty, and commitment.  We decided to see the public Sneak Preview and forgo the usual Tuesday night Cinema Society premiere viewing.This film is so rich, so moving, and so meaningful, it is an instant classic. The fine cinematic giant `Braveheart' comes to mind as a comparable title.  These two films depict the battle against tyranny and the honor of ones' history.  The obvious comparison of story line might appear to be with 'Dances with Wolves' as it also had an American Solider turn against his own country.  This film had a bit different twist than the Cosner effort.Voice over work done by Cruise and others give you historical reference with the time and timeline.   There is quite a bit of underlining meaning here to tug at your heart. I especially liked the use of humor in his film to humanize Cruise and make us laugh at the struggle.I could never have imagined Tom Cruise having the screen presence to own a role such as this one.  I found him a modern man and not transitional like Crowe or Gibson.  After a short battle with my own perspective, Cruise melts those miscast fears aside.  His ability to sell this character, a man whom had been so conflicted about his life, so disappointed in his path, creating a man who discovered what the human spirit is about and how honor and family in this far away culture had become something to fight and possibly die for. The transformation of his Captain Algren's spirit takes some time but is well done.  We are spoon fed this new culture not forced fed.    The background and splendor of Japan add to your viewing pleasure and enhanced by the wonderful score created by Hans Zimmer whose credits include `Black Hawk Down' and 'Crimson Tide'.  The fight scenes have a magical feel of realism and enhanced by the choreographed musical connection.  John Toll does a masterful job with the cinematography; his ability to exact perfect lens placement and not rushing us through the fight scenes is remarkable. John Toll's past accomplishments include `Legends of the fall' and `Vanilla Sky'.  This film will certainly garner an Art Direction Oscar nomination.The finest acting job and a certain supporting Oscar nominee is Ken Watanabe.  His past credits are nothing of notable stature but his character is so powerful, so prefect, you truly believe he is the warrior who exhibits honor and the respect of the culture.Another finely placed actor is Billy Connolly who I remember for his unforgettable role in `Boondock Saints', he plays the likeable and affable sidekick to Cruise.Each of the acting players is well cast.  Director Zwick steals a page out of the Spielberg playbook by utilizing children as the heart and soul of the conflict.  Their smiles, laugher and facial expressions humanize what could be seen as an epic war movie. None of the actors was more effective in their role than the young Japanese woman who helps Captain Algren's heal from his battle wounds.Edward Zwick utilizes his incredible vision here like other great films which we have seen from his past films such as `Glory', `Shakespeare in Love', and `Traffic' to lead this cast and crew to excellence in every scene.  The 'Last Samurai' was written by John Logan who penned the Oscar winner `Gladiator'.The `Last Samurai' is the best story of the year and is done with all the richness of other classic epics from year's past.  I feverishly kept writing down notes like human spirit, honor, family, love, respect, spirit and commitment.   It also has the underlining love story that glues the honor and sprit together.   I regret giving `Master and Commander' ten of ten at this point.  In hindsight `Last Samurai' is a bigger more full film, one with more action, more heart, and more emotional connection.This film is the best of the best for 2003.",The Last Samurai
519,US_Ken_Fan,"Astounding, Breathtaking, and Authentic portrayal of tragic times",10,8 January 2004,"This is the BEST movie I have ever seen!Ken Watanabe as ""Katsumodo"" is the best acting ever. I look at pictures and watch online video interviews and cannot reconcile his demeanor with the fierce vitality of the character he portrays. Tom Cruise also does a terrific job (his best role), but he is not afraid of being cast alongside the best.If there is a bit of historical background to the demise of the Shogun and the Samurai that is missing and would make the major theme of the movie stand out even clearer, this weakness is hugely overcome by the devotion of all the principals (the actors, director, cast and others) to the importance of the Menji reformation and the doom it spelled for tragic hereos such as Saigo Takamori (the inspiration for ""Katsumodo"").The authenticity of the life and culture of the Samurai is breathtaking. Most astounding is the ability of all the actors in filling every moment, every word, every silent look with the exact meaning contributing to their characters and the immensely important times in which their characters lived. It is quite telling when you can see a movie on different nights, and every giggle and titter from the audience comes at the same place, no matter how subtle the nuance of humor the characters are portraying.Support the professionals who have brought you this galvanizing story of epic proportions...GO OUT AND SEE THE MOVIE! IT'S WORTH IT! Then buy the video, so you can watch it over...and over...and over...",The Last Samurai
520,US_Ken_Fan,"breath-stealing, enthralling, humorous at times, well-drawn characters",10,2 February 2004,"KEN WATANABE AS ""KATSUMOTO"" Ken Watanabe's fierce, brilliant portrayal of ""Katsumoto"" in the Last Samurai took my breath away! Characterization was this film's strongest point--the many verbal parries and silent communications between these very real characters made me feel awe, sadness, smirking amusement, loss, and heartbreak. All by itself, that would be a terrific acomplishment and my review would be written and done with.But I really didn't know anything about this ""Ken Watanabe"" guy, did I? Not that he's actually rather easy-going...and not that in real life he looks more like a huggable chipmunk than a slashing Samurai!To be sure, this is silly, but I actually got so obsessed by this that I was downloading pictures of Ken as Katsumoto to my desktop just so I could switch back-and-forth between each picture and a video interview I found online. I just could NOT rectify the guy in the video with this vitallically fierce character, especially when at the movies it seems ""Katsumoto"" might get in your face instead of Nathan's (Tom Cruise).Yesiree, pretty amazing stuff this Watanabe-san is, hmmm? Oh, but wait, that's nothing yet...there's a reason I'm calling him Watanabe-san...he is 100% Japanese, has always lived in Japan, and this is his first English-speaking role. He had to apologize ahead of time when he walked into a press conference because his English isn't that good yet...and this is AFTER he made the movie!So now that you KNOW, go back and see the movie a second time. During EVERY one of his quotes of wisdom given in that musically poetic voice, or EVERY razor-sharp taunt at Nathan Algren, you sit there and try to convince yourself that the Ken in these videos is the same guy that delivers those important lines with such perflect inflection--in English!Of course acting is so much more than speaking...it's the precise raising of an eyebrow, the sharp and skeptic gaze, the royal carriage, the small gesture, the smirk that almost but never quite appears. Ken Watanabe is the master at all of these, and then some. He's simply larger-than-life, and how he does it is a mystery. I am sure he will be considered a master of the art, in both theatre and film, for decades and decades.
THE MOVIE ""The Last Samurai"" is a breath-stealing, enthralling epic, humorous at times and deft in the sensitive portrayals of its well-drawn characters--often without the aid of dialogue. Set mostly in rural Japan during the Meiji Restoration, it attempts, and mostly succeeds, to pack the stories of several complex, historical figures into one unified drama through fictional characters inspired by real Japanese people.The story opens with a landscape of etheral beauty, where a Samurai meditates next to a mountiain-top temple. He has a vision of a battle in the fog-shrouded forest, with a roaring white tiger surrounded by his band of warriors. Then we are shifted to post-Revolutionary America, where retired, decorated Army captain Nathan Algren drowns away his guilt in booze, making a profitable but pathetic living as a side-show attraction at Winchester gun sales events.Nathan is tormented by flashbacks of attacks in which his army killed innocent Indian women and children. A former comrade seeks him out as he has recieved a proposal to work in Japan. They and their former commander are offered an outrageous sum for training new, modern warriors for the routing of some tenacious bands of Samurai who refuse to give up their traditional way of the warrior, especially the feared and crafty Katsumoto. He is loyal to the emperor but believes the man-child is being manipulated by greedy Japanese and foreign businessmen. Nathan allows himself to be talked into the get-rich scheme and off he sails.Responsible for transforming an army of conscripts, mostly farmers and some former Samurai, into modern-day gun-toting soldiers, Nathan hardly has time to catch a breath before his arrogant superior officer orders the regiment detached to the forest to stop Katsumoto from attacking trains in the countryside. As expected (no spoiler here), the result is a pathetic flaying.
** SPOILER ALERT! ** Knocked off his horse in battle, Nathan is surrounded by fearsome swordsmen trying to get his life over with for him. He valiantly tries to hold off a whole clutch while they are gaining the advantage. Down from his white steed drops the legendary Katsumoto. He yanks off his mask, openly gaping in amazement at this overwhelmed and outnumbered man who refuses to give up when he is beat. The man is sweeping a sword he ripped from one of the Samurai in wide, defensive arcs. In slow-mo, we see hanging from the sword the flag of the white tiger! At the moment of certain death, Katsumoto orders, ""Stop!"" and the action comes to a grinding halt.
While witnessing the death of one of the army officers, Nathan the prisoner of war is led away on horseback to be held in a mountain village. Openly hostile and hateful at first, Nathan soon learns not to pre-judge his enemy and that he and Katsumoto have more in common than not. Brief passages of witty dialogue alternate with demoralizing defeats and silent emotional moments as Nathan parries with and learns from the wise Katsumoto, struggles to uphold his pride amongst the exclusionist warriors, learns to speak Japanese and to love the simple way of life, and
** SPOILER ALERT! ** discovers that his caretaker, Katsumoto's sister Taka, who was widowed by his own hand, deeply resents her swiftly-growing feelings for him. He even valiantly defends Katsumoto, Katsumoto's brave little nephew, and the rest of the family from a deadly Ninja assassination plot!
Eventually the emperor guarantees safe passage for Katsumoto to return the prisoner to his American comrades, and so they set off for Tokyo. Everything is changing...Samurai are stripped of their titles, police officers cut off boys' top-knots, and the wearing of swords is forbidden. After Nathan takes his leave, Katsumoto stubbornly walks in to attend a council meeting with the emperor. The council demands he give up his sword.
** SPOILER ALERT! ** Katsumoto offers to take his own life, but the emperor won't speak directly to him. Refusing to lay down his sword, he is placed under house arrest at his Tokyo home, led to a special ritual room, and offered a knife for ritual suicide in order to regain his honor, because he has refused to follow the emperor's mandates.
Meanwhile, Algren is preparing for his journey home, refusing to stay and ""kill japos"" to make more money. He resolutely refuses to be drawn into an argument with his former officer about his supposed ""hate"" of his own kind.
** SPOILER ALERT! ** But then Nathan seems to have a sudden inuition that something terrible is going to happen, or he mentally yanks himself up, and determines to spring Katsumoto. Goverment spies have been keeping an eye on him, however, and he is cornered by a troupe of Ninja assassins. He puts himself in the state of ""no mind"" and visualization, armed only with his fists, and manages to steal two swords and efficiently dispenses with the enemy. With the help of the goofy foreign photographer, an expert in all things Japanese who had accompanied the Americans in Tokyo and the emperor's palace upon their initial arrival, and several other men, he hatches and carries out a crazy plot to gain entrance to Katsumoto's Tokyo estate and spring him from containment. Katsumoto's brave young son dies in the battle, but the rescue is a success. They retreat back to the village, but Katsomoto has no heir of his own or of his son's to pass the village on to (land is passed through ranks of Samurai only).
During their dejected retreat, Katsumoto considers taking his own life to avoid dishonor in defeat in his quest to preserve the old way of life, but Nathan talks him out of it. For once, he teaches Katsumoto his own philosophy about destiny and death. ""We will make the emperor hear you,"" he says.Back at the village, as vast army regiments gather below in preparation for the rout of the last Samurai, Katsumoto and Nathan work out their strategy. Though the future of the Samurai is, in this movie as in real life, easy to portend, they vow to make it as difficult as they possibly can and not give up until the end.The ONLY ""weakness"" in the movie, and it is MINOR (hey, we already knew the fate of the Samurai before we ever stepped foot in the theater) is the screenwriter's soft attempt to give the outcome some meaning above and beyond the tragic understanding which we have already accepted, and which he thinks we are not mature enough to handle and still find the many truths. I will not post any ""spoiler"" details on this.But along with the admirable values of honor, duty, loyalty, compassion and service to family, there is a deeper tenet not associated with the Samurai ""Bushido"". We capture it fully only when faced with grim reality. A man said to me, when I was leaving the movie for the first time, ""It sure renews your belief in faith, doesn't it?"" Yes, it does, and the tragedy of the Samurai does not have to be candy-coated for me to come away with a great sense of faith. In truth, people walk out of this film with an uplifting of spirits in the face of death, which was exactly Ken Watanabe's hope for lucky moviegoers around the world.",The Last Samurai

522,WedgeJarvest,There are not many this I care less about than Japanese politics in the early C20.,6,9 February 2004,"Spoiler alert It was not until I had left this movie that I realized that there are not many this I care less about than Japanese politics in the early C20.This is the tale Nathan Algren (Cruise), a captain in the American army, still scarred by the ethnic cleansing of the Red Indians. Anyway Algren is hired by the Japanese army to train their troops in the fight against the rebellious Samurai. Algren is captured in battle and learns the way of the Samurai.As the movie progresses the politics gets harder to understand and loopholes appear in the plot line such as 'Why does Algren change sides?' and 'Why does Algren fall in love with the widow of a man he killed in battle?'. Also the movie begins to drag and all the scenes not involving Algren are in Japanese. The makers of the movie seem to believe that this can be made up for with cool scenes involving ninjas, which is partly true.The producers made the mistake here of trying to mix Samurai, the coolest guys in the world, with an epic. By the end of the movie you could not care less whether the samurai get killed or not, you just want it to end. This has Hollywood corniness written all over it and the final scenes of this are packed with enough cheese to make you sick. Having said this I have seen a lot worse movies and Cruise is good in his role. In the year of Cold Mountain and Return of the King, it's still a disappointment.",The Last Samurai

524,Gawdziller,"It's a MOVIE, people",8,22 April 2004,"I know this film has received much positive response, but the amount of negative feedback is almost overwhelming. I can't believe all these people griping about Tom Cruise's invincibility and how the movie fails to accurately depict the samurai and their way of life. They are fighting against a drastic change that is being forced on them too quickly for their own liking, so why not fight back? Cruise's character understands the way they feel, so he joins them in their cause. Maybe not a wise decision if one holds one's survival above all else, but it's a movie. For the love of all things sacred, it's A MOVIE. Enjoy it. Be entertained. If you don't like it because of such trivialities, too bad. They're there, and there's nothing you can do about it. Now, if there had been some truly glaring problems, such as a complete lack of explanation of Algren's sympathy for the samurai or the presence of an odious comic-relief character, I would complain about the movie as well.However, I found it to be an excellent film. It had an interesting story, one of the best battles ever filmed, great performances by the entire cast (especially Watanabe), excellent cinematography, and an excellent script, among other nice qualities. I, for one, found the ending to be quite well-done. As a whole, I feel it was a thoroughly satisfying film and should have as least been nominated for Best Picture.

After the last battle and the extinction of the Samurai Nathan finds the peace he has longed for.This movie has lots of character depth, and is an emotionally charged, greatly filmed, battle filled epic, that shows the honor and pride of battle. Tom and Kens performances are executed to perfection, and make the entire movie all the better. The only bad part to the movie was that, once again, the American are victorious over all.

The whole story is just amazing and there are no boring parts, no inappropriate scenes, no unnecessary things, it is just something nobody can miss. Edward Zwick did an unbelievable job and I consider it a masterpiece. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe did just an incredible, amazing, and a ""10 stars out of 10"" movie.Tom Cruise plays as Captain Algren, a civil war hero who is paid to go to Japan and take out a rebellion (which were the Samurai) headed by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).

I don't usually watch art-house films but I never miss a Cruise film and as usual he did NOT disappoint. In the film Cruise gives a commanding performance as he LITRALY plays a performing commander who has to travel back in time to ancient Japan to reclaim his honour (which has been stolen by the British again). While there he learns important new things like how to eat with chop-sticks and use a sword but most importantly he learns about himself and what's inside. Basically an f-load of honour. I think what made this film really excellent was that as well as having some super cool action scenes it also made me think about like, honour and what I would do if I was sent to ancient Japan?Just as a warning to people THERE ARE SOME SUBTITLES IN THIS FILM. I know what you're thinking, 'if I wanted to read I'd buy the Daily Mail' and usually I'd agree, but if you stay to the end its totally worth it for the last fight scene alone (three words, CRUISE v NINJAS).

Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are truly incredible, and Tom Cruise surely should've won an Oscar for his performance. I'm disappointed to see his acting in this film go unnoticed by the Oscars, as it has so many times before. Don't let this stop you from seeing it yourself, however.The tale of the samurai is a sad one. The modern soldiers are being sent to extinguish the ancient ways and the men of honor that followed them. This is what Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is hired to do: train Japanese conscripts to fight against the samurai.I won't spoil any of this wonderful film for you; instead, I'll ask you to experience it for yourself. The music, the acting, the directing, the great lines... everything in this movie just flows perfectly.I can list no flaws in this movie, and I have absolutely no complaints. Though sad, this movie is epic, and truly unforgettable. Everything about this movie is a success.10\10, without a doubt - I'd go even higher, if I could.

For more insight into how we corrupted the Japanese way of life, please READ the hot best seller by James Bradley...Flyboys.

Tom Cruise gives a stellar, underplayed potrayal of the American soldier who has ""obeyed orders"" one too many times. Through his capture by the ""enemy"", he is given the chance to learn the purity/ dedication/ power and loyalty of the samurai. Wantanabe also teaches us, in an equally underplayed non-preaching portrayal.

The greatest achievement is the quiet surentity that Edward Zwick is able to instill in Nathan Algren a character played by the seemingly un-apt Tom Cuise.Tom Cruise is meirly a conduit by which an amaising story unfolds.  It is in fact the lack of Tom Cuise' character that makes his role work so well with the story.

I have a love of Japan and a love of Japanese films. I can watch even a bad Japanese film because the minute of the Japanese environment can captivate and engross. Yet the Last Samurai is so stripped of meaning, detail or subtlety that I came away wondering why they bothered.The Last Samurai runs an epic, humourless two and a half hours. it seemed much longer.The Meiji Restoration is a fascinating period of Japanese history. The Last Samurai examines it with all a finese and insight that can only come of producing it entirely in New Zealand. Japan looks a lot like Middle Earth. Come to think of it, the badlands of Little Big Horn look a lot like Middle Earth. No amount of blue tinting can disguise this basic, unsettling visual impairment. In the first battle sequence, you are expecting bands of orcs to come grunting out of the forest. Instead, you get samurai in *medieval* armour. Welcome to 1876.Confused? Don't worry, you're not alone.In The Last Samurai, for all its bushido posturing, Japan and the Japanese are a mere afterthought.They got the US flag wrong too. And San Francisco. Given this, you don't have much confidence in their treatment of the history and politics of the period, or the intricacies and beauty of Japanese culture. Luckily, there's almost none. It mighty as well be Arrakis as Japan. The Last Samurai is a fantasy.This is a nothing so much as boys own adventure, and brings the very best and worst of the genre. There are few women, in fact only one who counts, and she is...uh huh got it in one. Tom Cruise is Nathan Algren the curiously centreless, ammoral hero, a character without subtlety, who of course out-samurais the samurai in just a few months. Whitie wins again.Cruise can bring little of the necessary gravitas to the role, little to make Nathan anything more than a action figure who can talk and bend.The next paragraphs contain spoilers, an odd term in this context because there is very very little in the plotting to surprise.American comes to Japan to fight rebel samurai. American is captured. American lives with samurai. You can guess the rest. Everything is perfectly two dimensional - noble rebels, complete with rebel leader who is really uh huh, grudging tough guy warrior who uh huh, and beautiful widow who uh huh. Its join the dots fantasy, rarely rising above stereotype... weak Emperor, two faced politicians, amoral Europeans. There's the obligatory 'use the force, Luke' scene, a few token culture clash scenes, and of course, the meat of the movie, lots of noble, chop-suey style battle scenes. Well choreographed, drawn out and messy, they are the heart of the film, and the measure of its appeal or lack thereof. The bushido way is death before dishonour, but heck, there's always a hollywood exception, right?The entire effort is curiously humourless, even given the serious themes and supposed dramatic depth of Cruise's character. The film has one good joke, completely out of genre, that takes us into Kevin Smith territory. (What was the name Ethan gave to his minder?)Billy Connolly makes an all-too-brief appearance as Nathan's loyal NCO. As the film dragged on, I kept thinking what a much more satisfying movie this might have been if it was Zebulon who was captured and whose story we followed. There would have been a film of much greater humanity, sensitivity and humour, if less macho posturing. Alas.What troubled me most of all was the moral confusion at the heart of the film. What was the message again? A generation on, those bushido values led to the Japanese invasion of China, Pearl Harbor, and beyond.Kurosawa, at least, never forgot that.",The Last Samurai

538,lmadlung,conflict between cultures--best weapon wins,9,26 November 2003,"It has been true throughout history, that when two opposing cultures clash the one with the most modern weapons wins.  This film tells the story of which weapon may truly be the best.  Tom Cruise produces and stars in a film which could have been a cliche of a burnt out soldier drowning in booze hired to train a foreign army in ""modern"" warfare.  It could have been bloody battles and explosions.  It was neither.  It was more.Captured by the Samurai early in the film he is taken in order for the leader to ""learn and study"" his enemy.﻿It is apparent to everyone watching the film that Cruise's fate is to be death at the hand of the man Cruise believes  his bodyguard.  But over the long winter, Cruise develops a curiosity about his captors, their method of fighting, their beliefs developing a respect for the Samurai and their leader.  Stockholm syndrome in the 19th century? If so, the film goer is also subject to it, enthralled by the storytelling and performances.   Paired with Cruise in a interesting yin/yang relationship is Ken Wantanabe as the Samurai leader.  Wantanabe's acting skills duel well with Cruise. Over the winter, Cruise barges into the training and bruisingly gains enough skill to encourage betting among  the Samuri as to how long he will last in a bout. While there is a gory climatic battle scene, most of the film is preparing for war, planning for war, practicing for war and finally engaging in war between two elements of Japan's culture.  Bows and arrows and swords against howitzers and gatling guns.  The victory does not result as one might surmise.Tom Cruise disappears totally into his character probably earning an Oscar nod by doing so.",The Last Samurai
539,sxmmycornfield,Beautiful with a few easily overlooked faults,8,18 May 2021,"-The cinematography was amazing, beautiful quality, framing.-The soundtrack was great adding o the grandness of the settings and the peacefulness of others. It gave the film a feeling of quality.-Tom Cruise's perfomance was incredible, you forget that it's even Tom Cruise playing the role. This is easily the best role i have seen him in. He also aesthetically suits the role. Overall a good and suprising performance by Tom Cruise.The costume design was great, it didn't look like they cheaped out at all. Especially in the last battle scene. You can see the intricacies of every single samurai which I found to be very impressive. Apon reading up on the movie, apparently the costume is very stereotypical japanese dress and may not be that accurate. However, still impressive and adds to the feeling of quality and grandness.Bad
The love interest annoyed me a lot. 3/4 of the way through there were a few hints to it with stares that were a bit too long and etc etc. But I thought, YES finally a movie without cheap love, but I was sadly mistaken. This was the most impactful flaw with the film, I found. It kind of ruined it for me, but I was still willing to see the good.-The plot armour was another flaw. I feel as they though they could have written more realistic and believable situations rather than, the two main characters charge through every obstacle and the people around them cannot. The plot armour especially for Tom Cruise's character was present in every fight scene in which his or someone else's life was in danger.The film is historically innacurate. As I mentioned before, the costumes were stereotypical, someone likened them to a film set in France and every character carries a baguette, wears striped clothes and a beret. Also, I believe the Japenese army at this time was not even trained by the Americans, rather the Germans and the French. This flaw is the smallest and doesn't take away from it as a film.",The Last Samurai
540,porl9,Disappointing,7,16 February 2004,"To me, the big disappointment with this film is the predictability of the script. From the moment Algren is captured by Katsumoto, it's possible to guess with some accuracy every single cliche that's going to be sprung onto us.Yes, it was well made with some excellent cinematography (although nowhere near as sumptuous as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with which it'll be most compared). Cruise & Watanabe both give competent performances without ever crossing the ""Wow!"" threshold. An entertaining enough evening although don't think for a moment you're going to see a classic.",The Last Samurai
541,kenjiyamamoto7,Good film that makes you think,9,16 January 2007,"Last Samurai is one of those underrated films that truly is not another Hollywood concoction or cliché. Kudos to Ed Zwick for not getting into stereotypes and doing research.It manages to exist on a number of levels, as a superbly competent action thriller, and as a cultural study into the relationship between the U.S. and Japan. It manages to exist on these multiple levels without sacrificing any for the good of another. It has at its center a complex spherical character in Tom Cruises' character.There are also strong supporting characters in Ken and the other Japanese characters. Ken's character is a man who stresses honor and propriety, who is at first repelled by Cruise's character and his ways. As the film progresses, he comes to a greater understanding of Cruise's character and comes to respect him as a shogun, as a man of honor, and as a friend. On top of all these elements, the film also delves into cross-cultural issues, namely how Japan and the U.S. are different in terms of honor code, civility and customs. It spends some time on the mutual exclusivity of these two cultures, how one cannot exist without the other, and how the have helped shape and form one another over many years without favoring one or the other.All these things combined the film still manages to maintain itself as a highly competent action thriller, with taught suspenseful pacing, and an intelligent storyline. It also contains one of the best and most memorable endings in recent years, which alone makes the film worth watching.Overall, I highly recommend this film to anyone who might enjoy this unconventional type of shogun-type film, a film with depth and intelligence. If you do, chances are this surprisingly excellent film will become one of your favorites as well.",The Last Samurai
542,dfes0,"This bullet, or arrow?, missed its target",4,6 May 2007,"The Last Samurai is a movie about the fascination of Americans for Japanese culture, more specifically Japanese heroism. But focusing on heroism alone dangerously narrows down the subject and approaching it from an American viewpoint warps and twists it into a failure. Before explaining why, here is a short summary of the plot.American army captain Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, is disillusioned after participating in gruesome slaughter of native American Indians. A friend of him convinces him to come to Japan to help strike down revolts of Japanese samurai, who oppose the new Meiji government's reforms. Soon he faces them, is beaten and captured, but samurai leader Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe, spares his life and patiently lets him experience the Japanese lifestyle, specifically bushido, the samurai warrior code. Algren is so gripped by them that he joins their side and helps them in their final efforts to plea and fight for their cause.This could have have been a nice movie. All ingredients are there: A period of turmoil with great historical importance, a clash of cultures, heroic warriors and of course a solid budget. But the movie never succeeds in convincing. There are a number of reasons for that. First, the acting is mediocre. Nobody really flunks, but never do you see one of them really being their character, instead of pretending to. Secondly, the plot follows a very predictable Hollywood path, never surprising, increasingly boring. The only surprise is that Algren manages to get into a romance with a Japanese lady, which is only surprising because you would not expect the writers to insert such a standard thing into a story that does not suit it at all. Thirdly, the sparse action scenes are shot with an overload of pomp and drama, similar to Mel Gibson - Braveheart / Peter Jackson - Lord of the Rings style, with long drawn out views of heroes dying heroically, or should I say refusing to die for minutes on end? Especially the final battle is pathetically overdone and suggest that the only purpose of the samurai was to die with honor. Did anyone ever consider that samurai also lived lives? Some people have compared this Edward Zwick - Tom Cruise combo product to the works of Akira Kurosawa, who seems to be their own hero. My advice: If you want to see a good movie about Japanese samurai, go watch movies made by the Japanese themselves. For instance, the works of aforementioned Akira Kurosawa, who could have taught Zwick and Cruise some moves.",The Last Samurai
543,xcanon,Critique of Western Ideals - Excellent Film.,10,31 December 2003,"Many the raters I would guess are either a bit young or American, possibly giving this movie a lower grade than it deserves. As the film reaches 96% of the rest of the world's population, most probably the appreciation for this magnificent film will result in a much higher grade for The Last Samurai.Scanning through some of the reviews here, I was amazed that few if any mention the essence of this movie - and that is, presenting two different cultural perspectives and how they (somewhat exadurated) contrast each other. The aggressive American imperialist approach is well depicted and, despite the fact that the movie takes places a 150 years ago, the resemblence to a modern day leaders of some Western or so called ""civilized"" nations is stunning and offers an interesting spin on modern political affairs that we are all too aware of.The actors, music, direction and production in general will most likely harvest a great deal of the Oscars this year. In fact, this is one of the finest films I have seen in a very long time.9 / 10",The Last Samurai

545,wingchild,A top notch heroic epic set in Meiji-era Japan,10,19 December 2003,"The story for this film is set just after our Civil War. At the time, Japan had just overthrown the Shogunate and gone back to Imperial rule in a process known as the Meiji Restoration. The Emperor, Meiji, had a vision to bring Japan into modern times; to achieve this he began hiring experts from the world over to give Japan heavy industries, modern architecture, and a current, up-to-date Army. This movie chronicles the fictional events surrounding an American Army Captain, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), and what happens to him on the ancient isles; also what happens to the Samurai as they are rendered classless, and pointless, in the new Meiji Era. (For more details, look up the battles of Chosou and Satsuma sometime.)
The storyline is fantastic and historically accurate; armor and weapons were up to par with what they had for that era. This movie has *the best swordfighting choreography* I've ever seen anywhere -- ever -- and I look for that kind of thing. Tom Cruise gives a solid performance and is very believable, even if his screen presence feels diminished standing next to someone like Ken Wantanabe, who steals the show with his carefully calculated manner.The acting is great, the scenes are beautiful, the swordplay fantastic and realistic; this movie is totally worth anyone's time. There is a lot of care taken with respect to historical and cultural accuracy, so if you're a bigtime anime fan or student of japanese culture, you'll pick up a *lot* of details that most people miss (the depth of people's bowing, the honor accorded by someone committing seppuku, or being asked to stand as one's second for the process, etc).Probably not the best family film, but definitely worth seeing repeatedly.",The Last Samurai

I have watched The Last Samurai in it's entirety 5 times and have yet to tire of it. The photography is stunning, the New Zealand countryside as 19th century Japan is breathtaking, and the story and acting are both captivating and real. Tom Cruise is a lightening rod for many folks due to his religious beliefs and outspoken manner. However a quick look at his representation on the top 100 box office films indicates that he is among the masters of his craft. In my opinion, The Last Samurai is his finest work to date.",The Last Samurai

I sat down and was totally shocked. This film was one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It had a good storyline. The acting was good. Tons of action for the guys and tons of the emotional stuff for the ladies. I am a 26 year old guy who does not like emotional films. Didn't know this was an emotional film until I watched it. I found myself swept up into the film and by the final battle scene found tears running down my face, and I wasn't the only guy there with tears streaming. So without a doubt if you wanna see a good FILM not movie... Then I recommend this film to everyone. If this film and Tom Cruise are not nominated for an Oscar I will be totally shocked!!!",The Last Samurai

It showed the spirit of samurais and their bravery, which far beyond my imagination (and of course some of other people who live in western world). No wonder why they are so legendary. Even they treated their enemy with respect (if their enemy prefer to commit seppuku rather than being captured). It was a great movie in all aspect, except the ending where Tom Cruise is the only one alive. It would be much better if Tom Cruise died in the battle or commit seppuku. Remember, he said he wanted to be a Samurai. Or maybe because he is an American, therefore he must be alive? For me, the star of this movie is Ken Watanabe.",The Last Samurai

This condition has brought me great success (imagine my fate after seeing ""The Ladies Man""), but also caused me some considerable problems (""Half Baked"" comes to mind).Alas, I went to the local cinema Friday night with my strange affliction, knowing full well that I may end the night a worse person. It pretty much all banked on Tom Cruise.At least nine times throughout the film, I accidentally, instinctively, loudly whimpered; I was simply overcome by emotion. And, to be entirely honest, this movie marks the first time since ""The Sixth Man"" I've cried in the theater. I won't say which part(s), because that would be Grand Theft Emotion for some unlucky ones out there who haven't seen this work of art yet. But yes, the movie simply took hold of me. Tom Cruise's performance was a Flawless Victory, the action gut-wrenchingly good, and the cinematography was pretty excellent as well (cameras are really clear these days).Thanks to Mr. Cruise, I am a wanna-be samurai.

550,talonz51,Shoddy and unfaithful star 'vehicle',2,4 September 2004,"My wife and I could barely stand to watch this shoddy film. If we hadn't paid good money already, I'm sure we wouldn've walked out. I alternated between gritting our teeth during the movie, laughing at parts there were supposed to be dramatic, and otherwise being bored and disappointed to tears.In short, I was angry to see what they did with one of my favorite theatrical genres in this movie.There are multiple reasons for that. 1) This movie was an obvious star vehicle for Tom Cruise. Don't get me wrong, I generally like Cruise and his movies, but you can't sacrifice story and authentic historical research just to showcase one actor. Well you can, but it doesn't make for a good movie imo. The movie spent way too much time on Cruise and not enough on making an actual movie. Some people have compared this movie to ""Dances with wolves"", a good movie, but Last Samurai didn't have time to deal with both a similar story and the actual rebellion/westernization of Japan. Obviouslly Cruise's screen time won out.2) Complete disregard for history. Certainly Commodore Perry opened Japan to international trade and western technology, but at no point were American forces on Japanese soil in any significant numbers after Perry. And they most certainly did not train Japanese soldiers.3) Story. There is a wealth of background available on the Satsuma rebellion that could have been utilized in this film. I was hoping that the film would have delved into this as a central theme, but nothing more than the bare essentials (samurai rebel against westernizing!) was used. Pathetic.So we have a camera perpetually focused on Cruise, a trashing of history, and little to zero story. Now add in some completely unbelievable characterizations and stereotyping of certain portions of Japanese culture and behaviour without regard to the whole society and you have a film unworthy of the money and acclaim it has garnered. Go rent ""Seven Samurai"", or nearly anything by Kurosawa for that matter, and see a real Samurai movie.I gave this movie 3/10 only because of Ken Watanabe's acting and some of the cinematography. Even the battles and use of extras or supporting characters was so pitiful because of poor writing.",The Last Samurai

Now I don't feel like this easily, but there was something about this film that made me feel so good, so different to so many other films. It was like making a New Year promise, as I started thinking about so many different things afterwards, like how much people whine nowadays at the simplest tasks etc. How badly I want to be in love...lol. How beautiful Japan is (I'm going to the Far-East for my first time in July - China). How beautifully Taka (Koyuki) was portrayed, and was not degraded once, by OTT sex scenes or nudity. Her relationship with Nathan (Tom Cruise) was so beautiful, and I felt the pain of both their lives/situations. Just shows how ridiculous wars are...you could kill a man on the battle field....and he may very well have been a good friend. However, the battle scenes were extremely well choreographed and moving and the film contained the perfect amount of action, romance and culture. As a westerner who hasn't ever been to the far-east, yet alone lived in the 19th Century I cannot comment on it's accuracy, but nonetheless I enjoyed every breath during this superb film.I am now determined to practice my martial art more often, get my revision done for my exams next week!

It is quite a performance, with fantastic Japanese backdrops and culture, excellent supporting roles by Ken Wantanabe and Billy Connolly and great action sequences.So whats the catch? No catch really but more a warning as Tom Cruise balances on the edge of self-adulation that has a familiar danger about which Kevin Costner became an expert. The last sequence of the film records his apparent immortality when everyone about him is killed. This for me did not provide a happy end to the movie but made it rather unbelievable and made an unfortunate diversion from reality.

562,m-p-williams,"Regrettably the ending is disappointing, but a very impressive motion picture none the less *NO SPOILERS*",8,17 January 2004,"On first sight of the trailer for The Last Samurai, I immediately became very optimistic about this film and after seeing it was very pleasantly delighted as a majority of the aspects that make a great film were there with a little bit extra.The film lasts around 2 1/2 hours approx but didn't drag at all like some long, outstretched pictures do. Each scene had significance and was genuinely interesting to watch. The Last Samurai was a compelling and highly interesting and entertaining film about a final group of Samurai in Japan that the Emperor wishes to rid their 'reign of terror' lifestyle among the people of the country.  However this idea of the Samurai being savages is explored when Captain Algren aka Tom Cruise is sent there to 'resolve' the problem inevitably being kidnapped and living amongst them as a 'prisoner'.  Honour, tradition, culture, betrayal, rivalry are all aspects that are explored within this epic and are done to great effect.In terms of characterisation, Algren(Cruise)develops at a pleasing rate as we become more involved with him and learn about his past and changing beliefs, more to the point Cruise puts in a very convincing and solid performance who is haunted by his past adding a diverse darker side to his already mysterious life. In fact, the entire supporting cast do fine jobs of portraying believable and 'real' characters, most notably Cruise's Samurai guard he names ""Bob"" which brought a touch of light heartedness to the tense situation.The plot was very interesting and works very well with an interspersion of the typical Japanese life as well as the Samurai way-of-life. There are minimal flashbacks, which allow the story to run in a chronological and comprehendible rate. The only aspect of the plot that let the film down is the ending which whilst is disappointing in comparison to the film as a whole, can be excused for the great acting, direction and superb battle scenes.The setting, props and entire mise-en-scene was very convincing and had a real look of authenticity to it which made the tale ever more believable as it progressed and due to the fact it was based on real events, was reconstructed rather accurately and is great style exploiting the Samurai way of life to the audience in a fascinating way.Overall, a great film to watch which doesn't fail to impress, possibly one of Cruise's best performances to date combined with a compelling story, interesting characters and breathtaking battles as well as settings, makes this the best film of the year so far, and will end up as one of the years greatest.",The Last Samurai

564,japhearttok,a beautiful blend of hollywood and Japanese aesthetics,10,18 March 2004,"TLS is one of those films that teach so much, about a people and an aspect of their culture, without having to come across as didactic. It does this almost effortlessly by demonstrating-- cinematography, the scenes' mood, production design, great acting, etc.  The viewer, if he is 'empty cup' (in the Zen sense), is simply engaged. Although Bushido can be controversial, TLS succeeds as a work of art in evoking sentiments and touching an audience's soul without needing to justify an ideology or give supporting arguments.  After all, it's a film-- not a philosophy book.  TLS is soft yet strong, gentle yet firm.  The battle scenes though violent aren't gory and sensationalized.  There is still that sense of humanity and tender feelings even in the killing field.  After all, this is not really a war film but a film about a people and a culture permeated by so much beauty, profound realization of impermanence, honor, pride, commitment, filial piety and sensitivity despite the presence of conflicts, imperfection, human frailty and 'birth pangs' that often accompany change.  It's one of the best introductions to Japanese culture.  I have seen the film 7 times (and intend to watch it again).",The Last Samurai
565,huncaluvsdolls,"If you can't enjoy fiction, then why do you watch movies?",8,25 June 2004,"This movie was powerful and stunningly beautiful. Yes, it was a story that's been done, but how many original stories *are* there? I always welcome another wonderful telling of a beloved familiar tale.The Samurai were not fighting the railroad, per se, but rather were fighting for a way of life. They were fighting the evil of greed and of cultural genocide. Yes, they trained as disciplined warriors, but they also balanced life with the appreciation of the world around them. Gold didn't fill their hearts as much as the perfect blossoms on a tree. To me, THAT was the whole point, and it was beautifully told.The Emperor was young and weak, as in so many other stories and in history as well, I assume. It reminded me of The Three Musketeers, and of how the young King of France was manipulated by the Cardinal. The power behind the throne is often what rules.Very violent but breathtakingly photographed and edited, with an emotionally moving soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (who can do no wrong in my book).If you can't get lost in the movies and just go with them; let them take you where they will, then why do you watch them...???** Hunca **",The Last Samurai
566,tomt60,Powerful,10,5 August 2004,"Ken Watanabe was great. Cruise, slow in the beginning (but understandably) Realizes what honor and sacrifice finally means. Personally I think the movie touches your inner depths about service to your people or way of life. I especially enjoyed the Sumarais' appearance in town and the respect the elders displayed. (Too little of that nowadays). Of course in the last chapter after the gatlin guns fired, when Cruise and Watanabe embraced as friends for the final time, it actually choked me up. So I have to give the film an A+. Perhaps not for overall acting, but for the strong content of service and friendship. Well Done. Hans Zimmer puts out another score. Its getting so when I hear the soundtrack he has produced for any movie, I know right away. He has a certain recognizable flair with each scene. Its mood setting content is directly responsible for the emotion each scene is after. I think this movie overall is one of Cruises Finest. Kens character and acting stole the show however. This is a movie you can enjoy over and over.",The Last Samurai
567,Ryan-Shem,"Realistic, Emotional and action-packed.",9,13 January 2005,"My rating: 9/10The reason I have voted this film to be so high is not because the plot was cohesive, but because it incorporated culture, both Japanese and Americna and gave an insight to viewers what sort of chaos and strife existed. But I'd say the meat of this film has to be the determination of the Samurai who want to keep Japan to the original state and not become an updated civilisation that has up to date technology and such like the Emperors minister, he believe Japan should be civilised and able to compete with world powers - economy wise and militarily wise but the Samurai are determind to prevent this.It is a very powerful film that will have viewers crying as there are some tragic events in the film, but conversely it will also make the viewers support the Samurai and will want the Samurai to win, I know it did that to me. But the intention of the ending was that the Samurai did win, yes, they were obliterated but they won because the Emperor heard the cry of The Samurai Leader and abolished all things that were not of Japanese origin. If anything, it got stronger as the film progessed. So from that, the film is really about fighting got a worthy cause and even if thew odds are against you, it does not mean you cannot win.",The Last Samurai

Tom Cruise does a lot of Movies but this is the only one were I don't see Tom Cruise, I just see Nathan Algren. Tom Cruise is an awesome Actor but the Films he usually does and the Characters he portrays are typical for Tom Cruise, there you just see Tom Cruise doing what Tom Cruise does.

572,Brad-78,A Flat Tire With Plenty of Holes,3,18 December 2003,"I would say this movie held my attention until Tom Cruise is captured by the rebel band of Samurai. From that point forward it was all down hill. Not only is the dialogue mundane when it is trying to be prophetic, but it also leaves you feeling totally dispassionate about the characters.Tom Cruise was a bad choice. He is supposed to be a man of stature and experience - a man who has seen the worst of the Indian Wars. Instead what we have is Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise. Sometimes drunk, sometimes sober. His natural build does nothing to enhance his credibility, either. I see no real emotion from Cruise in the character, but simply a man trying to be somebody else. It just wasn't believable.One thing I would ask my fellow reviewers is: Don't you feel the ending was totally over-blown?I found it personally insulting when, in the film's final battle, both main characters are shot all to Hell by bullets flying everywhere. There is what is supposed to be an emotional scene between the two leads holding each other at death, which is so silly and over the top that it makes me wonder what the author was thinking. Then Cruise, after having been shot full, is seen staggering into the Imperial Palace in a clean uniform. He respectfully hands over the rebel sword to the Emperor. That triggers an emotional dialogue between him and his ambassador. It is a meaningless conversation about their past coming to an end and the tragedy of it all. It is supposed to be deep and meaningful. All it really succeeds in doing is dragging the movie on for another five minutes. Finally Cruise, (because Hollywood believes its' audiences just can't stomach a sad ending) is filmed walking off into the sunset, with trusty horse in tow, to the quiet little village of the rebels. At least I had a good laugh here...I wish I could stay so healthy after being shot up so well. I wish I could find meaning in dialogue that has no sense of real human feeling or even so much as a complete understanding of what the characters are really suffering through.Too bad David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, or John Huston aren't around today. If they were, this film could have been a masterpiece handled by men who could appreciate a story like this. All we have is a typical example of a Hollywood film that carries a good concept, but is never fully explored. Hollywood today should stay with action films and comedies. Serious drama is not something the industry seems capable of exploring - thanks in part to the cash culture of the business.",The Last Samurai
573,Mara-8,"Quite interesting, but...",8,30 November 2003,"Well, at the beginning, I would like to say that I liked this movie. It is colorful, nicely shot, and actors played well. However, there are some details which bugged me quite a lot in the movie. First of all, japanese swords never produce this horrible 'zzzzzingggg' sound when unleashed (I think this mistake is quite common for hollywood movies). Secondly, when releasing a sword from the scabbard, you never *never* want to have a thumb right in front of the sharp edge of the blade which is as sharp as a razor (unless you want to loose the thumb, of course). Finally (which really bugged me), the concept of kaishaku, or assisting in ritual suicide or seppuku(harakiri) is completely unknown to the director. Person, assisting the suicide (usually a friend or a relative of a person who commit the suicide) must cut only through the spine *leaving* the head attached to the body. To remove the head from the body is a disgrace and it is usually done only to execute criminals. In addition to that, helper must perform an assistance in a very dignified manner, not screaming like the one in the movie...",The Last Samurai

The character played by Ken Watanabe seems so real, and it makes you wonder about the people you know. For example i asked myself: Do i know great characters like Katsumoto?

The nature shown in this film is really fantastic. The story is maybe a little bit predictable, but nonetheless believable. The acting is perfect. There is nothing more to add here than simply perfect.
The only thing that was a bit lacking in quality were some fight scenes. Sometimes it's hard to follow what exactly is happening during a given moment, especially because most of the enemies are usually wearing the same outfit.I cannot recommend this movie enough.

But that is their opinion and they are entitled to it.  But I, for one, absolutely LOVED this film.  I didn't watch the previews and I didn't get into the hype, so I pretty much went into this movie with a blank slate and no outside influences or expectations.  To me, all that stuff takes the element of surprise and true appreciation away from a film.  I like to just know what it is about, and decide if its good for myself.  The ONLY thing that I didn't really care for was the computer graphics in some of the early scenes, but that is it.  And that, to me, had no affect on the story.  But if you didn't like this movie, no big deal.  That doesn't change how much I loved it.  But just let people decide for themselves.

To my knowledge, speaking myself as a martial artist, this is the ONLY film that portrays the true Way of a Warrior who seeks enlightenment.No other film, (with the possible comic Star Wars films and Kung Fu TV series) portrays the Eastern Warrior arts this way.A great film and a treasure for those who study the warrior arts.",The Last Samurai

The score was breathtaking. Being Hans Zimmer's 100th movie score, I believe this is his best one yet and he is also my pick for the Best Original Score Oscar of the year. The costumes were beautifully done. Especially the Samurai war suits and the other costumes from Nobutada's village, Katsumoto's son. The sets were great too. Props to the set designer, carpenters and painters. They rock! The cinematography is excellent, done by John Toll. John Toll is also my pick for the Best Cinematography Oscar. I think this movie will sweep the Oscars this year. Everything about it is excellent. The story is just wonderfully played out. The trailer kind of misleads you on the plot of the movie.

590,www-thelittleman,Stunning. A must-see,9,18 October 2008,"I have never been a big fan of Tom Cruise, but this film was proof enough to me to show that he genuinely can act when he puts his mind to it. Edward Zwick has been one of my favourite directors for a while now, because of his ability to produce such visually enthralling films which always present a controversial issue with a wonderful thought-provoking new light. The cinematography is simply breath-taking,and coupled with the beautiful Japanese rural setting and the adrenaline-fuelled battle sequences, this makes for a very high quality film. Many of the other reviews i have read on this film comment on the similarities between this movie and one of Zwick's earlier productions - ""Glory"". Evident though they are, I see no reason why this should be held against either the film or director, as everyone involved in the film industry, (and any other industry) develops 'trademarks' that they use from one job to the next. Personally, I would rather see a single duplicated entry sequences of soldiers arriving through mist than the far over-used cliché shot used in most Hollywood productions where the camera pulls out from a close-up of the main character to reveal the danger - the ""dun-dun-duuuuun"" moment that we see so often in modern films. Zwick has expanded on the emotion and sense of honour create in ""Glory"" to produce a far deeper and more moving film than he had previously, creating a perfect balance in the depiction of the Japanese culture and driving the narrative forward, capping it all with an outstanding finale. A touching story, supported by a superb score by Hans Zimmer, this film is a must-see for any viewers who appreciate a strong plot and great acting, especially given that Cruise expels for one rare occasion.",The Last Samurai

I can understand if you didn't like it, I heard many convincing arguments from the people I went with, but a 1 means the film was downright awful.  a 1 is such an extreme rating.

593,TPalmerboys,An epic masterpiece?,10,22 December 2003,"The Last Samurai is one of the best constructed epics that I have seen, and the direction was wonderful.First let's talk about Tom Cruise, a movie with Cruise is an instant box office success but critically Cruise tends to overact.. so how do you combat this?  Carefully prune over the script... overacting is OK when Cruise is drunk, but it is not OK in a touching scene so don't let him speak much... Cruise doesn't have to talk much during action so that is good too; however, people like to see Cruise on camera so show a lot of him BUT use this discretion to keep him from showing off his penchant for overacting and watch the sound because he breathes really loud which can get annoying... in this movie the director knew all this and was able to combat the flaws in Cruise's acting.Now there were some great actors in this movie like Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto) who was simply stunning (he should be nominated for best Supporting Actor)So good acting is important to this type of film but the two other important aspects are script and action sequences.Action sequences are very important because this is a samurai movie but the sequences must be tasteful and endearing because there are in the context of the movie.  Watch a Van Dam movie and its like ""oh ok time for senseless fighting"" just like in a porno its like ""what's your name?  Lets have sex."" In Last Samurai the beautifully choreographed action scenes are always meaningful, for they are meant to reveal the true essence of characters, and in this aspect I don't think I've ever seen a movie in which action so aptly revealed a character.The script in an epic is very important because it dictates the pace of a movie.  If the script is too fast between action scenes, then the action scenes lose meaning and the movie becomes another crappy film whose sole purpose is to make a profit (i.e. Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Reindeer Gamers, any Van Dam, Seagal, Stallone, or Schwarzenegger movie).  If the script is too slow you may be watching the English Patient or some other god-awful overdone movie that is painful to bear because of tediously long periods of complete inaction. Dialogue and plot is important too because a movie like Legends of the Fall actually manages to pass the previous test but still finds wanting because of well.. a corny plot and some stupid dialogue.. I was cheering with the next guy when Aiden Quinn shot Brad Pitt's would be killers, but it was not a great movie because the plot was way too sweeping.  The Last Samurai is not in a rush to finish but never lingers too long on any scene or any subject and this is the movie's true accomplishment.. you feel fulfilled when the movie ends... good has not completely triumphed (which I am glad for) and somehow you feel like a part of you can walk out of the movie a little better, whether it be braver or with a greater appreciation for life.This being said there are couple of imperfections, as there are with any movie. 1) the search for the perfect blossom was a metaphysical search the point was not literally finding one 2) there a couple too many long looks between Cruise and Katsumoto;s sister 3) while it treated itself as original, the white man ALWAYS wins.. although in this case it was pretty clear that had to happen.Unless you truly cannot stand Tom Cruise do not hesitate to see this near masterpiece... for those of you who hate Cruise.. give it a try because there is a remarkably talented surrounding cast",The Last Samurai

599,TypicalJeff,Epic Excellence,10,29 November 2003,"I came into this film with high hopes. The trailer left me with a fluttery feeling in my chest. I am a big fan of any and ALL movies involving Samurai. So, when I got wind of this movie I immediately started anticipating it. Disappointment is the last thing this film gave me. If anything this is definitely one of the best films of the year, if not THE best. This is certainly a movie that will get a few nods from the Academy.So, what made it so good? Three parts: Cruise, Plot, Battle. Cruise: I've always been a fan of Tom Cruise, though I've never been one to say his acting is top-notch. However, with his last few films I've been impressed with him. After seeing him taking on this role as he did I am now convinced he is a very credible and wonderful actor. He was believable as an alcoholic Civil War veteran, but also fell into the character of a newly converted samurai so very well. Intensity was one of the key factors to Cruise's character, but also the introspective moments.. the moments of growth were pulled off skillfully. I would NOT be surprised at ALL if Cruise gets a nomination for ""Best Actor"" on this one, folks. Plot: As always one of the most important elements of a film is the plot. No story, no enjoyment. This movie has a great plot, and I give a round of applause to John Logan for writing it. From the beginnings of introducing Algren to the samurai encampment to the blood-soaked battlefields nearer the end of the film. With each new event .. Logan managed to craft good transitions and good dialogue. What I REALLY loved though, was his use of both English and Japanese. It wasn't forced, but natural. Love to see that. Overall the plot was great and really had no slow points in it. I never got bored, that's for sure. Battle: Going into this film I knew there would be some excellent battle scenes. After hearing of the film's budget this was an absolute certainty. I was not wrong either. I found the last battle to be quite a stunning visual display. Kudos to Zwick and the cinematographer for painting the picture so well. Not only were the battle scenes gripping, but scored well too! Hot damn! I was on the edge of my seat. Also of note were the other characters in this movie. As good as Cruise was.. this movie would have been lacking if it had not been for the wonderful Japanese/American cast supporting it. Katsumoto's actor( I forget his name) was perfect. PERFECT! This movie is a must-see. That's all there is to it.",The Last Samurai
600,Black-Out,Amazing All Around,10,6 December 2003,"This movie has definately made it to my top 5 movies in recent memory. Everything about this movie was perfect. The acting was terrific, really an amazing job by both Tom Cruise and his Asian counter-parts Ken Wantanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada. I wasn't bored at any point of this movie. The effort put into this movie by all those affiliated with it shows very stongley. The writing was quite good too, the dialougue ran pretty smooth so even people who are not as knowledgable about japanese culture will understand it. I really like the depiction of the characters thoughout the movie, I really felt emotionally attached to various characters through-out the movie. Also the cinematography was great, all the shots of ""japan"" (actually New Zealand) were breathtaking.This movie pleases on many levels. It combines elements of many from multiple genres, which makes an altogether amazing movie.
And of course the action was amazing. The choreography was exceptionally well done. Never did the action get repetitive, because there were constantly new situations which came up.SEE THIS MOVIE",The Last Samurai
601,nicksftw92,The Single Most Amazing Film Ever Made,10,9 November 2010,"The Last Samurai is a monumental film directed by (Sir - as I think he should be knighted for such a film) Edward Zwick with Tom Cruise as the protagonist accompanied by Ken Watanabe (who frankly steals every scene he is in). For those of you who do not like Tom Cruise, or cannot appreciate him as an actor, you're in luck, because in this movie you can hardly believe such an awe inspiring performance can be given by such a loony man.The film is ultimately about the psychological struggle of a soldier as he tries to forget what he has done in his military days, serving under a merciless leader, Custor. He is hired for another job training the Japanese army in order to fight the Samurai rebellion (who believe Japan is becoming westernised too fast). To really enjoy the movie to its full capacity it must be watched more than once. The movie contains a lot of symbolism and is by no means the average persons movie, as it requires a lot of what the educated call ""thinking"". To understand the movie in all of its beauty, you must devote time to understanding Algren's character and how he chronicles his life, and ultimately his evolution to peace of mind. Algren chronicles his life through a diary and narrates much of the movie as we virtually enter the mind of Nathan Algren.It begins with an introduction of Kastumoto (Ken Watanabe) doing what seems to be meditation, thinking of a white tiger, which later equates to mercy and a friendship between Katsumoto and Algren. We are then immediately engulfed into the world of Algren's character and personality as we see that he is a washed up soldier doing educational plays for the community. During this scene we see how morbid his character is, as he reflects on the hell he had to endure while under the command of Custor. Throughout the beginning of the film we see that he is a clear alcoholic (and he uses this to escape the reality of what he has done) and as the film progresses we see his declining need for it as he comes to terms with what he has done and finds peace within himself. Countless times he has escaped death, each time wishing it would be his last as he cannot take the strain of what he has done.The movie turns around from a morbid character development of Algren to a positive progression of self portrayal after he is captured by the Samurai and held as a (somewhat free) prisoner in Katsumoto's son's village. It is here where we see perspective on his character as he realises the disgust he has for his own culture. He becomes lost in the beauty and serenity of the Samurai culture, slowly trying to learn their ways and as he does, he begins to forget about what he has done in his past and obtains a sense of closure and peace.I cannot express the beauty of this film in words other than it is one of the most visually spectacular films I have ever seen. Every single actor in this film gives an absolutely amazing performance, and the directing is second to none. On top of that, there is a constant harmonizing soundtrack written by the one and only Hans Zimmer (and in my opinion is the greatest movie soundtrack ever written) which gives a beautiful ambiance to the whole movie.Every time I watch The Last Samurai, I cannot help but weep at how sad the movie is and the concept of it. And for you action junkies, it has incredible fight scenes that have been amazingly choreographed.I have seen this film 18 times now, and every time I love it more than the previous, and this cannot be said about 95% of the films made, but I realise something new every time. This movie changed my life and I can give it no less than a 10/10, and a movie that rivals it in my opinion is Shutter Island that I give 9.5/10 to.",The Last Samurai

Tom Cruise makes a fantastic portrayal of an outsider into a completely different world. I actually am so convinced of Tom during the film (i.e. the nightmare/sake scene) that I feel he becomes a samurai on screen. Ken Watanabe is also exceptional as a honorable and fearless samurai leader. The partnership between the two was electrifying and in my opinion both Cruise and Watanabes best performances to date. Overall the entire film was filled with emotional nail -biters and a tearful affair. Very nicely concluded and its a film I personally never get tired of watching. I hope the two return to collaborate in the near future.",The Last Samurai

It has some flaws in the historical aspect, but as fiction is great! An epic that reminds me Brave Heart (not as good though). Tom cruise is very well and the actor that plays Katsumoto too. Nice sound effects and great battle scenes. So, it's just 154 min. greatly spent.Rating: 8,5 / 10.",The Last Samurai
605,darbicus_prime,Beautiful Film...but really an attempt at a one man show,7,5 December 2003,"In a year filled with epics, The Last Samurai stands out as one based in an aspect not often viewed by the world's eye.Set in 1870's Japan, The Last Samurai stars Tom Cruise as a disenchanted Civil War/Little Big Horn veteran hired to modernize the Japanese army into a western fighting force. However Cruise is captured by a rebel samurai faction, led by Ken Watanabe, and during the winter, Cruise comes in contact with the true meaning of the ""warrior spirit.""First it should be noted that The Last Samurai is one of the most beautiful films of the year. Set in picturesque Japan...we definitely get the idea that this is where we are. Director Edward Zwick did a good job of letting the scenery take us to this time period, and should be commended on that element.Zwick also does a good job delivering an enthralling, if predictable, storyline. The actors save for one are very believable in their roles, especially Watanabe who delivers an Oscar caliber performance as the Samurai leader.Unfortunately the movies biggest attraction is also it's biggest detraction. Cruise doesn't deliver the Oscar-caliber performance he so desperately wants to deliver...and unfortunately Zwick spends too much time trying to give Cruise those soul-searching moments at awkward points in the story. Cruise is the only element that takes us out of the world and back into reality.As far as historical epics go...you are much better off seeing Master and Commander. For while this one is good, it lacks the touch necessary to make it a classic.7/10",The Last Samurai
606,Iggybone,Epic Masterpiece,10,28 December 2003,"There is a concept floating around that ""The Last Samurai"" is simplistic and formulaic. Could there be more of a grotesque distortion of the truth? This movie is, in every way, flawless. Note Tom Cruise's acting performance. He fits the role perfectly, and the two years he spent in preparation show in his skill with the sword, ease in Japanese speech, and feel of character. He, along with Ken Watanabe, form a one-two punch that, in my humble opinion, are prime for Academy Awards.The Cinematography in the movie is simply breathtaking. The camera work managed to capture some of the most eye-appealing scenes in recent movie history. Even if one is not a fan of the acting, or the plot, for that matter, it is a heinous injustice to deride the movie completely. Hans Zimmer comes in and delivers a fantastic performance in musical score, which only serves to augment the tone of the movie. Now, onto the plot Note: Some MILD SPOILERS may follow. For those who disagree with the fact that Cruise has decided to fight for the samurai, I pose this question: What do you truly expect? Cruise plays a disgruntled AMERICAN civil war hero. Yes. American. He makes this point a few times in the movie, therefore, he is not TRYING to be Japanese. He is merely an onlooker who finds beauty in an otherwise snubbed environment. The progression of story follows an ideal pattern. That does not qualify for the slander of ""formulaic."" It simply progresses the way a movie OUGHT to progress, and is, therefore, almost too perfect for its own good.Granted, some of the lines may be hackneyed, but it was nothing that truly detracted from the enjoyability of the movie. For those who carp and nitpick the inaccuracies of this movie, realize that it is Fictional Drama...and in that realm, ""The Last Samurai"" has no superior, or equal for that matter.Practically Flawless10/10",The Last Samurai
607,jheriko,Touching.,10,3 December 2003,"(Possible spoilers...haven't started writing yet.)If you've seen The Fellowship of the Ring and was touched by how Boromir(the dude who was shot with arrows) kept on fighting as he was dying then you're guaranteed to be touched by The Last Samurai.  And there are many other reasons why anyone would like this movie, but I don't want to over-hype it.If you hate Tom Cruise then I plead that you imagine it's someone else in his place because this movie shouldn't be knocked just because he starred in it.  If you're one of those people who like to just get lost in a movie, or feel like a part of the movie(if you know what I mean) then this is one of those movies.  I ask you to put yourself in Tom's place and see what seeing, feel what he's feeling and this will truly be an enjoyable experience.
The visuals during the fight scenes are utterly amazing.  Yes this is a movie about an American who becomes a Samurai within 4 months or so, but it's just a movie, SO WHAT!  And yes the title gives it away, but he makes up for it in the end.In my opinion the best movies to see are the ones you have zero expectations or knowledge of.  For example, I was told by numerous friends that Pirates of the Carribean was the best movie they've ever seen, so that's what I expected.  And of course I didn't like it as much as everyone else.  I saw very little of this movie before I watched the sneak peek and I'm very glad.
To conclude my strayings of thoughts.  I love to cry in movies(the touching parts) and yes I'm a guy and I admit it.  I've cried in A Beautiful Mind, Finding Nemo, Cool Runnings, Lord of the Rings, etc. I know that might sound amusing of the range of movies that touch me, but I can't help it, they just do!  So let me just say this, during the last 15 minutes of the film, I had to hold back some of the tears to keep from balling(pardon the corniness of how that sounds).  And you know that feeling you get in your throat when you're kind of holding back tears, that kept going for 10 minutes after the movie ended.  Go see this movie, have an open mind, have no expectations, and don't have any pre-dislikes for Tom Cruise. If you do this, this movie should really touch you or come close to it.",The Last Samurai

He surprised me with his intensity and acting skills in this movie. He was absolutely believable in this role as Captain Algran.Ken Wattanabe was also brilliant. He was amuzing and very convinsing and definitely deserves an award for best supporting actor.The scenery (set?) was beautiful and original and the story oozes messages of forgiveness and new beginnings. Christians complain that the Eastern culture (and especially the custom of suicide when defeated) is glorified in this movie. I took something different from this movie: it appeared to me that suicide was sensiless and that nobody benefited from it. I enjoyed the discipline and devotion that was evident throughout the movie.All-in-all, definitely one of the top movies I've seen!",The Last Samurai

When I saw the previews I scoffed at the idea of trying to integrate the hollywood heart-throb ""Tom Cruise"" into a Samurai movie.  I was almost sure they were going to really screw it up and have Cruise as some sort of cross-culture super hero.
Instead they delivered a very surprising and well-done movie.  Although Tommy Boy is on the camera a majority of the time they didn't seem to depend on him as the movie's saving grace.  All the characters (especially Katsumoto) had a very strong presence.  The movie as a whole worked incredibly well.",The Last Samurai
611,sboscaro,Laughable,4,20 January 2004,"Well, during all the movie Samurais are depicted as a warriors' elite that studied and practised the art of war for centuries. Nevertheless we see that it's very easy for an American alcoholic to equal them in the art of katana handling in just some months of training (this samurais must be dumb, as they practise katana since they are children !!). What about tactics ? After centuries of continuous warfare, they need a foreigner to teach them to feign a retreat and then to counterattack. And what about the final scene in which the captain arrives just when the pact is being signed and the Emperor changes idea ? I laughed to tears. I thought The Gladiator was unrivalled, but Hollywood never cease to amaze me. I'll seek comfort in Kagemusha or Gohatto.",The Last Samurai

When I saw the ads I didn't expect much from it, just because I didn't think that a movie with samurais against an army with gun powder interested me.  And of course the fact that Tom Cruise was in it pushed me away (Don't get me wrong he is a pretty good actor but I was never too fond of him.).  But the idea of another samurai, and that is was nominated for academy awards I had to go see it.  It turns out that it was a really great movie.  I can't believe I almost past up this fine opportunity to see it.  Which brings up the question, those of you who voted for it as a 1 did you even see the movie?  In short, great movie, and it also raises my opinion of Tom Cruise.Cameron Henrikson, Pirates4Ever",The Last Samurai
613,travelbug86,Brilliance,9,6 December 2003,"Just saw the movie last night ,i didn't even realize how long it was until i looked at my watch and realized it was one in the morning . Thats becasue i was hooked from the first scene , i swear i never even blinked.First off the only film that could possibly have a chance to top the cinamatography of this one would be LOTR return of the king . The camera work presenting scenery is absolutely stunning it truly sells the landscape of Japan( amazingly enough it was filmed in New Zealand). The battle sequences were also out of this world , unlike master and commander , where it was hard to tell who was hitting who , and moving to fast for your eyes to follow. No these battles are crisp , clear , and beautifully done . ( whats most impressive is that Tom Cruise and Ken Watabe do all their own stunts) Now as far as the story goes, don't listen to those idiots who judge a film before seeing it, this is nothing like Dances with wolves ,yea sure both films feauture a white man assimilating to a different culture , but thats as far as it goes ..anyone who thinks ""Last Samurai "" copied off Dances with wolves is mistaken.(no hating on kevin costner i love his movies to) The film transitions very smoothly from scene to scene , full of morality, its defeinatley one of those movies that will change you in someway spiritually. Not to give away anything but the love story is definately not the cliche everyone predicted its very complex. The acting is out of this world ( To hell with all of you that hate on Cruise) he 's awesome and he proves it once again in this film. This is my personal favorite of his performances second only to Jerry Maguire. Cruise perfectly portray's a man who has lost it all and has no reason to live , then expiereinces a spiritual rejouvination and finds a purpose to exist again. As always he does excellent , working off other people but it when the camera sits on him alone that he shines . The Music fits the mood of the film nicely ,and adds to the emotion . THere's also a light touch of humor in a couple of scenes which does justice to the film. THe samurai culrutre presented in this film can is one of the  coolest elements , the movie offered. (THERE ARE NINJAS!!! awesome badass!)  In closing i give this film 8.5/10 , look for cruise to be in the hunt for his first oscar , and for this movie to be in line for several other awards , including best director , cinamotography and Picture.""that was an order , did you not hear me?

614,attilanonym,not a great but still a nice epic movie,8,12 February 2004,"It's so hard for Hollywood movies to describe other cultures without bending the truth more or less.However,the Last Samurai did a very good job to present us the Japanese culture faithfully.The miracles of Japan in the last century which surprised generations of westerners were actually the result of the spirit illustrated in this movie,Duty and Conscience.Let along the magnificent battle-field scenes and great performance by the cast,the cultural depth in the movie made it one of the best epic movies in recent years.As far as I know about Japanese history,the story is not exactly a real one,especially the parts concerning the emperor and his ministers.Like other historic events in movies,e.g.political conspiracy in Gladiator,characters in this one were grouped typically as good or bad guys,the event was dramatized beyond the truth(Can you believe the last scene in the palace?).Probably good for the box-office,but it simplified the meaning and undermined the seriousness of history.",The Last Samurai

618,RMrulz001,Very Good Film,8,17 December 2003,"After the disappointment that was The Matrix: Reloaded, I decided I wasn't going to see another movie until Return of the King.  But on a whim, I decided to go out and see The Last Samurai.  And while it wasn't the greatest movie of the year, or anything like that, it was a very good film. One I wouldn't be upset to see again if I had to.The opinion on Tom Cruise seems to be quite mixed.  I don't like him very much, but every once in awhile I think he makes a movie that shows he is a much better actor than he usually seems to be.  I think this is one of those movies, yes at times the egomanic in him resurfaces, but on the whole I feel he gave a wonderful, quiet, understated performance that enhanced the movie.And about the movie itself - there were elements of countless previous works, such as Dancing with Wolves and Shogun.  But honestly, who cares? If the movie is good, if it is entertaining, who says it has to be the most original movie ever made?  And that's exactly what this was, entertaining. There was a quiet respect throughout the movie for the Samurai way of life, I especially liked the line that Tom Cruise's character gave about probably never completely understanding it.  It shows that us ""Western intelligent people"" can't understand everything, that there are other ways of doing things besides our own.The battle scenes were ordinary, but still good.  Hans Zimmer wrote a magnificent score, just one more in a long line of excellent work from him. The supporting cast was great, the fact that the intimacy in the movie was subtle and implied rather than outright and brash was appreciated, and added to the depth of the movie.Reading over this, I'd say this would be rated somewhere in the mid to upper range from me. But something about it makes me really like it, I think it's just a combination of the small factors that combined to make this a really good film.  Not excellent, but certainly worth the price of admission.",The Last Samurai

Instead, I think this is a strong message against violence and war; Samurai choose to die rather than surrender, Omura prefer to kill rather than renounce to its own interest. How many times people kill or die for an idea, for personal interest, or even for nothing at all? How many times people kill or die because they are like actors in a game, and are obliged to play their role up to the (obvious) end?A message that is sadly valid in the time being, no matter if we are the ones running against the gun machines, or those opening the fire.",The Last Samurai

""The Last Samurai"" is a bit more on the political problems of Japan in that time, as well finding oneself when you thought you lost it. With Algren as the person who had lost his soul for a cause he thought right, Cruise helps bring out the culture of Japan not seen often in the States. Also with Katsumoto (Watanabe) to play the opposite of Algren, he portrays how a traditional Japanese would have acted back then.While many people are accustomed to things being spoken outright, the Japanese are more of the opposite; what isn't spoken, is the most important. This may confuse the younger members but for those who study Japan, they might get the bigger picture.In short, it's quite difficult to say about ""Last Samurai"".

624,Bluesky_and_Breeze,This is a movie dedicated to the Japanese Viewers,10,15 February 2004,"I am a native japanese residing in Tokyo, very familiar of the actual history that took place in Japan towards the end of the 19th century.In short, by all means, this movie moved me and had me crying at certain moments. What I wanted to shout out after watching this movie was, ""Thank you Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick!!""From a Japanese viewer's point of view, it is evident that the story is all fiction, inspired by what actually happened. We all know there really was no American who stood for the final samurai rebellions, nor was there an American who took sides of the government. The movie also has its clear flaws if one looks at the details (e.g. there would never be any palm trees in the forests of mainland Japan, the wife of a samurai would never wear such heavy western make-up, the samurais would never be so fluent in English, etc). However, these issues are never irritating, as we could always sense a very strong, pure and innocent message coming from Tom and Ed, which I felt as a message coming from certain caring and intelligent American individuals to the nation of Japan and the Bushido (Samurai) spirit which still continues to live and influence our Japanese culture and our Japanese way of life.It is no wonder American viewers have mixed feelings about this movie, partly unaware of (and lacking true interest in) the history of Japan and partly noticing the similarities between this movie with other movies made in the past. From my perspective, however, being a Japanese national born and raised in Japan and knowing the dramatic history our country has gone through, I could not help but cry feeling the respect and sympathies coming from a very successful movie star (Tom) and movie director (Ed), bothering to spend a ""Hollywood Budget"" on what is a very ""personal"" story for the Japanese. It is the fact that this film was made by Hollywood which makes this film all the more important for Japan, as it would have been just another corny self-appraisal film if created by the Japanese themselves.Again, we know this is all fiction inspired by a true story and can't escape its small flaws, but I love the film all the same, and would like to thank from the bottom of my heart, Tom, Ed and others who deserve credit for thinking of creating this film in the first place.I don't think a film of this nature would ever be able to receive an oscar (as I can imagine how difficult it may be for an average American viewer to appreciate the true and deep meaning of this film, not being Japanese), but I believe this is a film which should deserve some kind of a ""Thank you"" award from Japan.

625,tom-curtis,It IS a Tom Cruise film so. . .,7,31 March 2012,"I give it a 7 out of a possible 10. And while you DO have the greatest movie star of them all in this flick, and some of the sword fighting scenes were very well done, the story still had a lot to be desired.First it is such a cliché to have our war hero, Nathan, a drunk, but really have a good heart. He fought with Custer and has been haunted by the women and children he killed. He gets an offer to go to Japan to train the emperor's soldiers. During battle, he managers to defend himself while surrounded and the Samurai leader, Katsumoto, decides to spare his life. So Nathan is taken to the Samurai village and cared for by the wife of the man he killed. What doesn't make sense is why does he take this ""kidnapping"" so lightly. He is a very violent man, why doesn't he do something crazy. So, of course, he learns to love the Samurai way and chooses to fight for them. And of course they have to throw a silly love interest in being the woman who nursed him.As I said the battles are done OK. I'm surprised it didn't get an R rating. There isn't much blood, but there are a number of people shown getting swords put right through them. But, I'm sure there is much more to the history lesson than is shown on screen. I never tells why the Samurai want to fight and don't want to get along with the emperor. I'm sure the movie paints the Samurai as much more likable than they really were.FINAL VERDICT: It isn't a great epic, so I don't recommend it if you don't like long movies. But, if you really like epics then take the time to watch it because it isn't bad.",The Last Samurai

Godspeed to you Tom. the chances of these few lines getting to him are slim but if he should ever read them, the message of goodwill on my part will have got to him as this is all I can offer him.. and isn't that good enough, just goodwill with no strings attached. tom is a good actor and whatever people may think of him- no one is perfect- one must remember that he also provides happiness to moviegoers with his efforts.a friend Timothyg@wanadoo.es",The Last Samurai

628,mike_zech,Epic Adventure!,10,21 April 2012,"Tom Cruise is in top form as a samurai warrior no less in this action packed adventure.The story revolves around a civil war vet in the 1800's Nathan Algren (Cruise in one of his better performance's since Michael Mann's Collateral). Nathan is sent to Japan to help the Japanese army fend off the Samurai, whom are being a real pain in the butt. Cruise being beaten in battle is now captured by them and learns their way of life from their leader Katsumoto (Watanabe). Nathan's eyes are opened to see who truly is the worse of the two, he is turned against the Japanese government and fights in one of the biggest sword swing, horse riding battles of all time (Just my opinion). Cruise and Watanabe give an electrifying performance in Edward Zwick's masterpiece The Last Samurai.",The Last Samurai
629,harliiwood,Excellent Action Movie!,10,15 June 2004,"The Last Samurai was not what I expected. Not only is it an excellent action movie, but I feel the content is very good for history buffs. After watching this movie I felt I would enjoy doing some research on the history of Samurai and Japanese culture.SPOILERS AHEAD...Tom Cruise was excellent as Captain Algren, an alcoholic who finds himself as he resides in a Samurai village as a captive. As he watches the Samurai train, he rediscovers why he is a soldier. He finally joins in the training and as he's constantly defeated, he challenges himself to do better each time. His relationship with the rebel Samurai leader becomes strong and each man helps the other in some way. Although there is a woman in the picture, that storyline is thankfully not developed as I feared it might be. Thus, the action and historical parts of the movie are given center stage.I now know why Ken Watanabe was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. I think he's the new Chow Yun-Fat. His English was excellent in the movie. His demeanor as Katsumoto, the leader of the rebel Samurai, is somewhat conflicted, but in a good way. He's at once thoughtful and inquisitive and at another bold and dangerous. His relationship with the other Samurai, including his son, is strong and they are very respectful of him. It was good to see the respect the villagers showed the Samurai as they passed through, bowing low. It showed how much the Samurai once meant to this culture.Tony Goldwyn and Masato Harada (Col. Bagley and Omura) are villains you love to hate. They're each excellent as the forces attempting to suppress and overcome the remaining Samurai. The interesting thing about the movie is that much of what they show us, we know is true. For example, the way Japan (and possibly other Eastern cultures) tried to lose its identity by becoming more like the European West. That part of the movie was very sad to me, to see the Japanese Emperor and his ministers willing to give up their traditions and identity in favor of guns, armies, suits and ties.This movie is very graphically violent and bloody, but I guess I'm nuts, I loved it. I wouldn't let a youngster (under 12) watch this. I had visions of blood and chopped off heads later and I'm an adult, so you might want to watch this first before allowing your child to see it, or if you're very squeamish, you might want to reconsider.Lastly, the subtitles didn't bother me at all. Although I watched it on a large screen TV, the print was rather small and I had to read it out loud for people sitting farther away from the screen than I was. That is the only negative thing I have to say about the film. Please see this movie yourself and make up your own mind about its worth. You won't be sorry.",The Last Samurai
630,spiderwebK,beautiful photography,6,11 July 2004,"If you like a typical Hollywood movie, you will like this movie.I enjoyed watching beautiful photography which probably attracts many eastern people by its exotic scenery of Japan.I found some good acting in there too, but what disappointed me is the relationship between Tom and the woman who took care of him and started to have feelings for him.The relationship is really annoying in the movie and that makes this movie typical Hollywood movie.I think the love relationship doesn't have to be depicted in the movie.I wish it were just ""hero"" movie.Music is playing a great part in this movie.Especially, it makes the landscape of Japan so magnificent and it's helping the too-quiet-atmosphere in the movie.Well, I'm actually Japanese, so I see the truth of beauty in the silence, when it comes to the movie, music never disturbed to me.",The Last Samurai

I originally did not even wish to see the movie, because I felt that they would not be able to portray the time period accurately using American actors and staff.I was extremely pleased with how the setting was done and the actually casting worked out very well. There are one two scenes that in the movie that would not have taken place in the actual time period in Japan, but other than those, they movie was a great movie. Tom Cruise played a great role, and his abilities are very under appreciated. He definitely deserved an Oscar for his performance.Great movie and one I would recommend to any one. 10/10",The Last Samurai

634,Andrew661130,"masterclass movie,well told story.",10,30 May 2005,"my love for tom cruise as an actor grows stronger all the time. his part in an epic tale told about the samurai's was brilliantly and also sadly portrayed.i was a kid when i first heard the word samurai, i thought of them as monsters, to be killed as i thought they themselves were killers how wrong was i.history once again has incorrectly written lies about the samaurai, why else would i think of them as the enemies of the people.The last samurai made me sad because in this day of age i would love to be one of them.dying for honour and living with the idea that there is purpose in everything we do.they lived for one purpose to serve the Emperor,and to die for their beliefs,religions now are all to confusing ,but there's so........simple. i cried for the end of those brave warriors and my complextion,took a whole new turn.being killed when told your idea's are no longer needed.I began to wonder who the real villains were!who are the bad guy's?The emperor for not saving the samurai's,the samurai's themselves, the Japanese government for not using more diplomatic discussions in order to save the samurai's or the American soldier who killed Indian children, then later felt remorse, then for some strange reason i began to love and respect.The last samurai is a well told story, you can make up your own minds who the good guys and the bad guys are.I'm 38 and feel cheated that i've spent 25 years or so thinking the Indians and the Samurai's are evil beings when all the time it's the very people who provide the blanket of peace that i live by ,who are perhaps in a realistic way the true baddies. this film and others like it open my eye's and I'm so tired of not knowing what's true and what's not. tom cruise done excellent work and my respect to the other suppporting cast,once again my eye's have seen the true light.to the samurai's i salute them ,i have never seen a braver and respected race of warriors.i guess in writing this i now know why i cried .to forget the teaching of my young life and arm myself with the sense that history as i knew it.made sense to the gullible.i only just watched the last samurai i will sit down again and watch it.well done guys.",The Last Samurai
635,TMifune1961,A Beautiful Tale Of Redemption and Inner-peace,10,1 March 2015,"""The Last Samurai"" is often criticized as another ""white man goes into a different culture, identifies himself with their beliefs, and changes his view and outlook upon them only to join with their cause."" Like ""Dances With Wolves"" for example. It's been disgustingly reviewed, on this board too, as another ripoff of just such a film. This film is beloved by people (Especially Japanese) and if any College Professor calls this film as another example of ""Orientalism"" or ""White-Man's Burden"" they are dead wrong and need to do some research or have their PHD removed. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a man haunted by the actions he took by killing a Native American tribe by the orders of Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) and drowns himself in alcohol to numb the inner pain he feels. He's hired to train Japanese soldiers during Japan's Meji Period. He's captured during the soldiers first battle with the samurai and brought to their village. After the hell of alcohol withdrawal he endures, he slowly begins a friendship with Katsamoto (Ken Watanabe) who, through the samurai code of Bushido, accepts begins to forgive himself and find a new reason for living. Through the experiences he encounters with the village people he begins a transition and while he doesn't immediately realize it, is being mentored by the people, especially Katsamoto himself. He begins to realize what these so called ""primitive savages"" are fighting to uphold: the code of the Samurai itself. What I find interesting is that both Algriens and Katsamoto's values rub off one another. This is why Algrein chooses to associate himself with the samurai and Katsamoto's cause. ""We've become nothing but a country of whores, selling ourselves to the highest bidder"" is what Katsamoto says during the film. The bottom line is this: don't let the cover image of Tom Cruise or whatever opinion you have of him, dissuade you from seeing this tale of redemption and inner-peace.",The Last Samurai
636,jonojet,Flaws in plot,6,31 January 2005,"I enjoyed the exploration of Japanese culture, and the struggle between modernisation and tradition, an issue which has found an interesting balance in Japanese society to this day. The one thing I could not stand in the movie was the incredulity in parts of the storyline. As already mentioned, the fight seen where Algren beats 5 samurai with a blunt flag is unbelievable, as is the machine-gun fight scene, where by some lucky coincidence, he is THE last man standing among the whole cavalry charge. And his capture... and the willingness of the samurai community to allow the enemy to join them? Fine, it makes for good drama but it somehow seems a bit too far-fetched a concept. Nonetheless, it does expose a lot of the Spartan and philosophical self-discipline of Bushido, and a great performance by Ken Watanabe. I was a bit disappointed by Cruise's appearance though, it seems like he's becoming more in love with himself as a big-name movie star rather than play the character.",The Last Samurai

I has an original mood, and if you listen to it carefully it has plenty of things to teach you about the values of life.I can't find any weak points of this movie, thats why i gave the the points (what is really rare from me).

638,spellzbreaker,A must see film,9,21 February 2006,"This film is unarguable the greatest war movie in the early 21st century, as every events and actions that is occur in the film truly express the audience about the Japanese traditional life as it is back then. The scenes is well organize and carefully design. Specially the ending when the samurai face the imperial army of japan. The film maker really owe the martial art of war trainers they hired ""they really did a great job"". Like how we can see in the final battle, every single warrior is moving and show the real emotion in their face, not just the main character like other war movie. Everything is taken care so careful on almost every details that made the movie so perfect (and also good job on the sound affect, they successfully made an expression that greatly support the acting). Above all our effort, we cant run away from the fact that we are human and human make mistake no matter how hard they try to evade. The mistake is soo little, but really annoying if you notice. That American captain and the samurai's leader, is surely a man of war and a both a tactical genius. But what happened in the final battle really do not show their skills as a master of war, but more about a kid with no tactical strategy. As a Samurai, they know they can only kill their enemy as far as their katana can reach. Then why fighting in an open ground ? can't it just like the 1st battle in the wood? that way they have more chance to win. In my opinion,-although it is not precisely told in the film-, the samurai tried to separate the imperial army from their general, as they think the samurai is retreating, but they could at least form a loose formation that way they could reduce their casualty, not just stand in a group and wait to be hit by a howitzer. Overall, this movie is beyond extraordinary. I give 9 stars, 1 is flying to hell as the the last little mistake.",The Last Samurai

I was ready to dismiss the film as another of Tom Cruise's hit-or-miss movies...then I sat down and actually watched it.I could go on for ages about the phenomenal acting and cinematography, but perhaps my favorite thing about the film were the subtleties...the things that you catch in a movie after seeing it a second or third time. Some of the most minute gestures--Hatsumoto's nods of respect to Nathan, the way that Ujio adjusts Nathan's armor to show his approval, etc.---were how the characters showed their emotions to one another, which I thought were better than wasting dialogue trying to explain their feelings.My only problem was that the movie had the unfortunate occurrence of being released the same time as the last of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, so the movie wasn't nominated for as many Oscars as I feel it should have been.",The Last Samurai

Tom Cruise played the role of Nathan Algren, a captain from the USA, who trained the armies of Japan. Tom Cruise is good in this movie, though, however, I hated the Cliché at the end of the movie and every time I watch this movie I REFUSE to watch the end, all because of this cliché.This movie really shows us the true nature of the Samurai, their way of life (Bushido) and their religion.

644,hawkeyepierce3191,A versatile drama worthy of a wide audience's attention.,9,7 June 2006,"The Last Samurai is not what you might call ""4 star Oscar material"" - but it manages to succeed simultaneously as a drama and as an action piece, and it manages to deal with many different forms of emotion on many different levels.Tom Cruise stars as Nathan Algren, an American captain who is called to fight the Japanese Samurai. Algren is haunted by his memories of the Native American slaughter, and they keep returning to him - until he is defeated by the Samurai and taken in to learn their ways. You can tell that the movie borrows from the book ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,"" since some of the stories and motifs from the book are very familiar within the movie, and since Algren's history with the Indians is an apparent backdrop for the movie's story. The word ""savage"" is used heavily by the hardcore American fighters, and like in the book, Algren is spared from his comrades' fate because the enemy appreciates how hard he fought.What makes this movie so versatile is how, at different points in the story, it can cover many dramatic feelings with such subtle touches. The story that is told through Algren's adventures begins with remorse. Upon encountering Katsumoto - the wisened leader of the samurai, masterfully portrayed by Ken Watanabe - Algren begins to understand the samurai, and he learns honor, discipline, and culture. Under Edward Zwick's beautiful direction, you can manage to understand and appreciate the themes of the movie by watching more than listening.What holds The Last Samurai back is the choice of Tom Cruise for the protagonist. While he is not a bad actor at all, he himself is too glamorous and scandalous for a role that is intended to be subdued. Also, he manages to look convincing in everything he does, but something about the way he sounds is inconsistent and out of pace with the other actors in the film. He seems to approach this the same way he approached Minority Report - while he was perfect for that role, it doesn't work the same way here. Finally, one thing the film dwells on for too long is the concept of destiny. You know it's gone too far when it is asked if you can change your destiny when, as any logical person would tell you, part of the idea of destiny is that you have to end somewhere.Nonetheless, I would strongly recommend The Last Samurai because it never dwells on anything for too long, and because the writing is always sharp and never awkward. The romance takes a backseat - where it belongs - by making it feel more like respect and mutual appreciation than desire or lust. The direction of Edward Zwick (Glory) is an appropriately slower pace, and it correctly accentuates the artistic approach to the film and the focus on the dramatic elements. The Last Samurai, besides providing lengthy and well-choreographed battle scenes, manages to succeed as a drama because it shows viewers the importance of honor and family, the significance of discipline and tradition, and finally, the glory - and tragedy - of war. But most importantly, it demonstrates the curse of an industrialized, unappreciative, and cold-hearted culture, and it will help to give you a better idea of what peace truly can be.",The Last Samurai
645,zenk0006,"Excellent movie, but mediocre actor in lead",7,28 January 2006,"I thought the plot line and story was an excellent one, much in line with Shogun, Dances with Wolves and other movies where a lost soul finds truth in who he is through another culture. Where this movie falls short for me is in the acting of Tom Cruise. I have no personal beef with Cruise as I think he has had several good movies that suit his acting style. Mission Impossible and MI2, Top Gun, Risky Business, just to name a few. I personally don't believe he is a great drama actor. He simply does not pull it off as his dramatic range is more believable when it involves a character with a huge ego such as in Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men, or The Color of Money. I think a better choice of actor for the role of Nathan Algren would have been Christian Bale. This critical role needed a highly physical actor, capable of performing highly technical martial arts skills, with a tremendous dramatic range. Without this, the movie falls well short of its potential.",The Last Samurai

The battle scenes were very well played out and the plot had you captivated as soon as the movie started. This may be the best Tom Cruise movie yet. The only problem I can see with this movie is the fact that you have to read a lot of subtitles but to a true movie fan it is not that big of deal. The Japanese co-stars did a remarkable job as well.

656,eminentjonfrost,very moving great film,10,17 March 2007,"Hi all! This is my first comment on IMDb, so I'll try to not spoil anything and make a good first impression. :) This movie is definitely my favorite. No doubt about it (well, maybe a little with 300 now showing). I watch this movie almost periodically to keep myself...'in check' with my values and to put into my perspective what is important to me and what is good for the people around me. I find that this movie hits me...in several 'dimensions', you can say. I'm reminded that decisions and actions I make will stick with me and that my life later on will be affected greatly by my choices and I'm reminded that courtesy, respect, devotion, and most of all, honor should be held high in my life.Every time I see the film, I feel like I'm maturing in some way from all the emotional and moral vibes I get from this film. While there are fights in the movie, it isn't the conflicts that the movie focuses on. The movie focuses more on what the fight is for.(I'm not sure this is a spoiler, but I'll flag my comment as a spoiler for it anyway, just in case) The samurai fight for justice and live to serve their emperor. The emperor's advisors, however, aim to gain for themselves using the emperor's goal for a unified and independent Japan. This conflict of interests is what makes the rest of the story.This movie's portrayal of the samurai and 'the bad guys' is genius. By the end of the film, I saw the samurai nearly as saints while I see the 'advisors' as despicable. The samurai are represented with characters that each show admirable qualities, while the opposite is seen of Omura (watch the film to know him). Only in the beginning, before you get a chance to see the samurai's perspective, might you think otherwise.At the end of the film, when the emperor is being told a secret, you can see Omura dropping in in the corner of the screen. Images like that throughout the film give powerful portrayals.My favorite aspect of the movie of all, its soundtrack. I LOVE this movie's soundtrack. Its quite beautiful and you can picture the movie while listening to it. It is slightly repetitive, just enough to notice, but not enough to change my opinion of it whatsoever.This is my favorite movie and my favorite soundtrack (and possibly music in its entirety) 10/10",The Last Samurai
657,macc_98,Class project,9,3 April 2007,"I really liked this movie because of its well-developed plot, and the effective personalities of the characters. The changing emotions and views of the main character are also felt by the audience (or I felt that way, at least).I think this movie had a very good plot because it followed the life of military man with ""shell shock"" and how he deals with that, how his views and beliefs changed while being a prisoner, and how he related to the audience's feelings when he decided to fight with the Samurai. As for the other characters, Omura was an effective ""bad guy"" because he was stubborn and wanted victory and success by any means possible, and it was very satisfying to see what happened to his character at the end because there was an amount of loathing associated toward him. Algren's superior officer Col. Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) played a military colonel who only cared about money and victory, though he does follow orders. I liked what happened to this character near the end of the movie because of what Algren said to him near the start of the movie. Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) was a great character because he embodied the traits and personality of an honorable Samurai in the early 1900's. At the end, I felt a range of emotions, which kept me thinking well after the movie was over. The other rest of the cast, though seen less-often, played powerful roles for plot development.This movie is very slow at parts, which is one of the bad things about it. It also is not a family movie, but even though it's rated R, mid to older teens might be able to watch it.For the movie as a whole, it left me thinking about what it would have been like to live in a time like that. I would recommend watching this movie.",The Last Samurai

659,joshrogers,"Art, Beauty, and Emotion",10,7 December 2003,"Art. If I had to say one thing about this movie, this would be it. Art. When the movie started, I have to say that I expected something completely different. I have always had a profound respect for Japanese culture and the idea of mainstream producers trying to handle it scared me. So many times, I've seen the Japanese culture shown from either the perspective of World War II, where they are crazed killers, or from different but still americanized perspectives.
The Last Samurai completely breaks from this paradigm and goes on to offer so much more. From the time that Japan is first shown in a sweeping panorama, the verisimilitude to the real Japan is truly wonderful. My Japanese foreign exchange student was shocked that Americans could make something so accurate and beautiful. The scenery and cinematography cannot be described, and the attention to detail is exquisite.
But perhaps the greatest innovation of this movie is its depiction of Japanese culture, especially way of the warrior, or bushido. Through marvelous directing and a wonderful script of subtitled Japanese and English, The Last Samurai succeeds in conveying and truly imprinting the deep emotion and tradition behind Japanese culture.
As a whole, the movie depicted beautifully both peaceful Japanese life and the insanity of the battlefield. For me, finding beauty in killing was a paradox but this movie proved my conceptions wrong. Watching this movie was an emotional roller coaster, an eye-opening experience, and an insight into the true Japanese culture. I will defiantly see it again.",The Last Samurai
660,DiegoFidel,"My eternal thanks to ""the last samurai""",4,21 September 2007,"This is my very first IMDb review, and let me tell you why I choose ""the last samurai"", and no other. Because this movie is the reason why I became a classic movie fan/collector.I remember it like yesterday... February of 2004, summer in Buenos Aires (where I live), going to Recoleta for a walk, entering the movie theater just to see what were they playing, buying the ticket and a popcorn, preparing myself to have a nice moment of light and harmless entertainmentAround half of the movie, EPIPHANY !. ""Didn't I see this movie already, at least one million times ?"". ""Why Tom Cruise, again ?"". ""I already know who is going to get the chick, to be the hero, to give as all an unforgettable lesson of honor and humanity... the yankee, right !"". ""Why I keep seeing this kind of movies"" ... and so onI left the theater, to never return. This was my last Hollywood-crap-big-budget movie, period. I keep asking myself how could I spent so many years of my life, passively consuming this junk-culture propaganda. But OK, better late than never.Now, after 3 years of rehab (exclusively Kurosawa, Bergman, Fellini, Eisenstein, Kubrick, indie, art, documentary, etc)... I can finally say that I'm cured, I can recognize junk from miles awayAll thanks to ""The Last Samurai"", which I will never forgetFidel Polvorón PS1: this is based on a true story... in fact, it's 100% a true story PS2: I gave it 4/10, just because Ken Watanabe, Art and Costumes",The Last Samurai
661,e_freedland@hotmail.com,Absolutly amazing!!!!,10,15 December 2003,i cant believe how good this movie actually was! me and my brothers have actually changed our lifestyle thanks to this movie! we even bought samurai swords (plastic ofcourse) and have been reinacting the movie since we watched it! a MUST see!,The Last Samurai
662,norihiro01,A W E S O M E MOVIE,10,23 November 2003,"Edward Zwick with his solid foundation in Kurosawa's cinema, brings the world of the samurai onto the modern silver screen to its fullest realization, while striking the fine balance between entertainment and historical authenticity. If Kurosawa were still alive I believe he would be impressed. There is no doubt in my mind that this raises ""Japanese"" cinema to whole other level.It is a cinematic journey led by capable hands that do not  steer the boat in the wrong direction or rock it unnecessarily, or spring leaks along the way. which is a VERY welcome relief watching a movie about Japan from a Japanese POV, Considering how easy it has been for hollywood to go for fast buck Jap-ploitation and poor enunciation. What I like about this movie is the level of authenticity, respect and dedication with which Ed Zwick and the creative talent has handled the samurai story. There is a level of richness to this movie that would sustain delving into it as far as you want to go.Essentially it is a Great Story, with Great Characters, with Great Execution, which is much easier said than done. It allows you to take a journey and discover another world and a way of being that is close to approaching the transcendent as Ive had in any modern day experience.. To me its pretty close to cinematic nirvana.The combination of the creative people involved here is a Dream Team. John Logan's script - his name is what got me excited back in the beginning. Hans Zimmers score - just hit me again Maestro! Ed Zwicks Directing - he IS the Man for the Job. John Tolls Cinematography - I dont think I'll get tired of this view. Costumes - the armour looks so dam good. Sound - one word howitzer. Supporting performance by Japanese actors - makes me proud. and Tom -  performance, and dedication to the role and project. oh and vfx - if its there you dont notice it because its good. oh and Im sure the editing is top notch too.I believe this is a good movie regardless, so I wont be suprised but WILL be excited when this pic recieves multiple oscars in any and all of the categories. but watch out!  because this WILL be the year that the maverick finally does good ! Im also wondering if there will be a first for a Japanese actor.Tom mentioned the spirit of the film as a ""gift"" and I would have to accept it with gratitude. and to Edward Zwick my respects.BRAVOP.S WarnerBros please release the dvd NOW !",The Last Samurai
663,Nxxtheflickchick,Beautifully crafted with strong performances all round,8,16 February 2005,"A beautifully crafted film, even the gruesome battle scenes are handled with a delicate poise and elegance. The cinematography in particular grabs you from the very opening sequence.Tom Cruise gives a solid yet standard performance. The real star of this feature is Ken Watanabe, with his subtle, passionate and stirring performance as the powerful leader and warrior, Katsumoto.The film narrates in the general accepted layout of most epic battles, pitting protagonist against a rival. However while it avoids the theme of the futility of war, the film does display a healthy distaste for the rigid organisation and obedience of western military, favouring instead the beauty inherent in the notion of honour displayed by the samurai. Though a brutal and unforgiving force, the samurai are remembered for their discipline, integrity and honour as illustrated beautifully by this film.",The Last Samurai
664,mr-mangus,The last samurai,10,31 December 2007,"I must say, this film really inspired me to endure the terrible things life throws at us. The story begins in which a previous civil war soldier(cruise) is struggling and wants to commit suicide for his actions toward natives during the war. He then goes to Japan to receive a job in which he teaches normal Japanese civilians how to fight against the samurai. Having lost their first battle, Cruise is captured by the Samurai and during his ordeal with them, he learns undeniable compassion and discipline. The acting is tearful, the music is beyond the most gorgeous I have ever heard, and the story line is just beautiful. The scenery and lighting fit the other three elements just perfectly. Agin, the music is the best part, thanks to Has Zimmer for delivering such a gorgeous score that supports and incorporates motifs regarding sadness and sorrow from ones past. A true piece of work and one of my favorite films!!!!!!!!!!",The Last Samurai

The attention to detail is spectacular; the costumes, weapons, and the dialouge is perfect.This movie shows what it is like to be the rebel, and makes it seem that just because you know you are going to lose, the people who are actually fighting for something. The samurai in the movie were very accuratly reproduced...everything from seppuku to the intense training they endure everyday. This movie should grant Tom Cruise with his first win as Best Actor, and Ken Watanabe's performance as Katsumoto is truly a masterpiece. This is the movie that ROTK will have the most trouble with at the oscars, and although I'm looking foward to ROTK, this movie has touched me in a way few movies have.4/4...Best movie of the year.Period.",The Last Samurai
666,sothicarreragt,brilliant movie!!!,10,22 April 2008,"best acting from Tom Cruise other than the movie jerry Maguire.its a brilliant movie overall and should have won Oscars if not for LOTR. There might be a slight flaw in its historical aspects, but come on this is a movie.there is nothing wrong with Nathan(cruise) living until the end because it was already mentioned that his time has not come(conversation between cruise and watanabe before the final battle).The main theme in this movie is Honor, and it portrayed that in every way.the theme is Honor, not culture or history so don't expect to get much of those two.this is not a movie where there is another superior American, but an American who learns from people around him and adapting himself to their culture.some people find it very hard to accept an American samurai, but in this movie, Nathan is already a professional warrior in his own country, so he does not find much trouble learning from them.Overall, this movie for me is an epic and i Honor it in every way.",The Last Samurai

The slow motion parts of yer man thinking back over his life were unwatchable - eugh!Typical Hollywood blockbuster fare. Sentimental and drawn out.The parts that were supposed to be funny were just silly. The parts that were supposed to be 'moving' were laughable and cliched. Man stares bravely ahead as woman dresses him for battle, cue 'emotionally stirring' music. Puke.Why is Tom Cruise always the good guy in films?

F.T.W was an American mercenary who trained and led Imperial troops during the Taiping Rebellion of the 1860's and was killed while leading his ""Ever Victorious Army"" in battle. Had he survived to help bring the conflict to a successful conclusion, then retired and written his memoirs, he would be better known today.

670,Reiqi,Lovely Epic; Welcome Change from Recent Popcorn-fare,7,30 November 2003,"My love for epics, Tom Cruise, and Japanese culture drove me to see this film. Repeatedly if possible. Having just come back from the sneak preview of the film (viewing #1 and counting), it is difficult for me to accept much of the criticism reviewers have generated. Some seemed upset by the lack of hacking-and-slashing action that the trailer appeared to promise, others offended by the apparent Love-the-White-Foreigner complex. Both criticisms are easy to dismiss once you've actually seen the movie.You will be disappointed if you enter the theater expecting hacking and slashing and gore-galore. God forbid that the movie be filled with *gasp* plot! The action that exists is beautifully choreographed, yet the filmmakers never forget that the stillness in between is just as important. There is no gore for the sake of gore itself - morbid beauty is found in every death and injury that occurs, and each only serves to remind us of the futility and bitterness of the conflict these warriors find themselves in.Tom Cruise may be billed as the star of the picture, but never does he become the glaring centerpiece of what is clearly an ensemble film. Each member of the Japanese cast explores a different perspective of a culture that may at first be incomprehensible to westerners. The eventual interest between Taka and Algren is beautifully restrained, as it would have been at the time. Some have deemed this plotline silly and unrealistic, yet when we see Taka's reaction towards Algren's relationship with her children and his own introspective growth, the eventual attraction is not so surprising. Nor does the film fall into the ""white man attraction"" cliche - that Algren is a foreigner seems highly irrelevant in their interest in each other - Taka hardly falls all over herself when he first crashes into her life. It is the tension and slow acceptance of eachother that makes this affair all the more delicious.There's much more to be said about this film, but really, it's been said, and said better, by my fellow reviewers. All in all this film ranks as one of my favorites of the year - I will be seeing it again -a lovely epic that comes as a welcome change from the recent popcorn-fare that has populated screens, possibly only to be topped by RotK.And, on a less intelligent note: DUDE. NINJA. I nearly squealed in joy at the neat surprise that it was.",The Last Samurai

In the context of this very beautiful film, it is a struggle worth The Last Samurai is a movie that demands our surrender  to its energy, to its bold-stroke movie-making, to its acting (particularly by Cruise and Watanabe, who blend musing and graceful muscularity) and, above all, to its romantic vision of a lost world. You have to rationalize its commitment to the warrior ...",The Last Samurai

If you haven't seen this movie yet, go do yourself a favor and watch it, you'll enjoy it guaranteed.",The Last Samurai
674,stanleyleo87,Great Movie...except for the ending.,9,23 February 2004,"After watching The Last Samurai a couple of months ago, the images and themes it bring up still linger in my mind. The image of Katsumoto (played by Ken Watanabe) meditating on top of the hill to begin the movie was pretty powerful. It presented the idea of inner-peace, yet also one of confusion, which seems to be a paradox that many people face. Also, the theme of honor runs rampant throughout the movie, and is strongly conveyed through the Samurai characters. Hiroyuki Sanada was impressive as Ujio, the tough, brutal, yet loyal and disciplined Samurai, and Ken Watanabe stole the movie with his powerful performance as the regal Katsumoto, who was faced with the dilemma which was complete change, or annihilation. The only character I felt was a bit overdone was Tom Cruise's. Granted, he was the main character, which is why the majority of the luck went to him, but it is still hard to believe that any man could have survived that charge on the howitzers. Getting stabbed my a couple spears when he was captured yet surviving, believably lucky; not getting ripped apart by hundreds of gatling gun rounds while everyone else around you is, unbelievably lucky. There were moments where I felt that there was a fair amount of overacting by some of the actors, but overall, the mood of the film was well maintained and expressed. I believe this movie deserves an 8.5/10",The Last Samurai
675,nuance1979,Enjoyable,8,3 December 2003,"After watching this enjoyable movie without noticing its 144 minutes' length, I can't help invoking another enjoyable movie, `Brave Heart'. In terms of its characteristic score, amazing views of landscape, heroic plot and, oh yeah, bloody sword fights, `The Last Samurai' stands clearly as a Japanese counterpart of `Brave Heart': what's more is the inspiring adventure of U.S. Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) into the diminishing Samurai society led by his Samurai mentor Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe); what's less is the mystic love story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson, Brave Heart). But I'm not saying this movie is impaired by its insufficiency of feminine flavor; in fact the subtle feeling between Nathan Algren and his nurse, Taka, is nicely presented in an oriental way. Although I didn't see any acting sophisticated enough to win an Academy Award in this movie, I believe its box office will be quite satisfying because with a right blend of commercially successful elements, this nice little Japanese meal is deliciously ummm. enjoyable.",The Last Samurai

Its no better than honey, its actually, I think, the exact same sort of movie.  Not genre-wise of course but its constructed the same way, taking pieces here and there from other competent movies and sticking them together to make another competent movie. We could have watched Dances with Wolves or Gladiator or Glory or practically any American Western and not have had to spend 12 bucks and 2 and half hours.  Wasn't any body freaked out by the Emperor's final speech about preserving tradition?  It was that composite mechanized-holy war that was gonna kill a helluva lot of people only two generations later.

This film combined American history and Japanese history that practically no public school teaches as far as i know.In The Last Samurai we see a lot of betrayal Japanese vs Japanese and Americans vs American.Many battles are fought during this film not just against Beliefs but their inerselfs.Characters in the movie have to brake the law to do what is right for their country or to just become a symbol, a symbol of hope for other Japanese to not forget their culture. For them to recognize who they really are and were they come from and for other country's to accept them without judging about appearance and culture but whats success they can bring with others countries.",The Last Samurai

I can't see why it isn't 10/10 but it should be. To begin with the casting is well chosen. Tom Cruise probably played his strongest in this film. The settings are attractive and beautiful where the music is just astonishing at times. The story has many twists and flows well. I particularly adored the action it was realistic yet it showed the true spirit of the samurai in the combat. The ending is truly heartbreaking just thinking that they had been ordered to fight and destroy their own people and history that formed their country was shown emotionally and will affect any person whatever race. Still remains my favourite film with an epic story, perfected characters, beautiful settings, relationships and scenes I still love this title and always will.",The Last Samurai

I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan so I was initially hesitant to see this movie but now I'm glad I decided to view this flick.  Yes, every now and again an actor walks into a role which suits them perfectly in all ways possible and in every aspect of their personality both good and bad.  This movie is Tom Cruises' Ying for his Yang.  I loved this movie because of its depth and complexity during selected scenes.  For example, the scenes where no lines were spoken but so much is implied by just the right eye contact between actors.  It's revolutionary in a comparable way as to the movie ""Castaway"" when it had no spoken lines for that 15 min stretch (but without the 15 min wait.)  This movie is so good that I'll pay for you to view it and I'll pay you another $20 if you don't like it completely!

685,snowraven-1,Absolutely Epic,10,9 December 2003,"I loved this movie. Usually, I'd walk out of a Tom Cruise film and say ""oh, he was soooo cute!"", but this time, I can say, with a completely clear and clean conscience that he was *amazing*. Absolutely incredible. The Last Samurai wasn't your typical ""West meets East"" movie. Nathan Algren doesn't try to ""reform the savages"" or Americanize the poor Japanese people. Instead, as would happen if any one stranger lands in a village, he changes. He comes to understand and respect their ways and if he doesn't necessarily become one of them, he does become a friend.This is probably the only two-and-a-half hour film that I could imagine sitting through again. And again. And again.The Last Samurai, in my opinion, is bigger than a ""Tom Cruise movie"". It rises above that stigma to become an epic tale that just happens to have Tom Cruise in it, doing an astounding job.",The Last Samurai
686,MadPowerBomber,A wonderful experience.,10,8 December 2003,"And I say that honestly.  The Last Samurai, to me, was a wonderful experience from the beginning to the end.  The story telling aspects of the film can be formulaic, but they're formulaic for a reason: they work.  Tom Cruise's character is a gateway character -- one with his own story at that, and his own inner demons -- for us to jump head first into an alien culture -- an often misunderstood alien culture -- and learn to embrace it, admire it, and adore it while he comes to do the same.  To me, it worked.  It worked on a plethora of levels.  It echoed Sunzi's teachings in the Art of War to take in a prisoner of war and treat him as an equal -- which is what Katsumoto did.  To sway him, and lure him away from his side to yours, and learn as much as you can from him.  This, I think, is what the intent was behind in that essence of the picture.  It was also a story of redemption for Cruise's character to redeem himself in his own mind from the things he'd done, or taken part of, in his past.  And through bushido, and through zen buddhism he accomplishes that.  While he doesn't attain enlightenment per se, he does change his life, his outlook, and become more than he was before.  In Katsumoto's tale, we have a tarnished samurai, a samurai who, in some eyes, has betrayed and rebelled against his emperor -- whom he's supposed to remain loyal to the end of his own life.  In his own eyes he's fighting not only for his emperor, but for his homeland as well.  It shows a great conflict, not only between others, but between himself.  Has he failed as a samurai or is he the epitome of the samurai?In the telling of one story in this movie, we have the stories of several men -- two of them taking the forefront.  And it's those stories that drive the picture completely, and I tend to think it did so with a style and grace that came close to the samurai epics of one Akira Kurosawa.  Also in the telling of this story we are shown the beauty and the poetic side of the samurai, and of bushido, as well as the spiritual nature of those that followed it.I think this film has several profound things to say, and it's really just a matter of whether you're listening or not.",The Last Samurai

Tom Cruise was convincing in his role and was great to look at as well.  The most interesting part of the film was the time he spent with the Samurais and how much he learned from their culture. At parts it was a little over done; they tried to make us cry too often. It could stand to be 20 minutes shorter but I feel that way about a lot of war films.  I'd say it worth seeing and you can learn a lot from it as well.",The Last Samurai

In regards to this movie... I am not going to go into detail about how historically accurate it was or why or why I didn't like the dialog (which was brilliant by the way), but rather I seek to give you an average movie-goers experiance watching a lovely, poetic film.When I saw the preview for this I didn't have the highest expectations. Tom Cruise as a samurai?  Sounds like a reason to pull in the middle-aged women who hate their husbands.  I was wrong.  Tom Cruise is perfect for the part of Nathan Aldwen.  This movie has allowed me to have a new found respect for the man.I don't want to go into too much detail, but this rather lengthy movie (At 2 hours and 20 some minutes) flows seamlessly and is never boring. This movie is about much more than shameless battle cinematography, but for people who enjoy that, believe me it's amazing.  The way it flows, is in a word, poetic.Amazing movie, best picture noms.",The Last Samurai
691,hoviewan,"Not a terrible film, but doesn't fulfill title of samurai (contains spoilers)",5,6 May 2004,"First off, this was not a terrible film.  It was ok, and worth a watch.  I would rate it a 6 overall, since it does have certain parts that are somewhat enjoyable.  But, when comparing this to other worthy samurai films, such as Seven Samurai, Rashomon, or Ran, this movie clearly falls apart. The plot is one that isn't truly believable, not saying that all plots are, but for some reason much of what happened to me was predictable and cliched. When watching any number of scenes, you could predict word for word what Tom Cruise was going to say.Now some may argue that the film is visually captivating.  Maybe.  It does have some scenes which are decent, but comparing this again to other color samurai movies, especially Ran, the images are weak and empty.  Although flagging is done somewhat correctly on the warriors, this has absolutely no meaning for the viewers and thus is just another ""cultural awe"" of asian cultures that many will just look at and think to themselves, ""strange"".The character development in this film was also a bit on the weak and unbelievable side.  Tom Cruise starts out as a boozer, but then becomes a compassionate warrior, even though the only thing that has changed is that he is now a prisoner and eating rice.  His character develops into something that fits with what american audiences want to see, not what may really happen and something that may be even more interesting.Overall, this is still a better than average film, but I would never call this movie a classic nor even rank it with other worthy masterpieces of Akira Kurosawa.  It is a good film to watch if you want a very americanized film of samurais, but definitely everyone who likes this films NEEDS to see Seven Samurai (Shichinin no samurai).",The Last Samurai
692,lmuplaya,No word will ever do this kind of film justice.,10,9 December 2003,"This film was without a doubt a masterpiece.  I have read so many reviews on this film that sooner or later they all seem to say the same things. ""This is why we go to the movies!"" or ""Hands down best film of the year!""  Then you come across the occasional, and in this film;s case scarse, bad review. The people that actually gave this film a bad review are the frustrated wanabee film makers that just couldnt cut it, so in turn try to bash other people deservingly amazing films.  They are the type of people that get no respect in the film industry and looked down apon for lack of artistic taste.  To these people I say ""Stick to movies like Armagedon.""",The Last Samurai
693,warnut,The best movie I've seen in years,10,14 December 2003,"When I walked into the theatre to see The Last Samurai I was expecting nothing more then a good action story, however what I saw was un expected....Much more. Tom Cruise gives an astounding performace on screen, some people think not for some reason, but trust me there would be no other actor who could pull it off the way Tom did. The storyline is excellent, and gives a genuine sence of honor that isn't ""Americanized"", like in most every other military film. The effects on the other hand are some of the best i have seen to date in a film of this genre. The katana scene's are nothing short of genius. Also the performance given by Masato Harada was nothing short of excellent. To conclude this movie struck an emotional string that a movie hasnt accomplished to do for me in a very long time. The directing, cinemetography, and the movie itself are all oscar worthy up and above any movie this year, save for ROTK.. This movie is fantastic, and dont listen to the put downs people have been giving it, especially Cruises performance. Go see it yourself you will not be disappointed...",The Last Samurai
694,harrymadsen,Over the top and superficial,1,26 November 2003,"A major disappointment.How many times must we see bloody battle scenes shot in mind numbing slow motion to the strains of overpowering string music?  Apparently, the filmmakers who brought us The Last Samurai think we need to see it many more times.  My guess is that Ed Zwick and his team meant to portray the horror of war, but guess what, we got it after the first thirty minutes. Showing the same thing over and over again, especially when the result is pre-ordained does not make for good film making.And it's not like the script offers much of anything in the way of characters.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but don't expect any insight into any of the characters, they are strictly superficial, have no life of their own besides trading platitudes with each other and you keep waiting for them to develop but they don't.  And this coming from the screenwriters who wrote Thirtysomething and Once And Again.  It makes you wonder if there's any place for good screenwriting in today's studio films.Another major problem is the complete inconsistency in the main character's fighting ability.  After slaying countless Samurai warriors, he finds himself unable to resist for more than three seconds when, taken prisoner he trains with them.  And given that this training takes a good half hour of screen time, that is no minor peeve.Another major screenwriting snafu is that apparently, Ed Zwick and his crew were too busy filming everything in slow motion that they didn't notice that at no point is the reason for all this fighting explained.  Maybe they have a degree in Japanese history, for they clearly are quite bright and display a real interest in Japanese culture that bring about one of the the sole qualities of the film, but the rest of the audience doesn't.  I know about the Meiji era being the time of cultural upheaval when Japan modernized itself by importing Western ideas and knowledge, but that's about it.  I was looking forward to learning more but after the first ten minutes of the film, the bloody gore takes over and any insight into Japanese history is forgotten.Add to that a picture quality that was much less than satisfactory (was the whole film treated with a low resolution digital intermediate, because it lacked any sharpness or detail in the blacks in 90% of the shots) and you have a film that can be summed up as a complete waste of time.Avoid at all costs unless you're a major Tom Cruise fan (and he does a great job with what little the script gave him) and you need to see every frame of every project he's in.",The Last Samurai
695,mythicasura,Excellent But Can Be Misunderstood,10,1 October 2013,"Ima keep this short and sweet. Its a great movie, and it took me a while personally to see it from a different perspective. I originally thought they was saying Tom Cruise's character was the last samurai which made me hate the movie. but after watching it a second time i figured out they where talking about the samurai as a whole. and the fact it ended without tom cruise's character dieing i assume that's because he isn't a true samurai.Considering that, It made me rethink my original score and I enjoyed it way more after I understood the message.So its a flawless movie with top notch acting, action, visuals, and emotional content and story.",The Last Samurai

Edward Zwick's samurai masterpiece brings reverence to a bygone age of service and honor.It is arguable, I believe undeniable, oscar caliber.  The cinematography beautifully proffers perspectives of terrain, architecture, emotion, color and space specific to Japan's fleeting samurai legacy.

We went to see the sneak preview and what surprised me is how the movie kept everybody attention for the entire 2.5 hours...no phone ringing, no baby crying, no talking...the only sound that we made is when everybody was clapping when the movie ends. There is a lot of efforts behind the scenes, production and casting are awesome...and I think we should promote the good movie like this instead of the crappy one out there.Go see it yourself and trust me it is really worth your money. I plan to see it again when it comes out next week...see you there!! :-)",The Last Samurai
701,mvonholle,definitely worth seeing,7,3 December 2003,"Saw the film last night and give it an overall rating of 7 out of 10.
Ken Watanabe's performance is enough to make this film worth seeing again. The Japanese culture was beautifully portrayed.  And who can resist those cute little Asian kids.Cruise did a nice performance, but I felt that some places in the film edited out the intensity of the scene simply to show Cruise's face more.
The storyline is a bit hard to follow in the beginning as Cruise's character was not developed well--I spent the beginning of the film trying to figure out what the deal was with this guy and where all his issues were coming from.  But the plot takes off once in the Samurai village and holds you until the very end.I wouldn't give it best picture, but I would put Watanabe in the running for best supporting actor.

I think a lot of people with strong cultural and ethnic backgrounds and values can relate to it very strongly when viewing everyday life in a modern society.

Exporting democracy for 200 years by the tip of a sword or the barrel of a gun.... And no, this is not about bashing US at all.I liked the movie because it took the time to dwell over the reasons ""why"" people were fighting, and how there's so much more always beyond what is going on in one's life. Additionally, the way of the samurai was not glamourized; I do think that the movie went a bit fast over the downsides of living by the sword, but it tackled very well the main issue: change happening too fast will unnerve people and will not be received well. Historically you always had revolutions on hand when people felt their way of life being violently threatened.",The Last Samurai
704,kollannur,Best film of the year (until the ending),10,6 December 2003,"Beautifully made and epic in stature. I was blown away by the scenes and philosophies presented here (a lot of parallels to what's happening in the world right now), but then the film sold out with the ending. SPOILER ALERT - since this is a $100m+ Tom Cruise production, I don't think the investors in this film would want a dark ending.  They probably felt they could make a higher profit with a feel-good Hollywood ending that caters to a different (and wider) segment of the audience.  Unfortunate and ironic since the movie spends a majority of its time debunking a lot of Western archetypes and culture, but then shows the standard Western optimistic ""hero always wins"" ending. Nevertheless, this movie probably couldn't be made without Cruise, and the ideas presented in the first part of the film probably wouldn't have reached such a wide audience without Cruise attached.

I found myself excited during every aspect of this film and not about what was happening in the plot or with Tom's acting, but because I was realizing just how good this film is.  The cinematography is breath-taking and the acting superb.  The actor who plays Katsumoto was stunning.  I came into this movie expecting it to be fun but never imagined how wonderful it would be.

Tom Cruise gave a spectacular performance and his supporting cast did a very good job too.  The scenery was beautiful and the story tug at heart strings especially the parts about how the enemy's family took care of Cruise, forgave and accepted him into their lives.  It shows us that human beings need to stand up for what is right instead of just going with the flow because someone else has control.  It shows us that doing right is what matters most because honor, respect and compassion makes life more meaningful and fulfilling.

I left this movie floored! Tom Cruise did an excellent job in his role, something I wouldn't expect given what he was casted for.  Normally I would say ""Stick to the Chick flicks"" but he did really well in this one!  The story was great, and I won't reveal anything about it....just go watch it.

Tom Cruise is, for once, not the only main focal point of this film, and it does nothing but benefit from that.  Ken Watanabe has moved to my A-List of actors.  The dialogue is moving, and incredibly well-written.  The acting is phenomenal.  I have not been so moved by a movie in a very, very long time.  The relationships between characters are extremely well-constructed, and it's one of the movies of its kind (Dances with Wolves, Glory) that does NOT make the ""white man"" of the group the hero, saviour, and victor.  There is a great amount of respect for Japanese culture evident in this script.  I am so very impressed.",The Last Samurai
717,mfu-1,Very very impressive,10,10 December 2003,"As a Japanese, I could not help being suspicious about how far Hollywood might mislead the viewers this time.  But, thinking of Tom Cruise being an honest person, who respects other cultures, I was hoping for the change, and got what I hoped for.Though the forest was obviously not Japanese, historically the story is not too convincing, etc., there could be a list of things I could complain; but, after all, the main thing is I could see their honest effort for authenticity down to the details, which I have never (I repeat 'never') seen in any other Western made movies.Watching the mountains in the rain, I felt I was at home, home which was lost in modernization long time ago.  The battle scene was just excellent. Ok, it might not be as good as Kurosawa's or other old masterpieces. But, for me, in a different category, it was better even.  I think Ken did a great job, too.Over all, I am overwhelmed.  I do not say it is a perfect masterpiece; but, I loved it anyway.(By the way, someone said the sword lecture is like the one in the ""Star Wars.""

718,Phoenix_Flight,Go see it! (Especially if you liked Braveheart.),10,10 December 2003,"This is a wonderful movie, but if gore bothers you, don't watch it, because there  is quite a bit of that in it. (Gore is the sole reason it is rated R.) However, despite the gore and considerable action and battle, the Last Samurai  is very much a philosophical movie. It is not your typical shoot 'em up; the battle  and action are instead a necessary but balanced part of the story. Don't expect  to go see it and come away mindlessly entertained. You will instead come away  with much to think about. The battles provide the backdrop for the story of a man  who must choose what principles he will stand on and what side he will take with life, death, and his own honor hanging in the balance. Because this movie  is about principles as much as-or even more than-the action side of it, Algren's eventual decision it not surprising. But it is a simpleton indeed who  thinks that predictability automatically condemns a movie. If you happen to be one of those people who are bothered by bad language or sexual immorality, rest assured. This movie is clean, except for a rare mild swearword or two. The bottom line? Great Action, thought provoking issues, and wonderful historical and cultural attention to detail. This movie is well worth seeing.",The Last Samurai

720,pacersnut,"The Best Movie of The Year--Open Your Eyes, Not Just Heart",10,13 December 2003,"Please read!  The Last Samurai movie is going to win most of the Oscar awards next year.  It is guaranteed to win ""Best Picture"" at the very least and Tom Cruise is guaranteed to win ""Best Actor"" finally.  Yes, fuss and kick all you want...it is a matter of time.  Don't judge by movie tickets sales because that does not win oscars, generally.  Those who give out awards for movies are looking for all the positive things in a objective fashion supposedly.  I am not trying to upset people or pretend to be a prophet--the writing is on the wall. Sorry to disappoint all those anti-Tom Cruise fans or wanna be Ebert critics.  Everyone has an opinion, but it is the majority that counts when deciding who and what deserves the recognition.  It is everyone's God given right to express their feelings as it is written in our Constitution.  The thing that bugs me about some critics is that they can always find the negative in everything--always a bias opinion.  Your opinions are more subjective than objective.  I have read many articles on the amount of work and heart that went into this movie.  Tom Cruise is very big on taking his time and doing it well.  He spent two years working with movie director Stanely Kubrick, no matter how long it took because he believed in something and someone.  He lost many years of blockbuster movie making and megabucks due to his passion to act and create something special--substance.  The majority of people fail to see the real beauty in both ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Vanilla Sky"".  You see what is on the surface and immediately attack.  You failed to see the underlying meaning of why the movies were made because you don't care!  Have you ever thought about how many good points in life can be learned by such movies. Movies are like books that can teach you alot about life--you have to find the not so obvious meaning sometimes.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Vanilla Sky"" both teach us so many valuable lessons about love, friendships, and so fourth.  You don't see that because your eyes are the ones wide shut. Have you noticed in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" the beautiful color reds and scenery in the film--forget about the orgy part.  The orgy part was necessary to illistrate the freaky things there are in this world when your eyes are closed.  The movie was NOT selling ""SEX"".  The point was that he was in the wrong place trying to do the wrong thing--vegenence for his wife's secret confession when drunk.  She did not cheat, she said stupid things because she was under the influence.  Therefore, it drove Cruise's character mad about the possibility.  Again, you only confirm my negative theory you critics have. You ruin movies, an art, because you tell others what is good and what is bad without letting others decide for themselves.  I never like reading reviews about movies because it ruins everything.  You as the individual need to decide for yourself how a movie is good or bad and not comform to these social norms in society.  It should be a crime.  I am a true movie buff that has seen the majority of the films worth watching and I can find the good in most of them.  I used to be closed or narrow minded, but as a person who is ill most of the time due to a rare medical condition I have spent many years watching, rewatching, and really analyzing movies.  My eyes are wide open and I am a better person because of it.  I can appreciate what I used to take for granted.  What about you...",The Last Samurai

The movie has an absurdly idealistic notion of Samurai.  Certainly Bushido is a wonderful code, but not every samurai follows it.  The code for clergy in the medieval catholic church was laudable, although certainly not followed consistently.  Samurai have a code, but are not perfectly moral and honorable individuals.  The movie (understandably) glosses this over to make the samurai more appealing to the disillusioned Algren, but still.2.  The Ninja attack.  No one ever (ever) ever caught a ninja.  Once.  In history.  The idea that a platoon of them invade a village is almost laughable.3.  This isn't historical so much as simply annoying.  Katsumoto is unnecessarily kind to Algen (Cruise) in the beginning, but by the end, he defers to him!  How did that happen?  Algren is certainly a fine warrior, but the idea that a powerful and experienced Daimyo like Katsumoto needs Tom Cruise to explain things to him is silly.

It has everything you need: strong characters, action, love, incredible scenery, original music and historical plot. You may say that the plot is predictable or you dislike acting performance, but this is movie is one of the best on Asian history made by Hollywood. Tom Cruise in my opinion is not the best at deep acting, but heroic and strong characters do suite him pretty well. What for the Ken Watanabe, he did play well although less fierce characters suit him better. Lets hope well get more movies like this)",The Last Samurai

It seemed very realistic in many ways (as much as one today can know what realism was in the times and events portrayed).  The acting was very good, and I will be surprised if awards are not give for this film.  The scenes of Japanese life were calming, and the Japanese portrayed in the village  do seem very 'disciplined'.  Some scenes may seem to be brutal, but I believe represent the viciousness of war, no matter the age. I recommend this movie, especially on the big screen.",The Last Samurai

735,Ionut_Parvu,"great movie, a ""must see""",9,9 January 2004,"Despite other people's opinion I found this movie to be quite entertaining. It seems to me that being a great Hollywood movie has become something bad these days. Some say ""Ahh, this is dances with wolves"". I find this to be a shallow perspective for such a movie.And now to the movie itself. Though it is quite long (2 and a half hours) it did keep me quiet (which is difficult). The acting is great especially in the part of Tom Cruise who delivers again and of Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto) which manages to portray a samurai quite well. Also Koyuki (Taka) plays her part with excellence.The story is captivating and although it does resemble ""Dances with Wolves"" you have to appreciate the depicting of the japanese culture and mentality of the samurai.This is a story of an american captain who's experience in the Custer battles grant him the opportunity to train the japanese army in a war against the samurai who do not agree with the views of a young (fooled) emperor who decides to make Japan a modern country.(mild spoilers) After being captured by the samurai, Cruise's character starts to appreciate their culture based on honour and dedication to a higher cause and in his own words ""I can not help destroy that wich i have come to love"",which pretty much sums it up (yeah right). (end of mild spoilers)You will have to pay attention to all the symbols that the movie presents.Someone much smarter than i am (who's name i unfortunatelly forgot) said: ""Art is the way the artist depicts something that he has seen with his own eyes."" and in my opinion Edward Zwick is an artist here. So even though some will say that this is a ""been there, seen that"" movie I say ""Go and see it. It's worth it""I give it a 4.5 out of 5",The Last Samurai

738,soma36,A very good time,9,14 January 2004,"First of all the movie was not overwrought or cliched except perhaps for a couple of scenes, and the ending was satisfyingly ambiguous....Much in line with the the spirit of the times, and not just in Japan. The battle scenes I found were more enjoyable and less abritrary the LOTR and the development of the plot appropriately paced. I found it even a little more rousing and emotional, at least in terms that i could identify with than ROTK. I guess unlike ROTK and precedents, the story was a good one but simple. Thus it left a little more time and resources for good execution. I was amazed although not suprised at the performances of the Japanese contingent in this movie, and Tom Cruise was quite bearable, and the training he put in for the movie definitely paid off. The cinematography and scenery spoke for itself, but I am biased! At the end of the day, the movie was sufficiently cynical about some historical things, and idealistic about others- but i think in the right way around. Perhaps the Samurai came off as being little too overglorified and consistent in their virtue (as with any human spiritual/religious sect, consistency is desired but not always achieved), but it made for an excellent story and vehicle for alluding to the troubling loss of virtue and ethical coherency endured at the time, and one that may well be appropriately contemplated now. Overall it kicked the butt seriouslyBTW, I dont understand the ""Dances with Wolves in Japan"" criticism. The premise is admittedly the same- a tormented US Civil War veteran finding solace in the customs in another culture- but the development of the story is completely different. First it is a completely different culture so therefore the internal dynamics and interactions are different, which in itself is interesting. Anyone who misses this has perhaps too much interest in the technical aspects rather than the movies key theme. Secondly, DWW was more a love story, while in the LS the love story (happily) is quite incidental, other than to express the cultural different conceptions of virtue (vis a vis her somewhat ""troubled"" initial relationship with Algren), and for that matter quite intriguing because of it.",The Last Samurai

742,gaishoukun,An Example of What We've Lost,10,25 January 2004,"I loved this movie because it shows what we've lost.  I'm not of any asian descent, purely mutt American, but I can relate to this movie.  It calls to something within me that is so basic, so simple.  We've lost the idea of Honor and how to simply live with one another as human beings.  I watched an episode of the History channel yesterday about The Last Samurai and Tom Cruise said this or something cose to it...so it's not a verbatum quote, ""The Samurai, the lifestyle, begged us to remember that man was more than just a body, he was a spiritual creature too.""  There is such simplicity in that way of life and yet it was complicated too.  It's so hard to describe the feeling within thinking about how this movie effected me.  It gave birth to a craving, a yearning for what was embodied within the movie.  Honor, Loyalty, Duty, Purpose, Harmony, Respect.  I admit that both times I saw the movie...I cried.  I can even cry now for what was lost.  To see such courageous men knowingly give up their lives for something they believed in, something that was good and should not have left this world.  So many times we like to say that we have honor.  Personally, I feel that we delude ourselves.  The ideal of Honor has become twisted and self-serving.  It's not an easy thing, but with it, true honor, life become simpler.  One other thing that stayed with me from this movie...""Life in every breath.""  Too often we become drowned in simply trying to survive in this world.  We should all remember this, ""A life spent looking for the perfect blossom...is not a life wasted.""",The Last Samurai

746,D-sword29,The best change of Heart movie to show truly what humans really are about!,9,14 February 2012,"This movie takes place in the 1870's where Japan is trying to repress and eliminate the old sacred samurai way within Japan. They hire Captain Nathan Algren(Tom Cruise), an American civil war veteran, who will work for anyone. He is to help westernize the Japanese Emperor's army by getting them accustomed to firearms and taking away the threat of the sword and close quarters combat. But, Algren noticed when the Emperor wanted them to take place in battle his army was not ready. The Emperor still ordered the attack and the part of the army was slaughtered by the Samurai. Nathan Algren was badly wounded but he still fought to the end by killing Samurai leader Katsumoto's best samurai; this lead Katsumoto to spare Algren's life and took him in. When Katsumoto took him in this is where the movie started to get interesting in my opinion. Algren when he was healed enough to walk around he started to soak in their lifestyle and he started to appreciate their daily routine of waking up and dedicating your life to one thing to master. After he talked to Katsumoto awhile and realized they truly weren't enemies and Algren was forced in this action they began to get along and Algren trained with all the other Samurais'. After his time was up Katsumoto let him go but Algren didn't really want to leave and when Algren got back to the Emperor, they asked him all these grueling questions and he didn't like how they were like savage dogs in one big wolf pack. So, Algren had his change of heart and went back to the Samurai's and suited up with them when they went back to war with the Emperor's Army. I believe anybody can make this change in lifestyle if they truly see the pure greatness and the evil they have done to the good.",The Last Samurai
747,Lotustale7,Entertainment vs. Politically Correct,4,24 February 2004,"Being Amerasian and feeling a responsibility to support other Asian actors, I forced myself to go to The Last Samurai.  Before I did I was weary to the idea that a movie, based completely around the world of truth, was also toting fictional characters along to ""pacify"" the average American public. Tom Cruise's character (reminiscent of Brad Pitt in Seven Years in Tibet)was an unnecessary additive because Hollywood seems to think that the only way to tell the story of such an ""exotic"" culture as the Japanese is to see it through the eyes of a Westerner.  The true story of the Samurai is amazing enough without being adulterated with Western influence.  PC aside, Cruise's character was flat and obvious.  We don't doubt his commitment to the Samurai even before the movie really begins because that's the kind of movie we're expecting.  Good guys are always good, bad guys are always bad.  The dialogue was cliché, especially the closing arguments.  The only thing beautiful about this movie was the cinematography and Watanabe's performance.",The Last Samurai

Casting was quite successful, few of the post-filming effects stood out a bit too clearly but did not interfere with the film itself. At least not too much. War was depicted as a brutal, yet beautiful thing and the violence was quite graphic, but it was almost a necessity in this kind of movie. All of the battle-scenes were breath-taking and especially the first engagement between the samurai and the soon-to-be Imperial army was something that will stick in your mind for quite some time.",The Last Samurai

(till the last 15 or so minutes that is)That's all folks :)",The Last Samurai
751,larsgrimstad,"The Last Samurai - Bushido ""The Warrior Code""",9,31 March 2004,"This movie blew me away...i've liked Tom Cruise for years, but he surprised me this time. I did read some other recommendations, and i cant understand some of the criticism.This film portrays an american soldier, Colonel Nathan Algren(played by Tom Cruise), who has both nightmares and moral issues with what he has seen of slaughter in the indian wars, and his demons makes him seek comfort in alcohol, like  so many soldiers do when not coming to terms with their beliefs and the reality of having done horrible things in battle.So when the Director draws parallels from the native americans to the samurais, he actually shows us the last days of two dying cultures.Now the samurais in this movie are not evil, nor is the imperial army. The fight between the two sides is a cultural battle, wich i think the movie portrays well. The only character that comes away as a ""bad guy"" is the war minister, Omura, who is the one that originally hire Algren, to train the japanese in modern warfare. Cruise is pressed into battle by his senior commander, played by Tony Goldwyn (in a good role, i might add), and he is subsequently captured by the Samurai's, when the attack disintegrate as the samurai charges.This teaches us all a simple lesson, if u want to make a statement, be prepared.While Algren is fighting off the attacking samurais, we see the vivid dream of Katsumoto, as seen in the beginning of film. The flag with the white tiger... a subtile symbolism, and premonition of two destinys, Algren's and Katsumoto's (played with magnetism and conviction by Ken Watanabe) coming together.The way Cruise and Watanabe plays these two characters impresses me, they both know, and the actors shows us...without words that their characters fate are bound to each other. Cruise kills the husband of Taka, Katsumoto's sister, and gradually, with time, Taka, understands she does not hate Algren, but she comes to terms with the events that led to her loss. She then opens up to Algren, making it possible to fall in love with him as the cultural barrier (in this case, the language) is broken down.
The battle scenes are excellent, and the sword-wielding is caught on film with such force, that it can actually make u gasp for air.What i liked about the film was the way it portrayed the samurai's, like Ujio, Katsumoto's samurai lieutenant and the older silent man (Algrens Guard)...Ujio comes across as the tough samurai u dont want as your enemy, but later in the film, as the village starts to trust Algren, Ujio then becomes more humane, and in the end u are sad to see him die on horseback.
The old man guard is another heroic character, along with Katsumoto's young son. In the late part of the movie, as a soldier is about to shoot Algren, he charges the enemy as he screams out the only word from him in the whole movie, calling out to Algren his name, then runs in front of him to take the bullet ment for Algren, in this moment he becomes a hero of mine.. pretty powerful stuff.The battle between the ""new"" army and the samurais has its parallels to battles where a small band of warriors charges a larger force outnumbers and outgunned.The motive for all this fighting, u might ask ? Algrens primary objective is money, but in his encounter with the samurais he finds the clensing he needs regarding alcohol and nightmares, and he discovers a true meaning to being a warrior, fighting for your beliefs and your honor.The end, after Katsumoto and all the Samurais are dead, has some twists, the trade agreement is rejected by the emperor, as Algren brings him the sword of Katsumoto, who's wish it was only to serve the people and the emperor.This is where Omura's actions comes back to haunt him, and Katsumotos death becomes justified. As for Algren, well i, like Mr. Graham likes to think that Taka and Algren found some sort of peace together after the turmoil and agony shared through-out the movie.I recommend this movie highly, the fact Tom Cruise is in it should be 1st reason, but Katsumoto's character, and the story itself even overshadows Tom Cruise a bit. There are subplots and personal dynamics in it that gives the movie a lot of depth, that makes it a good 2nd reason, and the 3rd...all the Samurais looks fierce, proud and commited.The Bushido - The warrior Code, i have never really grasped the essence of it fully, until i seen this good film.The way Katsumoto finds the last sentence for his poem just when about to die is what i found to be the best scene in movie, and it sums up the ""Last Samurai"" for me.",The Last Samurai
752,chad-terry,Hadn't we seen this already??,7,1 April 2012,"I like all Tom Cruise movies, and he always delivers quality, but this movie really reminds me of the Costner movie, ""Dances With Wolves"", only in a Japanese setting. But that doesn't mean that I think it's bad, it's definitely worth watching.The atmosphere is well-rendered, and it keeps your attention for the most of the time. Also the battle scenes are well made. It's a shame then, that they had to stick on a really Hollywood ending.So many movies have been scarred by this, but I guess there must be a large group of people out there who want that from a movie, otherwise I don't see why they insist on doing it time and again.

753,Vuduguy,"Historically inaccurate, lack of cultural understanding.",2,6 May 2006,"At first, I was disappointed. With what this movie was trying to do, it was just falling short. As the film drew on, I became increasingly angry with the director's stereotypical portrayal of the samurai and lack of understanding of Meiji Period Japan. The oversimplifications in the film make Pearl Harbor look like a documentary. There is no discussion of why the samurai are angry, why they rebel beyond ""Japan is losing its way."" The fact that, after more than 250 years of almost total isolation from the rest of the world, Japan had been forcibly opened to foreign trade in 1853 is simply ignored. The rapid influx of Western ideas, science, technology and personnel and the tension this caused is considered to be of no importance. The humiliating terms of the Ansei Treaties that Japan was forced into are mentioned in passing and out of context. The traditionalist backlash, the violence, the overthrow of the shogunate--all are condensed into a bunch of angry samurai rebelling. Why are the samurai rebelling? Is it because they were stripped of their titles of nobility? Or because they were no longer permitted to carry swords? Or because they lost their government stipends? Perhaps because Saigo Takamori wasn't allowed to invade Korea? We don't know, because the movie mentions none of these things, choosing instead to depict the restriction against ponytails while reiterating that ""Japan is losing its way."" The politics of Meiji Period Japan are also horribly condensed into some oily Japanese businessmen out to make a buck by coddling to the West. The Emperor's role is horribly exaggerated; his position was almost entirely ceremonial and he played virtually no part in the political process. For him to discuss a treaty with a foreign diplomat is absurd. I could go on, but I'm running out of space.",The Last Samurai

Theses people dont pay attention to anything but titles of the movie and who stars in it. On most movie review sites Cruise isn't even named first on the cast list, Watanabe is.

Nor is it credible that Algren would swear allegiance to the Japanese emperor when he knows nothing of his government and policies. The samurai way of live is portrayed in a romantic and naive fashion. While the samurai code include honors, it also supports a repressive feudal system. Did he think the peasants along the roadside knelt to the parade of samurais out of respect only? It is more because peasants can be killed with impunity by samurai for any show of disrespect!This film perpetuate the Hollywood theme of putting in a white man in a Japanese culture and have him out-Japanese the Japanese. Throwing in some Zen-lite remarks cannot make someone a master swordsman in 3 months!The only saving grace for this film is the very realistic battle scene. It is almost as realistic as Braveheart.

The one-liners, both humorous and thoughtful, are plentiful, but not overbearing. This epic film is not quite a true action film, but also not a true romance/drama. It is a moving depiction of a man torn inside who finds companionship and belonging. It goes deep beneath the surface of humanity to examine what makes life worth living. It is one of those rare films that made me think, in a way that I'm not even sure the filmmakers intended. It teaches the virtues of acceptance, tolerance, honesty, and loyalty. There are few films that create a sensation such as this. Beyond Cruise, the other actors may not be altogether noteworthy. The script is at times slightly cumbersome. Still, in a time when most movies have only time to for a good plot OR good acting OR a good script, this film finds a way to have all three in enough of a dose that they blend together to make a terrific film.

Katsumoto (sp?) for example is regal, benevolent, cultured, noble and insanely courageous - there is no complexity or ambiguity there. the bad guys are all bad, and the good as pure as fallen snow. And the English photo guy is erudite but buffoonish - just like all English people, right? Wrong. Nothing is as simple and black and white as Hollywood blockbusters would have them be.

764,crzymnky,This Is Not Your Usual War Film.,9,2 March 2018,"In The Last Samurai, Tom Cruise and Ken Wantanabe star in an original historical fiction film that takes place during the Meiji restoration period of Japan. In 1868 under Emperor Meijia rule, Japan was involved with an unprecedented chain of events, which restored practical imperial governmental power to Emperor Meijia over Japan. Primarily, one side of Japan wanted to stay with traditional Samurai warrior practices. Katsumoto, played by Ken Wantanabe, stood by these beliefs and practices with the way of the samurai. On the other hand, Emperor Meiji wished to advance into a new and modern Japan. 
Emperor Meiji acquired the assistance of the Americans to fight the revolution against the samurai; this is where Tom Cruise's character comes into the story. Playing a decorated yet ragged Civil War veteran named Nathan Algren, drifting through life with no purpose and drinking away his war-torn suffering in hopes to forget the horrific actions he was forced to commit against the Native American people. Hired by the Americans to train the army of the Japanese emperor in an attempt to eliminate Katsumoto's fearless and drastically outnumbered Samurai squadron. In Algren's efforts, he was captured by Katsumoto, with no casualties from the samurai side. During Algren's captivity, he sees the beauty in their culture. Learning the way, the Bushido Spirit, of the Samurai and siding with Katsumoto and becoming ""one with the samurai."" Algren finds peace in this way of teaching because of its values of honor and internal morals it has against war and death. The institution of the samurai only bound Katsumoto and Algren together even closer, from enemies to brothers. In review of Edward Zwick's work in The Last Samurai, we have to acknowledge his previous films. Zwick is known for various historical pieces such as Glory, Defiance, Legends of the Fall, and one of his most successful works, The Last Samurai. This action and adventure/drama not only includes some of the most significant choreographed fighting scenes in the film industry but also with the fantastic official soundtrack orchestrated by the legendary German film score composer Hans Zimmer that ties the film into a perfected unison. The first time I saw this movie, I was deeply affected by it. An essential element that I took note of during my review of this film is while the battle scenes are gloriously epic, and indeed everything looks brutally realistic, the battle sequences were not the primary focus of the film. The center of The Last Samurai was a deep friendship that blossoms between Katsumoto and Algren. They both come from two very different cultures that would not have met if it wasn't for war in the mid 1800's. Despite their differences, two cultures who were clashing at the time learned from their differences and found similarities in one another, binding them in unison. The idea of coming together with the mind and soul into one is a crucial element of the samurai way of teachings in the Bushido Spirit, which is prevalent in the film as exponential teaching and growth. This element in The Last Samurai was very emotionally resonating because usually, movies with a war theme like this leave me at a rapid disillusionment with the slow segments within the film's plot, waiting for the battle sequences to come back. For The Last Samurai, this is not your usual war film. There is an extreme lack of CGI that still holds up 15 years later. So much of the film's epic battle sequences are adapted by just cinematography alone with traditional and effective camera tricks. With those impressive cinematography skills, the film is bound by fantastic editing, which is added by the magical touch of Hans Zimmer, beautiful scenery, and impeccable costume design. In the sense of unison, The Last Samurai shows direct traits of the Bushido Spirit. This sense is backed up by having everything inside the film universe having a purpose, everything in The Last Samurai happens for a reason. There are no costumes or extra deaths in the battle scenes for a ""just because"" effect. All the factors are implemented into the film to give a binding unison with The Last Samurai Universe. To this day, the audience would agree that this film is still today looks visually enthralling. Zwick's decision to focus on this beautiful friendship between Katsumoto and Algren, in The Last Samurai, is a central theme in the film. We as an audience see both Katsumoto and Algren grow together from enemies to brothers. This theme of the film leaves the audience excited for every scene that follows with the impeccable acting from Cruise and Wantanabe in their character development. One thing that should also be mentioned, at the time this film was initially released, there was a lot of controversy for having a white lead who wins the day in a foreign culture. These complaints, in my opinion, are from people who have never seen the film. The Last Samurai is about two cultures that were at war with one another, who learned to work together, respect one another, and became almost family with an bonding love for each other. Ken Wantanabe's character is one of my favorites in this film, playing the part of Katsumoto. The audience is presented with a jaw-dropping performance from a man, who at the time, was never really heard of. Wantanabe conveys such a passion and devotion. The character Katsumoto is seen to have such a love for his country, for his country, for his culture, for his emperor, but Katsumoto believes the Emperor is going in a cultural direction that is against traditional beliefs of Japan. Katsumoto is then forced to separate himself from worshiping the Emperor to preserve the way of the samurai and the Bushido Spirit. This makes Katsumoto such a compelling, conflicted, moving character that contrasts with Tom Cruise's character similarly. Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, is feeling very similar conflict struggles that Katsumoto is enduring within the film. When Algren is captured by Katsumoto and his forces the relationship between the two leading characters is seen as a struggle to find similarities. Katsumoto views Algren as a drunken barbarian because of Algren's American background and the reputation for savagery towards the Native American people/. From Algren's perspective, he views Katsumoto and his people being uneducated, ancient, stubborn, barbarians for fighting in battle against lines of muskets with only swords and basic armor. As the film progresses, Algren sees that he is being trusted into an utterly different culture, that reminded him very much of the Native American people. Understanding that, even with an emphasis in war and combat the samurai people, Katsumoto believes in an emphasis of finding peace with oneself, a unity in the body and soul, something that Nathan Algren has looked for in almost all of his life. The samurai way of teaching works and loves one another in their community, dying for one another without a moments notice. The theme of compassion, friendship, and understanding is prevalent throughout the film. The Last Samurai resonates with Zwick's style of filmmaking, with it's beautiful and vast battle scenes, lengthy run times, and incredible soundtrack that ties it all together. This film has always been a favorite of mine for as long as I could remember and comes with a story that isn't like any other. What is pulled off in this film is hugely impactful with the audience. Having the ability to convey such a compelling story between two cultures, showing that no matter how different our views are, or what our beliefs are, we can find a common ground and unity with one another through compassion for another human being.",The Last Samurai
765,tigran-2,Fantastic!!!!!,10,1 September 2004,"One of the finest movies done in Hollywood. Epic proportions, fantastic tale, excellent acting and far-reaching message. Should have won couple of Oscars. Incredible achievement! Tom Cruise is one of the best Hollywood actors - he has proved it here! Not nominating him for an Oscar is a disgrace. High emotional adventure tale with focused cast that has digged deep into these roles and a story that enchants and captivates throughout. A great vision of a dissapering world, of different cultures and civilizations clashing and of retaining basic values that can never be destroyed regardless of anything. Wonderful music and scenery accompanies this almost perfect tale. Captain Nathan Algrens battlefield ending scene survival takes the edge of the movie but gives it back in the most last scene with the emperor. Almost a flawless movie worth seeing several times.",The Last Samurai
766,Michael_Lepatsky,The Last Samurai: Simple Beauty,10,26 September 2004,"This is my first review and I actually wrote it as an English 111 essay. I'm not sure if it contains essential spoilers, so I warn you now: May contain spoilers; read at your own discretion. Now with that out of the way...The Last Samurai: Simple BeautyThe Last Samurai is a story of a man lost in his pains justifying his life through simple material gain. Without any direction in life it seems as though this man, Captain Nathan Algren, is destined to a life of depression and worthlessness. The powerful and moving transformation that Algren undergoes from a man of little worth to a man of greatness is done in such a way in this movie that I believe to be a very captivating experience.Honor and tenacity, two major themes of this movie, are introduced early in the movie. We are also introduced to Algren whom of which is drinking and obviously miserable with life. Early in the movie Algren takes a job in Japan to train Japanese soldiers, whom of which are at war with the rebel Samurai, in the art of modern warfare. It is in the melee with the Samurai that Algren's tenacity is first displayed. The Samurai leader, Katsumoto Moritsugu, is intrigued by this tenacity and, after defeating Algren's forces, brings Algren back to the Samurai village, a place of honor, as a prisoner to study him. Here, Algren is unable to escape because winter is coming and, as such, prevents any flee from the mountain. It is in the Samurai village that Algren's transformation occurs.A problem that I have with this movie is the over-simplification of some key elements of the movie. It is obvious throughout the movie that Algren's depression is a result of the Native massacre that his battalion was a part of. Unfortunately, though, this feeling of guilt and regret is coupled by an excessive and somewhat incessant number of flashbacks and blatant reminders that Algren does indeed feel this way. If it isn't extremely large pictures of the Natives drawn on multiple pages throughout Algren's diary depicting them as a divine people, it is Katsumoto blatantly articulating this theme during a conversation with Algren during the latter stages of the movie. Throughout the entirety of the movie other ideas or essential developments are also simplified in this manner. It is not that that the formalization of a theme is undesirable; rather, the incessant recurrence of this style only does the director, Edward Zwick, and the intelligence of his movie a great disservice. One other problem that I had with this movie is the Hollywood makeover that it was given. Though it is a movie of Samurai in the era of modernization in Japan, the presentation of it is only loosely based on what it was actually like at that time. Though they were deeply respected, the Samurai were also seen as rebels and practitioners of many old, less compassionate ideologies such as the absolute degradation of women. They were not as pure and kindhearted as presented in this movie. More over, the use of Kanji in the movie is also simplified and clichéd.Though, the over-simplification of the movie may be a minor weakness, it is also, ironically, excels as the major theme of this movie. Algren learns to deal with his frustrations by looking at the grand scheme of things rather than getting lost in material insatiability. Deeply symbolic Kendo sessions show Algren's transformation and many epiphanies. In the beginning, despite its aimlessness, the Kendo sessions serve to show just how tenacious Algren is. As the movie progresses, they illustrate how aimless tenacity is no match for purposeful honor and, as such, Algren accepts this new ideology. The result is man at peace with himself.Though, The Last Samurai does spell out or rather, at times, shout integral themes at the audience which, in turn, effectively lowers the intelligence of this movie, Zwick still delivers a story of epic proportions like no one else. Though, simple Japanese stereotypes are magnified and actual history thoroughly abused during the telling of this story, Zwick is doing just that- telling a story. Even though I was trying to find flaws in this movie, I was left finding a needle in a haystack of perfection. I am indefinitely captivated by the message that this movie conveys while practicing it itself- the beauty of simplicity and the simplicity of beauty. It teaches the audience that perfection and fulfillment is no more than a state of mind. It is all around us and bares no price-tag. It also teaches the audience that rather than seeking perfection through the consumption of substance and material, that perfection is actually created through the essence of simplicity. No one movie can ever be perfect just as no one measure of value can ever be perfect; rather, it can redefine a genre and raise the bar for its successors and that is exactly what this movie has done....Excellent! 10/10: Recommended for those of us with eyes!",The Last Samurai
767,Moneymaker,A masterpiece,10,12 October 2004,"The Last Samurai is arguably one of the best movies I have seen.The story is pretty common and simple. A dillusioned American war hero gets captured by the Samurai and eventually transforms into one of them. The transformation is pretty realistic from drunken soldier to idealistic samurai. Edward Zwick plays puppeteer with all of the characters emotions and reveals only a little by little making them ever so real. The soundtrack is a marvel of music. Hans Zimmer has composed on of the best movie soundtracks ever. It truly draws you into the movie and adds a whole new dimension of depth and emotion to it (which Tom Cruise cannot).The cinematography deserved an Oscar. Every shot seems that it has been painted and when explosions take place, they look like they were meant for the screen.Tom Cruise gives an unusually remarkable performance as Capt. Nathan Algren. It seems that the part was tailor made for Cruise with all the shouting and selfishness. But he is not the best actor.It is Ken watanabe as the Samurai head who gives the most amazing performance. His eyes alone show us what his character is feeling and then of course come the rest of the facial expressions. The rest of the Japanese cast act brilliantly, determined to show their American counterparts who the real bosses are.It is a direct homage to Dances with the Wolves (right down to the voice over diary entries).The fight scenes are masterly executed, providing a proper war experience (not like Troy) and the film rarely drags. It just slows down. The only reason it was not well received by the Americans is the fact that they cannot handle the fact that an American converts and chooses another culture over his. One of the best movies ever. 10/10",The Last Samurai
768,gabthedude3,A great film,8,19 March 2013,"Tom Cruise did great acting for this film and portrayed his role very nicely. Tom actually spent two years on this film he had to do Japanese lessons and Sword fighting. I really like the structure of the plot I thought it was great, I thought it was good that he accepted their culture and learned their ways and willing to protect them. I thought the Japanese actors did a good job and all the extras and there were also some pretty good action sequences it was very interesting this film and I thought the director did a marvelous job so was the screenplay. The acting was great and Tom Cruise's performance was great and positive acting, the sound effects weren't bad either.

770,rudedoga,"Good movie, but predictable, derivative",6,7 August 2005,"I liked this movie. However, after watching it, I noticed that it seemed familiar.My sudden epiphany was fueled by a sudden thought of how much this film is like ""Dances with Wolves,"" a film that I also like. In short, a stranger with a checkered past comes to a strange land to do his duty but comes to admire and respect those who should be his adversaries. Climactic battles result in his being irrevocably estranged from his own people, who now see him as having betrayed them by going native. The scenery is majestic, the battles are epic, but a seven year old could have predicted the end. The female lead, Lady Taka, is very beautiful. The ending is confusing. At the end of the climactic battle Tom Cruise's character, Algren, is surrounded by the enemies and is apparently being the only survivor for the Samurai. Despite this, he later appears before the emperor in time to convince him that doing away with the Samurai and modernizing Japan was the wrong thing to do. Why didn't the modernist Japanese take him prisoner, kill him, or at least deport him?",The Last Samurai
771,eskildue,Dances with samurais,7,15 April 2005,"Well, this movie really reminds me of dances with wolves, only in a Japanese setting. But that doesn't mean that I think it's bad, it's definitely worth watching. The atmosphere is well-rendered, and it keeps your attention for the most of the time. Also the battle scenes are well made. It's a shame then, that they had to stick on a really Hollywoodish ending. So many movies have been scarred by this, but I guess there must be a large group of people out there who want that from a movie, otherwise I don't see why they insist on doing it time and again. But all in all, it's worth a watch, if you can live with the annoying ending. Alternatively, you can just leave the theatre or stop the DVD when you see it coming. You can easily see it coming...",The Last Samurai
772,l-goatley,A quick review with a personal touch,10,1 December 2004,"An outstanding, moving and passionate incite into Japanese history. Edward Zwick has managed to combine a great mixture of narrative and action, a mixture few films these days successfully achieve. Excellent battles and compelling story not to mention a killer soundtrack (good old Hans Zimmer) this film stands out from the crowd in its genre and provides something unique.On a more personal level i tend to rate films on how they effect me as a person, as the audience; whether they can make me feel for the lives of the on screen characters or the beliefs and motives behind them. This film achieves this in every sense and will go down as one of my all time favourites. I strongly suggest you watch it.",The Last Samurai

This film develops into a tender yet brutal film that is full of emotion and raw feelings, shot brilliantly, with a good storyline. To compare it to another film leads me to Gladiator, as it left me with the same feeling, it gave you a very low feeling, yet it is such a good film. I feel it has something for everyone, love, action, amazing shots, and good storyline and a good ending.This film is amazing, and it left me in tears, its an uplifting and liberating film, even if it doesn't seem so at first.",The Last Samurai

775,myst-10,Best film Cruise has ever done.,10,10 December 2004,The journey of Nathan Algren has to be the best character I have ever seen Cruise play to date. His portrayal was believable all the way to Algren's DTs and the embarrassment of Higen catching him 'practicing' moves in the house. I spent 3 wonderful years in Japan and they are an intriguing people rich in tradition and history. The legend of the Samurai and 'Bushido' are still very much alive within Japanese culture and it is a great source of pride for all.I hope Cruise will be able to retain some of what he gained in this film and I thank everyone who worked so vigorously to make it happen.

776,garde-link,A thought of the title...,10,23 December 2004,"Just to bring this up as an idea... The movie may not have been focusing on any particular samurai as the last samurai, but the resistance group lead by Katsumoto as a whole.Samurai is both singular and plural, you don't say samurais. I think the title was actually meant to encompass the Samurai as a whole, fighting for bushido, and the old ways of Japan, versus the westernization or ""Americanization"" of Japan.The movie really does show the struggle of all the samurai, not just Katsumoto, Katsumoto is just the star samurai, since he's the Daimyo.And yes, this movie made me cry at the end. It makes me wish I knew more of my Japanese roots...",The Last Samurai
777,stardancingangel,Wonderful Entertainment and Tought Provoking,10,27 December 2004,"I thought the movie was incredible! I read many of the comments regarding Samurai versus Ninjas and felt that the portrayals of both did not detract from the movie. It was not billed as a docudrama. However it appears to have been based on history.I speak some Japanese and found Tom's accent quite credible. The wonderful subtleties of the Japanese in their almost inscrutable expressions were so very clear in the eyes of the actors.It was a 2 1/2 hour movie and the time just sped by. Some of the lesser action scenes really helped to engulf the viewer in the entire culture and feeling of story. One could almost imagine being part of it.Great to see actors riding ability as well, it certainly added to the reality of the movie. Being a horsewoman it really takes away from the movie when a person is supposed to be riding horses for more than just a guided trail ride and truly cannot ride. It certainly adds to the realism when they can ride and apparently do all of their own riding in the movie. Also having the horse's almost always the same is a nice bit of detail. Tom's mount appeared to be only two horses with a very subtle difference in the white blaze.The bloody(gory) scenes were handled quite well. One got the sense of the horror of the battles without being inundated with too much graphic realism. For a 'war' movie, it was extremely well handled and totally fleshed out the characters which added so much more to it than just one battle scene after the other.The scenery was excellent. The costumes fantastic. Even though the material was present day the reality in the design of the costumes took away any distraction regarding them being 'polyester' :-).Going through the stills of the movie gave me an even more incredible appreciation for the action shots. The stills say so very much about the training, etc. of the actors. They certainly look very realistic and one gets the impression that the actors were in excellent physical shape and really doing the action shots w/o obvious stunt doubles. There may not have been any stunt people at all. I do not know for a fact either way. But it appeared the main characters did all of their own action acting and riding.Excecellent in all ways. I got an excellent appreciation for the ways of the samurai. The sense of honor and customs was beautiful and enlightening.",The Last Samurai

Am I the only one who noticed that this is practically a chapter-for-chapter, character-for-character regurgitation of DWW, just in a different setting?! It's ridiculous! You have a broken soldier, ready to die at the beginning; takes a new job that puts him up against a ""savage"" culture that he learns to admire; a woman who lost her husband at the beginning of the film and becomes his love interest; he develops a friendship with a leader in the ""savage"" culture; they come under attack while he's there and he fights with them...do I have to go on? The ONLY differences: there's no Two Socks, Dunbar wasn't a captive of the Sioux in DWW, and Algren's diary doesn't get stolen. This was a lovely film but as scene after scene, character after character paralleled DWW, I started wondering if this was some kind of joke.

He follows the superior's order to massacre a village that the people are unarmed. If he is a samurais, I think he will not massacre. After Indian had entire family, Japan become the buyer of Western, the Western make a good profit by selling things to Japan. I think this kind of things, It's only a kind of invasion culture.

Samurai are primitive yet sophisticated and honorable men, meditating, reciting the heart sutra, writing haiku's, sipping green tea, enjoying kabuki theater, and contemplating the falling cherry blossoms all the freaking time. It all amounts to an okayish action flick marred by a stupendously shallow look at (and understanding of) Japanese culture.

The last people putting honor above anything else, ""Isn't that worth fighting for, isn't that worth dieing for ?"", I think that it worths, and that the sacrifice proves that it ever worthed. They weren't fighting against Japan they were fighting to protect it, to protect the last real men, the last people that thought that living is a blessing and living is to be Honored.

I did not see this movie in the theater but have now seen it on cable television every time it has aired and each time I see something new. The acting directing locations were perfect. I cant remember ever seeing Ken Watanabe before but his portrayal of Katsamoto was outstanding and a role to be proud of. This whole effort is something to be very proud of. I believe The Last Samurai will survive the test time and continue to delight viewers for decades to come.

Some good sword fighting in the Samurai film tradition and a beautiful landscape. Ken Watanabe's acting was wonderful and heartfelt, portraying feeling and emotion not from the things he said, but from his bearing and expression. But that was about it.

The scene where the wife of the warrior he killed had to dress him up in her late husband's robe was most remarkable and then, the resilience of the samurai warriors in the face of intimidating firearms evoked so much sentiments in my mind - reminding me of the 1897 punitive expedition in the Ancient Benin Kingdom of West Africa.",The Last Samurai

For example, they try to overlap Samurais and Native Americans, which is very difficult for Japanese to comprehend. In one scene, Samurais were fighting in a jungle. We do not have a jungle in Japan. They try to depict that swords are the most important thing for samurais, which is not true at all. Bushido is not that shallow.The only notable thing I observed in this movie is that the Hollywood finally learned to be capable of treating foreign cultures positively. I know it is very difficult to make a movie about foreign cultures free from misunderstandings and prejudice.If you want to touch the real Bushido, which Japanese natives embrace, I recommend that you read ""Bushido"" written by Nitobe Inazo, or watch ""Chushingura"".",The Last Samurai

789,mornicdavis88,Last Samurai,8,21 July 2014,"The Last Samurai is a 2003 American epic war film directed and co- produced by Edward Zwick, who also co-wrote the screenplay with John Logan. The film stars Tom Cruise, who also co-produced, as well as Ken Watanabe, Shin Koyamada, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada, Timothy Spall, and Billy Connolly. The film's plot was inspired by the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion led by Saigo Takamori, and on the westernization of Japan by colonial powers, though this is largely attributed to the United States in the film for American audiences.Set in Japan during the 1870s, The Last Samurai tells the story of Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a respected American military officer hired by the Emperor of Japan to train the country's first army in the art of modern warfare. As the Emperor attempts to eradicate the ancient Imperial Samurai warriors in preparation for more Westernized and trade- friendly government policies, Algren finds himself unexpectedly impressed and influenced by his encounters with the Samurai, which places him at the center of a struggle between two eras and two worlds, with only his own sense of honor to guide him. The sound in movies are broken into three basic categories of sound. They are dialogue, sound effects and music. As stated, dialogue, sound effects, and music require careful balancing to serve the story; because of this, each category is typically recorded separately and mixed together during the final editing process (Goodykoontz & Jacobs, 2011).The movie is consistent with its storytelling method. Of course, I love the reference to one of the greatest last stands in history as it foreshadows an epic, final battle. Next, Algren helps Katsumoto devise a strategy where the Samurai can get close to the soldiers so they can use their swords and neutralize the advantage of guns. The movie's title foreshadows a tragic denouement, but that in no way lessens The Last Samurai's impact. The film is in many ways about the clash between the old ways (those of the samurai) and the new (those employed by the American-trained troops). While history makes the results predictable (six decades later, a thoroughly modern Japan would attack Pearl Harbor), it's our involvement with the characters and their situations that energizes the experience of sitting through this movie. The historical context may be established, but we don't know what happens to Nathan, Katsumoto, Taka, and others.The dialogue itself is the requirement for most movies. Without the dialogue, the story and the plot cannot come to conclusion. The dialogue helps shape the mood, the direction, the balance of any movie that the audience is watching. It is also important to note that emphasis on certain portions of the dialogue, whether it be change in tone, pitch, or sped up and slowed down, the dialogue can change the mood of any movie. If done correctly, it will make an excellent companion to the music and the sound effects of that specific film. (Goodykoontz & Jacobs, 2011). As he walks among the people, there is very little dialogue, but many scenes of the beautiful Japanese countryside. This is the perfect place to put music to help the audience appreciate the beauty that he is discovering for the first time. As stated in our text, ""with the advent of sound, music became a basic element of constructing a movie, as essential an element as lights and cameras"" (Goodykoontz & Jacobs, 2011).http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-last-samurai-2003Goodykoontz, B., & Jacobs, C.

791,kecman-s,Movie that breaks though men's hearts!,10,10 January 2017,"First of all, let me express my deepest sorrow because this movie is not in IMDb's top 250, but that's only my opinion. Secondly, to explain my thoughts and feelings that I have written beforehand, I love this movie because it contains everything an action movie should have, a hero, a supporting hero, horrible villains, a fair maiden, fight scenes and most of all that deep strong and manly warrior emotion. Of course, everyone who might be reading this and hasn't watched it has my highest recommendations to do it, boy or girl, old or young you will not be disappointed. To conclude I will just say that this is the only move that made me cry, and yes, I watched Bambi when I was a kid :D",The Last Samurai
792,domcernaz,Favourite film,10,15 February 2015,"When I first saw this at the age of 8 I thought it was really good. When I revisited it several years later it became quite possibly my favourite film. I'm not quite sure why, I don't like Tom Cruse that much and as far as historical inaccurate Hollywood mainstream over the top films go, this fits the bill. But for some unknown reason I love this film. Its bazaar. Not only that but it gets me at an emotional level. I cry ever time. Perhaps its the representation of conflicting cultures with east meats west plot line with clashing cultures. Additionally there is the tradition or modernization discourse which accompanies it. So perhaps the film speaks to me on a cultural level, I am one for loving the past. Or maybe just the fact I really like cherry blossom means I love this film. Either way I love this film.",The Last Samurai
793,betomomu,Underrated Masterpiece,10,5 August 2018,"Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai is, without a doubt, one of the best films I've ever watched. The battle scenes are gorgeous and so realistic , with a refreshing lack of CGI. However, the story and the evolving friendship of Tom Cruise's and Ken Watanabe's characters are the aspects that make you love the movie and feel atached to it. Such and emotional and fun ride can't just be found nowadays. Masterpiece!",The Last Samurai
794,iltersevinc,Excellent Movie,10,1 July 2005,"This movie is one of the bests of recent years. It's amazing, influence and inspiring. Moreover, this is the best movie of Tom Cruise. His performance is great. I think he deserved at least to be a nominee for Oscar. Also, the performance of Ken Watanabe is effective. I think this movie should have been nominee for the best picture.Tom Cruise has showed the depression in the inner world and desire of justice and honesty of Captain Nathan Algren very well. Also, the main point of the movie tells the viewers and the whole world that the importance of honor, honesty and justice. The world needs this kind of men definitely. I strongly advice to watch this movie to everybody. A small measure of peace to everyone!",The Last Samurai
795,tomwerner,An excellent film ...,9,16 July 2005,"An excellent fusion of Japanese and American film making with amazing photography and strong characterisation. The journey and the way it is followed by the director is rich and interesting, don't expect this to be a light-hearted film, many serious issues are covered throughout. Tom Cruise offers an atypical performance, breaking away from his usual mould of acting. Before watching this film I had never known much about Japan's rich history, now I want to learn more! One of the best things about this film is how impeccably you are made to believe that it is set in the 19th Century.If you can get your hands on a DVD of this, the commentary is also very interesting, it is amazing that this film was shot in both Japan and New Zealand. Films like this also further stead me in awe of the amazing culture of the far east (past and present).All in all a great film!",The Last Samurai
796,imdb-8005,Pure Hollywood,3,14 October 2005,"I wonder if I'm commenting on the same movie as everyone else, because the one I saw was over/pathetically acted by ""Jerry Maguire""--giving him credit for acting at all seems a bit unfair to real actors. And, is agonizingly played out over a glossy Hollywood palate of plastic sets and dialog. My wife who is Asian, laughed hysterically through much of the movie, e.g., the incorrect topography, joke dialog, etc. For example, the token Cherry Blossom plunked into the middle of California hills. Oh then we must be in Japan now :)Save your money, you'd do better with Power Rangers or some other horrible movie, but at least there'd be no expectations!",The Last Samurai

798,bjorn-andenas,Western culture vs eastern culture,10,27 July 2005,"The last samurai truly succeeds in depicting the clash of the western philosophy of ""win at any cost"" vs the eastern philosophy of ""carrying yourself with dignity and honor"".The setting for this theme is Japan in the 1870's. Captain Algren (Cruise), is a war hero, but he has become a suicidal alcoholic and despises himself and his superiors for the way they slaughtered women and children during the Indian wars. After taking on a mission to train the Japanese army in western warfare he is captured by the samurais he has been paid to kill. In the samurai warrior code he finds the kind of philosophy and dignity that a soldier can live with in victory and defeat. So much so that he switches allegiance to the samurai side even though he knows it is a lost cause and that it can only mean certain death. This being a Hollywood film though, he survives and gets the woman in the end...Even so the film succeeds on so many levels, including showing emperor Meijis difficult task in combining new technology and knowledge while retaining the Japanese culture and heritage. The bonus material on DVD is also brilliant.",The Last Samurai
799,peylizabeth,Breathtakingly brilliant despite slight historical inaccuracy.,9,29 February 2016,"If you have never seen this movie, you are not only missing out on some of the best cinematography that the film industry has to offer, but also an intriguing plot and elegant characters. The story has the perfect mix of traditions, action, love, and discipline, giving the viewer an opportunity to connect with the traditions of the Samurai and learn the basic history of the conflicts in Japan. The only discrepancy found in this film is the slight historical inaccuracies, for example the Samurais refusing to use modern weaponry or the ninja attacks on the city, seeing as the Samurai did not have a problem with using the modern weapons of their time and ninjas were not around at the same time as the Samurai. However, if you are a person who will not be bothered by the most minimal errors of history, then this film will rank high on your list of favorites. It is, in my opinion, a true stand out in all of film, and despite whether or not historical facts are important to you, is a must see in everyone's lifetime.",The Last Samurai
800,racquel127,"so much has been said about this movie, but still:",10,2 August 2005,"just one more fan of this movie. I have seen so many movies, I guess you could call me movie-jaded. I barely like to go out to see new movies because they don't do what movies are supposed to do - interest, haunt, cause you to think, mesmerize, enchant - if I want some sick humor or plain old Hollywood plot, I can always tune in to the news... So here is a movie, The Last Samurai, and I figured: OK, let's try it... and I loved it. I'm not a big fan of wars, unfortunately in my country we see way too much of that, but the way it was portrayed was incredible. Really very, very good. I read that some people didn't like the romance part in the movie. There wasn't much of it, just a hint, and as a (very) romantic woman, I actually wouldn't have minded a more explicit romance between them, but even without it, there was such an aura of drama and suspense, that really, the movie didn't need it. I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did. :-) Bye, Racquel",The Last Samurai

In particular, Ken Watanabe, Tom Cruise and Hiroyuki Sanada. We learn the conditions of the period and about the history of Japan. We learned about the traditions of the Samurai.

The quality of the acting and the plot itself were extremely good. Tom Cruise was easily at his best, emotive, but very subtle, and his character evolved very well throughout the movie. Ken Watanabe was the absolute show stealer. His performance is something that will make me remember him alongside names like Toshiro Mifune, and will definitely have this DVD sitting alongside everything else I immediately show to people and tell them they have to see.I would also note, this was one of a few movies to invoke such strong emotions in me.

This is one of my all-time favorite films. The first time I saw this movie I was deeply affected by it. The thing that surprised me the most is that while the battle scenes are epic and very well done, not these were the focus of this film. The focus of this film is a heartfelt friendship that blossoms between the main characters (Nathan Algren & Katsumoto) who both come from very different cultures.
Also not to be overlooked is Hans Zimmer's beautiful score that I listen almost every day.
The Last Samurai to me is a very underrated film with great performances, beautiful soundtracks and wonderful storyline.",The Last Samurai

""The Last Samurai"" follows the story of an American war veteran during the 1870s, a slayer of the red Indians that are still haunted by the nightmares of what he's come to regret doing, for his hands to kill u
countless innocent native inhabitants with only sculpted the alcoholic that he's become, hiding behind a fake career as a public entertainer.It was probably out of his mind to predict that he's return back to the battlefield, only this time around crossing almost crossing half of the hemisphere to train the Japanese army on modern warfare.
The poor soul gets captured during his first offensive move there by the Samurai, a tribe he' never heard about, a new type of barbarians he said, the like of which he was already well acquainted of killing.
To his surprise, it was that barbarian who he and his friends at the army labeled that showed him the right way and helped him get over his nightmares as he started learning the way of the sword and managed to conceal his old sense of what it meant to be a warrior.""The Last Samurai"" was more than a warring state between the traditional side of Japan and the wanna-be-modern side of it, it was a journey of self-redemption that ended up affecting the ties of that war on a larger scale by the hands of a man that never feared death, but sometimes wished for it.The historical setting of the movie isn't 100% accurate with some tweaks to help carry on the emotion you'd expect from a movie, with a bit cliché tropes here and there but it was all just to enhance the experience and make it closer for even non-Japanese to get all of those references they throw at you.",The Last Samurai

I can quote from the movie and it drives my husband nuts when I say the dialog right before the movie dialog. I LOVE THIS MOVIE and I can't put my finger on why. I feel the same way about Dances With Wolves. I know I had a native American past life so I am sure that is why I like Dances With Wolves so much. I highly recommend The Last Samurai. It is the best.

812,sachitra,"So above all, the film is so inspiring",9,11 January 2007,"Its title brings me in a new sense, whenever I recall it  The Last Samurai. When I went through the description at the back of the DVD case, to me, it was a foreign solider torn apart two worlds: Modern Japan and its traditional counterparts. Now the most interesting factor holistically is that the foreign-born military officer gets to know about the traditional flavour whereas Japan's own people do fail to identify it. My recent cram for the exam reminded how Japan switched into an open-foreign policy from a close-foreign policy during Meiji's ruling. However history records indicate Meiji continued with the Samurai backing. And I quite well remember how the Samurais were described under Meiji rule; they had reputation but no wealth because they loved their tradition. May be the Meiji's officials wanted a Samurai-free reign open to foreign policies. The Emperor must have been a cat's paw in this phenomenon hence so shown in the film. He is shown as somebody  like a protégé  of his council. When the Samurai chief approaches him for the help in presence of the council, he remains silent. But alone he renders a great helping hand to the Samurai chief by reappointing him to the council. The movie's irony is perhaps the war that happens between two peoples of a same tribe. But it reaches a crescendo when Kotsubo, the Samurai chief and the last Samurai breathes his last giving in to the enemies, his fellow people. The incessant release of skirmishers against Samurais keeps the Japanese Army General warm. He begins feeling his heart  the Japan. He suddenly commands the halt of the firing ignoring his superior's presence. When the Last Samurai breathes his last, the whole Japanese Army kisses the earth in respect of their fellow rival. This scene is followed by the signing of the agreement between US and Japan on free trade policies. However the scene is interrupted by the foreign military official's visit to the Emperor. He is here to hand over the last Samurai's sword to the Emperor. The irony here again is that it is a foreign official who leads the Emperor to trace his traditional ways and means. With receiving the sword, the Emperor becomes sentimental; he realises the futility, or perhaps the danger of maintaining the foreign relations. The Emperor remains almost silent all along the film, and begins his oratory consequently abolishing the treaty signed between US and Japan. Nathan Algren is American but Japanese in heart. Omuro is Japanese but American in deed. The encounter between Taka and Nathan is also charming. The relationship so grows gradually along with the movie itself. The relationship reaches a kind of climax with a light oral kissing. Apart from this, the bond is always shown on facial expressions. Taka's richness in her facial expressions of her feelings towards the foreign-born is really amazing. And what caught me very much is a line in Captain's journal that from the moment they wake, the Japanese devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue. Captain's words pervade the film and the Japan's history on the practical end. There is not a single moment they are seen just gossiping around; all the time they are busy: men with their fights, women with their household chores. So above all, the film is so inspiring.",The Last Samurai

The machine guns, I don't think the Gatler Guns were ever taken out of America. The machines guns were introduced in Europe only in the late 1890's or so.correct me if I am mistaken.
