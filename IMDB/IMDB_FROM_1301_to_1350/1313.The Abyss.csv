0,bkoganbing,Awe Inspiring Spectacle,8,7 March 2010,"The story of The Abyss starts with a mysterious crash of a US nuclear submarine that is armed with the appropriate nuclear weaponry for its time. With reports of it down, we want to get it before the Russians do.When it rains it pours, literally in this case. A fast moving storm forces the Navy to use the crew and equipment from a nearby underwater deep sea drilling platform and the oil roughnecks are promised some big government checks for their help. Crew chief Ed Harris gives his reluctant consent, made even more reluctant by the fact that his estranged wife Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has designed some new equipment for use in the really deep waters of The Abyss of the Atlantic Ocean. The Navy people and the oil people are a bad fit to start with, but when the deep depths effect Navy SEAL Michael Biehn by bringing out the worst aspects of the military authoritarian personality things get real interesting down in the deep.The spectacle does dwarf the story which is the only real criticism I can make of The Abyss. What the submarine made accidental contact with is some incredible alien life form which I can't go into further because that's the whole point of the film. Of course Biehn still believes it's all a Russian plot of some kind and therein lies the conflict exacerbated by the extreme paranoia he develops.Unlike Cameron's Titanic, the spectacle at the end just overwhelms the human players in this film. But it was those special effects that go The Abyss its Academy Award recognition. The Abyss was also nominated for Sound and Art&Set Direction and Cinematography. It could have been a winner in any of those categories. In fact the biggest mistake you can make which is the one I did make, to see The Abyss on the small screen and formatted. This film is what IMAX was developed for.Though the story does get lost somewhat in the special effects the point is still made about man being ready and open to all kinds of possibilities of life that can exist anywhere. See The Abyss, but wait for a revival showing at a theater.",The Abyss
1,Leofwine_draca,Not too bad at all...despite the friendly aliens,7,16 January 2015,"One in a wave (pun intended) of underwater horror/science fiction films to proliferate the late '80s – offhand I can think of LEVIATHAN and DEEP STAR SIX as others in this sub-genre. THE ABYSS was one of the few James Cameron films I had never taken much interest in, mainly because I find the idea of peaceful underwater aliens to be less exciting than killer robots from the future or acid-drooling alien beasties from outer space.Still, one night I caught this on the schedules and decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did. It may be overlong and slightly unsatisfactory, but for the most part it contains all of the elements that make Cameron films great: taut suspense sequences, clinical attention to detail, plenty of tension, a fine score and outstanding special effects. The 'water creature' scene is truly a landmark of CGI technology and helped pave the way for TERMINATOR 2 in a spectacular way.Otherwise, we're in familiar territory here: an undersea crew are cut off from their team mates and forced to fend for themselves against overwhelming odds. Along with the aliens, they have to contend with a brilliantly done disaster scenario and an increasingly unhinged team mate. The casting is spot on. Ed Harris might not be everybody's first choice as hero, but he acquits himself very well indeed – and it's a wonder he never really found the success he should have done, based on this performance. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is more shrill and slightly annoying, but she does get some very good moments, like the infamous 'drowning' sequence. I also appreciated the fact that Michael Biehn stars as something other than the clean cut hero (as in THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS); he seems to be relishing the chance to explore other facets and brings the screen alive.To be honest, the 'friendly alien' stuff I can do without, but Cameron handles it with the right mix of awe and wonder. Better than CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, in any case. There's an outrageous special effect at the climax which works very well indeed, but the slow spots and occasionally weak plotting stop this from being a classic in the same league as the director's other films; I'm glad I saw it, but it's not something I'll eagerly seek out to watch again. It's still his fourth best film ahead of AVATAR and TITANIC, though.",The Abyss
2,SnoopyStyle,technological marvel,7,26 March 2015,"American nuclear submarine USS Montana has a mysterious encounter and sinks 80 miles off of Cuba. The navy can't get there before an incoming hurricane and asks divers of a nearby underwater oil rig to the rescue. Lt. Hiram Coffey (Michael Biehn) leads the SEAL team with a secret mission. Bud Brigman (Ed Harris) leads the oil workers. Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) is his designer soon-to-be-divorced wife angry that the navy is hijacking her experimental underwater rig. She encounters glowing otherworldly creatures which disrupts their electrical systems. They are unable to disconnect the cable from the underwater rig to the explorer ship above and the rig is throw into chaos.As a story, James Cameron's love of the underwater technology does get into the way sometimes. He spends a little too much time with the underwater maneuvers which takes away some of the tension. Looking back at the technical aspects, Cameron is taking a lot of risk and pushing the boundaries. The water tentacle is a giant step forward. All the underwater work with projections on the surfaces and the underwater creatures are terrific. The sets and the water action scenes are also terrific. It was reportedly a harrowing movie shoot and the constant close-quarters water work was probably the big problem.",The Abyss
3,mark.waltz,It's a big submarine! It's a really big ocean! Where's the plot?,3,2 September 2020,"I guarantee that the three old ladies from the Wendy's commercial of the 80's may have said this if they had gone to see this before going out to get burgers. It's a film that manipulates the senses, but when you start to think about it, you realize that you have seen this before, and even if the special effects weren't as good, the film that this stole from was much better. Yes, this has terrific special effects and some segments are truly amazing. The use of color and underwater photography is breathtaking to look at, but for 2 hours and 15 minutes for the regular cut and close to three hours for the director's cut makes you frustrated when you realized that what you came for, a story, isn't there, and you're really getting all style and no substance.A submarine is trapped underwater, and the Americans want to get to the Caribbean before the Russians arrive. They discover mystical sights underwater, and it is apparent that something is visiting from somewhere beyond the depths of human knowledge. What looks like a snake made out of water that can form into the faces that it sees is really neat, and I can agree that this did deserve the Academy Award for special effects. But that doesn't occur until over an hour into the film, and prior to that, it's nothing but a lot of banging around of underwater equipment, people screaming and arguments between Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Ed Harris, as well as Michael Biehn.I realized early on that I really wasn't interested in any of these characters, so I began to focus on the colors and the effects and even the musical score which is very pretty. But to put it all together and make a successful film out of that, well maybe it was a smash hit in 1989, but in reflection on what I'd remembered from first seeing it, it really does not stand the test of time.To even read the synopsis and get a linear feel of what the actual plot line is defeats the purpose of just sitting there and watching it, and when a creature out-of-the-blue does appear, it looks like ET in one of Drew Barrymore's Halloween fairy costumes. I will say one thing for this film, that it did inspire a lot of modern film in the sense that it is a gorgeous use of magical effects but really is much ado about nothing. The conclusion reminded me of the 1960's Captain Nemo film about a city beneath the sea, and as silly as that was, at least I could follow it.",The Abyss
4,lee_eisenberg,"obviously better than ""Titanic""",6,13 June 2005,"James Cameron seems to be obsessed with larger-than-life stories. ""The Abyss"" and ""Titanic"" both showed this; ""The Abyss"" was more interesting, as it did not use a historical event for a love story. In this case, a bunch of people are on a submarine stuck under water due to a hurricane. Then, they all discover something beyond their wildest imaginations in the ocean. Unfortunately, some people on the submarine don't like what they've discovered and devise some sinister plans.Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio do a good job as Virgil ""Bud"" Brigman and his wife Lindsey, who are leading the expedition. Cameron may have directed his best movie ever with ""The Abyss"". So watch it; it's not abysmal at all.",The Abyss
5,jboothmillard,The Abyss,6,19 June 2006,"From Titanic, True Lies, Aliens and Terminator director James Cameron, this is a pretty good sci-fi water film with some fantastic effects and three good actors. Basically Ed Harris as Virgil 'Bud' Brigman has a crew, including wife Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and Lt. Hiram Coffey (Michael Biehn) looking for the wreckage of a submarine. In fact what they find in this dark and deep pit of the ocean (the abyss) is intelligent life, like aliens. I think the film really gets interesting when the ship starts to sink. After that you have drowning, trying to revive, deep DEEP diving and the great ending on top of the alien/sea creature ship. This film deservedly won Best Visual Effects at the Oscars, and three years later so did Terminator 2 with the T-1000 (looks the same as the water creature). It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Sound. Good!",The Abyss
6,ccthemovieman-1,Typical Cameron Sleazeballs,4,17 November 2006,"If profane, stupid dialog doesn't bother you, this is a very interesting and unique film. Unfortunately, its a James Cameron-directed movie which means you get a lot of disgusting, foul-mouthed characters as the leads - people you are supposed to like. In here, it's Elisabeth Mastrantonio and Ed Harris, who are no strangers to play hard, profane people. They spend most of the moving yelling at each other. This ""romance"" is so stupid it's insulting, as is the ridiculous New Age-alien visitors ending.The good news, in addition to the unique story, was the special-effects. I'm not sure how it looks now but 15 years ago this was a real eye-opener. Now, if someone else - someone with more class and morals than Cameron - could have written the script, this might have been a great film. The same thing applies to Cameron's ""Titantic,"" another movie where unlikeable lead characters ruined what good have been an excellent adventure movie.",The Abyss
7,rmax304823,Benthic.,4,14 March 2015,"Well, it's expensive but not a total loss. The title is subtly and aptly suggestive.You get abyssal Cold War animosity, abyssal disaster movie, abyssal the wonder of outer space creatures. Maybe I should explain that pun. ""Abyssal"" = ""A bissle"", meaning ""little bit of"" in German/Yiddish. It's terrible. Don't bother saying so. On the other hand, that's no reason to smirk. Do I smirk at your puns? No. No, I don't.I don't really think it's worth getting into in any detail. I can't begin to enumerate the flaws. I'll just say that the feminist sensibility versus the male patriarchy crap is overdone, even for 1989. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is called a ""bitch"" and told ""don't get your panties in a twist."" It's unfair. She's only doing her job at this underwater equivalent of Grand Central Station in New York, lacking only the Oyster Bar. And they talk about her and her anger and spite as if they were discussing my ex wife, whereas she's the sole possessor of any common sense aboard this steel-encased asylum.Enough about characterological flaws. The special effects are fine. They must have been extremely good because they distracted me to the point at which I'd completely lost track of how many submarine vehicles there were, who was in each, and which ones had sea water rushing through them.An American submarine has imploded and sunk to the bottom where, you'll be surprised to find, it sits precariously on the edge of a precipice that perches over plumbless depths. Their mission: Disarm all the MIRVs aboard the boomer.Well, that's a tough enough assignment right there, and a power of near catastrophes befall the gang led by Ed Harris. It isn't helped when Mastrantonio, alone and vulnerable in a diving suit, is surveilled by pink-and-blue gelatinous creatures, rather like shape-shifting jellyfish, only like no jellyfish that ever existed.. Once she gets over the shock of finding one of these fluid organisms watching her from behind -- and it only takes her a few seconds -- she smiles at it because it's so pretty and reaches out to caress it with a fingertip. Would you do that? Well, you might, if you heard the inspiring, awestruck ooohs and aahhs of the chorus on the soundtrack, bespeaking not just wonder but a kind of numinosity.It's a commercial pastiche with scenes and plot devices ripped off shamelessly from, oh, ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters,"" and ""Destionation Tokyo."" It should go about hooded and masked, tinkling a little bell, and crying, ""Unclean, unclean.""",The Abyss
8,BA_Harrison,Save your hatred for Michael Bay.,8,28 April 2018,"People like to rag on James Cameron for Titanic and Avatar (two films I thoroughly enjoyed), but they seem to forget what a ground-breaking film-maker he is, and choose to ignore the incredible success he has enjoyed over the past three and a half decades. The Abyss is a technological feat that advances the art of CGI and underwater photography, and tells a great story at the same time.On the surface, this tale of undersea oil workers and Navy Seals encountering extraterrestrials in a hostile environment sounds all too familiar, but Cameron doesn't simply cash in on the success of Aliens with another gung-ho action-fest pitting humans against malevolent monsters: there are several edge-of-the-seat-moments and some great action set pieces, but on the whole we get a far more nuanced film, with characters we care about, a measured pace, and a thoughtful script that explores the strengths and weaknesses of the human spirit. Meanwhile, the extraterrestrials in the film prove to be benign creatures who only have mankind's best interests at heart, which makes a nice change.If you're planning to watch the film, I recommend the Special Edition, which makes far more sense than the theatrical cut-but be warned... it clocks in at a massive 171 minutes. That said, Michael Bay's last Transformers film was 154 minutes long, and I know how I would rather spend my time.",The Abyss
9,moonspinner55,Tightening up the narrative might have helped...,5,20 August 2005,"Elaborate, involved underwater sci-fi has deep sea oil-rig crew enlisted by the Navy to investigate mysterious sinking of nuclear sub, leading them to wondrous lifeforce at the bottom of the ocean. Technically marvelous, good-looking picture provides a grand glimpse into the imagination of James Cameron, though it's unfortunate many of the dramatic people-to-people moments don't come off(and a sub-plot involving Michael Biehn is torturous). Performances for the most part are satisfactory, including Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio(who does her best with an insulting role as a ""bitch"" who softens up on the journey), and Cameron makes good usage of the Linda Ronstadt chestnut ""Willin'"". This review is based upon the original theatrical release in 1989, not the director's cut(which runs an extra 28 minutes)",The Abyss
10,Quinoa1984,One of the best underwater films ever,7,22 June 2000,"James Francis Cameron's The Abyss is a wonder of action and suspense.  It works better as a underwater saga than it's typical sci-fi genre, but that's fine.  Not always what I expect (especially because the version I saw was the special edition), but the ending is amazing and great as a sum-up to the movie.  One of Cameron's best.  A",The Abyss
11,michaelRokeefe,"Deep, cold and the haven of something mysterious.",7,22 September 2002,"Having very good success with TERMINATOR(84)and ALIENS(86), writer/director James Cameron delivers a subtle chiller with Oscar winning F/X. Terrific cinematography and a story line that seems to have a pulse of its own. Civilian underwater oil-drilling divers are summoned to work by the navy to search for a nuclear submarine that has just dropped off the sonar screen. The divers are plagued by a mysterious force not knowing if it is friend of foe. Oh yes, there is the talk of a bomb with the timer already ticking. After viewing this three times I'm certain about calling this is a top notch thriller! Ed Harris leads a very interesting cast featuring:sexy Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Michael Biehm and Kimberly Scott as Lisa 'One Night' Standing.",The Abyss
12,hitchcockthelegend,Cameron's Marvellous Close Encounters Of The Sea Kind.,9,6 March 2009,"Special EditionA deep sea oil crew are called upon by the military to investigate the events that saw an American Nuclear Submarine crash down in the abyss. As the crew, and their hot headed Navy Seal passengers, get down deeper, it would seem they are not alone down there.The Abyss is a flawed movie when put under the microscope, even allowing for the reinserted (and much better) ending that James Cameron was forced to cut by idiot studio executives. Most glaringly obvious as a fault is that The Abyss, after holding us for 2 hours of engrossing cinema, can't quite seal the deal as a deep (hrr hrr hrr) message movie for the modern era. What isn't in doubt upon revisits to the piece is that it's at times spectacular, at others it's joyously ambitious, both things coming together in one big loud boom of being a blockbuster with brains. James Cameron can never be accused of not trying to entertain the masses, and here, with a bit more thought on a humanist level, then we would have been talking in the realms of masterpiece.The making of the film is itself worthy of a movie, a fraught and angry shoot with many problems, of which I wont bore you with as they can be found at the click of a mouse. But Cameron pushes hard because he wants to please and dazzle, and he does, every buck and sweat drop is up there on the screen to be witnessed. The lead actors put in great work, Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio give the film its centrifugal emotive heart as the warring Brigham's, while Cameron fave Michael Biehn does a fine line in Gung-Ho decompression nut case! The technical aspects do dazzle, the visual effects rightly won the Academy Award in that department, and both the cinematography (Mikael Salomon) and art design (Dilley/Kuljian) are worth the price of a rental alone.It's true to say that The Abyss is a fusion of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind & The Day The Earth Stood Still, but really I don't personally see anything wrong with that! As a spectacle it rewards the patient in spades, as a deeply profound moving picture it falls just about short, but even then a less than 100% Cameron picture is still one hell of a ride to be on. 8.5/10",The Abyss
13,LeonLouisRicci,Melodramatic Mankind Meets Aquatic Angels,8,16 April 2014,"The Movie Almost Sinks from the Overacting and Overcooked Human Interactions. Director James Cameron does not know how to Subtly Portray Character Predictions and is Forever Melodramatic and Hammers each Situation with Hyperbolic Dialog and Emoting to the Extreme.But then there are the Impressive Visuals and Creative Artistry of a Vision and a Place that Movie Audiences had yet to Explore. Deep Underwater where only Angels, or what We might call Angels, Exist.The Film is Exciting, and moves quite Rapidly considering its Bloated Length and Filled to the Brim Plots. But it is Blended well and the Good Far Outweighs the Bad. For Every Cringe Inducing, Barely Tolerable Scene (like the resuscitation), there are others that take the Breath Away and Replace it with a Liquidity that is Certainly Unusual.So the Shallow and Stereotypical Military Types and Oil Rig Workers can go about Their Clichéd Machinations. It is the Wondrous World of the Unknown that Manifests Itself here for Entertainment, with a bit of Philosophy for Your Consideration.",The Abyss
14,utgard14,"""...like a dance of light.""",9,15 June 2014,"Beautiful sci-fi film about a civilian dive team trying to help the Navy find a sunken nuclear submarine. The mission goes horribly wrong and the crew find themselves struggling to survive as well as fighting to keep a deranged Navy SEAL from starting World War III. In the midst of this, they also encounter what appear to be aquatic aliens!I'm kind of a sucker for underwater films as they tend to have a lot of beautiful imagery and some interesting premises. Now, I'm giving this a score of 9 but that is for the Special Edition version. The theatrical release I would give a 7. Why the difference? Well, the Special Edition has the ""wave scene"" ending that drives home the anti-nuke moral of the story better. It reminded me of The Day the Earth Stood Still. The theatrical release kind of ends anticlimactically. You never get an explanation for why the aliens were there to begin with nor is the issue of conflict between the US and Russia over the sunken sub ever resolved. You also get additional scenes that build upon the relationships and conflicts between some of the characters. The version with the expanded ending takes it from being a good movie to a great one.",The Abyss
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Water, water, everywhere, and... absolutely nothing else",5,21 November 2004,"First of all, I don't care too much for water... especially not as a plot item in movies. The whole drowning/submerged thing has just been used too much, and I can't help but think about how the appropriate reaction next time I see something where a character is about to drown is to calmly, perhaps in a British accent, point out to the character(not...expecting a response, I'm, in spite of how I'm occasionally perceived, not, in fact, a crazy person) ""Well, just stay on land."". It's actually rather simple and easy. Same goes for sharks. Yes, I really don't find H2O scary... and I hold little, if any, appreciation of it. But what I do like is James Cameron's direction and the actor Michael Biehn(in particular when the two are combined). Therefore, I gave this a try. I'm not sure if I didn't like it because my viewing was based on the wrong reasons... I should have gotten a hold of the original version instead of the Special Edition Director's Cut... the theme was too lame... or the overall thing was just so dull and the end was way too preachy(but if I had to guess, I'd go with the last possibility). The plot is boring and very, very old. It's been done to death, and it had in '89, too. Something happens to a bunch of people, someone else is sent to investigate. James adds nothing new to this idea. Instead he just expects the audience to sit through stuff we've seen tons of times before, while offering nothing in return but some nice visuals. Half of this thing is spent Under The Sea, which can only really impress people who *really* love underwater-shots, I imagine. I didn't really care. I think this was about 45 minutes in before I stopped paying attention. The film clearly didn't deserve it, so why waste my time on it? The characters are not particularly interesting or well-written. Most of them and their backgrounds are clichés. The acting is OK. The special effects are well-done. The ending was really, really preachy. This really has nothing to offer but something to look at, and that really doesn't do that much for me, not for being 2 and a half hours long. In conclusion: either the guy got really lucky on the good pieces he's helmed(Terminator 1&2 and Aliens) or he just had no idea where to take this one. The moral is like something a five-year-old child would say to his parents(and was better when it was in a far superior feature almost forty years before this). Ridiculous. One would have expected something more profound than that from the man who made aforementioned titles. Little to no action, un-engaging adventure, silly sci-fi, poor thriller and no real drama. I don't particularly recommend this to anyone, save for diving lovers and *huge* fans of Cameron. I doubt anyone else will find it worth watching. 5/10",The Abyss
16,neil-476,Wet and wonderful,9,25 April 2010,"On his way to Titanic and Avatar via assorted Terminators, Aliens and Lies, James Cameron made Close Encounters Of The Wet Kind aka The Abyss.Two main story elements - gung-ho military nutcases pursuing secret mission, and secret aliens living on the sea bed - turn out to be very connected, and are intertwined with the domestic problems of Virgil and Lindsey Brigman (married couple at war) in the claustrophobic confines of a drilling rig 2,000ft below the ocean's surface, cut off from support by a storm.Notwithstanding the fabulous special effects, exciting plot developments, and stunning set pieces, the Brigmans' relationship is the heart of the movie. It's what makes you care, and Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio do a great job of bringing these people to life.The whole alien encounter business is lifted directly from CE3K, of course, but the deep water setting so so very different that this doesn't matter. Also, Michael Biehn's loopy navy SEAL (playing essentially the same part which Stephen Lang played in Avatar) is an element not in CE3K, notwithstanding his familiarity from so many other movies.In the end, though, this film buzzes by quickly, excitingly and thrillingly, with some real emotion driving it. Like all of Cameron's films to date, it is a big film, an entertaining film, and a film with heart.",The Abyss

As a survival film it works though, with quality leads in Harris and Mastrantonio.

I just found for the most part that it was kind of boring to me as well. In this movie you can see what makes James Cameron a very good director as he always has good special effects for his movies, he gets the most out of his cast (I always thought he brought the best out of Arnold), and his movies usually have a lot of impact (see the movie Aliens). However, this film also showcases some of his bad tendencies as well. His bizarre obsession with the ocean, the fact he lingers to long with certain scenes (that scene where Ed Harris was trying to revive that girl went on way to long), and the fact he kind of over does it sometimes. The story has a super digging rig at the bottom of the sea, some people need to get on said rig to find some sort of ship or sub at the bottom of the sea. The team leader seems okay at first, but you will find out he is slowly losing it. The person in charge of the rig and the one who designed it are ex husband and wife and that makes for some friction as she does not care for the fact the military is taking over the rig. Well everything begins to unravel with the appearance of some strange thing as this causes the leader of the military guys to totally flip and lots of water and things crashing underwater to follow. The movie had potential, perhaps a more condensed plot would have helped or something, as it is I found the movie to contain both a lot of good and bad.",The Abyss

With help from Navy Seal Michael Biehn and his scientist ex-wife, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Harris and his crew descend deep into the ocean and discover something amazing. Being a Cameron flick, the most impressive thing is the special effects. They really are amazing (and they won a much deserved Oscar). Of the actors, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the strongest. I don't know if she's ever been better. I could really do without all the character actors in the supporting cast. They all seem like they're trying to steal the show.

21,Mr-Fusion,A thrilling adventure in the deep,7,6 November 2021,"There was a time, way back in the '80s - before James Cameron suffered head trauma and devoted his life to Avatar - when the man made blockbusters that had a humanity at their core; something instantly relatable despite the sci-fi setting. The Abyss is one of those, with Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio reconciling their failed marriage amidst mortal peril. Indeed, they're trapped miles beneath the ocean's surface, negotiating nuclear warheads, attacking subs and a hair-triggered Michael Biehn.Cameron creates a realistic environment that still feels otherworldly, populates it with real people and ratchets the tension to unnerving heights.

It looked like an exciting and like a great adventure of a story. It is over all, it does really have the most amazing effects for 1989, it has this water worm like creature that tries to communicate with the team, it was so cool to look at. Not to mention, it was kind of a scary story, being trapped underneath all this water with people whom you don't know who to trust and not trust with these creatures.Basically a submarine has mysteriously disappeared in the ocean, so a civilian team, including an ex married couple, goes down to find them. But something goes terribly wrong and they get trapped into the darkness and the deepest of waters where they discover a new world of creatures and sights to be seen. But one villain may ruin their chances of surviving when he plans to destroy the under water world.Over all, I think this was a pretty exciting picture, not to mention just how groundbreaking the effects were for the time and still to this day. The acting is alright, it does get a little over dramatic at times.

The end (though I won't ruin it) was ridiculous, and left my jaw slacked, just wondering how a great director like James Cameron could have made a film so worthless as ""The Abyss""!1/5 stars-John Ulmer",The Abyss
25,lasttimeisaw,The Abyss,8,14 August 2010,"It's hard to believe 20 years ago James Cameron has already created a wonderland of aliens under the deepest ocean! Before watching this film, I shunned any spoilers just to completely dive into it. But I didn't expect the film would blow my minds away and it was really a great 3 hours ride.There is miracles underneath the deep sea. Within an area no human beings could ever reach, until our hero, Bud, in order to dismantle the nuclear bomb, commits the suicidal mission (I think the plot is a little bit make-believe, and I doubt the plausibility of diving at such depth), anyway all is to create the chance to meet the deep-sea aliens and exhibit in the latter part of the film with its not-out-of-date special effects. The mysterious deep-sea environment also attributes to a charming attraction towards the audience.James Cameron is an obstinate filmmaker, I admire his talent and persistent pursuit of visual wonders on screen, as well as his strong anti-war protestation, even this time the ending is too preachy and unconvincing, only if aliens consider human beings as the utmost species among all the living creatures.The performances are strong from two leads (Ed & Mary, also bravo for their stunt underwater performances), as for Michael Biehn's sole villain character, it is a little bit pity that it should have more exertion, as he was a superstar at 1980s!I gave AVATAR 9/10, and this one I give 8/10 as it is a decent work even it has obvious flaws, I esteem the courage and insight of the whole team because it was extremely difficult to make this kind of sci-fi film 20 years ago.

27,OllieSuave-007,E.T. takes to the sea.,9,28 February 2014,"This is an amazing sci-fi adventure where an American nuclear submarine crashes and sink, and the U.S. government believes that the Russians are responsible. A team of underwater drilling platform workers and Navy SEALS try to locate the crash site and as they get closer to their destination, the friction between the two teams increases. Some workers report seeing UFO's but the SEALS suspect it's a Russian mini-sub. Soon, the events that follow consist of a daring adventure in trying to save alien species and the prevention of World War III.My dad and I would catch this film on TV when it aired a few times when I was a kid, and it is always memorable and fun to watch. The first appearances of the aliens and the part ***spoiler ahead*** where one of the aliens, which looks like an E.T. with wings, takes Bud (Ed Harris) to its underwater city, are some of best parts to watch. The special effects crew really did a great job in the alien effects, making them believable and realistic.Each actor gave a terrific performance, some dramatic yet heroic, and some tough yet humorous. It gave a perfect balance of comedy and drama in this pure sci-fi film. Leo Burmester as Catfish De Vries was my favorite character performance; loved his expression when he first spots the alien. Ed Harris, on the other hand, was too reactionary at times.Overall, this is a very entertaining film - exciting to see all the mayhem and chaos as the characters struggle to survive and complete their mission in their sunken sub. I would recommend watching the extended non-theatrical version because it explains the origin an purpose of the aliens better.Grade A",The Abyss

If he hadn't he might have ended up being remembered for this - and no one would want that hanging around their neck like a millstone for all eternity.The first ten minutes or so of ""The Abyss"" are fine - good even, as a U.S. nuclear submarine sinks after encountering some mysterious force off the coast of Cuba. From there, the whole thing falls apart. The cast (headed by Ed Harris) appears wooden and uninterested and has no discernible chemistry. The story never really seems to set a direction and follow it. It tries to be part Cold War thriller, part alien encounter stuff, part disaster epic. Then it tries to blend them all together in a movie that is nothing less than dull - and that seems to go on and on and on. And did I mention that it seems like it's never going to end? And when it does end it leaves you wondering why you bothered watching this thing for almost three hours.This really is bad.2/10.",The Abyss

30,Lejink,Sea odyssey,8,22 February 2012,"An enthralling and remarkably ambitious underwater epic by James Cameron, As a kid, I grew up watching ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"", well this was voyage to the bottom of the bottom of the sea.Cameron clearly wants to show us that the uncharted depths of the oceans are as much the final frontier as outer space, but that clearly enough to satisfy his artistic vision as he grafts on an encounter with an advanced sub-sea life-form for a remarkable finale, at least the equal of Spielberg's more celebrated ""Close Encounters"".Cameron sensibly gives us just one prior encounter between the entity and the humans, but a remarkably beautiful one it is, a special effects triumph so good he would rework it into ""Terminator 2"", some time later. The cast isn't starry by some standards but this helps give the incredible adventure they share credibility and it's to the actors' collective credit that their sense of camaraderie comes through strongly. That said Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio make an especially believable ex-married couple, very necessary as they pull each other back from the brink with the force of their respective feelings. Perhaps the very long story could have got to its point without the contrived enmity between the riggers and the Navy S.E.A.L.'s, but once the latter are out the way, the action intensifies with Harris' literally heart-stopping mission to de-activate the nuclear warhead some 10000 feet below and his remarkable experience at death's door.I haven't always liked Cameron's work, considering him too light and clichéd in characterisation, usually at the expense of spectacle, but here he delivers an eye-popping but still engrossing movie that works on many levels - including the one that Harris has to descend to, to save the day!",The Abyss
31,bowmanblue,A worthy investment of your time,8,28 February 2020,"After the success of sci-fi blockbusters 'The Terminator' and 'Aliens,' writer/director brought us 'The Abyss' in 1989, which was marketed both on its special effects and - to a lesser degree - 'aliens underwater.' However, most people took this as meaning that there would be hordes of xenomorph-like creatures picking off hapless divers. Yes, there are aliens contained within the movie, but, no, they're not the kind that want to burst out of your chest. And, sadly, a lot of people felt let down by the film and it didn't quite live up to its two predecessors.In the near future a mobile underwater drilling rig is hired by the military to rescue a crashed American nuclear submarine. A small team of Navy Seals joins the rig's crew and they dive down to see what happened to the sub. This was the - very - basic plot of the film and, if you told someone there were aliens in the movie, you'd kind of expect this to be the point where they make their entrance. Again, not the case - 'The Abyss' is so much more.I should point out that I own - and are therefore always referring to - the 'special edition' of the film. It's longer and contains vastly more information regarding the plot of what's (really) happening. The fact that so much was cut out in the original cinema cut was another reason it didn't really gel well with audiences. It's a long film and if you choose to sit down and really watch it (i.e. no fiddling with your mobile phone!) you'll get some of the most breathtaking underwater scenes ever filmed (certainly at the time). The special effects were cutting edge, utilising miniatures for the rigs and combining them with some of the best ever (again, for the time) computer-generated technology bring audiences of the day believable sights that they'd never seen before.And, on top of a fantastic looking motion picture, you get a decent 'human interest' story to hold it all together. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio play the leads - a pair of estranged rig workers who get caught up in all this. You could almost call this a bit of a 'love story' as it's about the two of them reestablishing a connection with each other in the fact of not only the weather raging above them, but also the unknown 'threat' of what lurks at the bottom of the ocean and an increasingly psychotic Navy Seal, perfectly played by (James Cameron favourite) Michiel Biehn.If you're looking for some sort of sci-fi 'blast-a-thon' full of action and fight scenes, then you're probably better sticking with 'Aliens.' However, if you're in the mood for something a little slower-paced and deeper, but at the same time brilliantly acted and spectacular to look at, then definitely try to get into the special edition of 'The Abyss.'",The Abyss

35,The-Sarkologist,One of the best movies I have seen,9,30 July 2011,"I have discovered that in some cases I can say much less about a movie that I love than about a movie that I hate. Well, with movies I hate I can rip them to shreds, and some movies such as L.A. Confidential are so deep that one can rave on for hours about it, and some movies, such as the Abyss, are just masterful pieces of story telling. The Abyss shows hints of what is to come in James Cameron's career. It won an award for visual effects, and the Abyss is seriously visually effective. The story is what makes the Abyss an exceptional movie. An American nuclear submarine spots something unusual underwater and gives chase. They believe it to be Russian but it is way too fast to be anything of a kind. The sub goes into a deep ocean trench and smashes into the wall sinking it and killing all on board, not before it manages to release a warning beacon. Nearby Benthic Petroleum is test running an underwater drilling platform and is drilling for oil. The US Navy commandeer this platform as a base of operations so as to get at the sub. Meanwhile, tensions between the US and Russia are escalating because of the sinking of this submarine, and a Hurricane is approaching from above. The Abyss starts off as slow but really begins to pick up pace when the hurricane hits and the Navy Seal commander begins to go psycho due to his inability to handle high pressures. One reviewer comments that there are too many crises but I don't think that you can have too many as long as you keep them logical. When the crane comes down, it drags the rig to the edge of the abyss, but some have said that there is no way that the crane could have pulled something the size of the drilling platform. As is typical of Cameron, he seems to interweave interesting philosophy into his movies. He opens the Abyss with a quote from Neizsche (who is dead) which is about the emptiness of the human soul. He doesn't seem to really pick up on this point, but what we do have is a scenario in which the world is on the brink of an abyss, which is world war III. Unfortunately the original version doesn't play this out so it comes out as more of an underwater adventure. When the World War III scenario is put into the movie we can see how there is two layers to this movie. On one side the rig is perching on the brink of the abyss while the world is hotting up for a really hot war. Then there are the aliens. They seem to take a back seat in all of this, but they are the reason as to why the war is starting up. Yet aliens are not exactly something that we encounter everyday, so even though there is a lot of evidence that what they are facing underwater is not human technology, the Navy Seals do not want to believe it. The ""Russian Water Tentacle"", as is so aptly put, does not convince the commander that the aliens are peaceful, so he decides to blow them up. On a third level there is the relationship between two of the characters. They begin on the brink of divorce, another metaphorical abyss, and the underwater adventure, where they face each other dying, reunites them. Both of them are stubborn, but brought together on this rig amidst the dangers that they face, including loosing each other. What I thought at the end though was that even though these events brought them together, will it keep them together for twenty, thirty, or even forty more years?",The Abyss

38,johnnyboyz,"UFOs everywhere. That's ""Underwater Flying Objects"".",8,30 June 2013,"The Abyss plays like a more extravagant, more mature and more interesting version of director James Cameron's 1984 breakout hit ""The Terminator"". Therein, we witness what is essentially a love story which happens to have an awful lot of general flak revolving around non-human entities and a range of supporting acts skewering proceedings playing out around it. There are special effects and a distinctly science fictitious atmosphere of fear of the unknown to proceedings, but nothing that matches neither the aggression of The Terminator nor the tendency to rely too heavily on B-movie convention. I don't think it would be at all untrue to label The Abyss as one of Cameron's best work. I view it a combination of the various traits that made up what the man was known for at this time in his career: we have the underwater set/ocean based narrative of Piranha II: The Spawning combining with that very claustrophobic atmosphere of Aliens, as something that's supernatural lurks out there ready for you, furthermore combining with that aforementioned idea of two people coming together under extraordinary circumstances before realising just how much they have in common while the exterior elements brood. Later on, the film even goes so far as to channel Paul Riser's character from Aliens when someone gets their own big ideas on how to deal with the newfound entity apparent in their company.The conflict in those three examples was, of course, much more obvious than it is here – a killer robot; a shoal of killer fish and a pack of killer extra-terrestrials, three things of which can only be so interesting for so long. The Abyss may be a slower and more patient film in its covering of events and depiction of character, but it at least has a little more to depict in the events column than mere second unit action. The film is additionally richer out of the fact its ambiguity and tendency to avoid straight up human heroes and non-human villains. Akin to Cameron's previous work, The Abyss covers a group of people in an inescapable situation made worse out of the fact they have to come to deal with a potentially non-human entity – a non-human entity whose first action during the opening sequence appeared to be to lure a submarine to its doom. The film is, despite this, so much more than how that sounds.Ed Harris leads a team of oil drillers whose expertise is in doing such a thing at great depths beneath the sea, a team of people recruited by the government to uncover precisely why it was that aforementioned submarine crashed and burned like it did. Although, one can hardly crash AND burn when one is underwater... The crew is distinguished by Harris' character Virgil Brigman and that of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lindsey, two people who were once married but now maintain their professional relationship with one another in a working capacity. Also down there is a group of Navy SEALS, whose presence is that of protection should whatever caused the crash still be down there and still be dangerous. Lindsey is the lone female presence and Cameron plays with us in the manner he did when depicting one of the few feminine presences in his prior film Aliens. This occurs when one of the SEAL members asks Harris' character if she should be referred to as ""sir"", raising the issue of what's expected of specific genders in these sorts of projects: we have already witnessed hard-line female space marines who are as powerful as their male counterparts and a complete overhaul of the Sarah Connor character in The Terminator, whose passing from servant (waitress) to solider was there depicted.There is also a great deal of effectiveness in the way Cameron goes about depicting this newfound world the characters find themselves in. While we are a long way from both the inter-planetary colonies found in Aliens and the way in which Cameron attempts to make a parallel between the Los Angeles of 1984 (the setting for Terminator) and a god-forsaken post nuclear war Los Angeles of the 21st Century, the underwater setting here might just as well be somewhere futuristic and unreal for the feeling it evokes. There is a real vulnerability to the setting and its surroundings and as a tropical storm rages above on the surface severing communication with that which can only be defined as 'the outside world'. The film additionally toys with oxygen levels, deep-sea pressure and all the important apparatus required when one is this deep below the Earth's surface. There is a nasty, gooey feeling to these scenes such as there would be if one was in outer space and oxygen quantity in tow with levels of pressure were too vital.As far as dramas go, rarely does a film avoid a misstep like The Abyss does. The piece is, ultimately, the template for an adventure to allow for former romances to be rekindled while its attitude towards its premise that sees it resemble a deep-sea rescue/disaster film with a science fiction twist is the sort of Cameron genre hybridisation I can live with. One of the film's more crucial ideas revolves around when it is the entities make their presence known and to whom they appear. Many are the times wherein we watch as the character most prone to fits of hysterics is the one whose 'contact' is made first – thus, few are believers. Such is The Abyss' inherent maturity that when that happens here, it is not the character closest to psychological meltdown whose condition is abused for meek dramatics. Indeed, they are calm and measured enough to merely report that they thought they were dead on account of ""seeing an Angel"" approach them. The Abyss is not the Cameron film that has captured the imaginations of the many over the years, but it enthralled me.",The Abyss

43,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Abyss"" is a small chink in Cameron's armor because of character issues",6,15 March 2010,"Filmmaker James Cameron's constant yen to explore the unknown has taken us to the future, the depths of space and now the deepest caverns of the ocean. ""The Abyss"" is an underwater survival story with a science-fiction bend. It is a trip into the depths of what we know exists on this planet but can't truly fathom. (I think that's two unintended puns already, sorry.) Then it throws in an extra-terrestrial element, which to be honest, probably doesn't need to be there. ""The Abyss"" is about a team of oil drillers hired by the military to investigate a sunken nuclear submarine. When a hurricane strikes their surface crew, their underwater station is nearly destroyed, tension between the drillers led by Virgil (Ed Harris) and the military men led by Lt. Coffey (""Terminator"" star Michael Biehn) grows. This is then escalated by Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), Virgil's wife, who discovers an iridescent sea creature is among them.What makes ""Abyss"" pale in comparison to Cameron's prior achievements of the 1980s is simply its non-chalant approach to character. Cameron simply tries to compensate for his idea-driven script by dialing up the romantic tension between Virgil and Lindsey whose marriage is days away from ending when they embark on the mission. We would see '90s films such as ""Armageddon"" try and emulate this model for romance in a survival film and Cameron himself would get it right in his 1997 blockbuster, ""Titanic."" This time around, however, it's painfully forced and essentially ineffective.As a concept survival thriller a la a Michael Crichton novel, ""Abyss"" is solid and entertaining. Maybe not the full two and a half hours, but most of the way through. The situations are well thought out, logical and suspenseful. A couple scenes later on take hacks at the credibility of the story and some character motivation overall is questionable, particularly Biehn's character, but as a ""how do we logic our way out of drowning"" movie, it's spot-on. Harris commands Cameron's team leader role and with some exception Mastroantonio does her part as the strong female character he strives to have in his films.The reason I don't think the science-fiction element had to be part of this film was that it didn't really exist other than jumpstart the conflict, escalate the conflict and bail the characters out in the grand finale. In other words, it was a cop-out for the script and an excuse for Cameron to pioneer some visual effects. Maybe you can't blame him in the E.T- obsessed '80s for including it, but looking at ""Abyss"" among the sci-fi greats, which includes some of Cameron's other films, it doesn't compare favorably. Yet, Cameron manages to do what he does best, use great visuals and write stories that compel and resonate so easily with his audience.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",The Abyss

45,freemantle_uk,James Cameron's first underwater adventure,8,24 September 2013,"James Cameron has made many great films over his career, including The Terminator, Terminator 2 and Aliens. But The Abyss is often forgotten when compared to his other films and was a box office flop when it was first released.An American Navy sub mysteriously sinks in the Cayman Trough at the height of the Cold War. With the American Navy unable to launch their own recuse operation they hire an oil drilling crew working on an experimental underwater oil platform. The US SEALs, the crew and the platform's designer, Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) personalities start to clash underworld, with the SEALs' leader, Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) suffering from pressure madness, America and the Soviet Union moving closer to war and the potential discovery of alien life in the depths the ocean.The Abyss is a very tight, claustrophobic thriller which is very much about paranoid and distrust like The Thing and about the delicate state the world was in during the Cold War. The Abyss is a very character driven film, with all the characters being very distinct and memorial. I personally feared that some of the characters were going to only defined by their quirks or traits such as one of them being a conspiracy theorist and has a pet rat and other one is a woman in a cowboy hat and listens to country music, but the characters slowly get more fleshed out and likable as the film progress, particularly the relationship between Lindsey and Bud (Ed Harris). The team is as memorable as the Marines in Aliens, but there still leave an impression. Compared to most of Cameron's filmography, The Abyss is an action light film and more like a sci-fi film of old. As already mentioned that The Abyss does share similarities to The Thing because of its themes and basic settling (a group of highly trained personnel isolated in an extreme environment). At the end of the special edition The Abyss in the Special Edition also shares a lot of similarities to The Day the Earth Stood Still, with a little bit of 2010: The Year We Made Contact near the end and this is when Cameron goes on his soapbox about war and nuclear disarmament.For the time the special effects were incredible, using a combination of models and minitures and CGI. The water effects particularly hold up, especially when you still see water effect being very hard to do, like in The Last Airbender. The aliens too also had a unique design, looking like glowing stringrays with the pink, purple and blue lights and the aliens themselves had a mix of a classic grey alien look with more colour to them.Composer Alan Silverstri was also able to add to the visuals with an excellent score, using many different styles. There were heavy drums for the military to a softer choir when we see the aliens are present, giving them a divine presence.The Abyss is a long film and the Special Edition is over two and half hours and near the end the film The Abyss does start to drag. This is not helped when Cameron becomes more preachy and a little cheesy when Bud meets the aliens.The Abyss is a thoughtful, character driven sci-fi from Mr Cameron that reflects more older sci-fi films and shows that special effects should be used more then just for spectacle.",The Abyss
46,dee.reid,"""The Abyss"" - Love and War in Underspace",10,20 October 2004,"""The Abyss"" is the most thought-provoking, imaginative, and beautiful science fiction film that I've ever seen. Master filmmaker and craftsman James Cameron brings us another thoughtful sci-fi epic behind ""The Terminator"" (1984) and ""Aliens"" (1986), two films that played brilliantly with Cold War-era paranoia and here, he brings us something that could possibly be the director's most introspective piece.1989 was quite a year in terms of undersea sci-fi flicks, with ""Leviathan"" and ""DeepStar Six"" taking full advantage of the ""Alien"" syndrome, and while ""The Abyss"" had aliens on its mind, these particular extraterrestrials come to us with a message and a purpose.The film begins with the sinking of an American nuclear submarine that was brought down under mysterious circumstances. The navy commandeers a civilian drilling rig to enter the sub and search for survivors. But this ragtag group of blue-collar workers, led by Bud Brigman (Ed Harris) and his ex-wife Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), are plagued by a Navy SEAL team's insane leader, Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn), and a series of bizarre underwater occurrences that could prove that they're not alone on the ocean floor.""The Abyss"" boasts one of the most compelling science fiction stories of any sci-fi film in the past 20 years. It was James Cameron's third and most powerful film, but it wasn't his best, at least according to his hardcore audience and certain critics, despite its groundbreaking computer animation effects and story.Even though my review is based on the 1992 special edition, one cannot help but wonder why THIS is not the version that was released in theaters back in 1989. But of course, overzealous executives played heavily into the film's troublesome release, and erased the most significant subplot of the story, with regards to the extraterrestrial visitors that plague the protagonists.Now upon the revelation of this information, one might be tempted to recall ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" and what it stood for back in 1951 when it was released. Desperate times, like today in 2004, call for a movie like this to be viewed by a public that is disillusioned with itself and its overseers in Washington, D.C.""The Abyss"" is a radical call for peace, in that both of these films tell stories of otherworldly visitors who descend from the heavens (in this case, underspace) to tell humans to cease their violent, self-destructive ways.Not since ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" has there been an anti-war science fiction film that is this groundbreaking, powerful and bold. I'm sure that Cameron ran into his fair share of individuals who claimed that he was a communist or a propagandist for making a movie that calls for peace rather than conflict.And perhaps ""The Abyss"" is the most political and out-right vocal of Cameron's films; it is arguably the best of a crop of sci-fi films in a very long time that are tailor-made for essential viewing.10/10",The Abyss
47,mjneu59,Close Encounters (of the Aquatic Kind),5,1 November 2010,"A crippled deep sea mining rig lies helpless on the ocean floor, with two equally lethal bombs on board: the salvaged nuclear warhead from a scuttled military sub, and an unbalanced naval officer ready to snap. The plot may not hold water, but James Cameron's undersea action fantasy is still a thrilling adventure, despite a conspicuous absence of the human element from all but a few scenes. Clearly a good deal of care (and cash) went into the production, and the attenuated pace of filming under water gives every scene an eerie, ominous momentum. But Cameron is obviously more interested in showcasing his (admittedly dazzling) state-of-the-art special effects, and the 'Close Encounters (of the Aquatic Kind)' subplot is a definite liability. The overblown resolution is uncomfortably at odds with Cameron's already tense, claustrophobic inner space survival story, but it does at least offer one consolation: the visual razzle-dazzle helps divert attention away from all the stock characters and comic book dialogue.",The Abyss
48,smatysia,Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio excels,8,24 March 2002,"OK, I'm a sci-fi fan. And I only saw the original version. But it was darn good. Yes there were some holes, like there always are. (Most notably how people seemed to not be overly bothered by wallowing in 30 degree water.) Ed Harris played his usual rugged persona well. Michael Biehn seemed the least believable, but I can't understand why. But the top award in this film goes undisputably to Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. She was great. When she was the ice queen, she pulled that off. When she melted, that seemed natural. When she was dead, she LOOKED dead. The effects were pretty good. But why, whenever there are benevolent aliens, are they always accompanied by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir? I'm looking forward to seeing the long version. Grade: A-",The Abyss
49,jimbo-53-186511,Not Cameron's finest hour (or should I say nearly three hours),4,17 May 2015,"This review is based on the extended special edition version of The Abyss which is 164 minutes long (as opposed to the normal version of the Abyss which is 139 minutes long). I suspect that both versions of the film are too long, but at close to three hours the extended version is almost intolerable to sit through.I'm all for films that have slow burning narratives whereby you're teased to breaking point, but for the majority of the running time this film is just one big tease; I think the best analogy I can use to describe this film is to say that it's like foreplay; whereby you're teased for a long period of time, but eventually you get to the point where you think 'Hey I want to have sex now' except here it's all foreplay and no sex.It's also clear that Cameron never seemed to know which direction to take the film in; it starts off as a mission to rescue survivors, then it becomes a film about hunting down supposed Alien life forms, then we get the clichéd crazy character who's intent on destroying the Aliens with a nuclear warhead. Cameron is usually a good story teller, but this film is so sloppy, lacking in focus and poorly conceived that it just becomes hard to take it seriously. It has a pointless political agenda that went nowhere and the film is just so painfully boring to sit through. It didn't help that I didn't like any of the characters and the soap opera between Bud and his wife was more annoying than anything.There was also something that puzzled me when this film ended; I understood that the Aliens only saw bad in humankind (hence the reason why they were intent on destroying the human race) and presumably this is why they attacked the nuclear submarine at the start. However, what I couldn't understand was why they didn't destroy Bud and his team when they had the chance? I understand why they didn't at the end when they realised that not all humans were bad and that humans were capable of loving each other, but they didn't know that at the start so why did the Aliens spare their lives in the first place? It's sloppiness like this that really brings the film down despite the fact that it has a good message and surprised me by being something different to what I expected.As with most of James Cameron's films this film has some wonderful special effects and some beautiful cinematography. Sadly, unlike a lot of Cameron's films this does not have a compelling story and doesn't even have any exciting set-pieces (anyone who is expecting an exciting Aliens style film underwater is going to be bitterly disappointed). For the most part it was just an unfocused mess and I felt that the pay-off at the end nowhere near justified the ridiculous and boring build-up to said pay-off.",The Abyss

51,Kdosda_Hegen,"""When you look long into an abyss, the abyss looks into you...""",9,24 June 2021,"That's how I felt watching this film. I watched the almost 3 hours long Special Edition and it was an absolutely magnificient experience. This is both visually and plot-wise strong film. The settings are breathtaking. Most of the special effects are practical made and the put effort truly shines. Some of the shots are just eye stabbing how marvelous they look. I guess that some of the interaction effects feel slightly off, but it did not bother me.One could say that for the most part nothing happens in the film. The whole first hour is mainly just to get knowing the characters better and I truly loved it, with all the time dedicated to them you truly start to care for them. The characters are so fleshed-out that I even care for the villain's perspective and his motivations and it even begs a question if he really is a villain in the first place.The action scenes are awesome. Underwater chase sequences and fight scenes in the water are stunning. I have even watched some behind-the-scenes footage to see how it was all done. There was so much effort put into this that the main actor almost drowned while being filmed. We don't get much of such devotion to filmmaking nowadays.And for the storyline itself the film is completely unpredictable. It doesn't go by the common plot making rules and it just feels as a wonderful unexpected journey more than a huge event. Many of the seemingly not important scenes later on are revealed to be very important, but it all feels earned and not cheap at all. It even has a strong political message which make it feel more directed to the viewers than the in-film characters themselves. The film's ending is so pretty and sentimental, a true pure cinematic beauty. 3 hours very well spent, one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.",The Abyss
52,Boyo-2,"Son of Abyss, This is a Good Movie",8,7 September 2001,"The special effects and underwater scenes do not overwhelm the human drama, which is usually the case with James Cameron movies.  He knows how to dazzle you, and he knows how to appeal to you emotionally too.
The leading man, Ed Harris, has said that he will never discuss the way he feels about making this movie, but once on 'Inside the Actors Studio' he tipped his hand by saying that he just felt like asking himself the entire time, 'is this acting?' I am sorry he feels that way, since he does some great acting, has some fantastic moments and if the stunts were egregious to him, he probably should have passed on the project. I saw this at Radio City Music Hall when it opened, which of course is ideal for a movie of this magnitude.  Sorry also it was not a blockbuster hit, its really a very good story, conducted by a part-time maniac, part-time sentimental fool named James Cameron.",The Abyss
53,ShootingShark,Eye-Popping Underwater Science-Fiction Epic,8,1 May 2005,"When a US nuclear submarine crashes mysteriously in the ocean, the crew of a nearby prototype submersible oil-drilling rig, along with a specialist Navy team, are asked to search for survivors. The investigation finds no obvious cause for the wreck but when inexplicable underwater phenomena start to occur, tensions run high between the riggers and the marines. Is there some military power at work, or is some much more powerful natural force behind events ...This is without a doubt the most amazing undersea movie ever made - getting on for half of the running time takes place underwater, and visually it is simply spectacular. By all accounts it was a horrific ordeal to make for everyone who worked on it and the technical complexities were enormous (much of the diving gear, vehicles and camera equipment were new designs that had never been used before), but none of this shows on screen - what remains is a majestic and powerful undersea science-fiction epic with amazing action scenes and terrific, passionate performances. Harris as the honest-Joe down-to-earth crew chief Bud is the absolute core of the movie, and his fine performance gives it the solid centre from which the fantasy can flow, but the support cast are equally impressive, particularly the scene-stealing Graff, and Biehn as the slowly cracking-up Lieutenant Coffey. Visually the film is a sheer delight from start to finish; Leslie Dilley and Ron Cobb's incredible sets for the rig make it seem astonishingly real (the main set was built in the tank of a disused nuclear power plant in South Carolina), Mikael Salomon and Al Giddings' photography is stunning and the Oscar-winning visual effects are mesmerising, particularly the pseudopod/water-tentacle sequence, which was the first modern-day computer-generated digital matte sequence (a style which has now sadly superseded virtually all other types of visual effects). The movie has so many memorable scenes it's hard to pick favourites, but I particularly like the crane-collapsing sequence, the spine-tingling search of the sunken sub and the euphoric swim over the alien city. The evocative choral score by the talented Alan Silvestri is arguably his best work and adds immeasurably to the movie's atmosphere. This review is of the original 145-minute theatrical release; the film was subsequently re-released on video in a 169-minute version which has some interesting but not very crucial extra footage and plot development. This can never be stated enough; movies are about images, and the more fantastic and imaginative the pictures are, the richer the movie. The Abyss may have been horrible to make, but as a piece of pure cinema it is simply dazzling. Forget the overblown Titanic, this is Cameron's most audacious, thrilling and best movie.",The Abyss

I think it is helpful that most of it occurred in the water giving a good background to absorb any of the problems.The setting is a personal favorite of mine, underwater seabase, so maybe I'm a little biased in that regard, but the story is solid writing and it's a pretty good cast.There is some weird flubbing when people get panicked or crazy, but I really can't say any of it was actual bad acting.",The Abyss

56,PredragReviews,Cameron's Water-themed Masterpiece!,9,1 June 2016,"""The Abyss"" is one of the most intriguing Sci-Fi/action movies to have ever been made. From the very beginning of this exceptional movie to the end, for the first time viewer or for those that have watched it many times, it is a highly inventive and an ultimately captivating movie. Although there have been many movies made about events under the surface of the ocean, few can match up to the intensity that ""The Abyss"" is laden with. One of the more intriguing aspects about the edition of ""The Abyss"" that I'm reviewing today or any other version that contains both the original theatrical release and the Special Edition with twenty eight minutes of additional footage is how the whole tone of the conclusion of the film changes between the two. This is not something that I wish to go in to in great detail; suffice it to say that the Special Edition gives a whole new meaning to this classic movie.From Ed Harris to Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio to Michael Biehn and all of the other marvelous actors that performed in this film, they all deserve high praise for their collective efforts in creating this Science Fiction classic. It isn't too often that Ed Harris or Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio gets the lead roles in films but in the case of ""The Abyss,"" they both proved that they were quite ready for such roles.Technically, it has few peers. It is scientifically accurate in what it depicts, and the special effects are virtually flawless. The story is very engaging. It unfolds slowly and smartly and takes many twists and turns. The aliens and their importance to the story are kept a mystery until the end. And the movie also has something often missing in science fiction, drama. Science fiction in television and movies often tends to be overly intellectual or overly melodramatic. The Abyss, in contrast, is a dramatic story through and through. The scenes between Bud and his wife (particularly when he tries to revive her after she drowns and when she talks to him as he descends into the abyss) are among the most engaging I have ever seen in any movie. Give it a shot, this is definitely a sleeper classic that deserves more exposure than it's gotten!Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",The Abyss
57,philip_vanderveken,Breathtakingly beautiful,8,18 April 2005,"When we think about aliens in the movies, I guess everybody immediately thinks about the series of ""Alien"" - movies, but there are some other fine examples and ""The Abyss"" may well be the best alternative I can come up with. Even though this was made by James Cameron, the same director who gave us ""Aliens"", both movies are very hard to compare.When an American nuclear submarine is attacked during the cold war and crashes, the navy is convinced that it was the work of the Russians. They want to salvage the wreckage as soon as possible, because a storm is coming, but they aren't able to send a diving crew of their own that quickly. That's why they contact a group of workers of a nearby underwater oil rig, who reluctantly accept the job. They are joined by some navy SEALS who will help them to locate and investigate the cause of the crash. But they do not only find the crashed sub, they also find out that there is more down there in the deep than what they had ever expected to see.What I liked so much about this movie was that this time the aliens didn't feel threatening at all. It was something completely different from what we were used to see and it worked perfectly. This was a beautiful, well-crafted movie with some very fine acting and with some excellent special effects. Even though this movie was created in 1989, the computer animations were still marvelous and breathtaking. In fact, this entire movie is breathtaking. It is very touching and powerful at the same time and I'm sure that many people will have a lot of difficulties not to show any emotions while watching it. I give this movie an 8/10. It sure doesn't deserve any less.",The Abyss
58,screenman,There's Something In The Water.,6,3 July 2008,"Gosh; I get really cheesed-off with these tight-arsed 'experts' each trying to out-expert each other, in order to prove that they know more, are more necessary, or more loyal, or more dedicated, or some damn thing associated with the big project, adventure, mission, whatever. So, we have a seemingly endless round of belligerent, theatrical, hammy histrionics, until somebody finally, grudgingly concedes a point and the story can proceed.Hollywood calls it drama. I call it bunk.Quite a decent cast become immersed in this cheesy hokum. Unfortunately, it also includes one of the most irritating actresses to vex the screen: Mary Minestroni or something. She has these beady, black, rat-like eyes by which she stares at everyone with needless emphasis. These, along with her pasty complexion, and jutting, bony features lend her a 'living-dead' appearance. I'm sure she's cold to the touch.Well, things go wrong big time. There's a storm turns up (yawn). There's a bunch of sinister marines or other, led by a psychopath (something wrong with the recruitment programme). There's the inevitable flooding down below. The systems stop working. Surprise, surprise; they can't communicate with the surface (they never can). There's even a nuclear bomb - whoopee!And, if that lot isn't enough to satiate your adventure needs, there's some aliens down in the deeps. But they're a really nice crowd. Despite raining all manner of scrap iron onto their facilities and trying to nuke them out of existence, they're just a benign and playful bunch with a comic turn in watersports.Effects are impressive, But the rest of the movie is anything but. It's more like a children's fairy story mistakenly aimed at adults. The makers have created a 'Close Encounters' under water; unfortunately it's as childish as 'ET'.",The Abyss
59,brando647,One of James Cameron's Finest,8,28 January 2009,"There are very few filmmakers in modern cinema who can do science fiction as well as James Cameron. Cameron is responsible for bringing us some of the best sci-fi in the last 25 years, having created the Terminator and even delved into the Alien franchise. Cameron's 1989 film seems to be a bit under-appreciated and overshadowed by his other accomplishments. The film follows the crew of an underwater oil rig who are enlisted to assist the military in searching for survivors in a downed nuclear submarine. Events take a turn for the worse when a hurricane forces their topside support to evacuate and the military lieutenant overseeing the operation in the rig begins to show signs of stress-induced psychosis. Soon, the stranded crew discover that they aren't alone on the ocean floor...First, I need to recommend that, if you plan to watch this movie, be sure to watch the special edition that was re-released to include an additional 27 minutes. The special edition restores the original ending for the film that goes into greater detail of the crew's discovery and the message James Cameron was trying to instill upon the audience about mankind. Despite the films near 3 hour runtime, you will hardly notice the time passing as the film never gets boring. Strong performances and high quality special effects will keep you engaged throughout.The casting in this movie was exceptional, with Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio headlining the film as the divorcing couple in charge of the rig crew. The best performance comes from Michael Biehn as Lieutenant Coffey and his slow mental deterioration as the high stress environment eats away at him. Even the supporting cast was of high quality and were a great addition to the film (particularly Todd Graff as Hippy, who I found to be a bit of a scene-stealer at times). The effects in this movie feel ahead of their time. While the film was created in 1989, it's effects were just as impressive (if not more) as movies released well into the mid-1990's. Overall, the film is a blast to watch and, while it didn't seem to receive as much recognition as some of Cameron's other work, it remains one of my favorite films from his career. It's well worth the time to sit through this 3-hour epic.",The Abyss
60,fntstcplnt,The Abyss (1989),8,31 August 2019,"Directed by James Cameron.

Quinn, Christopher Murphy, Kidd Brewer, Ken Jenkins. (PG-13)Ambitious underwater science fiction saga about deep-sea oil rig workers grudgingly cooperating with a Navy SEAL team on a search and rescue mission when a nuclear sub sinks following an encounter with an alien presence. Exceptionally well-mounted and designed adventure, as expected from a movie made by James Cameron; it also suffers from some of his disorganized and erratic scriptwriting tendencies. When the film focuses on the futuristic action and human drama elements, it's a near-masterpiece, but when he tries connecting fantasy/sci-fi elements to global crises (or just the main narrative itself), it rarely satisfies completely. For all of its shortcomings, though, it's still an enthralling 2.5-3 hour experience (depending on which version you watch, both flawed in different ways) with superlative sound, image, direction, music and effects, and fine performances top-to-bottom, especially Harris and Mastrantonio as the estranged husband/wife leads. Typically, films bog down when they go below the ocean surface--lead-footed, murky, unappealing--but not here; the underwater photography and action staging has arguably never been topped before or since.

Flawless.",The Abyss
62,Howlin Wolf,"A little more sedate than Cameron's other work, but every bit as good...",8,12 April 2001,"By far James Cameron's most personal work, it takes at least half an hour for anything conventionally 'exciting' to happen, but by then we're so involved with the characters and their situation that it makes the drama all the more intense.   Cameron is a master of the 'pared down' screenplay, giving us all the elements necessary for the story but no frills.  ""The Terminator"" epitomises this technique.  Rarely does the story slow down long enough for the characters to indulge in reams of exposition; but then, that's what makes it such a visceral experience.  Cameron's dialogue is made up of either bold statements of fact or smart wisecracks.  Never are the audience or characters allowed to think ""I wonder if they meant this...""   So it is with ""The Abyss"".  Only with the story being naturally slower, non-stop action is not contrived to take the focus off the dialogue.  It is left to the visuals to do this; and what stunning visuals they are.  The reputed 'hell' that Cameron put his cast and crew through during the shoot would doubtless by judged worth it by the director, pointing to these as his evidence.   The film is no less interesting when things are confined to the interior of the sub.  The actors convey their uneasiness with their surroundings and each other perfectly.  No, the relationship between the characters of Harris and Masterantonio isn't very credible, but this is more down to Cameron's shunning of backstory than any deficiencies in performance.  In any case, it doesn't damage the drama at all.   There are some (not very subtle) allusions to the Cold War for those who want them, but for those who don't, ""The Abyss"" proves surprisingly difficult to categorise.  One thing that can be said about it is that it is consistently entertaining throughout its running time.  Cameron hasn't lost the knack of providing for his audience.  Fans will find something different to his usual style, but pleasingly, this at least remains the same.",The Abyss
63,oneguyrambling,"Too ""big"" a concept even for Cameron to handle.",6,14 November 2010,"To sum up The Abyss in one sentence: An undersea drilling team are conscripted to search for a sunken US Navy submarine, only they find that and so much more. First off the bat, JC doesn't do ""little"" films, so there is a lot more to this film than that.The rescue team is led by Ed Harris as Bud and includes many unique characters, but in truth none of them exceptionally memorable or even necessary. Upon being informed of their duties they are joined by a team of Navy Seals, this time led by Michael Beihn as Coffey.We realise shortly after that the drillers and the Seals aren't likely to co-exist peacefully for too long. Adding further fuel to the potential fire is the late inclusion of the designer of the underwater rig Lindsay, played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who also happens to be Ed Harris's soon to be ex-wife.After initial decompression the newly forged team investigate the sub, the USS Montana. They find that all crew are already dead, and during the search one of the team suffers convulsions and goes into a coma for some reason, outside the sub Lindsay sees some non-natural looking lights that freak her out a bit.Meanwhile above water a cyclone hits, the Seals have taken the diving gear to salvage things from the sub so the crew has no choice but to sit it out. Unfortunately the storm causes the flooding of a large area of the rig in which crew members are trapped and drown, and the loss of communication to the outside world. It also nearly drags the rig into a massive abyss near which the sub is located.But that isn't what the film is about, the key of The Abyss is when the crew eventually meet the inhabitants of the abyss, everything else is a sideshow. Once contact occurs, Coffey loses touch with reality thinking the alien beings are Russian enemies, and the crew must work out how to survive and somehow get to the surface once more. This all becomes more complicated when Coffey unleashes a nuclear weapon many, many times more powerful than the WW2 A-Bombs, which must be disarmed before anyone thinks about leaving.For the time the SFX in The Abyss were amazing, which for a Cameron directed film shouldn't surprise anyone after T2 and now Avatar. But as a film The Abyss is only so-so, there are so many converging plot lines that take things nowhere and if anything lead to a bunch of dead ends and unsatisfying conclusions that you only really remember the water tentacle FX and not much else.What The Abyss ends up as is an 80 hour build up leading to a 40 minute wrap up and a pretty dumb and hardly mindblowing conclusion, which is I think what Cameron was chasing.There are several interpersonal issues and conflicts raised over the duration but none of them seem important and indeed none of them are necessary to further the plot, they are simply included as Cameron felt that they must.Without giving much away (I think), in the finale the aliens show a montage of the bad things that humankind has done to itself and the Earth over the years. I know the aliens must be a very advanced race but did they already have Tivo in 1989? Really? Another point: If nothing else this has some James Cameron standards that seem to pop up again and again in his films: - A bad ""establishment"" guy that becomes the face of everything naughty about big corporations. (T2, Aliens, The Abyss, Avatar) - The seemingly obligatory ""Squad formation"" scene where the troops discuss plot events for viewers. (Aliens, Avatar, The Abyss) - The big fight between huge manned machines. (Aliens (of course), Avatar, The Abyss) Final Rating – 6 / 10. Unlike Avatar this is far more a technical achievement than an entertainment one. Too long and basically too little of anything to be memorable.

A first-rate cast led by Ed Harris keeps this lengthy sci-fi epic afloat. Ocean adventures can be a hard sell (think WATERWORLD) but THE ABYSS is greatly helped by its first-rate special effects and compelling cast. The ultimate encounter with the aliens makes the long wait worthwhile, although I can agree with those who have suggested the film has enough adventure even without the alien subplot. While it is no masterpiece, THE ABYSS stands head and shoulders above some other water-logged flicks like the similarly themed SPHERE, also about a mysterious underwater artifact. THE ABYSS has several highly dramatic moments, especially a drowning sequence mid-film that is not intended for the very young or the squeamish.",The Abyss

A bunch of people confined in these small and closed spaces where death could be imminent. But everything fell apart after that phony alien made an appearance. It was a tough survival flick until then. The Abyss might have created the prototype for big budget sci-fi flicks like The Martian.

At this point they all jump around like a bunch of monkeys shouting and yelling as if someone invited them to an orgy. Jeez! Yes. I know it is supposed to be an allegory and all.

66,bobsgrock,"For 2 1/2 hours, it's unparalleled in its scope.",8,21 May 2010,"James Cameron is a true visionary director. If anyone can prove the auteur theory it is him, for every single film he makes is of his own, unique vision that separates him from the rest of Hollywood. With the Terminator films, Titanic and The Abyss, he shows his full-out talent as one of the premier entertaining directors of the last 30 years. Considered to be his most arduous and challenging shoot, The Abyss plays like a National Geographic documentary showing footage of divers underwater. The scope and scale of Cameron's vision here is tremendous; almost every shot begs the question, how did he do it? Yet, compelling as that footage is, it doesn't begin to scratch the surface of what a deeply involving experience this movie is. Though his dialogue comes off as corny or amateurish at times, his storytelling ability is unparalleled. He creates a complex plot-line, sometimes to the point of over-stuffing the amount of content the audience can take. He introduces one thread, than another, than another, than pushes them all together until we are overwhelmed, but not confused. It really is quite a head-trip, but it is so well-made that very few other films could succeed as this one does. As with most Cameron films, the director's cut is almost assuredly superior to the original. Certainly the extra footage is not totally necessary to the central plot, but it gives more evidence to account for the incredible scale and detail he puts in every single one of his productions. The acting also contributes the riveting action taking place; Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are quite good as exes forced together and the supporting cast also really helps bring the audience into this world. Not enough can be said of Cameron's incredible vision. For that reason alone, practically every film he's made is worth seeing. Unfortunately with this one, the ending suffers quite a bit. For the first 2 1/2 hours, I cannot think of many other films more engrossing and riveting than The Abyss. However, the final scene seems almost forced and tacked on. Cameron essentially opened up for a number of different possibilities here and took the easy way. Had he created a more compelling finale, this might be his unsung masterpiece. Despite this quibble, there is no doubt this is a unique film by a unique director. You know you're in the hands of a master when all you can think about while watching the movie is how the heck did he do it.",The Abyss
67,mstomaso,"Epic original sci-fi adventure with a lot of heart, action, suspense, and brains",9,5 July 2005,"The Abyss is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi films. It mixes hard science with abject fantasy to make moral and philosophical points about the human condition and our place in the universe without the usual clichés. And it does so with good dialog, strong characterization, and intensely emotional acting. Harris and Mastrantonio are absolutely electric together and dominate the screen, but the entire cast deserves plenty of credit. The production itself is mesmerizing despite its vast scale and tastefully used special effects. The film is long, but worth every second of the experience, and the slightly lengthier, more detailed Special Edition version is even better than the original.Ostensibly, this is a film about first contact with non-terrestrial intelligence. But the story allegorically deals with an amazing array of themes common to great dramas - violence, love, capitalism, war, courage and cowardice. The hardest, most obedient soldier in the film, played spectacularly by Michael Biehn, is a coward, and a man who is hopelessly in love with his estranged wife (Harris) turns that love into an act of suicidal heroism which might unintentionally save the world. And yet nothing is exactly as it seems to be, and there are really no spoilers in this review. There are so many subtle and sensitively developed themes in this film that it is hard to imagine a more epically human drama in the sci-fi genre. Even so, this is a film which entertains at every level, and will satisfy the action fan as much as the wannabe film critic. ;-) Most of the film takes place on an experimental submarine drilling platform owned by a petroleum company. A nuclear sub has been lost in ""the abyss"" - a subduction trench near the Caiman Islands - after encountering an impossibly fast object. Soon, the US military commandeers the platform and its command ship - The Benthic Explorer - to attempt a rescue mission. As everything begins to go wrong, and the encounters with strange phenomena continue, the Navy SEAL in charge of the rescue attempt begins to crack. Meanwhile, on the surface, accusations concerning the sub are escalating between the USSR and USA, and nuclear war seems immanent. This describes just a small segment of the deliciously complex plot that unfolds in The Abyss. You'll have to see it to enjoy the rest.",The Abyss
68,sarastro7,Superb sci-fi action adventure,10,15 January 2005,"The Abyss is one of the best sci-fi action/adventure movies ever made. Besides the ""usual"" ingredients of excitement, characterization and great narrative technique, the movie really scores on the wonder factor. The amazing, jellyfish-like aliens and their manipulation of water... A superb story incorporating the use of a then-recent SFX breakthrough to absolute perfection. A timeless story with great actors, great characters, great emotional substance.The story is fabulous. It is about the very survival of humanity, drawing on that time-honored science fiction trope: will we be so stupid and disorganized that we cause our own destruction, or will love and reason prevail, inaugurating a great and harmonious future for our species? In thinly veiled symbol terms, this movie demonstrates how we will reach the brink of destruction due to our own folly, but can be redeemed if we rediscover the love and wonder that we once lost.My rating: A clear 10 out of 10.P.S.

69,emasterslake,Amazing Suspense movie.,8,25 March 2006,"Abyss is about a mysterious attack on an American Sub that was caused by something not human. The Lifeguard and Navy believed it was done by the Soviets, only that doesn't explain how something can go fast and stop anything that's electrical.So to get to the bottom of this the Navy hired an aqua oil repair team from Texas to solve the mystery of this incident.The Aqua team has it's own underwater fortress as well as several mini subs and high tech gear.Once they encounter the cause of the incident, they're about witness something not human. Something that mankind has never seen in the ocean before.This movie is directed by James Cameron who also made Terminator and Aliens possible. The visual effects and structure of the movie is just amazing to watch. It's unlike any suspense movie you'd ever witness.Those who like Cameron's other movies will enjoy this one.The flow of the movie is slow.

Definitely worth the price of a ticket back then for the large screen and I recommend the blue-ray purchase today which has all scenes restored including a decent ending. Amazing filming scenes underwater and it took its toll on everyone so the real-life stories go. On the movie story, if you see the uncut version, we are introduced to another lifeform and as always the questions about who, what, where, why, how and when just present themselves. It glues us to the screen because we want to believe. I like long movies and this is up there with them. Worthy mention is James Cameron signature on this. He is a serious Director and here we see him going through his learning curves for greater movies to come. Get ready to scuba!",The Abyss
71,vip_ebriega,'Close Encounters' meets DAS BOOT.,10,3 February 2007,"My Take: A splendid claustrophobic adventure with terrific special effects and gripping tension. Unless (or even if) hell froze over I can only say this: No one makes blockbusters like James Cameron. The director who shone in THE TERMINATOR continued to shine in his subsequent films including ALIENS, a TERMINATOR sequel, the ever-so-popular TITANIC (which finally earned him his deserving Oscar for Best Director), and this sometimes subtle but mostly gripping underwater adventure THE ABYSS. James Cameron is one of my most favorite directors (joining Spielberg, Hitchcock and Burton). You may know this guy as the director of the blockbuster, multi-Oscar winning ""Titanic"". Or the dude who brought you the superior sequel ""Aliens"" and the first two ""Terminator"" movies. The said films are big hits but among those Cameron films is this enjoyable adventure flick. THE ABYSS didn't make much of an impression in its original release, but thanks to a Director's Cut, THE ABYSS is better than ever. Other than the claustrophobic first half, the finale is improved from a simple what-if deux ex machina to a morally-induced ending. While the final product still falls short of the director's ALIENS or his later movie TITANIC, THE ABYSS has stood up as a classic underwater adventure. Rating: ***** out of 5.",The Abyss
72,KnightsofNi11,Incredible amounts of fun and technical innovation,7,15 July 2011,"James Cameron might not make perfect films but he is certainly one dedicated filmmaker. The Abyss was one of his most demanding projects, shooting 99% of the film actually underwater with giant sets, no stunt men, and diving equipment galore. The film is about a group of blue collar oil rig workers who are called to clear the wreckage of a crashed nuclear submarine. The cause of the subs crash is unknown, but it soon becomes clear that there are some sort of extraterrestrial forces at work that the crew must face, along with US versus Russia pressure and a crazed and paranoid captain. The Abyss is a fun filled adventure flick that is more of an impressive technical feat than anything else. James Cameron was a revolutionary filmmaker long before Avatar, and if you don't believe me watch The Abyss.This film really is quite the spectacle. The sets are very impressive and the vastness of their underwater setting is breathtaking. There is some great movie magic going on in making the film look as much like it is in the ocean as possible. The special effects are also incredibly impressive for 1989. A long floating tube of water moving around submarine hallways might not sound impressive but it is when you consider how hard water is to animate and just how limited the technology was for this sort of thing back in 1989. Then of course there is the design of the actual aliens, which isn't incredible but it is pretty. There is a wide shot of their underwater spaceship lit up in beautifully colored patterns and that truly is immaculate.But what's not so immaculate are the script and story. There's nothing really wrong with it, it just isn't all tied together as well as it could be. It is easy to become confused as to what is going on in certain scenes and why the characters are having to do what they are doing. Character motivations are often not fully fleshed out, especially towards the end when we have to just sort of accept that they are doing what they are doing. I felt like some scenes were in the film just so that the technical innovations could be utilized as much as possible. It's not always clear what is going on, but it always looks cool. I commend Cameron for trying his best to explain all the science of the film, even though parts of it are a a bit of a stretch. There are things like the diving suit that allows a human to dive incredibly deep. The science behind this is never really explained so we sort of just have to take it for granted. It's not a frustrating issue, but it's there and you can't ignore it.Bottom line is that The Abyss is a very fun movie. I watched the three hour special edition of the film and not once did I get terribly bored. It gets slow at times but always picks back up with some new intense action sequence. This is a far from perfect film with some pretty obvious flaws. It doesn't help that it has a very Hollywood cheesy ending, but the ending takes place on a great set piece that is quite impressive to look at. And that's where this film succeeds. Great technical innovation helps it to be a memorable film that I wouldn't be totally against watching again sometime down the road. I also suggest reading the IMDb trivia section on the film because you will learn things that make the film all the more enjoyable. The Abyss is a film full of excitement and fun and, despite some flaws, is really a great movie.",The Abyss
73,Bob-45,THE GREATEST SCI-FI FILM EVER MADE!!!,10,14 July 1999,"I am referring to the Special Edition.  The theatrically released version was only slightly better than mediocre.  The studio made Jim Cameron cut over one half hour from his final cut, and this nearly makes the final third of the film unwatchable.  As great drama requires, this film has a theme. Its theme is separation.  THE ABYSS refers as much to the relationship between the characters played by Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as it does to the huge trench which is the center of the action throughout the last half of the film.  THE ABYSS also refers to the us vs. them mentality of world conflict, which is a major point in the Special Edition.",The Abyss
74,Angry_Arguer,"Lacking testosterone, well built-up characters (spoilers)",10,18 August 2002,"James (""I'm the king of the world"") Cameron has definitely made his mark as a financial director with mega-hits Terminator 2 and Titanic and a serious director with Terminator and Aliens--if you can call that serious. The Abyss is a really different film since it maintains suspense throughout even in some rather tedious parts but very few people are killed--I'm not counting drowning as ""killed"".  Some can say it's a rehash of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  Wrong!  CEot3K was too much a Disney movie in contrast.  This movie is about survival, the unknown, and all other special effects.  The aliens may seem a bit ridiculous but I can say they look better than some mutated prune waving a glowing finger around speaking like a Chipmunk on depressants.",The Abyss
75,sjanders-86430,Mastrantonio ruined this film,2,27 October 2020,Mastrantonio was too strident and that ruined the underwater calm. Also the music was not what I would want under water.

I don't like Spielberg's either or Lucas' films.,The Abyss
76,russem31,Grand,8,20 December 2005,"The Abyss is a grand epic of a movie from movie making genius James Cameron. Though this isn't Cameron's best (I would say Titanic and Aliens are his best) it definitely isn't his worst. The main problem with this film is its length - it clocks in at 146 minutes (and a whopping 171 minutes for the special edition!) which makes it hard to watch without at least one bathroom break. I very much enjoyed the performances by the superb actors Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, whose character interactions are quite heartfelt especially near the end. And talking about the ending, it's one of the best climaxes I have ever seen (won't give it away but I LOVED it!). And special mention goes to Alan Silvestri for his superb score.

78,RonellSowes,Abyss-mal,2,1 July 2021,"The Abyss is a movie that I think is just as clueless as to what it's about as is any unfortunate viewer. In the beginning it gives you the inclination of a sci-fi alien flick, but the majority of the movie plays out like something very different; until the last few minutes when it returns to those originally placed themes with some visual effects that haven't aged very well.But regardless if it's extraterestial science fiction or an underwater thriller at all times its extremely dull and bound together by some scenes that just trudge around without direction and dramatic moments which are anything but.The Abyss is one of those movies where there's so much wrong that its hardly worth, or possible, listing and all I can add is that it lives up to its title...it is the abyss of filmmaking.",The Abyss
79,kuarinofu,Clearly needs a modern re-make,9,5 January 2020,"I've seen The Abyss a couple of times and each time it amazes me just how technically well done it is, especially if you consider the fact that this movie is OVER 30 YEARS OLD.I've only seen the Special Edition (the way it was meant to be seen in the first place). While it has some flaws like pacing, story focus and the ending (get's just too cheesy at times), I still enjoy it every time I re-watch it.In 2020 some of the effects don't really hold up so well, but it still works cause when you see drowned people - you know they are really there, when you see a rat breathing liquid - it does so. I know that The Abyss was a production hell, mostly because of Cameron's perfectionism at the time. It's sad that today all we get under Cameron's name is some trashy nostalgia cash grabs milking the Terminator franchise.I wish they would come back to this film some time, give it a good budget, get good actors, flesh out the story but keep the environmental and anti-war message. I mean, I'd go and watch that.As it is now, it has worth only to the people who love Cameron's older works and enjoy the technical side of the film. Due to slow pacing and somewhat blurry focus (and quite a run-time if you want to really enjoy the Special Edition) I don't think modern audiences would ever be interested in watching this.But I am, and I hope one day this will get the necessary treatment for a good re-make.",The Abyss
80,AhmedSpielberg99,What a third act!,7,13 August 2019,"What ultimately saves the first hour of the film are the phenomenal and impressive Oscar-winning VFX (they are truly way ahead of there time) and a couple of creative ideas we see every now and then, for I found it lacking the emotional impact, suspense and the interesting characters other Cameron's films are known for. Actually, the first hour is basically a show of Cameron's trademarks and nothing but. Even the plot is incoherent and barely make sense. For all that, I was 100% percent sure there's no way I could like this film.After the first four, The Abyss took a turn for the better. the suspense gradually increased till it reached its peak at the third act. Likewise, with the help of a desirable and palpable chemistry between Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, the characters became more and more interesting. When the film went for the full sentimentality and cheesiness by the end, everything worked for me, and I was thoroughly engrossed. And I think there's no better proof that I cared about the two lead characters by the end than that.P.S. the CPR Scene is one of the most emotionally intense scenes I've seen in a Cameron film, nay, in any film!(7/10)",The Abyss

82,RJBurke1942,The Abyss: where James Cameron finally goes off the deep end...,5,28 October 2006,"This movie started out as a really good thriller. It had all the ingredients: a great cast, a believable story line, fantastic special effects, and brilliant use of editing and post production. When compared with other Cameron successes like Terminator (1984) and Aliens (1986), this ranked with them  until he ruined it all by turning it into a fairy tale.Here's a basic story: a US nuclear sub goes down during war exercises; a navy SEAL team is sent to retrieve information from the sub with the help of a nearby commercial oil rig crew who are in the final phases of testing a new undersea oil platform; the leader of the SEAL team goes wacko thinking that a Russian sub is nearby, trying to get nukes or information (who knows really?) from the downed sub; so, the wacko leader attaches a nuclear bomb to an automatic submersible programmed to detonate near what he thinks is the Russian menace...That's when the fairy tale really starts, although by that time, the poor viewer has already been introduced to it, a bit earlier on. If Cameron had ended the movie when the bad guy gets his just desserts that would have been fine; the movie had been going long enough, anyway.But, no! Then Cameron takes the viewer into la-la land at 16,000 feet below the surface and proceeds to launch a polemic against the state of the world. This then is a lesson for all storytellers and directors on how to turn many viewers off, guaranteed. For the remainder of the movie, there is about as much excitement and thrills as there is at any political convention.I don't mind polemics. I really like good action thrillers. But polemics belong in the documentary genre. Yes, I know the movie is trying to be a metaphor for the abyss of nuclear warfare, but we all know that nuclear war is a no-win situation anyway, already.The only remaining question for me is: why did Cameron deep-six such a good story with such a goofy ending?",The Abyss
83,yenlo,Overall point?,3,1 March 2000,I recall James Cameron doing an underwater interview in his souped up scuba gear about this movie. He said the film had hardware but wasn't about hardware. It had romance but wasn't about romance. It had special effects but wasn't about special effects. It was under the sea but wasn't about being under the sea. Well just what exactly was this picture about? I have heard a lot about the Directors Cut being superior to the original release. Plenty of things happen in the story but don't seem to tie in. The ending was really whacked out and served absolutely no purpose.,The Abyss
84,roedyg,"The best of movies, the worst of movies",7,6 April 2006,"The first hour of this movie is one of the most boring movies ever made. It is a basically an instruction manual on the dangers of underwater construction, complete with laconic military males barking orders, some obligatory fires, and lot of water, sort of like endless Titanic retakes. I could not for the life of me figure out where I was or what was happening, and I did not care. The only character I cared lived or died was a pet rat. ""Full of sound and fury signifying nothing..."" The special effects water creature is legendary, and that sequence is utterly magical. Those few seconds alone makes the movie worthwhile.The psychotic Lt. Coffee and his Dr. Strangelove need to set off a nuke, really turn up the emotional volume. At that point, you begin to know the characters and care about them.Then the movie takes a 180 degree turn and becomes about emotion, love, the survival of our species, in long heart-wrenchingly emotional scenes that were so intense I had to take a break, reminiscent of Leonard di Caprio's death in Titanic (another James Cameron film). The tail end of the movie reminded me a bit of Stanley Kubrick's 2010 with its quasi-religious awe, though I burst out laughing at the Atlantean city that seemed to be modeled on Euro bathroom fixtures.This movie handles alien intelligence exceptionally well. They are properly mysterious and awe-inspiring, not just silly drooling monsters or cutesy muppets.The extended version was almost 3 hours long, a grueling experience.",The Abyss

I absolutely love the idea of another species of intelligent life living on earth, but living in a place where we couldn't have previously seen them or noticed them...in the depths of the ocean.It's truly hard to believe that this film was made way back in 1989, because it looks so crisp and clear and looks better than a some movies released today.The cast in just superb across the board.  Ed Harris pulls off one of his best performances and probably my favorite.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also pulls of one of her better performances.  Michael Biehn plays his part very well in his third outing with director James Cameron, I guess there's a reason Jim keeps using him in his films.  The only other cast members that I recognize from other films are Kimberly Scott (in her first role ever and doing an extraordinary job), Chris Elliot (very odd to see him in a non-comedic role, but it was cool to see him nonetheless), and Ken Jenkins (of TV's ""Scubs"").  Despite the cast being relatively unfamiliar faces, they all did a fantastic job and deserve a great deal of credit for their work.I have to talk about the special effects in the film.  They are nothing less than spectacular.  Some of the blue screen effects are a little off, but I certainly won't hold that against the makers, everything else is just PERFECT!I would definitely recommend this film to everyone.  There is so much good stuff in this film, and I think it appeals to a wide variety of people. It's got sci-fi, action, suspense, romance, comedy, ...everything!

While it is certainly a great idea to set the film almost entirely under water, which means claustrophobic scenes, I just don't think the pace picked up enough to make it a really good movie. And the ending, I don't even want to think about it, it just gets too ridiculous.

The acting is nothing short of intense, especially from the three leads, they deserve awards galore for some of the harrowing scenes they went through, and they produced sheer magic.

92,pfgpowell-1,Of its kind the de luxe model - Cameron pulls it off,7,13 August 2010,"I've said it before, I'll most certainly say it again and I'm saying it now: there are some films which, for whatever reason it might be, you simply do not like, so even the smallest flaw will irritate the hell out of you. And there are some films which despite their tics and oddities just win you over and which you are prepared to forgive almost anything. The Abyss is one such film: there is much about it, not least the science, which has you suspending your disbelief almost to breaking point. But - well, you can't help but like it. Or at least this viewer can't help but like it. Perhaps it is Ed Harris as the boss of the underwater rig who is not only likable but believable; perhaps it is James Cameron's intelligent use of remarkable special effects which serve the film rather than, as all too often, demand that the film serve them and which, at the end of the day, seem to be a particular kind of film's raison d'etre. The Day After Tomorrow would be a case in point; perhaps it is the very touching and credible romance between Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, an estranged couple who find that at the end of the day they simply love each other too much to split up (which makes a welcome change from the usual stereotypical mush Hollywood likes to serve up); or perhaps it is simply Cameron's achievement of filming underwater and managing to persuade us that it is not all taking place in some multi-million gallon tank somewhere in Arizona. Actually, I'm not in the mood to analyse: I simply liked and enjoyed the Abyss. The plot in which a Navy seal loses his marbles and heads off to detonate a nuclear weapon underwater is barely credible. And however intriguing the 'underwater civilisation' is, it, too, does not bear close scrutiny. (Who built the city? Who are they? How do they exist? Etc, etc - just don't go there). Harris's team underwater is populated by the usual suspects of lovable quasi misfits, all with a heart of gold, and there is much about The Abyss which could, in lesser hands, have seemed like filming by numbers. But Cameron has the knack and pulls it off. I saw the extended DVD edition which spends more time on the civilisation than the theatrical release which Cameron cut and in which he focused more on the Harris/Mastrantonio love story, but either way there are worse ways of spending your time. It ain't great film-making, but of its kind it is the de luxe model.",The Abyss
93,manuel-pestalozzi,A movie with depth,7,23 March 2006,"I found this movie a pleasant surprise. I am not much into the disaster genre, but high sea adventures offer many possibilities for script and direction. I also consider The Poseidon Adventure one of the more successful movies of the genre. There the motto is up to the bottom"", here it's down into the bottomless depth"".The abyss is much inspired by Stanley Kubrick's 2010. But it is really more than a ripoff, with a simple, formulaic but coherent and credible story. The main character, a diver dwelling in middle depths, descends further down into darkness on a rescue mission. His loneliness and his border experience"" give occasion to a very poetic sequence which is handled perfectly by the movie crew. And somehow deep sea pictures grip me much more than space flicks. They are just in the water, right? I know water. Everybody knows water. Gives it a sort of intimacy. There also is a cranky, creaky low tech angle to the whole setting of the movie that is very endearing.But what really lifts The Abyss above the average fair is the choice of actors. Ed Harris is just perfect for those he man roles where the hero has to suffer a lot. Very unusual is the female lead: She is actually the boss of the crew, not least of her own husband, played by Harris. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio exudes competence, authority and warmth in this difficult role which only makes you wonder, why this excellent and versatile actress isn't in more movies. The chemistry between her and Harris is excellent. Nice detail: early on Harris decides to gets rid of his wedding ring, has a change of heart and reaches deep"" for the first time.Don't watch the Abyss while having a bad cold or if you suffer from claustrophobia.",The Abyss

So I decided to give The Abyss a try. I was not at all let down.The special effects were some of the best I have ever seen. Everything was so vivid. Not to mention a lot of equipment used was hi-tech and almost sci-fi quality.The acting was perfect. Best performances were by Ed Harris and Michael Biehn on 2 opposite sides. All other roles seemed to be played by small-time actors but they all gave such good performances that you could never tell.I read in the trivia about how difficult this movie was on cast and crew alike, and I respect the actors and crew for their hard work and determination in making sure this movie was done right.Over all a great movie. Sci-fi fans will love this one.10/10.",The Abyss
95,charchuk,Too many subplots,8,17 April 2007,"Watching the special edition, the story's even more of a mess. There's an added ending with giant waves that, while looking cool, adds another subplot into a movie chock full of them. At nearly three hours long, it gets to be a bit much. The original version has the same problems, though. There's a love story, a disaster flick, an alien contact film, and an anti-Cold War message all trying to get out of this movie, and none of them mesh together very well. The visuals are very impressive, but also just seem to be attempting to mimic Close Encounters - underwater. Ed Harris is overacting a bit, but nothing compared to Michael Biehn, who finds the scenery so damn tasty. Still, it's well-made, and the scene with the water arm is classic.",The Abyss
96,kdnor2011,"Would be great, except for one little problem",7,17 August 2011,"Jame's Cameron's the Abyss is often regarded as one of his best movies. Well, I don't know about that, I certainly wouldn't call it bad, but for me, there isn't that much special about it, or much that gives it much rewatch value.Usually James Cameron uses a cliché premise to tell his story, but adds fun and likable characters. This movie is the opposite, sort of, the plot is better while the characters are really forgettable. I remember four of these characters, the lead male, the lead female, the black chick, and the guy with the rat. I don't get the villains motivation. But probably my biggest problem is that the movie can be very boring. It's very slow, especially in the beginning, and then it just doesn't know when to end. I swear it ends like five times, or should I say, climaxes, each time gets more tedious. And also, this may just be me, but the movie came out in 1989, I know the Cold War didn't officially end until 1991, but wasn't tense relations between the Soviets and the U.S. pretty much done by 1989. And no, sorry, but she would not be able to live after staying underwater that long.The mystery and plot is what makes the movie watchable. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty much a mix between Alien and Micheal Crichton's ""Sphere."" But it's interesting enough to keep you watching. The direction and special effects are great for the most part, but this is James Cameron, so who would be surprised. It has some great action scenes, the best being when the crane falls. And some great moments of atmosphere, including when that rope of water comes in. And it's pretty funny.Basically when stuff starts happening, it gets interesting, but a lot of the characters are forgettable, and it's pacing is all over the place. I know a lot of people love it, but this isn't one I tend to rewatch a lot.6.5/10",The Abyss
97,Rammstein-2,A true Cameron epic,8,11 January 2000,"Oil diggers planted on the ocean floor recieve a mission to explore some strange phenomenon under water. In the cramped confines of the underwater oilrig, psyches fall apart and strange things start to happen. Beautiful, esoteric and quite special is this Cameron epic, with man's encounter with the unknown in its epicenter, and with a climax sending shivers along the spine. The director's cut version is preferred, though, since it doesn't end so definitely and revealingly.",The Abyss
98,W011y4m5,"Very, VERY cheesy.",7,3 April 2019,"The Abyss is more of a technical achievement than a great film with the filmmaking being far more impressive than the actual film itself.
Cameron obviously had a multitude of ideas when writing the script but never coherently pieced them together to form a tonally consistent or satisfying movie & thus, for the majority of the runtime, we're watching a claustrophobic thriller about survival set underwater with only brief sci-fi elements featuring fleetingly throughout... Only for the third act to dramatically transform into an overwhelmingly bombastic, over-the-top, cheesy science-fiction spectacular with a message to viewing audiences which has all the subtlety of a whack to the head from a metal plated sledgehammer, whilst also managing to be an ode to 2001: A Space Odyssey & Spielberg. Felt as though I was suffering from physical concussion by the time the end credits rolled.
Other films from James Cameron are considered masterpieces due to their timelessness - even after decades, they still irrefutably remain classic - yet unfortunately for The Abyss, it hasn't aged so well; it's very dated & very very 80s.",The Abyss
99,DeBBss,"Great Concept, but Barely Used",6,31 May 2020,"The Abyss had an exciting first act, but a disappointing second and third act. I love the concept, but it was barely used in the film. I suppose The Abyss focuses mainly on how the characters are surviving their circumstances and how they react to the alien specie.I love the plot, but the pacing somewhat killed the movie. The pacing was extremely slow, and since we rarely see the aliens, we completely forget about the aliens. I had to remind myself several times why they were doing everything that they were doing. There should have been more alien encounters because they were really amazing, but I'm assuming that they didn't have the resources to make more alien scenes. By far the best part about the movie was the last 20 minutes. In those 20 minutes, it was intense and we finally got to see the aliens properly. If the movie just focused a little more on the aliens, then it would've been great.The acting was solid and the characters were fairly likable. The issue I have is with the antagonist, Lt. Coffey, played by Michael Biehn. The antagonist's motives were justified because he was going through decompression sickness. But it's pretty lame that all of his intentions were because of psychosis. The villain was needed for the plot to continue, so it was necessary for an antagonist, but couldn't have James Cameron create a more interesting bad guy. One solid aspect of the characters was the great character development. James Cameron is a legend at writing good character development, and in The Abyss, it's really well written.James Cameron is great at special effects, and in The Abyss, it's perfectly done too. All of the underwater scenes were great and the aliens were awesome to look at. I also really liked the blue color palette that James Cameron uses in almost all of his movies. Lastly, the soundtrack was really good. There's one specific song that is really eerie sounding, which helps build the mood of the film.I had high hopes for The Abyss, but there were a lot of flaws with the screenplay. There should have been more scenes where the characters encounter the aliens. At times the plot gets forgotten because of how long the film focuses on subplots for too long. The characters were well acted and there was great character development, but the antagonist was terrible. The Abyss isn't bad, it's definitely worth a watch, but it's a little overrated.",The Abyss
100,jwscott-home,It was great for its time... A comment on the Academy,8,18 September 2021,"I want use this to say Ed Harris must be the most underrated actor of all time. He's been in so many blockbusters and played so many enigmatic and big great roles so much more so than most Academy Award winners...He's never won an academy award and good grief he deserved one. But the wannabe artistic liberal little heterosexuals and the goofy gays on the academy board just don't like guys like him... take some time to look at his list of movie and others like him. Look how long it took them to give the absolute best actor in the last 75 years an Academy Award... Leonardo... I mean good grief he should have at least 4 on his shelf. The Academy is such a joke at times. They give the award to such newbies at times who've had no prior experience like Vikander, now she was great but was she better than the portfolio of Harris or DiCaprio... no I think not. And was the movie Leo got the award for his best? Hell no, my god crawling through the snow and all that crap it was likely his worst movie ever... he's played several characters that were far better and at a minimum he should have 4-5 AAwards. What a fricking joke. And I think everybody knows what freaks there are that sit on that board. More deserving artists haven't won than have won. It's incredible it truly is. If your a tough rough guy like Harris, no you'll never win an award without first doing a fancy fart musical. Same with femal fatales.. you'll never win an AA as a female for playing any butch tough roles... only period pieces which undermine women's real ability and place in the current world. When are we going to stop giving the Academy so much credit? It's absurd and everybody knows it except the Academy and the idiots who continue to show up to the awards.Not that musicals and the like aren't good it's just you shouldn't have to play roles that suit the Hollywood liberals to win an academy award. I've been a voting liberal for 50 yrs but I just don't go that far to the left as the academy does. An incredible actor. Truly. Great career Mr Harris!!! And many many others deserving as well who've been overlooked on purpose.Seriously, change the personality of the Academy, my god, what a bunch of prissy ass prudish freaks. Time to bring the Academy into the 21st century. There shouldn't be a single soul on it older than 50 years old. That's the main problem is that the Academy is always 2 decades behind in its members and they never 'get' current artists' Please do us all a favor and totally change the make up of these archaic old fools who make up the board!!!

101,jmbwithcats,Amazingly Difficult but Brilliant,9,6 September 2019,"The Abyss may be a blatant reimagining of The Day The Earth Stood Still, but it's a damn good one and one of the most difficult films to make, but it's an amazingly underrated movie, and it's all heart.",The Abyss
102,mnpollio,"Has its moments, but misses the mark",6,5 October 2009,"I am usually always impressed by director James Cameron's scope and vision in film crafting and after the successes of The Terminator and Aliens, it was intriguing to imagine what he could come up with at the bottom of the deep blue sea. Sadly, The Abyss fails to live up to its potential and feels like a short-changed project. The technical aspects of the film, barring some notable exceptions that I will address shortly, are first-rate. The film actually falls apart in the story-telling, which has actually been one of Cameron's strong points in his other films. Set on the ocean floor next to a rather intimidating ""bottomless"" drop (aka abyss) it opens with a joint effort between a marine mining crew and Navy SEALs to investigate the cause of a downed nuclear submarine. The film convinces the audience right off that extra-terrestrials are at work, although their motives are unclear. Unfortunately, Cameron's storyline is unfocused and pulled in myriad directions, and suffers from the lack of a worthy adversary to pull in the audience. The crew become trapped by a hurricane above, the head of the Navy SEALs (Michael Biehn) develops a pressure syndrome that makes him paranoid and dangerous, there is a ticking nuke, estranged married couple Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio alternately bark and flirt with each other, and periodically the aliens emerge for a special effects show to let us know they are still around in an often forgotten subplot. Harris is adequate in the stoic dull hero role and Biehn gets to go all bug-eyed as the increasingly psycho soldier. One has to credit Cameron for crafting another tough female role, but Mastrantonio is often more shrill than involving, and a sacrifice that she makes later in the film fails to have the impact it should because of her frosty quality. Unlike in his earlier films, Cameron also tosses logic to the winds whenever inconvenient here, with characters venturing out sans protective gear onto the ocean floor without being done in by the pressure - and then having pressure play a role when he wants it to. The film also has pacing problems with too much technical babble and too few moments of high tension. The conclusion with Harris' descent into the abyss and the realm of the alien critters ultimately degenerates into a fiasco - with cutesy E.T.-like beings saving his bacon. When their ship miraculously takes everyone safely to the surface without pressurizing them, it looks suspiciously like Cameron's budget ran out and a huge piece of foam rubber with some splotches of psychedelic color passes for the ship, while the story seems to forget to provide the aliens with any raison d'etre. Who were they? Why were they here? What was their point? Who can say, since none of those questions are answered in Cameron's cinematic cut of the film (truthfully the extended version Cameron later provided is not that much better since the aliens appear to have snagged the same motivation as the beings from 2010). What we are left with is a promising misfire filled with some striking moments that ultimately go no where.",The Abyss
103,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Really great one,7,17 June 2008,"Meticulously crafted but also ponderous and predictable, James Cameron's 1989 deep-sea close-encounter epic reaffirms one of the oldest first principles of cinema: everything moves a lot more slowly underwater. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as formerly married petroleum engineers who still have some ""issues"" to work out, are drafted to assist a Hung-ho Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) with a top-secret recovery operation: a nuclear sub has been ambushed and sunk, under mysterious circumstances, in some of the deepest waters on earth, and the petri-teaches have the only submersible craft capable of diving down that far. Every image and every performance is painstakingly sharp and detailed (and the computerized water creatures are lovely) but the movie's lumbering pace is ultimately lethal. It's the audience that ends up feeling waterlogged. For a guy who likes guns as much as Cameron (his next film after all, was the body-count masterpiece Terminator 2: Judgment Day), it's interesting that the moral balance here is weighted heavily in favor of the can-do engineers; the military types are end-justifies-the-means moralists, just like the weaselly government bureaucrats in Aliens.",The Abyss
104,flicklover,One of James Cameron's near masterpieces,9,9 May 2020,"The Abyss is a movie that I watch every year or two and I always say just about the same thing. It is mostly so good that it is angering that it misses being a full on masterpiece because of a storyline that belonged in a different movie.The movie takes place in a deep water oil rig run by Bud, played by Ed Harris. A nuclear submarine sinks unexpectedly in the Caribbean and the Navy asks the oil rig company for assistance in diving to the wreck and search for survivors. Bud's estranged wife Lindsey played beautifully by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as the designer of the oil rig. She descends to the rogue along with a team of Navy SEALS commanded by Coffey, played by Michael Biehn. The workers on the rig are played well by the cast and make up a tight knit group. The center of the movie is the love/hate dynamic between Bud and Linsdey. They are both very stubborn people who love each other but just don't get along. The SEALS take the Bud and his team to the submarine to supposedly look for survivors. The dive becomes dangerous when one of the oil riggers sees a bright light and panics. The unexpectplained light is assumed to be a Russian weapon of some kind by Coffey, who is now suffering from high pressure nervous syndrome and tells his superiors that he thinks the unexplained phenomenon is the enemy. The go back to the sub to retrieve a nuclear warhead and arm it to destroy the supposed threat. The movievtgen goes from a really great, intense undersea action movie to a science fiction fantasy. The things that are appearing are extra terrestrials. One of them is seen by Lindsay. No one believes her until what seems to be a surveillance device appears and moves around the rig. Of course, Coffey is now psychotic and determined to set off the warhead. The movie then becomes a sort of Close Encounters story with the Bud, Lindsey and the oil team fighting Coffey before he sets of the nuke. In classic Cameron style this movie to this day is visually stunning. It was a groundbreaking use of CGI in 1989 when it came out. The effects still hold up, the extra terrestrials and their ships are beautifully realized. The action is as good as anything James Cameron has ever done. The problem is the final act. The movie is so good for so long and builds to an ending that should be awe inspiring but it really isn't. The main performances are so good and we care about these characters and what they're going through that the ending just doesn't pay off the way it should. James Cameron borrows from Spielberg here and it just doesn't have the impact it should. He also uses this movie to bring in an obvious but not very effective environmental message.As good as the special effects are, the human element is much more involving. Imagine that? Most of the time in Hollywood blockbusters, especially these days it's the other way around.This movie is really good, in fact great at times. It needed a better ending.Grade: A-",The Abyss

106,jose-cruz53,"Good film from Cameron, still the weakest among his classics",6,29 September 2012,"The Abyss is a 1989 science fiction film, which can be characterized as an well made typical Hollywood blockbuster. If we could classify by genre, it would be a film in the underwater Alien encounter genre. It has many typical elements of a James Cameron film, such as a fairly cartoonish set of main and secondary characters and a typical love story.The film is the set in the ""present day"" (late 1980′s) when a nuclear submarine is intercepted and sunk by an unknown underwater object. A team of hard working divers is sent to investigate. Cameron said that he had the idea of the film's story since he was in high school, which was a story of a group of scientists working in a underwater laboratory. He changed to a group of commercial blue collar diving workers to increase the film's commercial appeal. This group of divers eventually discovers that it was a non-human intelligent lifeform that caused the accident.The special effects were the best in the world at the time the film was made, in the 1989, and they are among the main attraction of the film. The characters are also interesting, though they are a bit simple.",The Abyss

108,Quebec_Dragon,"Ambitious and ""deep"" undersea adventure",8,30 June 2009,"This review is for the special edition of Abyss that adds 28 minutes of footage especially near the end according to Wikipedia. I had seen it many years ago but although I remembered it was underwater and had a particularly cool and original creature, I didn't remember much else from it. After watching it again recently, I wonder why. This is one of the best undersea adventures I've seen, certainly the most ambitious. This was made before computer effects became so prevalent so most of the action underwater is actually shot underwater on sets and in diving suits. State-of-the-art computer effects (at the time) are used to portray most of the strange deep-sea creatures and they still look great today. The Abyss starts as the rescue operation of a nuclear submarine but veers more into good first encounter science-fiction as it goes along.What struck me was the great underwater setting that at times made you feel claustrophobic and isolated as if you were deep underwater yourself. It's not the most action-packed film and it can feel slow at times so try to be relatively awake before watching it. The first half sometimes somehow made me feel contemplative and relaxed but it might bore some people. You should be warned that most of the film takes place in a relatively confined location so there's no undersea exploration a la Cousteau per say. It's also a character-driven conflict between reason and open-mindedness (the rig crew) VS ignorance and destructive impulses (the military). As it went along, my appreciation of the film went from only good to remarkable. There are strong suspenseful and dramatic character moments extremely well played by Ed Harris (rig captain), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (creator of the rig and future ex-wife of the rig captain) and Michael Biehn (leader of the navy seals). I particularly liked the shuttle scene between the captain and his future ex-wife. Because of the creatures, there's also a feeling of mystery and sense of wonder at the unknown which is rarely seen in modern sci-fi but that I often enjoy. The characters are not the type to shoot first and ask questions later which I found refreshing.What I also found noticeable is that there are several ""false"" endings, as in it might stop there but it doesn't, going further into the ""abyss"" as it were. This is a great humanistic and human sci-fi flick that gets better as it goes along. It's closer to 2001 than Aliens but it's not really like either one. The extra footage in the ending makes for a more satisfying conclusion that helps things make sense. However, your appreciation might vary on how cynical you are, I can see it ruining the film for a minority. In my opinion, it's worth owning but be careful of which DVD version you pick, the ""special editions"" don't necessarily have a second disc with the extras and the covers don't tell you how many discs there are (you want the 2-disc version).Rating: 8 out of 10",The Abyss
109,TheCorniestLemur,That cruise is looking less appealing now,7,27 March 2021,"Apparently it's very important that I mention I watched the theatrical cut of this, and if any of you would like to give me sass for that, go have a look for the special edition yourself and please come back with chocolate and apologies.I haven't seen anything James Cameron's done probably since I was just over five feet tall, and considering that, just from this, I think he's a pretty good director. If not a great one. Good because christ almighty can he really make you feel the oppressive weight and darkness of the bottom of the ocean, but not so great because I didn't really care about anything happening until about an hour in.After that though, I was really into it. It's just that the characters don't have enough going for them to make the first hour all that interesting, even if it is well directed. If I'm completely honest, they don't really have enough going for them to be interesting in the rest of the film either, but by then I was much more interested in where the story was going.And after that point, I loved pretty much everything about it. The cinematography is great, the atmosphere is thick as hell, all the performances are great, I appreciate the metaphors even if they are a bit obvious, and holy wow are the effects impressive, especially for the time.And I don't often mention this specifically, but goddamn this is a well lit film.

110,fimimix,..a likable fairytale..,10,27 June 2006,"Right off, I want to say I have not seen the ""director's cut"", nor am I a sci-fi fan.....unless they blend believable, everyday plots. All those fantastic monsters and special effects have no appeal to me. I am way past the ""video-game"" generation. I do not expect certain directors-actors-actresses to deliver something similar to works they have done in the past.....give me a story I can relate to with good performances. ""The Abyss"" gave us the sinking of an atomic sub; some extra-terrestials who sank it; oil-companies' ships in a storm; the beneath-surface oil-crew; the perils of working underwater; and how the ""rescuers"" survived. That's a pretty plot !I have no idea what those commentators who disliked this movie were expecting - I just wanted to be entertained, watching an under-water story, although I don't risk going into the ocean over my ankles. It was all very believable to me - especially learning those dangerous stunts were actually performed by the cast makes the story even better, in retrospect. I'll watch, not join-in.......The entire cast did a remarkable job, except I thought Michael Biehn really was just a trifle too frenetic in his role - the first glance of him told you he was the ""heavy"". Ed Harris was his usual, handsome self, delivering convincing acting - although I did wonder why he did all his swimming in tight jeans, when the fat guy was in his drawers. Use your imagination, ladies ! Mary Elizabath Mastrantonio was great - and, BTW, HAS made several very good films since then. James Cameron got it all together - yes, I think the high-tech stuff was right for today, having no idea the film was so old.And now we come to the ""fairytale"" - The ""water""-babies were perfect. Wouldn't you want to believe there are more intelligent beings in our universe - who occasionally visit us - than we mere mortals are? How could you like ""ET"" and not like the ""water""-babies - looked pretty similar to me ! They can help me with my troubles any time - I loved the ending of this movie: lovers reconciled and giving us hope extra-terrestials aren't all out to ""get us"". Although they destroyed the atomic sub and caused the deaths of the men on it, those warheads weren't there by accident. If THEY could control the oceans..........then maybe some that can stop earthquakes will give us a visit at a very opportune time......what a shame they weren't in ""the abyss"" to prevent the Indonesian tsunami...... loved this fairytale.",The Abyss
111,Gubby-Allen,Not bad.(Not good but not bad either).,5,15 October 2003,"A pretty average film. Great is patches, poor to mediocre in others. Compliments all round on the visuals & some stunning cinematography. The main problem I had was the same problem I have with all submarine films. Nobody ever gets on with each other. It's as if a job on a submarine is the natural route for any miserable, argumentative sod & everyone with a gripe against the world. Sadly all the other cliches that come with 'Saving the World' films are here including the Crown turd of them all - 'The Pointless romance with an unnecessary & over emphasized previous history'. What made this one worse was that I never knew exactly what hat the female lead was wearing. She started as some super bitch who struck fear into all men & ended up like Dale Winton, as far opposite from that as you could get. The version I watched wasn't far off three hours, & though I kept interested through 75% of it there were times I lost the will to live & consequently couldn't keep up with exactly what the Biehn character was up to, partly through lack of interest.

114,pkzeewiz,too long and too much hype - kinda sucked!,3,29 April 2010,"When a submarine is mysteriously destroyed the U.S. hire excavators to go down and investigate and also on a secret mission they are to remove a missile head to prevent the Russians from getting it. While under water the military tries to take control but the rigger captain is not gonna let him. They investigate the sub and its all a mystery until they soon realize that they are not alone under water and ultimately find a whole alien race living in the deepest regions of the abyss.I had watched this a couple times and all I had remembered was the long snake like figure made entirely of water. I must admit, the movie isn't exciting. It has beautiful scenes but story wise it was just slow and painfully boring...Hollywood hype.Cameron has made a few good movies, but I think of him as one of those directors that has so much money and such a big budget that the heart and talent is gone from his direction, his crew of C.G.I. artists, cinematographers and editors are where the talent is. None the less he did have some beautiful shots here. Silvestri's music was horrible, way too over the top and dramatic and also lacking heart. I want the music to be present, but never too obvious, It is background and should accompany the scene and not be a part of it. Acting wise I liked a lot of the actors here. Ed Harris isn't great, but hes mediocre enough to work. Michael Biehn did a great job here he can do so many different styles and here he does a wonderful jerk. I also though Todd Graff really shined.The aliens were a bit too cute for my liking and it sucks too that the movie didn't feature them much. All of the action, what little there was, was done by the humans. There was a beautiful message about people killing people and how humans were destroying each other, a beautiful touch with the waves making people stop and think for a minute. I hated the cheesy ending and how things all turned out nice and perfect - happy ending usually ruin movies for me, there needs to be some major casualties and some mystery at the end. I didn't like it but I give it 3/10 stars. Avoid the DVD extended special edition its way too long.",The Abyss
115,PetarNeo,Are we alone?,8,12 May 2020,"James Cameron's movie flick Abyss is exploration of sea dept's in the most unexpected ways. After US submarine crashes under sea, team of oil diggers is sent on a rescue mission along side couple military guys.First of all production design is absolutely great and filming looks incredible, combined with some pretty solid visual effects, really creates atmosphere of the dept and vastness of the sea along side with claustrophobia that runs in the halls of the rig. Feeling trapped under the sea looks horrendous and feels also, but somehow with decent dialogue it makes you think about other things while crew begins to separate in opinions and visions.Idea of something living in the dept's of the oceans, seas is the most mysterious because humans rarely have courage to go deep and have equipment that will allow them. It is enough for anybody to get excited of new and fresh look into deeps but after two hours it really starts to feel heavy, sometimes too long and some of the craziest thing that you will see that might not be realistic in any way but had to be done for the story and sacrificed possible effort that went into making this good film.Ending goes from heartwarming to tense moments and what might seem like hopeless, but eventually turns in the kind and loving way. 3/4",The Abyss
116,Mr_Censored,Treading water.,6,10 June 2009,"""How many drugs was James Cameron on when he wrote and filmed this thing?!"" – One of the many thoughts running through my head during the two and half hours ""The Abyss"" fills up.An oil rig crew is sent to the depths of the ocean in hopes of recovering a sunken nuclear submarine. Led by Bud (Ed Harris), the crew makes a grisly discovery about the fate of the sub and meets friction with a group of Navy SEALs, led by the psychotic Coffey (Michael Biehn). Thousands of feet below the surface, a mysterious alien force is discovered, although their intentions are unknown. At the very least, we know the Russians aren't on the attack. That's about all that is really made clear in this movie.When it isn't busy drowning itself in character clichés and predictability, ""The Abyss"" uses most of its effort to force us into believing the impossible. This is all well and good, seeing as how even James Cameron himself acknowledges this film as purely fantasy, but little things like the previously drowned coming back to life in a schmaltzy scene and the comatose awakening to save the day tend to stick out like sore thumbs. Cameron, well-adept at both film-making and screen-writing at this point, could have and should have known better. Unlike ""The Terminator,"" this film fails to make its characters believable despite an implausible situation, and on the other side of the coin, lacks the intense adventure and horror of ""Aliens."" This could all be forgivable, though, if the film had a solid or consistent plot. It's almost like Cameron was suffering from A.D.D. when he made this film, as evidenced by its multiple endings and dead-end subplots.On the upside, the film is, as expected, a stunning visual affair. You also have to admire Cameron's ambition (which would be focused a little better later on with ""Titanic"") in under-going such a ridiculous film-making process, both in the magnitude of its production and in how outlandish its story really is. The film is anchored by Ed Harris, given one of his juicier roles, opposite the tough and endearing Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, whose career has curiously fizzled out since. The Great Michael Biehn shows up with a mustache and helps amp up the energy of the film, despite the fact that his character is disposable in the scheme of things. Truth be told, the film steers close to perfection as far as the actors and the overall direction goes. Yes, there are some dated effects that trap this film in the 80's, but that's not enough to bog things down. The main problem here is that the story seems to have been forsaken for action and razzle-dazzle. Not one of James Cameron's best flicks, but at least worth seeing for the assault on the senses it delivers. ""The Abyss"" is worth sinking into, provided you can forgive its lack of an engaging story.",The Abyss
117,joemamaohio,My Review,8,12 August 2008,"A U.S. nuclear missile submarine mysteriously sinks after coming into contact with some colorful unidentified object. The government enlists the help of expert divers Bud Brigman (Ed Harris) and his estranged wife Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) to take a team of divers to the sub and search for survivors.What they discover far exceeds anything anyone could've imagined. Not only do they have to do battle against the government, who steals one of the nuclear warheads, but they're also subjected to the mysterious lights, as well as survival against a hurricane that is about to strike.James Cameron knows how to develop characters, and the characters of Bud and Lindsey come across as people you really root for. As for the mysterious lights (also known as Unidentified Submerged Objects), I thought it was a great side-story to the main focus of the film, and overall it's just a joy to watch.",The Abyss
118,smellthecult-com-1,Invaders from the deep,8,18 December 2009,"You know how it is: You're a successful movie director and have recently completed one of the most accomplished sequels in movie history (Aliens) and, in the back of your mind, an idea is forming about another sequel, one with Arnhult, Asta La Vista and GnR warbling over motorcycle sequences. Trouble is, Linda Hamilton isn't available for a few years and Arnhult has prior commitments up to his nutsac. What to do? Well, why not direct an underwater sci-fi spectacular, making use of one of the most expensive and elaborate sets ever designed to whet your appetite for future projects? Eh? Eh? Why not just go and direct The Abyss? Well? Beautifully shot, much admiration must be expelled in the general direction of Cinematographer Mikael Salomon for the visuals which truly captivate, right from the off.The plot: An American nuclear sub' has been lost and it is up to an expedition led by a young looking Ed Harris and the weirdly sexy Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio to seek, locate and extract anything useful, be that people or equipment. A bunch of Navy SEALS are sent along to assist, though they seem to have an agenda all their own whilst, most worryingly, it seems they may not be alone in the depths as something altogether alien stirs.Whilst this is essentially a monster movie, it is a monster movie with a difference. Here, the gribbly-ibblies aren't befanged and hungry for human flesh, instead they are more cerebral, content simply to float around and look beautiful in a vague attempt to make contact, seeming more curious than threatening. At times heart-stoppingly evocative, the film does occasionally delve into mawkish territory, particularly the soap opera-light relationship shared by Harris and Mastrantonio, which is the single reason this did not gain top marks.An excellent, ideas driven sci-fi movie that will, if you have any semblance of humanity in your cold, empty heart leave you simply breathless.",The Abyss

120,ryan_kuhn,"""These guys are about as much fun as a tax audit.""",7,29 April 2005,"The Abyss was a movie of destiny. First off, this movie either began or was the result of a lifetime obsession James Cameron has the ocean (see later Titanic and his IMAX deep sea movies). The Abyss is also full of echos of claustrophobic thriller/adventure movie Alien, in which Cameron directed the sequel. So combining one of Cameron's old movies with his new obsession, we get The Abyss, a solid sci-fi thriller starring Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Ed Harris plays Bud, the head of an undersea oil rig where very little actually happens and the people on the rig are only there in case something goes wrong. Well, wouldn't you know it, but an American nuclear submarine patrolling the US coast near the oil rig suddenly sinks, killing the sailors on board. The Americans suspect it's the Soviets, but we know better. Something pink and glowing does something to the submarine causing it to sink. A team of Navy seals, ferried down to the rig by Bud's ex-wife Lindsey (Mastrantonio), boards the oil rig and uses it as a command base for their mission to recover the submarine. And that is when the fun begins. Of course a hurricane has to enter into the plot, in movies like this, there is always a hurricane, but beyond, The Abyss is a solid sci-fi thriller, where the oil rig becomes a character in the movie. Much like the Nostromo in Alien or The Discovery in 2001, the tight spaces adds flavor to the movie, bringing the setting in as another character of the movie. The special effects were groundbreaking at the time and hold up well today. The scene of a column of water snaking its way through the oil rig still creeps me out to this day.",The Abyss
121,MamadNobari97,"Well, I'm Kinda Disappointed Not Gonna Lie",6,22 April 2021,"From the photos I saw of this movie and the decent rating, I was expecting an alien maybe horror movie but this is far from different than I expected.It's an underwater movie stretched to 3 hours for some reason and you keep waiting to get to the good stuff but it kinda doesn't satisfy?It takes the film an hour to show something interesting happening and then we see some glimpse of the ""aliens"" and the other 2 and a half hour of the movie is just drama between human characters, which is not bad in itself but it's a long effing movie and you feel like the payoff wasn't satisfying at the end.The direction for the most parts is really good and the cinematography and production is awesome, no doubt in that. The acting especially from Ed Harris is really good. But unfortunately, even though the movie is 3 hours long and like the 97% of it revolves around these characters, you don't really care that much about them. Like I'm glad that Liz survived and the resurrection scene was really good, even though it was long, it was one of the better parts of the movie and Ed Harris nailed that scene and made you actually care about Liz. But I think it would've been a bold move if they just let her die and not come back.I would've even given it a 7 or even an 8 if at the end, the aliens just swept humanity of the face of the earth and ended human race, cause that would've been a cool and logical - from the perspective of the aliens - move and would've made the ending much better, even though the reasoning for their desire to wipe out humans was presented in a really cheesy way and it was more funny than impactful. It was like one of those anti drug PSAs from 90's telling you ""hey you see this apple? Don't smoke ok?""Now about the aliens;
So if I got this right, the aliens were observing the humans to see what they do and when the first submarine went down, they started doing all that so humans won't launch a nuke? But wasn't the reason that SEALs guy wanted to launch it, was that the aliens wrecked that submarine in the first place? Or were they already going to nuke Russia and the aliens tried to stop them? Cause what the movie says is that they had no such intentions and things only got ugly between US and Russia when the submarine was destroyed.And as I mentioned earlier, I would've even give the movie a 7 or more if they wiped the human race, but they didn't.... because of the power of, Love!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?Seriously!? This thing again? Like can't directors come up with something better than ""the power of love saves the universe once again. Then everyone gave an standing ovation.""?!It's so cheesy and it ruined the ending.Bud dying at that cliff at the end of the movie and then rolling the credits wouldn't've even made the movie less satisfying you know why? Because it's two or even three different movies loosely tied together as one movie. You don't even remember about the aliens in this movie cause there's the human parts for the first hour of the movie, then 5 second scene of the alien, again another longer scene with watery alien and then another 2 hours something humans scene and a cheesy 20 minutes of ""we didn't kill you cause u said love ya wifey!""
The movie doesn't really have coherence and balance between the human parts and the extraterrestrial part. It feels like the writers had these idea of two stories and they tried to make it into one and they barely hit the mark.The movie doesn't know if it wants to be an alien movie or a underwater humans movie.And I'm ok with a movie about humans that is 5% alien movie too, as long as you make the humans' story more interesting than this. And it's not fair to say the story of the humans wasn't good, but it wasn't enough and it needed better characterization.And again, I would give a different cut of the movie an 8 if:
1. Liz did actually died.2. Aliens' reasoning for wiping out humanity was presented in a less cheesy way
3. Or they actually wiped out humanity
4. A lot of humans stuff mostly the unnecessary ones were cut from it.All and all, I can't really recommend this movie because you wait 3 hours - and trust me it's a really really long 3 hours - and the payoff isn't that great.",The Abyss
122,axlrhodes,An immense achievement that is unfairly dismissed in many quarters.,9,3 June 2008,"This film almost defines the word epic.James Cameron is a fearless film maker who thinks big and The Abyss is one of his most underrated works.I think the film is a rival to Aliens in as much as it was pioneering,courageous and brilliant.I think the slightly sugary sweet ending may have hurt its appeal but there is no denying the films sheer scale of achievement.Cameron squeezes every ounce of performance out of his actors and takes the camera places most would never dare. His skill and ambition are all on display here and he doesn't disappoint.The subway rescue at the start of the film is a little akin to the marines first landing on LV426 in Aliens but is that a bad thing?The film manages to be suspenseful and thrilling and only a slightly annoying Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio let things slip a little however Michael Biehn and Ed Harris cancel that out.The Abyss is a fine film from a super talented director sitting right on top of his game.For a real undersea adventure, choose The Abyss.",The Abyss

It's no spoiler to say it's mainly shot in underwater scenes, an environment which would make most of us uneasy. It's Ridley Scott at his best, take the alien from outer space and place it in the depths of the ocean. Thing is, the alien is not the star of the show, the setting and characters are. The depths of an ocean trench are as cold and scary as outer space, with an ever present natural threat. Only reason I didn't give it 9 or 10, it's USA film demanding happy ever after, no matter how implausible. But that's a personal gripe, it's a very good film, well worth watching.",The Abyss
124,arthera09,surprisingly good,7,3 June 2007,"I am not sure if the overall rating comes from the extended version or not, but this comment and rating comes from the extended version of the movie. I think this really enhances the movie viewing experience, but it makes the movie considerably longer and a little harder to get through, especially towards the end. But acting was good for the most part and there were a few times when I was not convinced. The bringing of Lyndsy back actually gets to a lot of people, but I was not convinced by Ed Harris there. I do think he did a good job and I liked most of the cast, but a lot of them were played over the top because they were just over the top characters. I think I would have preferred a smaller cast and more time expanding each character, instead of omitting everyone's back ground story. That would have added to some of the emotional aspect of the movie. I liked the ending with the aliens, but there is something that always bugs me with all movies with the same theme. After looking at all the horrible things that humans do they always decide to save humans because of one act of self sacrifice. In all honest I would still end the world after looking at a lot of crap we have done in the past and continue to do everyday. That was always funny to me even as a kid. I liked the atmosphere he gave the movie and some of sets were amazing. Just to think of being underwater for such long periods of time. I have to give full props to all the actors who had to dive and do a lot of it. I do enjoy this movie, but I am not sure how much I would recommend it to people because a lot of people I know cannot get through the 3 hours of it.

125,saarvardi,Young Ed Harris's performance in the film is good enough to bring anyone to tears,10,8 March 2008,"I really think James Cameron's The Abyss is one of the greatest and (sadly) most underrated sci-fi gems out there, miles better than Revenge of the Sith and other, more popular, choices. Young Ed Harris's performance in the film (which was shot and released back in 1989) is good enough to bring anyone to tears. The sci-fi element in what originally seems like a cold-war submarine drama comes as a complete surprise towards the second half of the film, driving it up into one of the biggest, most satisfying, climax sequences I have yet to see on the silver screen. That, and the fact I saw this film at the tender age of nine at the theater and was completely blown away after watching it, turns this baby into a keeper in my book.I recommend anyone who considers himself a science fiction fan to grab hold of the film, watch it breathless, and understand what i'm talking about.",The Abyss

Yes, we all have our soft spots for Star Wars or Star Trek or Forbidden Planet or Close Encounters, but hands-down The Abyss trumps them all.It has all the elements for not only good sci-fi but good drama, suspense and action all in one. Here is but a partial list:Down-to-earth, well-acted characters. An ensemble piece, not single-egotist stars of the day. An interesting, believable, exciting plot line. One of the most amazing and imaginative chase scenes ever created (the submersible chase in the fourth act). Amazing photography and visuals, all set underwater. A creepy villain, expertly played by Michael Biehn. Great visual representation of the aliens. Extreme tension and fear in the various diving scenes.

127,C22Man,Succeeds as a Claustrophobic Thriller,6,9 July 2016,"The Abyss certainly feels like James Cameron's most personal and low-key directorial effort. The big action set-pieces and ahead of their time special effects are still here, yet the story he's trying to tell feels much more human and conscious of its time period. It's his first film to mainly concentrate on humans and have the science fiction elements play more of a side role. On a technical and atmospheric level there is nothing to hold the film back, only Cameron himself does that with some inconsistent plotting and writing which leads to a frequently spectacular but unbalanced film. We follow the workers of an underwater oil rig as they are joined by navy seals and asked to investigate the crash site of a navy submarine and find out what caused it. The rigs designer Lindsey insists on going along despite her estranged husband Bud being the foreman. You can see that this will lead to their personalities clashing and it does which creates an interesting dynamic to the films credit. It's no surprise when we learn that something alien caused the crash, after Lindsey comes face to face with a life form that can manipulate water. This alien story works best when it's shrouded in mystery, yet I really don't like the eventual resolution to it. After a lot of interesting build-up we end on a note that feels straight out of E.T and doesn't fit the films tone at all. The real meat of the story comes when navy seal Coffey steals a warhead from the wreckage. Struck with paranoia he believes that the life form is a Russian spy and turns on the crew when they don't cooperate with his plan to attack it. The tension during these scenes is wonderful. Coffey is the most interesting character and seeing him slowly snap is disturbing in all the right ways. The clashes between him and the crew are always brimming with intensity too. The film is at its best when it lets the claustrophobia of these situations wash over it. The sense of isolation and unease does get appropriately strong, as scenes like the crew trapped as water floods in or racing to stop the warhead being launched are what really suck you in. I actually think that if the film discarded the Sci-Fi elements then it could probably work even better as a straight-up thriller.An area of weakness is in regards to the characters. Most of the crew just don't have much personality because of a lack of development and bland writing. Having characters like Hippy whose trait is being a conspiracy theorist and carrying a rat or Standing whose nickname is One Night (which is the worst excuse for a nickname you'll see) stinks of laziness. Ed Harris is solid as usual and Mastrantonio does a serviceable job, yet its relying on their acting talents to carry bland characters. The only real standout is Michael Biehn who provides a genuinely chilling performance as the paranoid Coffey.With that said Cameron's direction and staging is as impressive as ever. The set itself is simply incredible. Not only does it look gigantic, but it is lit perfectly and gives a real sense of being deep in the ocean. The special effects are impressive and still hold up well, while the in-camera effects still amaze too. I didn't think it was possible to make a fight scene between two mini-subs gripping but they managed to pull it off. There are also a number of sequences that are really deliver the tension necessary. Notably the resuscitation scene which, though a little ludicrous, is almost overwhelmingly intense and superbly acted by Harris. The same goes for Harris attempting to retrieve the warhead, it's heart-pounding in every way you could wish.When The Abyss reaches its conclusion I was relatively satisfied. It is an intelligent and frequently thrilling film based around an interesting idea. The issues arise from when that idea isn't fully realised and the writing gets in its way. When the film concentrates on offering thrills and intensity in a unique environment then it really does engage. Yet all the talk of alien life forms feels out of place in such an oppressive setting and the majority of characters aren't strong enough to really involve the audience for such a long film. In saying that I was never bored or confused by the film, and with a little fine-tuning it could have been something special.",The Abyss

Yet watching The Abyss, I do not stop and feel as if what I'm watching has been ripped off. I just enjoyed every moment of it.The ensemble cast is well written and preformed. And while the script isn't as efficient as The Terminator, it holds some great moments of suspense and human drama lacking in that film.Sure the story ventures into redundancy. Sure there are too many endings. Sure it ventures into deep bellows of high cheese melodrama followed by happy ending nonsense only seen in a Spielberg movie. All these things I do not dispute. But every time Bud gets to typing after disarming the bomb and we see ""..knew this was a one way ticket."" it just gets me every time. And between the theatrical version or the extended cut, I easily prefer the theatrical one. The intimate and claustrophobic story in the theatrical version is a story I vastly prefer.

This time it is aliens underwater that intervene to save the hero capably played by Ed Harris. There is a value placed on marriage when Ed Harris' wedding ring stops a closing door from crushing his hand. Ed Harris' character impresses the Aliens when they play back ""love you...wife"" on a video screen after rescuing him. The character of Michael Biehn has good command presence as a Navy Seal officer. I have trained beside Navy Seals at Cecil Field Naval Air Station in 1997 when I was with the Canadian Forces. Navy Seals are much tougher than the ABYSS portrays them as being. The concept of Aliens living underwater in spaceships is impressive. If they do exist I coined the name for them the CareRankKI. Its like the defensive move in chess where your king keeps going back and forth in the corner forcing a stalemate. The care and rank represent the two squares in the corner and Ki represents the king piece. President Kennedy talked about tossing our hat over the wall of space and now we are forced to retrieve it.

First of all the set design is amazing, I am genuinely amazed how good this movie looks especially for the time it was made. The characters are kind of bland sadly, there is little development as the story focuses on the problems the crew face as a whole. The romantic side of the story is really cliched and sadly ruins the ending a bit. The action scenes are good, again I'm surprised by how good they are. The story does take its time, it doesn't ever lose its pace making it quite consistent but it does make it a bit boring. I also find that the ""aliens"" kinda took me out of the story, I couldn't help laugh when they showed up because of how serious the movie is.

137,rcolgan,Under the Sea,7,2 July 2015,"After creating two of the most instantly recognisable science- fiction films in the 80's (Aliens and Terminator), Cameron ended the decade by embarking on a unique and original project with an underseas setting. Whilst it may not live up to some of his other action masterpieces, The Abyss remains a great adventure through it's focus on suspense and unique underwater environments.Similar to the Terminator films, The Abyss is focused on reflecting Cold War fears of complete annihilation of the human race. It is set in the midst of the cold war and the story of an oil rig crew, searching underwater for a crashed nuclear submarine and investigate the causes of the crash. To do this they must work in harsh conditions with the regular pressures of submarine work, passing hurricanes and the threat of Russians causing increasing pressure and insanity amongst the crew. Whilst on their mission they begin to realise they may not be alone there and encounter a mysterious alien species who seem to be able to control the water around them.Whilst the story is interesting at points, the film is problematic in handling it as the script is constantly trying to push the story in different directions. At times the film is very dark, with one storyline going in to the growing madness and paranoia of one of the Navy SEAL's as he is on the verge of attacking the other crew members. Then at other points it grows very soppy with the aliens friendly presence and the way they're used in the film being more reminiscent of something like ET. Particularly its ending (which I won't spoil here) does go in to gag levels of cheesiness. But whilst the films writing may be scattered at points the visuals never fail to disappoint. Whilst the film is well known for its revolutionary effects in using the first 3 dimensional CG character, what's truly impressive is the films breathtaking underwater setting. James Cameron and the crew spared no expense to create realistic underwater environments, buying a 7 million gallon tank at an abandoned plant and filling it with water. At times this way of filming led to an extremely troubled production including the likes of algae infestation and even lead actor Ed Harris almost drowning, presumably in an attempt to take method acting to the next level. But the results of this are astounding with the lighting and use of colour creating a real sense of how this submarine crew are cut off from the rest of the world. Its style is also a nice step away from the usual Hollywood blockbusters with the film favouring a slow tension building scene than the usual fast paced action movies. For example, in one of the film's best sequences Bud has to descend into the Abyss and has to deal with the pressures that such a dive would bring with depleting oxygen and difficulties in keeping consciousness. Sequences like this are both visually spectacular and more successful in putting us in the perspective of our characters and experience the same pressures they do. Whilst it's writing has its weaknesses, the visuals are truly something spectacular and deliver on creating some great moments of tense atmosphere. Beyond this the ambition and technical brilliance of the effects used in the film are truly astonishing creating the most realistic underwater environment put to screen.",The Abyss
138,travisimo,Good Sci-Fi Flick,8,31 December 2003,"I've never really heard of The Abyss except in Fox DVD commercials.  When it came out, I was only 8 and not into sci-fi movies that weren't titled Star Wars.  However, now I decided to check it out and was quite pleased with this solid sci-fi movie.At first, I wasn't quite sure why this was considered sci-fi.  It seemed pretty normal with the sinking of a nuclear sub and the hiring of an oil crew to save it.  It wasn't for a while till we really got to meet the ""extraterrestrial"" creatures.  The special effects for representing these characters were quite good, and I especially liked the water creature that toured around the rescue vessel.  It's also neat to see that effect inspire a similar one used in Terminator 2.As I said, the story took a little while to gain steam, but it was pretty interesting from then on.  The acting was good too, most notably by Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.  The other actors didn't do anything really extraordinary but serve as solid supporting characters.Overall, I wouldn't say The Abyss is the best sci-fi movie out there or that it will dethrone Star Wars anytime soon, but rather it's a solid addition for any sci-fi fan's collection.My IMDb Rating: 8/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: B+ (Memorable)",The Abyss
139,Filmdokter,Strange and unbalanced film,5,13 August 2021,"This is one of the lesser known films of James Cameron. It contains all the elements his (earlier) films were known for: big set pieces, ballsy action and Michiel Biehn. But this film is not in the same league as Cameron other 80's film; Terminator or Aliens. The Abyss starts as an Alien ripoff. But instead of Monster in Space we get Monster in Deep Water. But then the monster is sidetracked (and turns out not being a monster at all) and the focus is on the fight between the good guys versus evil (and overacting) Biehn. A great climax with a superb acting Harris who tries to save his (ex) wife is then followed up by another climax. A messy ""meeting the alien"" scene that feels more at place in a lighthearted Spielberg film. The Abyss is solid in the first 40 minutes when the fear of drowning and a monster in the water is played out with great suspense. Just watch the sequence where they first enter the missing sub. But in the end the film tries to be horror, thriller, sf and epic all in one and fails...unfortunately...the special effects still look good though.",The Abyss

Bud whacks Coffey with a huge metal pipe - it may even supposed to be a solid bolt - but when it hits Coffey's back it bends about 45 degrees! In the next shot it's straight again! :) :) :) If only the editor had cut another 1/10th of a second off the bit where it's bent over Coffey's back, we wouldn't have seen it.Overall though, it's a brilliant film and very touching in places - worth seeing again and again.",The Abyss
142,TheSeaLion,An underrated film if ever there was one,10,31 July 2013,"If you think about James Cameron movies, a film like ""The Abyss"" is not one that would pop into many people's brains. Maybe even less known than Cameron's film ""True Lies"", ""The Abyss"" is suspense at its best and further demonstrates Cameron's knack for story and characters in cinema.After a submarine is brought down to the depths by an unknown force that turns out to be alien, an underwater drilling base is usurped by the Navy team led by Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) to investigate the disaster. The people in charge of the drilling base, Bud (Ed Harris) and Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), ex-spouses, work together to stop Coffey from destroying the alien species and rekindle their love.While ""Avatar"" is believed to be the most insightful film that portrays Cameron for an artist, I believe it is this film that does that. This film has a message beyond ""Avatar's"" businesses are greedy and want to take things from the weak. The message here is about being kind to one another and even though no one can be nice to everyone, it reminds you that being loving or nice to one person makes all the difference. This is one of the few films where I think it actually made me feel sad at the parts I was supposed to and happy at the parts I was supposed to, thanks to the brilliant acting by the whole cast and the powerful directing and writing that Cameron put into the story.""The Abyss"" is a completely underrated work of art that has a better message and is able to succeed without all of the fancy effects and action scenes that Cameron is normally known for. Yes, this film has action but it deals more with the character drama alongside the struggle and not the drama being a subplot to the main struggle.",The Abyss

I know many would claim that to be Titanic, but save for the sinking of the ship half of the film, that movie really held little of interest for me personally. The Abyss, however, in my opinion is a far superior story with its tale of the underwater crew and their run in with extraterrestrial life and how the different crew members react to that. There's a little bit of Close Encounters of The Third Kind in there if you think about, but Cameron's film veers far more into sci-fi territory than Spielberg's did. A personal favourite scene is when the pet rat is breathing underwater thanks to the new government project of breathable liquid. There's just so much imagination in the film that I can't help but love it. This is what Cameron needs to be making more of.",The Abyss

The movie is patient, unlike Michael Bay's ""Armageddon"" which moved too fast for me.  James Cameron takes his time, developing his characters extraordinarily well.  The plot of the film, however is confusing.  I recently saw the special edition.  The cut scenes make the movie almost completely different.  The movie, as it is, is almost annoyingly subtle.  It focused less on the aliens, which it shouldn't have done, while going off and being about something else.  Overall, the movie had a great atmosphere without going too far into common action movie formulas.  A very good film although not great.",The Abyss
146,matlefebvre20,"""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" meet ""The Poseidon Adventure""",8,6 August 2006,"Extraterrestrials hiding in the depths of the sea? Why not! We don't really know for sure what is hiding in the abysses, which are the lowest points of extern Earth. So it's a rather interesting way of seeing things.Directed by James 'Terminator' Cameron, ""The Abyss"" opens with a nuclear submarine which crashes after chasing what looks like a spaceship taken from Spielberg's ""Close Encounters"".A military expedition is sent in order to retrieve the submarine and the mission needs involvement from an oil-driller crew, led by Virgil 'Bud' Brigman, played by Ed Harris. Also on the scene are Bud's wife Lindsay (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and paranoid SEAL officer Coffey (Michael Biehn).On the surface, however, the climate isn't very sane. As this is a Cold War-era picture, American officers involve Soviets with this accident, while the Russians deny all this. This leads psychotic Coffey to plot a scheme in order to launch a nuclear head and thereby satisfying his need of Russian blood.At the same time, a hurricane strikes the drill platform and things seriously begin to go awry. After a series of action scenes orchestrated by Cameron, Coffey is out of scene and I thought that the movie would end that way. It's not the case.The following scenes are the best ones. They involve Bud having to save Lindsay from hypothermia drowning and then defusing the nuclear weapon in the abyss. And, the icing of the cake, a meeting with the aliens.Much of the interest for this movie relies in its special effects and its visual spectacle. Cameron proves himself incredible in filming underwater sequences (which would be even more obvious in a certain blockbuster he would make in 1997). At one point, we almost forget the presence of water...The hurricane Fred sequences are also well done. It feels like a precursor for Wolfgang Petersen and ""The Perfect Storm"".But the greatest moments of the movie are those which involve the visitors themselves. As far as I can remember, it is the first time that I see UFOs (Underwater Flying Objects). And Cameron couldn't have depicted them better than actually. When UFOs approach, power goes out and a blueish violet light fills the environment. It makes the alien scenes somehow predictable, but each one is different from the other, so there are always surprises. The mini-ships are very intriguing and this sense of wonder is greatly expressed by Mastrantonio's face. The heavily-transformable water column provides some mystifying twisted visions and also frustration when it's slashed by Coffey.The best scenes of the movie occur at the end when Bud is rescued by an alien which looks like an hybrid between a stingray and an angel. The alien brings Bud to the visually dazzling and admirably conceived alien base, which then emerges to the Atlantic's surface.As this is a visual spectacle, dramatic and emotional are kinda rare and when they're there, they're not really successful. The only one which actually works is Bud's stubborn attempts to save Lindsay's life after a dramatic and last chance move.Cameron also tries to show deep water psychological effects on the characters, but the results are mixed. When it's about Coffey going crazy and insane, it's rather annoying and uninteresting. But when it's about Bud descending into the abyss, now it works.""The Abyss"" is a movie to grab, because there are no other pictures like this one. If you love sea adventures, visual magic moments and alien encounters, this is definitely a must-have. But if you're interested in character developments and you're not really patient, you'll find that 140 minutes could be really long.",The Abyss
147,eamon-hennedy,Stunning Science Fiction on every level.,10,16 May 2003,"I was about ten, possibly eleven, when I first saw James Cameron's The Abyss and immediately I was struck by it. It was the film that made me realise that I was a fan of Cameron's work, however I was deeply surprised to find that the film is not regarded as the classic it so rightly is.What Cameron has done is to create a science fiction thriller that is epic on every level. The story, especially in the director's cut, is one that goes beyond being a bottom of the ocean/alien film, it becomes a deep message for why we should try to live in peace and how we should respect each other as a race (maybe George W Bush should be made to watch the film, maybe he might learn something), but amazingly, amongst all the superb visual effects (the birth of CGI) and fantastic underwater cinematography, Cameron creates characters that we come to care deeply about. He doesn't forget that for something epic to be truly moving, he needs to have three dimensional characters that we want to see alive at the very end and here he has more than succeeded. Giving us a love story (of sorts) before Titanic was even a possibility, he creates an estranged relationship in Bud and Lindsey's faltering marriage and makes us hope for a Hollywood happy ending, one we thankfully get.The supporting cast and characters are also fantastic here. Hippy, Jammer, Catfish, One Night and Coffey also get a chance to be fleshed out and all have their moments and even though he is, essentially, the villain of the film, Cameron even makes one feel sympathy for Coffey is that nightmarish final moment he has as he faces death.I love the film and I make no apologies for it. There are many who have problems with the film, I know, but I just have a soft spot for any film that Cameron makes. His mixture of fantastic and ground breaking visual effects and his talent as one of the best storytellers in the movie business today always combine to give us a journey we never forget and with The Abyss all those abilities come to the surface (pun unintended, I swear). Even better is the Director's Cut of the film that gives Cameron a chance to flesh his story even more making the film one that is epic and which gives us a message that, while some may find preachy, in today's day and age is highly relevant.Fantastic in every regard.",The Abyss

149,Deckard-16,"James Cameron's best film --topping even Titanic, Aliens and T2.",10,25 March 2000,"When this movie was first released I had just learned how to scuba dive and this movie sent me right back into the depths. The opening scene of a sub in jeopardy rivals anything in the excellent ""Das Boot"" and kills anything from ""The Hunt For Red October"" (which was would not be released for another 6 months)and, of course, this was just the beginning. Cameron did a brilliant job of weaving a mystery with great action and a heart-wrenching love story. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are at their peaks as an estranged couple who find each other again 3 miles below the ocean's surface (it is rare to become teary-eyed in a movie like this). Michael Biehn is also memorable as the paranoid military guy who can't handle the deep. Amidst all the hellacious action the drama and the acting really shine. I was deeply moved and thrilled. I bought the first ending, but it is hard to review this movie without thinking about the Special Edition that Cameron came out with a few years later. Of all the different cuts that other directors have released in recent years (thank you all) this is the most special. The added tidal wave scene drives home what I suspected in the first place. ""The Abyss"" is a adrenalized update of the classic ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"". This is a movie I keep going back to.",The Abyss
150,VikiLauda,Direstors Cut is a work of Cinematic ART!,10,4 May 2019,"I first saw this on rented video in 1990 following a Sunday liquid lunch at my local pub & I hired this on the way home. Now I must admit I was mildly impressed. It was a half decent piece of entertainment, but for me the ending did not make sense...& it took me 20 years to find out why!This review is for Abyss ""Directors Cut"" which is almost 3 hours long! Because if I were reviewing the theatrical release my score would only be a 5. This longer version tells the FULL STORY of the adventure of an undersea drilling platform & its crew & their encounters with the unknown. The screenplay of this masterpiece of sci-fi is probably the finest I have ever encountered & if you think watching a FULL film of almost 3 hours would be long & boring, you would be highly mistaken. It was a cinematic CRIME to chop this beautiful film to shreds! I believe the awesome lead actors Mary Elizabeth Mastrantanio & Ed Harris, who did not receive an Award (another crime!) for their exquisite work on Abyss in which both of them almost drowned, yet were brave enough to see it through its making. I would certainly put this movie on the same level of excellence as ""Alien"" 1979. This movie manages to combine real science & fantasy, as well as also containing some fair amount of humanist morals, which should all be lessons learned. Abyss was also a pioneer of CGI, being one of the first movies to make use of the technology & it works perfectly!I will not give any spoilers here, because this is a film everyone needs to watch at sometime or other, & younger generations will be enlightened by its positive messages. However, I do think the original ""theatrical"" version should be confined the the trash can of cinema history as a lesson learned for studio bosses who ordered it to be edited (hacked to pieces more like!) for the sake of ""runtime""Anyway massive respect to all the cast of Abyss who went though Hell to bring us this work of art. THANK YOU! x",The Abyss
151,jiangliqings,A cross between the spectacular and the plain dumb.,6,15 November 2000,"** and 1/2 stars out of ****  (171 minute version)I've always felt The Abyss was a rather overrated sci-fi drama/adventure. For one thing, it moves at a far slower pace than one would ever expect from director James Cameron, who helmed the exciting actioner Aliens.  With The Abyss, he tries to mix action with profound themes, and though the result is not a bad film by a long shot, it still is quite flawed.Ed Harris plays Virgil ""Bud"" Brigman, head of an oil drilling team underwater.  He and his men are informed by the U.S. military that a nuclear submarine has sunk somewhere nearby, and they would like Brigman and his men to help retrieve any survivors.A Navy Seal Team and Brigman's ex-wife (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) arrive to help in the recovery, but soon things begin to go wrong.  Not only are there not any survivors, it seems the Navy Seals have been ordered to bring back one warhead.  The drilling habitat also encounters a disaster, killing several people, with the oxygen leaking rather quickly.  At the same time, it seems that some sort of nonterrestrial intelligence is lurking nearby, waiting to make some sort of contact, but the threat of war could possibly break any means of peace with this newly discovered race.First and foremost, The Abyss would like to be an action/thriller and a sci-fi piece.  It's not always a successful combination nor does it always work individually.  As a matter of fact, director Brian De Palma did a much better job incorporating these elements in his own sci-fi opus Mission to Mars (a vastly underrated film).  Sure, there are some exciting, slam-bang action scenes, but not nearly as many as you would expect from Cameron, plus the fact that this is a film that runs nearly 3 hours doesn't help the pacing, either.  At some spots, the film almost feels sluggish.Cameron's own script is ambitious, perhaps more so than most of his other films (that's saying a lot), but he's more successful with romance in this film than anything else.  Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio truly have a lot of strong chemistry together and the love that begins to grow back between them is heartfelt.  Both deliver strong performances, which is better than can be said of most everybody else.  Michael Biehn has the tendency to play a military man, but I find it quite hard to believe that a Navy Seal (who should have been properly tested) would crack underneath the sea.  But Cameron isn't exactly well-known for penning brilliant dialogue, and The Abyss has its fair share of lackluster conversations between characters. Perhaps Cameron should leave the dialogue up to somebody else to figure out.The special effects are appropriately spectacular, and why shouldn't they be.  At 70 million dollars (most expensive film at its time) the effects should be ground-breaking.  That is to say, of course, that not every visual in the film works.  There is an occasional scene that features a rather fake-looking effect, but that's a minor complaint.  Then there's the ending, which in some ways, is the best and worst part of the film.  Those sci-fi fans waiting for a grand finale full of profound themes and great special effects will enjoy it, but it might disappoint those who were just hoping for the film to keep a survivalist tone.  To be honest, I'm rather split by this.  I liked the ending in the fact that it is moderately thought-provoking and even grandiose, but it does interfere with the tone the film kept before the finale, or could it rather be that everything before the conclusion was what damaged the mood and tone.  Either way, it's a flaw that, while not by any means detrimental to the film as a whole, will cause at least some disappointment.",The Abyss

A unique and original interpretation of extraterrestrial life, this film is a success on many levels. It almost feels like two movies rolled into one, the first half being suspenseful and captivating, with the second half being more like a good sci-fi movie with romantic elements. I was moved to tears in two different scenes near the end, which is not an easy feat for me.James Cameron had a vision, and as both the writer and director, he brought it to the screen for all to see. This is a powerful film unlike any other I've seen before. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio provide a lot of on screen chemistry and fill out their roles well.

So i was looking forward to watching this movie, and despite a few flaws I found it very good. There were some things which i disliked, but overall I thought it was pretty entertaining and intense.Of the negative sides the movie is sometimes maybe moving a bit too slow, not much is happening, but actually that is sort of okay, because our interest is kept because we are eager to find out what is beneath, what is the secret. This makes the movie very unpredictable, it's sort of a mystery, and I thought i had guessed the end many times. I'll be honest, I love unpredictable movies as they keep my interest better, and I found this movie very original and unique.Even though the movie moves at a very slow pace it still creates many very intense scenes that had my heart pumping a few extra times per second, naturally it's the whole thing with the navy seals, and there is never any doubt either where the sympathy lies, even though you may wonder if they are actually doing the right thing, but as the sympathy is far from there, their leader is portrayed as the villain and he sure is a psychopath, and a total moron before he goes insane, down there.As always James Cameron has done a fantastic job with the directing, and especially the dramatic scenes of this movie is very well handled and extremely intense, especially the scenes where the oil rig is getting dragged towards the bottom were fantastic, another amazing job from Mr. Cameron here.On the acting I think many of the lead ones did a good job, they were all above average and made a very believable foundation for the movie. Ed Harris had a few flaws, but I also think he had many good scenes, especially the scenes with Mary Elizabeth were superb and their chemistry very good. But for me the star of the movie is the villain, Michael Biehn, his portrait of a nervous psychopath were fantastic, I could almost feel his wrath and damn did I hate him, absolutely terrific!To sum it all up a bit. I Found this movie very good, and it kept my interest all the way through, but even though it was a fantastic original idea and the details were thought through. But actually I have to admit that i disliked the ending, i loved that i didn't see it coming, but the final end was just too over hyped and classic for me, I was constantly hoping for a shocking end, but the end was just too melodramatic and reminded me too much of something I've seen a million times before, the classic ""Happy End"".8/10",The Abyss

This is probably one of James Cameron's weaker films but as the guy doesn't make bad films it's still fantastic. The underwater scenes are amazing and the special effects still hold up, especially the liquid effects Cameron used to such iconic effect in Terminator 2.

159,Rooster99,An excellent movie,9,29 December 2001,"This movie is extremely well made.  Make sure you get the original director's cut, or Special Edition as they are calling it on the DVD.  It includes the real ending, along with more than 20 minutes of additional footage.  The morons from the studio in Hollywood decided that the public wouldn't want to see a nearly 3-hour underwater adventure, and forced James Cameron to cut it down and change the ending.  The ending the studios insisted on is your typical boring old done-a-million-times happy ending, and does not work.  It betrays the message of the film, and makes it nothing more than a good underwater shoot-em-up.  This movie is much more than that. See the REAL ending to understand why it is so important to this film.  As opposed to the canned studio ending, the REAL one makes you think.  Well, what did you expect?  Hollywood executives make movies for the common herd, they dumb them down to make sure every patron goes away feeling happy.  God forbid that anyone actually may have to think a little.  At the time, despite a few solid hits (such as the original Terminator), James Cameron wasn't enough of a power in La-La land to force the studios to release the movie as he wanted it to be.

After that they have to bring her back to life in a nail biting resuscitate scene.The movie is intense, but takes it's time to build everything up and the pay-off at the end is fitting and great in my opinion.I all in all adore this film, because of the excellent acting, incredible effects and it's emotional core...",The Abyss

162,dina-78772,Another Masterpiece From Cameron,9,20 August 2020,Kudos to James Cameron for this kind of movie in 80's itself. Amazing Underwater Adventure thriller movie. Great screen presence by Ed Harris. The movie runs with speedy and sensitive speed with good VFX. This movie explains about global warming & tsunami on those days' itself. Fantastic movie to watch,The Abyss
163,Surecure,A powerful and unique science fiction masterpiece,9,14 June 2006,"James Cameron's 'The Abyss' holds a sentimental place for me as one of the most beautifully conceived and composed science fiction films ever. The story of a group of oil rig workers thrust into an event that is bigger than anything they could ever have imagined themselves to be a part of is so easy to connect with because of the cast of characters. Instead of following high government officials or rich people in exotic locations, Cameron brings the action to a bunch of average, blue-collar workers who woke up one day to find themselves smack dab in the middle of both an international crisis and a intergalactic revelation.The film's plot is remarkably intricate: when a US nuclear submarine mysteriously crashes, a crew of oil rig workers are called in to help with any survivors and secure the wreck as American and Russian forces are at a stand off above. What they discover is a species of alien life-form trying to establish contact. But when the leading military officer securing the submarine -- cut off from his superiors on the surface -- falls victim to a pressure related psychosis and retrieves a nuclear weapon from the submarine, the entire planet is put at jeopardy. With intense action, drama and suspense, the story builds layer upon layer to a stunning and unforgettable conclusion.The cinematography and landmark visual effects work is simply stunning to watch. The palette of colors used to paint the landscape of this film is like candy to the senses. The design of the submarines and dive-suits give an almost outer-space like feel to the film, and the design work on the famous 'pseudo-pod' that would later form the basis for the T-2000 in 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' still ranks as one of the most amazing special effects creation to date.The depths of action to which the cast submerged themselves (pardon the puns) in order to achieve the incredible realism of the film is commendable. This film marked the first time that actors had to perform both action and dialog while in dive-suits, and the results are fantastic to watch. And with an extraordinary cast including Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Michael Biehn and Leo Burmester, the audience is truly transported into the story.Of course, none of this would be possible without the fantastic imagination of James Cameron. While 'The Abyss' does not rank as one of his larger commercial successes, it certainly ranks as being likely his most elaborately crafted film. It is a delight to view and a non-stop, gripping thrill ride from beginning to end, and certainly solidifies Cameron's ranking as one of the most exciting writer/directors alive.",The Abyss

165,Rinho18,My number 130 movie ( contains story + spoilers ),8,9 February 2001,"Abyss is my number 130 movie. The story : The crew of a diving station search for a submarine that is full of nuclear warheads. They get in contact with a kinda alien lifeform there. I do not like maybe a fifth of the movie´s runtime, but there are some parts that I actually love. The first one is when Bud Brigman ( Ed Harris ) dives to the submarine. And the second one is the most famous part of this film, when they see the water monster"". That was great. Those two were not the only moment that I liked/loved, but those two are the only ones I remember at the moment. I think Abyss"" was a good sci-fi-mystery-movie with great special effects, as you have them in every James Cameron film. This one is definitely not his best, there are 4 better ones ( the 4 big T´s : Titanic, True Lies, Terminator 1 & 2 ). Maybe you wonder why I did not mention Aliens, but I thought that that one was worse than this. And it is not the best Ed Harris movie, The Truman Show and The Rock were better. All in all, I rated Abyss 8/10, and recommend it to sci-fi fans.CU; Rinho",The Abyss
166,realalexrice,Cameron's best?,9,24 August 2021,"Watched theatrical cut, and quite enjoyed it... might be my first or second favorite Cameron film. It's a shame that no one had a good time making this because it's pretty excellent stuff. Kind of like the Apocalypse Now of underwater movies, read about some of the behind the scenes if you get a chance, fascinating but sad stuff. Definitely deserves to be seen on Blu-ray and not DVD. Going to keep that in mind for a rewatch and I'm definitely going to check out the special edition cut which contains like 25 minutes extra of character development, something that usually is hit or miss with Cameron and honestly is the main thing that keeps me from enjoying his movies more. Upon reading further, it's come to my realization that there is no Blu-ray release... yet another reason to not love James Cameron, beloved and fun movies like this and True Lies have not yet been restored for proper Blu-ray releases because he won't stop diving to the bottom of the ocean/making Avatar sequels no one wants and yes, that's irritating.",The Abyss
167,HBeachBabe,"Director's Cut gets a 10, regular cut gets a 4",10,1 February 2000,"The difference in my rating between the 2 different versions of this film ought to clue you in on how important the material that was cut is to the plot, character development and theme of the movie.  I have never understood director James Cameron's decision to remove as much of the end as he did yet retain the opening (unnecessary & expository)sub scene- all the details of which are later recapped in dialog anyway.Despite the terrible ""Titanic"" script, Cameron proves here he actually is capable of writing a solid romance.  This film *is* a romance that happens to be set against the backdrop of aliens at the bottom of the ocean.  Again, the director's cut is needed to get the full impact of Bud & Lindsey's relationship, as it includes an important conversation between Bud & One Night which is built on later during the descent as well as a much more detailed argument between Bud & Lindsey prior to him disposing of his wedding ring.If your judgement of this film is based on the version you saw in the theater you owe it to yourself to watch it again, all 3 hours.  The additional 25 minutes will answer so many questions you won't believe it's the same movie.  I had the good fortune to see the director's cut on the big screen and it was amazing!The ""Making of the Abyss"" documentary is a fascinating companion piece, perhaps second only to ""Hearts of Darkness- A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"" as far as showing the trials of getting films made in the most difficult of circumstances.",The Abyss
168,Clive-Silas,There's a phenomenally original thriller stuck somewhere inside this unconvincing Sci-Fi epic.,4,29 October 2003,"The movie I'm talking about is about the absolute deepest depths of the ocean, with pressures so enormous that a tank would be crushed like a soda can. This is distinctly different from other undersea dramas which just deal with strange and dangerous flora and fauna a few metres below the surface; here the danger is from the power of the water itself.In 1969 Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed and walked on the moon, a different planetary body from the one on which we live, a quarter of a million miles away. Over the next three years 10 more men walked on the Moon.Further back, though, in 1960, Piccard and Walsh reached the deepest part of the deepest ocean, the Marianas Trench in the Pacific - a total depth of 35,810 feet (or less than seven miles.) Despite the fact that the distance travelled was 0.00003 as far, this feat has never been remotely equalled in 43 years. And they found life down there. This is a truly alien environment.Given a background in which the defining danger is water pressure and the sometimes surprising consequences of that - like the fact that a fall off a cliff deep underwater is just as dangerous as one above the surface - a normal contemporary human plot about the dangers of nuclear weapons in the wrong hands makes a truly original thriller.Unfortunately, Jim Cameron had new toys to play with, to whit the CGI optical effects system, which necessitated the creation of alien intelligence in the bottom of the ocean which was completely superfluous in the context of the genuinely strange worlds available home grown by our own planet. The result was a sub-par touchy-feely ""aliens tell us peace is better than war"" plot which deadens the effect of the entire movie. Instead of assuming that aliens are superior to us in every way (as every other alien movie does), why not depict the difficulties any creature used to living at such a depth, would have with our measly 15lb/in² atmosphere. But instead the aliens have no difficulty in manipulating water against gravity at our atmospheric pressure, which would be rather like us being able to carve a face in a soap bubble.All this movie needed was a human ending, as opposed to an alien one, and it would have been simple to cut all the alien scenes out and make a completely different (and far more satisfying) movie.",The Abyss
169,mpofarrell,James Cameron's Real Folly,5,20 September 2002,"In the summer of 1996 the big news in Hollywood was the new film project being directed by James Cameron, the man responsible for such successful movies as the Arnold Schwarzenegger science fiction thriller THE TERMINATOR and the state of the art horror extravaganza ALIENS. Reports from the set did not bode well for Cameron's latest endeavor, an enormously expensive production fictionally recounting the last days of of the famed luxury liner Titanic, which sank in the North Atlantic on April 15, 1912. A notorious perfectionist with an obsessive love for gadgetry, Cameron drove his cast and crew to near exhaustion in in his aim to create the last word in epic entertainment. A mock replica of the original boat was built nearly to scale and Cameron even traveled to the North Atlantic sea bed to visit the original Titanic's resting place. Descending in specially made submersibles, Cameron got as close as any civilian ever would to the underwater grave site After countless delays and extended post-production on the movie's complicated special effects, TITANIC opened to enthusiastic critical acclaim and incredible commercial success ; many had predicted that the picture would fall flat on it's face. With an expenditure of 2 hundred million dollars, arguably the most expensive movie ever made, TITANIC was an unstoppable box office dynamo. James Cameron was being labeled as the 90's answer to legendary producer David O. Selznick, and TITANIC was Cameron's GONE WITH THE WIND. What had once been labeled ""Cameron's Folley"" while in production was now perceived as a commercial masterpiece. Amid all the brouhaha, something was being forgotten. Nearly a decade earlier, Cameron had embarked on another movie project that was incredibly costly, that challenged to the limit the talents of its technical crew and proved to be possibly the worst experience of their professional careers for the unfortunate cast members. THE ABYSS , released in the summer of 1989, was a spectacular science fiction thriller that possessed all the technical know -how and up to the minute advances in special effects available at the time. The story of a missing U.S. nuclear submarine, its pursuit by civilian and Navy Seal divers and strange encounters in the ocean deep would seem to be a surefire , edge- of -the-seat thriller, but something goes very wrong with Mr. Cameron's sea opus. Instead of a minute by minute, nail biting suspense yarn, Cameron's screenplay throws too many genres into the mix. The picture opens with a harrowing ""you are there inside the sub"" sequence that immediately grabs the viewers' attention ; for a time the plot keeps one involved but soon too many distractions get in the way and the movie becomes annoyingly unfocused. A major subplot responsible for much of this is the edgy relationship between Virgil ""Bud"" Brigman, the foreman of a huge underwater oil- drilling platform and his soon to be divorced wife ( Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ) who happens to be the designer of the oil rig and is called on to visit the rig in a state of emergency. Add to this the inclusion of a truly sinister bunch of Navy Seals to help the oil riggers look for the mysteriously missing submarine and you have a film that seems to move in fits and starts, never achieving a sustained pace. In between scenes of domestic quarreling between Harris and Mastrantonio there are a few brilliant set pieces : the surveillance of an underwater structure and the sudden panic of one of the divers who has lost communication with his crew ; the toppling of the oil rig's crane into the watery deep and its perilous descent to the ocean floor , the one truly great sequence in this movie where Cameron's immense talent for combining editing and sound comes into full play; and Ed Harris's final , eerie descent into the murky depths, the only time in the film where the other characters stop shouting and the film quiets down to an almost contemplative state, with the viewer waiting for the big story payoff. When that so-called payoff happens it is a bitter disappointment ; rarely have I seen a picture where all that had gone on before is so totally laid to waste at movie's end. It's as if Cameron was at a loss as to how to end his movie ; in what seems like a desperate cover-up, he turns up the loudness quotient on Alan Silvestri's already portentous music score and combines elements from two Spielberg classics, ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind "" and ""E.T."" At this point the poor actors have little else to do but look as though they've been on the Road to Damascus, but the bolt of lightning they've been hit with is bogus and the ending of this movie is a sham. THE ABYSS is included in the film history books as a cinematic landmark because it introduced the pioneering liquid effects that would be perfected in Cameron's next feature, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY. To look at THE ABYSS now after more than a decade after its original release is to wonder it amazement at the blind determination and audacity of a gifted filmmaker who can make wrong choices and spend profligate amounts of money to so little effect, and yet as fate would have it make another picture just as fraught with problems but with the right chemistry produce one of the great entertainments of all time. THE ABYSS is James Cameron's real folly.",The Abyss
170,ringfire211,Wasn't really impressed...,5,24 February 2010,"So why wasn't I impressed? Weren't there any strong points to the film? Of course there were. Everything from a technical stand-point was top-notch! As per usual for a Cameron film. The claustrophobic feel was genuine, you could really feel the depth (the ""abyss"") in this film, all the diving robots and technical wizardry was impressive, the underwater photography (thanks to FOR YOUR EYES ONLY alumnus Al Giddings) was grade-A stuff. And the alien stuff was obviously ground-breaking for its time - it no doubt paved the way for the T-1000 in T2 two year later. Oh and I loved that huge tidal wave coming up on the Golden Gate Bridge and then stopping dead in its tracks. For 1989 this must have been amazing stuff to see. Like the parting of the Red Sea in 1956's ""The Ten Commandments"". OK, OK, nothing will ever be THAT ground-breaking. And the acting in the film was good as well.So that out of the way, where is the problem with the film? There are two main gripes that I have - the story and the run-time. At almost 3 hours this film is waaaaay too long. If this were about a historic event (like TITANIC) then a 3-hour runtime would be acceptable. But I'm sorry - with this film we're 1 hour into the film and I still have no clue where the story is going. 1 hour and a half and I still have no clue what's going on. I'm looking at the eye-candy (all the technical stuff) but the plot is not clear. I'm not really invested in the story. For example, what's with the Michael Biehn character? What's causing him to grow increasingly paranoid? I know he was obsessed with the Russians. But once he sees the ""water alien"" why is he still obsessing? Why does he want to detonate the bomb on the ocean floor? He just comes across as an extremely bad 1-dimensional villain whose job is to simply look evil. With no explanation to what his motivations are. Or maybe they're just unclear to me. Whatever.I guess the real problem is that as I'm watching the film I really want to know where the story is going. This helps to better engage with the story. But it seemed like there was no real direction to this story. We see a submarine go down at the beginning of the film and then we see a rescue team assembled to go down for a search and rescue/recovery operation. Once they get down there the film really slows down to a crawl and for the duration of the film we are simply supposed to be sitting there in awe of Cameron's amazing wizardry on display. We see various diving machines moving to and fro, we see a storm wreaking havoc on our crew, we see Ed Harris and Mastrantonio bicker for the duration between each other. Not that I minded the bickering but I would have really wanted the story to move ahead. Instead we see the crew move from one hatch to another, from one compartment to another, using various technical diving jargon, and so on and so forth. And while the sets and all the tech stuff looks impressive it's merely just a stage for our performers to walk on. Back and forth. Ad nauseum. Because the story is not really going anywhere. I almost prayed for that ""water alien"" to attack them -- anything to pick up the pace. But no such luck. I guess that's where Biehn's SEAL character comes in - to give us the obligatory bad guy (but whose motivations are unclear). It really is a shame because by the end of the movie you feel cheated. I just sat there for 3 hours for what? Just to find out that the aliens are watching us. And warning us. Could this have not been told in less than 2 hours? Did we even need the Biehn character's story? Oh well... I feel that the film was a severe miss in the entertainment department. Cameron wanted to demonstrate all his wizardry to us for 3 hours and just sprinkle some story here and there. It's obvious that the story is about the aliens. Yet we only see the aliens for no more than a combined 5 minutes out of an entire 3-hour runtime. The rest is a showcase of the beautiful sets, the gadgets, and the underwater photography. Really aside from 3 scenes - the alien scenes, the scene where Harris has to first drown and then revive Mastrantonio, and his descent into the abyss (a tense moment) - the film is really a chore to sit through. It almost feels like a National Geographic documentary than a suspenseful and riveting Cameron film.I recall that his TERMINATOR films had me hooked from the get-go. In ALIENS once the first alien attack happens I'm hooked immediately. Same with all of Cameron's films. He is able to hook you and transport you into the world that he creates. But he is able to do this with a a story that we care about and so we are able to stay in that world of his. Here in THE ABYSS again I love the world that he created but when nothing exciting happens for long periods of time you're taken out of that world and end up thinking ""Hey, what's for dinner?"" I'm not into alien movies to begin with - unless they're attacking us... hehe - so this wasn't exactly my cup of tea. But then on the other hand if that's what the movie is about and that's the selling point of the special effects then show us those damn aliens already!! Stop wasting my time with mindless underwater shenanigans for 3 hours. If I want that I'll watch National Geographic. Get to it already!!I say it's a wasted opportunity. As Siskel or Ebert might say, THUMBS DOWN.",The Abyss

This movie is full of amazing shots that were all shot underwater. James Cameron made a landmark film with those shots. I saw this movie in theaters. I left the theater thinking that there were some plot holes. But then I saw the extended version and that version explained everything. If you haven't seen this movie, you should see that version. This movie had great acting, great directing, a great script, a great story, and it was funny and sad in parts. The special effects were incredible for 1989. James Cameron made a landmark film with this movie. I said that it was one of his best. I think it was his second best next to Terminator 2. This was a great movie. 9/10.",The Abyss

Beautiful effects animate the aliens, which are without much point.

During the operation freak weather conditions damage the platform and sever its communication with the surface. As World War III looms above and tensions rise between the divers and a deployed SEAL team the rescuers discover that there is something else besides the submarine in the Abyss.""Now I have to say first of all that I watched the Directors Cut, so if I make mention of something you don't know about, that's why. This movie was made in 1989 and yet has better effects than half the movies today. But the thing was that the effects were not the story, the characters were the story and the effects merely added to that fact. This movie has great acting from Ed Harris, Michael Biehn and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Mary has been labelled as ""annoying"" in this movie which is actually quite good. She needs to be perceived early on as annoying so that her change later on actually works. Ed is the star and provides a killer performance. Michael Biehn though, I felt stole the film. He was just f***in creepy in this movie. Michael is a great actor and should be in more big movies. Maybe Cameron or Taratino can help.I only have one problem with this movie and that's the audience. I've read so many reviews that say that this movie would be bigger if it wasn't for a Disney movie ending. Uh, hello, what the f*** do you expect? This movie couldn't have had a better ending. It completely suited the movie. What the f*** do you want, Ed Harris to turn into the f***in Terminator and hand all those aliens asses to themselves? Get a warhead and blow the b******s to hell? That would sure as f***in hell not have suited the movie. In a movie like this you need to stop the aliens by non-violent means, otherwise you are as bad as they say.Have the aliens destroy the f***in world? That again would not stick. These are peaceful aliens who have been driven to a brink by humans and are trying to stop them before they do anything worse. The aliens just needed an excuse to not go through with the plan and were provided with it by Ed Harris. ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" has a bigger Disney type ending and is a f***in landmine in Sci-Fi history.Nobody wants to badmouth ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" because it had a message at the end which everyone accepted. James Cameron tries to update this message with ""The Abyss"" and gets f***in s*** on because of it.People, just watch a f***in movie and if you enjoy, enjoy it! Don't go out and b**** that it wasn't perfect. No movie is completely perfect but there are some that are nearly there in their respective genres. The Abyss is one of the best f***in Sci-Fi movies out there and should rightly be on the top 250 list instead of being badmouthed! F*** THIS, I'm done!",The Abyss
174,user-543-975655,The Best Deep Sea Adventure I Have Yet Seen,8,23 December 2013,"Sorry for the long gap between reviews lately. I just have been busy with school and work. So sorry if it's not that good. So I got The Abyss out of a Walmart $5 movie bin and watched it the next day, which is today, because I had just come from seeing The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, which is good, by the way, and I will review that later. The Abyss is a triumph for its time, and is great except for a couple things. For one, there is too much swearing. There is s*** and b**** left and right. You don't need that! There is already a good enough dialogue without all of that. Also, the movie is really long. There is about 10 minutes worth of film that you could cut out and not notice its missing. I paused the movie once to go read a book for about 10 minutes. Besides those two things, the movie was very good. James Cameron is just a master of filmmaking, and has had other such masterpieces such as Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Titanic, and Avatar. I have to say this movie is maybe 5th on the James Cameron scale, however I think it deserved a little more than a 62 from critics. Maybe somewhere around 68-72 is where I would put it. The acting in this movie was great all around. Seriously, it was. The people in the film had great fake accents, and moved like they should have, looked like they should have, talked like they should have, and looked scared like they should have. All of them. Congrats to you actors! I've heard some people say that this movie is cheesy. Sure, for this era it is, but this was made 24 years ago! That's like saying King Kong is a backyard film. That movie was made 80 years ago. If you tried to make a movie with the technology they had I'm sure you wouldn't be able to do anything better. Hmph. This movie is actually more realistic than some movies of today. Like any Syfy original movie, or Machete or Snakes on a Plane or Piranha (2010). The movies special effects are like nothing I have ever seen before. It's like they aren't made from a computer, It's not made from stop action, and it's not made from a set or miniatures. It's probably made of all 4, though. Well actually, all 3, because I know it's a set. This is one of the few reviews I actually talk about the poster. The poster on the IMDb page for it, anyway. It's awesome and iconic, and you know what movie it is even if there wasn't a title on it. It is strikingly similar to the Thing, but The Abyss has a surrounding that makes you know they're underwater. Just look up the two, and compare the two people on them. I really don't know what else to say about this movie. Except for the storyline. It really is original, and enjoyable. Sure not for now it isn't original, but back then it was, so I say it is anyway. Where else are you going to find a deep sea oil rig that turned into one of the most epic adventures of the 80's and 90's? Seriously! This is one of the best deep sea movies I have ever seen. Maybe the best, I don't know. Even now, you don't find stuff as good as this. There are many iconic scenes in this movie that help the story, but you'd have to see them for yourself. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone that likes deep sea movies, good movies, and sci-fi movies, or adventure movies. Thanks for reading guys, and I'll have some more reviews up soon.",The Abyss
175,epalejandrocarrillo,Technically impressive.,6,23 May 2020,An impressive film especially when you consider the lengths that the director goes to but unfortunately the sci-fi part really takes away from the dramatic events. If the director would have eliminated the aliens and kept it a drama it would have been one of the best movies for everyone involved. Movie endings can change your opinion of the whole and the overly preachy end really ruined a great experience. Everyone worked so hard for a good movie when it could have been great.,The Abyss
176,Lt_Coffey_182,Masterpiece,10,13 October 2003,"Though I prefer The Terminator and Aliens, this film is James Camerons most artistic film. The visual imagery of this film is stunning, with no half measures taken, it is such a pleasure to watch. The aliens look as beautiful as an alien can do and the underwater scenery is so picturesque that I just wish I could be there.The special effects are stunning. As with a lot of Cameron's hits, this was an innovator in special effects. If it wasn't for this film, films such as The Matrix and Lord of the Rings would not be here or at least would not have been able to express themselves in a visual sense.Cameron is the ultimate director. Although he is a pain to work with, he gets his image across and proves why he is such a hit machine. No one compares to him when it comes to picking a cast. Even though most of this cast were, and still are, unknown, the performances in this are fantastic. I know I always praise him but Michael Biehn as Coffey is one of the best acting performances I have ever seen and the fact that Biehn was not even Oscar nominated is a travesty! He is great to watch as the maniac who is irate and just plain horrible. Ed Harris is on par with his good performances in The Rock and Apollo 13. You just want to be his mate in this movie despite the fact he is another pain (see Rock out takes) which is why him and Cameron have not spoken a word since this film. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was a bit of a fad. She didn't last very long being in good films but she is good as the hard nosed estranged wife who near the end, becomes wonderfully vulnerable and loving.Cameron is a great writer and The Abyss, along with The Terminator and Strange Days, shows off his talent to a great extent. As with all of Cameron's Sci-Fi screenplays, behind the technology lies a distinctively human element. This enables The Abyss, despite the extra terrestrial goings on, to approach the audience on their level and suck viewers in to the film. The character of Coffey is a great obstacle character because he is losing his mind and is getting engulfed by paranoia to the point where he can not trust anyone. The way Cameron uses Coffey to build up suspense is very effective and the culmination of this is one of the most frantic underwater chases there will ever be. Spectacular is the only word that comes to mind. The ending of this film has been heavily criticised but this is unfair as it carries a decent message regarding humanity and fits the mood of the film. It may have been slightly rushed but the best bits of the film are all under water anyway.Anyone who likes their special effects, a great story and terrific acting need look no further than The Abyss. The contrast of the breathtaking beauty of the ocean between the claustrophobia of a vessel should be enough to captivate most audiences. A fantastic visionary piece.",The Abyss
177,picturetaker,Can you hold your breath as long as me?,1,17 September 2016,"I have to write a review. At this point there are more than 360 other reviews about this flick but I have to write a review.I am a fan of James Cameron. Though I admit I really dislike Avatar and don't get me started on there being 5 by the 2020s! But his other movies are great. Titanic, Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies are all great! So after more than 27 years I finally saw this movie. I was 9 when it originally came out and I think I saw it on video. Maybe. Whatever. Likely fell asleep.So my review goes like this. IT WAS TOO LONG! Like it was like holding my breath under water long. You know when you're a kid in the pool with your school yard chum kind of contest holding your breath. Every second or two feels like an eternity. The story also felt very weak. Like I get they're on a rescue mission but they never really accomplished much except to get a nuke, one nuke out of many on the sub. Then a storm comes, there is always a storm. Then some space jellyfish come and interrupt the storey. Then more holding breath happens. So much so and then finally we see them and their ship. And their ship looked like a certain piece of the female anatomy!?! Like huh? And then the character Bud goes into the ship and watches low resolution television with some space jellyfish. And blah blah whatever! The Abyss was a mess. I will never watch this movie again unless I am recruited by the CIA and trained to interrogate ""bad guys"". I will have them watch this abysmal movie a few times and guaranteed my friend they will crack.",The Abyss
178,pink_floydilia,Michael Biehn is all you need,8,8 November 2019,"This has been a favourite of mine since I was a little kid. My dad introduced me to the world of sci-fi early on and I have been eternally grateful for the eye opening films he showed me. This was one of those movies.
Stellar cast, gorgeous graphics and a solid storyline. Absolutely loved every aspect of the paranoia to the aliens to the music score!",The Abyss
179,Bing-18,Could have been better.,5,6 March 2000,"With such truly fine actors as Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, this film had great potential. However, for once, James Cameron's love of special effects, actually hampered the movie.If the movie had been treated as a psychological thriller of being trapped under the water with a dangerously unstable Navy SEAL on the loose, the stars and director would have made a superb movie, but the use of an alien species, while using stunning special effects, was simply ludicrous, and ruined the movie, especially the ridiculous ending.Harris, Cameron and Mastrantonio can all do better than this.",The Abyss
180,jonathanmark-77048,One of my favorite movies,9,6 May 2015,"The USS Montana, a nuclear submarine runs straight into an underwater cliff after an encounter with what they believe was a new beyond state-of-the-art Russian submersible. The Navy dispatches a SEAL team (lead by Michael Biehn) to observe and report the situation. Meanwhile, A deep sea oil drilling platform run by the estranged Brigman's, Bud and Lindsey (Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio)are called to help search the sub for any survivors. During their mission, they discover that they are not alone.This is one of James Cameron's best films. The way he combines drama, suspense, action and comedy blends so well together. While not in the same league as The Terminator or Aliens, The Abyss still manages to produce terrific performances, fantastic visual effects that still hold up to this day and a story that is tension-filled with great atmosphere. Ed Harris as Bud Brigman is fantastic, the ranges of emotion that he shows is so powerful and very realistic. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is also very good as Lindsay, she isn't used as a sex symbol like some movies would have done which I like. Her character is a strong woman who can defend herself, but still show that she is still human. Michael Biehn is equally fantastic as Lt. Coffey and should have gotten an Oscar nomination for this. The way he portrays this character is terrifying once he starts going crazy, his character is very memorable and helps bring tension to the chaos. The rest of the supporting cast do very well in their roles and are equally as memorable as the leads. Both versions either if it's the theatrical or special edition version are great. The only problem I had with this film is the treatment of The other navy seals(except for one) They aren't given any character development or personality. Either way, The Abyss is one of my favorite films of all time and if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and rent this film and give it a chance. You won't regret it.",The Abyss
181,jwhale9382,Awesome 80's Classic,10,29 November 2005,"Although I just saw this movie for the first time a few months ago on the Sci Fi channel, I'd heard about it over the years and had wanted to see it for a long time. When I finally saw it, I was just blown away. It really is one of James Cameron's best movies.In the movie, a group of cocky oil drillers are hired by the Navy to check a sunken nuclear sub for survivors. The sub is rested on the edge of a very deep trench. But while they're working on their rescue mission, the crew get the eerie feeling that there's something living down in the trench...The casting in this movie was great. There are only three big stars in it. The rest are ensemble. Ed Harris plays the brave, but somewhat laid-back Bud Brigman. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays Bud's more serious ex-wife Lindsay Brigman. James Cameron regular, Michael Biehn, plays renegade Navy SEAL Lt. Coffey. Before this movie I didn't know Michael could be insane and power-crazy. But my favorite character in the movie was Hippy (Todd Graff), the crew's crazy, rat-loving, audiovisual nerd.But the real reason to see this movie is the awe factor. This movie is literally one jaw-dropping scene after another. And the special effects were awesome. There are some early attempts at CG visual effects in this movie, but even by today's standards, they're amazing. Even the music in the movie was amazing. It really helped to establish a sense of astonishment in the audience.Just a reminder, this is a long movie, and some parts drag on a little bit. The special edition is almost four hours. So be sure you're willing to sit for that long. But I guarantee you, it's worth it.",The Abyss
182,Progressive-Element,The good outweighs the bad,9,25 May 2013,"James Cameron's first budget-buster, this underwater sci-fi thriller briefly spawned a swarm of rip-offs, just about all of them simply Alien clones set underwater. The Abyss is more in the vein of Close Encounters, though there's a strong whiff of Aliens in some scenes.Unlike those films, this one isn't trash. It's a serious, ambitious epic, with some awe-inspiring visuals. The Oscar-winning special effects are still a joy to behold. Production design is impressive. The score adds to the epic feel. As always with Cameron, we can expect intense, relentless set-pieces, and he doesn't disappoint, with a memorable opener, disaster hitting the undersea rig, and growing hostility between the protagonists, and an unstable Navy SEAL. And on top of that, the growing suspicion they're not alone down there...A truly impressive film, but it isn't quite up there with the best of Cameron's. Filming underwater scenes always presents pacing problems, and this film is no exception. There are many long-winded, sluggish moments that cause the film to drag at times. The anti-war anti-nuke sermonizing is stronger here than in the Terminator films, and is heavy-handed to the point that it couldn't be any less subtle if the heroes were all wearing peace symbols and No Nuke T-shirts. The cast are good enough, but at times performances verge on overly histrionic, especially at the climax with Lindsay - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonion - talking to estranged hubbie Bud - Ed Harris - as he descends into the titular crevice to defuse a nuke. I don't think much of a spoiler to reveal the aliens are friendly, as the film more than signposted that in earlier scenes. This does however present a problem - whereas the aliens in Close Encounters didn't seem aware they were causing harm by snatching the boy, it seems conveniently forgotten all of a sudden that the aliens in The Abyss inadvertently caused the deaths of the entire crew of a missile submarine.The Special Edition is even longer, close to 3 hours, but it helps flesh characters out a bit more, and we see the aliens aren't entirely sweet-natured, as they come close to causing a terrible catastrophe to avert a possible conflict between the US and the Soviet Union.Unfortunately, the Cold War subplot of the Special Edition, means it hasn't dated as well storywise as the theatrical release.A flawed film to be sure, but a likable often impressive one.",The Abyss
183,VCRanger,Underwater Flying Object,9,20 April 1999,"The Abyss is an extremely entertaining movie that is a ""must see"" for sci-fi fans.  James Cameron (The Genius) pulls together what could have been a mess of a movie, and shaped it in to one of the best films of its genre.  Breathtaking photography, excellent acting and an above average storyline (see the special edition) makes The Abyss a truly epic film.  The movie does receive some criticism for its overall length.  A rating of 9 out of 10 was given.",The Abyss
184,RandomTask-AP,Cold War in Cold Water (positive review - some spoilers),10,10 December 2003,"During the cold war, the nuclear superpowers found themselves under a great deal of pressure as they held the power to end the world literally at their fingertips. Both sides felt no trust for the other, and even a rumor could begin a buildup of military forces. James Cameron takes the tensions of the cold war and places them 2000 feet below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico where the bizarre happenings become a compressed version of the looming nuclear face off between the United States and the Soviet Union. In Cameron's screenplay, the real dangers arise from a lack of communication which plunges the characters into life-threatening situations and greater distrust even when there was no real danger in the first place. Only when people begin to talk and listen are solutions brought about.         At 1000 feet below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, a U.S. nuclear submarine crashes into a canyon wall after a close encounter with an underwater U.F.O. and sinks to a shelf in the 2 and ½-mile-deep Cayman Trench. Although the Navy is equipped with rescue equipment, it cannot get it to the site before an impending hurricane and recruits the team of an American - owned submerged oil drilling platform to help with the rescue. In spite of heated arguments between the designer, Lindsey, and the platform manager, Bud, the Navy team transfers down to the platform for the rescue operation. As tension between Lindsey and Bud grows because of their impending divorce, the team leader, Coffee, begins to experience High Pressure Nervous Syndrome (H.P.N.S.) which clouds his judgment and contributes to his paranoia of the oil workers and the unknown phenomena that caused the sub crash. After finding no survivors in the wrecked sub, the Navy team is ordered to retrieve and prepare a nuclear warhead for detonation in the event that a Russian sub happens upon the wreck. Even though there is no evidence of Russian involvement, the U.S. blames Russia for the sub disaster and both sides begin to build up naval forces in the area.  Various miscommunications between the Navy and the oil crew lead to deaths on the platform, and occasional visits by the aliens increase Coffee's paranoia. Cut off from the surface and forgetting his duty, Coffee turns the timed nuclear warhead loose on the aliens in spite of the efforts of the crew to stop him. Although the differences between Lindsey, Bud, the Navy and the workers begin to be resolved, Bud must descend into the trench to disarm the warhead and, however unplanned, face the consequences of threatening the aliens who now plan retribution against the human race for their nuclear threat. Only one final series of communications brings the world away from the edge of interspecies brinksmanship.   Tensions exist between several different groups that parallel the silent enemies of the United States and the Soviet Union in the film. On the mainlands, Russians and Americans don't trust one another. Lindsey and Bud experience difficulties speaking with one another as unresolved issues from their failing marriage arise at inopportune moments. The oil workers trust neither their management nor the Navy team because they feel that they are being denied important information. Suspicion on the part of the Navy team arises from the workers' constant curiosity about classified issues. Ultimately, fear and suspicion between the aliens and the humans holds each society under the thumb of the other's destructive weapon. Just as the cold war, miscommunication and lack of understanding leads to the use of weapons and threats.        From the start, suspicion works to disable those who don't communicate. The captain of the submarine automatically assumes that the unknown object is a Russian ""bogie"" to be dealt with. Not trying to investigate the source before encountering it causes the sub to be caught in the massive wake of an alien vessel which sends the sub reeling out of control into the canyon wall. More deaths occur when the Navy borrows a key vehicle from the oil platform to retrieve its nuclear warhead without consulting the workers first. Without the vehicle, the platform cannot be disconnected from its surface boat, and crew members die as the platform is violently dragged about by the surface boat helplessly caught in the hurricane.         The film brings the audience close to the action and the characters with its use of the camera. In unbroken follow shots, the audience receives a tour of the oil platform as the camera follows Bud on his duties. The same style of shot is used to keep the audience involved with the crew as they run about when the platform is tossed about. As a tough, strict character, Lindsey is introduced in a close up shot of her high heels stepping down from a helicopter behind the boots of the Navy team. When Coffee locks himself in a compartment with the nuclear warhead, his paranoia and loneliness are expressed by a close up shot of his face looking out a porthole that pulls away and pans down into the trench. James Cameron is noted for not letting his audiences pull back into objectivity, and with dramatic photography, he keeps his audience captive in The Abyss.       Although delivering its cold war message more seriously than its original release, the expanded edition of The Abyss is more enjoyable. Certain scenes help expand the relationship between Lindsey and Bud. Unlike the original, the revised ending brings the aliens more fully into the story rather than letting them simply remain an unmotivated catalyst to push Coffee over the edge and provide a pleasing end. The film is not without its faults (a long run time, dark scenes). However, it is a thrilling sci-fi adventure that captures the fear of the Cold War and marks amazing milestones for special effects and film making for both Cameron and Hollywood at large.",The Abyss
185,jpcjcpd,Couldn't get past the bad writing,3,18 September 2021,"The characters are all one dimensional and the writing is bland.Sorry, I couldn't get past the Navy Seals being cast as the bad guys. Ok, their leader is having paranoid delusions from a bad decompression. So one goes blindly along following an unstable leader because they are the typical one dimensional military war mongers (similar to avatar). The other barely objects.And apparently they can't outfight a guy that is exhausted from swimming in ice cold water or the stereotypical ""big dumb lug"" that can take on two Seals and disarm them with no issues.On the bright side, the undersea scenes are well done and the concept of aliens at the bottom of the ocean is intriguing.",The Abyss
186,mig28lx,Sustained pressure leading to a fizzle,7,12 September 2000,"This is a film that had more technical hurdles than anything I've ever heard of, at least before Cameron himself tackled ""Titanic"".  If you've never seen the documentary on the production, you just won't believe it if I say anything about it.  You have to see it to believe it; it's available on the most recent DVD release.That said, here comes the actual opinion.  This film creates at least as much tension as was present in ""Terminator 2"", with a tad more whimsy.  The sights presented to Bud after his presumably fatal plunge to the bottom of the abyss are unforgettable.  The claustrophobic atmosphere onboard the rig is perfectly presented.  Why, then, can I not say that I love this movie, and can only say that I REALLY LIKE this movie?  Fear of commitment?  No, dear reader.  It's the ENDING.*****MAJOR SPOILER ALERT. I BEG YOU, IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN THIS FLICK, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, READ NO FURTHER. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.What the hell?  What should have been a glorious, almost orgasmic moment revealing the aliens and rescuing our heroes comes off as a hastily-written deus ex machina cop-out.  I know, I know about the alternate ending and how the theatrical ending supposedly suffered because of it.  The alternate ending is supposed to provide the aliens with a reason for giving us humans another chance.  So why did I STILL not like it?  I love everything else about this movie -- okay, I didn't like some of the more hokey dialogue. (""Bud, I know you think you're alone...down there in that...cold...blackness..."") And, yes, the cold war friction is practically non-existent today. Otherwise, this is a stellar, big-budget production that no subsequent underwater production has yet matched.  But that ENDING...it was so cheesy. It was just TOO happy and TOO tidy, and also the most obvious model in the entire picture.  You just hate to see runners stumble at the finish line like that.  It reminded me of the ending of ""Sphere"" where the artifact goes speeding off into the sky, but no one on the ship seems to care.  What should have been a truly climactic moment had all the impact of a goosefeather hitting a brick wall.Oh well...at least the underwater scenes were more believable than the ones in ""Leviathan"" or ""Sphere.""",The Abyss
187,gdalesmith,Close encounters of the worst kind,5,1 January 2021,"Including a near death experience by leading man Ed Harris during production. If life was fair, The Abyss would have swept the Academy Awards just for what the cast and crew went through in making it.Off-screen drama aside, the movie is merely okay, entertainment-wise. The plot, which features highly intelligent creatures that dwell on the sea floor, is only modestly intriguing. Several other films were released in roughly the same time period that also involved scary, ocean-based lifeforms, so that new wears off fast. Lots of impressive special effects, sets, and props, yes, but given roughly $150 million in 2020 dollars almost any director could turn out impressive visuals. Try to imagine what the people who made Hardcore Henry could have done with a budget like that!More importantly, despite heroic efforts by Harris et al, the screenplay they had to work with was shallow. Plot holes aplenty, like having a relatively tiny, one-person submersible tow a massive, megaton oil rig to a new location near the Cayman Trench. Dialogue and character interactions are generally unimaginative, which soon becomes painfully evident despite a furry of shouting and profuse profanity. A few twists as the story progresses, but they resolve into predictable outcomes, as does the film's ending. And for the record, SEALS are not 'Jarheads; i.e., Marines.",The Abyss
188,merdiolu,Mark of James Cameron all over it....,10,25 August 2009,"The Abyss , a production 20 years old still incredible in acting , production , camera work , FX and other special effects , CGI , script , editing ( well OK Special Editon is far better ) is a wonderful piece of art. It has James Cameron stamped all over it... Perfection..Getting best performance from everything , pushing limits hard...Ed Harris was solid as rock as main character , Bud Brigmann , captain of DeepCore underwater oil rig. He is a well established leader of men in underwater condition with a troubled personal life and collapsing marriage. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is also showing quite a performance as somewhat annoying Lindsey Brigman , Bud's soon to be ex wife who is also rediscovering herself and her feelings for her husband....But real ace in the hole of whole movie was Michael Biehn as Lt. Hiram Coffey , Navy SEAL Commdr. who arrives to DeepCore rig and began to descend into madness right after wards due to high pressure environment....Biehn definitely deserved an award for his characterization here.

Well the people who put this together had tons of it, and it shows. The script, though weird and abstract, conveys a sense of beauty you can't explain. The characters are well-written, and the performance of the actors can only add to that. The directing is solid, and the cinematography plays its part in immersing the viewer to the experience. But the absolute gem of this movie lies in its visual effects. Despite the occasional choppy keys, or some subtle cases of mismatched lighting, the sheer passion of the production team to innovate and create a new world passes onto the audience. Seeing great vfx is one thing, but watching it on film in a movie that came out past century is a completely different feeling.",The Abyss
191,micke-bystrom,Should have ended before the reveal,4,25 April 2017,"The major part of this, right up to just before the end, is a really nice deep water drama with interesting personal developments and encounters.It's more open if you can live with the end, but if logic and story coherence are important to you I recommend you turn off just after the deeper descend. If you do, you will have had an intriguing movie experience with few regrets. Most aspects do hold up, also most of the special effects.I remember watching this in a big cinema in a group of 5-7 friends. All of us had a heated discussion afterwards walking away, where everyone agreed on that some Hollywood CEO, must have reacted to test viewer reactions, and then have made sure Cameron added on another ending than this well-written story deserved and in that had destroyed the experience of a really good story and movie. We reached the conclusion that ""Hollywood endings"" are the bane of good cinema even if most of us otherwise had enjoyed the movie.Now, years later with the Director's Cut, that I've also saw some time later** — which ending will hurt you so much more profoundly, or alternatively amaze you and yet leave you potentially offended because of the actual ending — it would seem the last piece was Cameron's wish after all.I've looked upon on his work with skepticism ever since the Director's Cut, even if I like some of what he's done since. The documentaries like ""Aliens of the Deep"" and ""Ghosts of the Abyss"" (unrelated to this story here) are the most interesting.It could have been so good. As it was released it's as watchable as any Sci-fi flick that almost got there. Just don't get your hopes up.**What can I say?

192,MatBrewster,Underwater Adventure,8,2 March 2005,"James Cameron as a director is a bit of a mixed bag. He has created some of the most phenomenal action showcases cinema has ever seen. His movies make loads of money and create spectacle like no other. He has been part of the Alien quadrilogy, Terminator, and there was that little movie that could about a couple of lovers on a sinking boat. For that little picture he even won an Oscar. However, as a writer he has also given us some patently ridiculous dialogue. It's like he can create some pretty interesting story concepts, generate a great deal of tension between characters and pull of amazing action, but when it gets to finding the heart and soul of a character he pulls out the cheese. It is interesting then that my favorite Cameron movie would be so character driven with only a few moments of grandiose action.The Abyss came out in 1989 with a trimmed down 146 run time. Later when the movie came to video Cameron released his directors adding a significant amount of footage and bringing the time to 171 minutes. Most of this extra footage comes in at the end of the film and stands to clear up some major confusion wrought in the theatrical version. It seems that there are some creates living at the bottom of the ocean and are rather perturbed at humanities prevalence for violence. It seems these creatures (aliens?) can manipulate water and have forced giant tidal waves to start approaching every major port. Humanity is saved when the creatures see the true love between the two main characters. It reminded me of the quote from Genesis where God agrees to save Sodom and Gomorrah if He can find just 10 righteous people. In their case He didn't, and the cities were destroyed by sulfur and fire, but in Cameron's tale it seems that the rekindling of love between Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio does save humanity.What Cameron does extremely well in this picture is create tension. From the claustrophobic setting of an underwater oil rig to the potential nuclear meltdown each scene slowly tightens the screws of suspense. The cold war plot raging outside of the main action reminded me a lot of 2010. In both pictures the main characters are isolated on vessels (a spaceship on 2010, an underwater oil well in the Abyss) while the USA and Russia bring conflict close to nuclear war back on earth (or above water). In both movies this helps to add tension as it also dates the movies since the cold war is now over.One of my favorite scenes involves the flooding of parts of the rig. Water comes rushing into the rig and several of the characters scurry to make it to safety and close off the doors to isolate the flooding. Ed Harris is saved by his wedding ring. One of the doors automatically starts to close and Harris sticks his hand in to stop the door, which normally would have crushed his hand, but because he still wears the ring his the door does not fully close. This give him enough time to be saved from the flooding waters. There was an earlier scene in which his wife asks him why he still wears the ring since they have separated. When I chose my own wedding ring I opted for a titanium band known for its extra strength. I can't help but think of that scene every time I look at my own ring.Much of the dialogue in the Abyss is of the heavy handed, clichéd variety that Cameron brings to pretty much all of his movies. Some of the extemporaneous characters bring little to the overall movie and help distract the viewer from the main plot. I think Cameron has done a very good job with the two main characters though. Ed Harris does a remarkable job playing his role as 'boss' on the rig while still hackling with his wife. Mastrantonio also does a fine job of portraying the tough as nails ""Lindsay"" while still remaining feminine and sympathetic.The directors cut ending is much debated in the online world. While it serves to clarify what was a rather abrupt and confusing ending in the original it also becomes quite preachy and is at a loss for any type of subtlety. Cameron attacks his anti-war message like Ripley against an Alien.Even with some awful dialogue and a preachy ending the Abyss has still managed to be one of my favorite sci-fi movies. James Cameron creates a tension like a master auteur and creates two of his best characters to date.",The Abyss

I won't go over the plot details here except to say that the extended cut makes a lot more sense than the theatrical cut- especially the ending. The extended cut of this movie is long, but it is so worth the time. The performances, plot, script, directing, design, sound, everything in this movie is so well done, which is simply incredible when you find out just how hard this film was to make.Watch the making of video to really understand. I think it really gives you an appreciation for how hard all of the actors and crew worked on this. Most of the time I think the average person could look at an actor and say their job is probably harder than the actor's- not on this. The technical and safety challenges alone of working under water like this are beyond anything most of us experience. Ed Harris's scenes in the liquid suit in particular required him to perpetually hold his breath for long periods of time... 40 feet under water! Just doing that violates every rule of SCUBA alone- you never hold your breath...EVER. Even if your regulator pops out of your mouth you maintain an even, slow exhalation until you get it back in.Another pivotal scene is the CPR scene. Again, everyone is doing an amazing job, but Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was put through hell for that scene, and between her willingness to do that and the performances of the other actors you get a scene that is just incredible.So anyway, watch this movie, if nothing else for the enormous amount of effort that the cast and crew put into it.

198,shortround8391,An underwater adventure that is among the greatest......,10,17 April 2009,"""The Abyss"" was the first underwater film by film-making genius James Cameron. In less than 10 years after ""The Abyss"", ""Titanic"" came and swept the Oscars and the box-office with ease. And then in the 00's, he made a few underwater documentaries, but still has yet to make a real film (which he will, in 2009 with ""Avatar"").And ""The Abyss"" is freaking excellent, and it's got everything, acting for the realism lovers, a story for the film lovers and special effects for the action/sci-fi lovers.It tells the story of a diving team that are forced by the marines to search for a missing nuclear submarine that was sunk by an extra-terrestrial alien species. Once the Navy SEALS reach down to the diving team, the leader of the SEALS starts to become more and more paranoid and schizophrenic and hatches a plan to steal a nuclear warhead and use it on the aliens while believing it to be the Russians. And also the head of the diving team also has to go on this mission while dealing with his ex-wife.James Cameron has always been known for giving his characters very human personalities and characteristics. And there's this one scene at the beginning when the whole diving team are all singing along to a song on the radio which shows off their goofiness and the human nature that we all have.""Goddammit, you bitch! You never backed away from anything in your life! Now fight!""-Bud Brigman Ed Harris who plays as the central character Virgil ""Bud"" Brigman, is at his best. Bud is basically, as i said before, a very human and vulnerable character, and although he frequently makes jokes and taunts his soon-to-be ex-wife, Lindsey (Mary Mastrantonio). But deep inside, he's very troubled and still loves his wife which is evident when he throws his wedding ring into the toilet and then goes through the trouble to get it back. Also, after the film's 2nd hour, he tries to resuscitate his wife in the one of the best scenes of the movie, you can totally see Harris' acting skill in there. And Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is excellent as Bud's wife and displays the right emotions at the right time, like when she and Bud start to re-connect towards the end and when he about thousands of feet below her.""It went for the warhead, and they think it's cute.""-Hiram CoffeyAnother high-point performance is Michael Biehn as the insane Hiram Coffey. Everything Biehn does in here justifies the claim that he should've gotten an Oscar for this. As soon as Coffey enters the rig, you can tell that there's something about him that is sinister and when his hand starts shaking, you feel like that theory is proved correct. It is to this day, the most realistic portrayal of a delusional man suffering from pressure-induced paranoia, and I've never seen an actor perform like that in my life. And we all must be wondering why Biehn never got the recognition he deserved.And the other supporting actors are totally memorable and likable because of their humanity, and that's what James Cameron does best. And after seeing this movie you can remember all their names right off the bat: Hippy, Catfish, One-Night and Jammer. And they each got their gimmicks, like Hippy with his pet white rat and Catfish with his fist that used to be called ""The Hammer"". And like in ""Predator"" and ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"" makes you care about and wanna see an individual movie on each character to show you more of him/her. But the world ain't perfect, so we may never get to see that happen.The special effects were great and totally ahead of its time, and the water tentacle completely blew me away and I wonder how they did that since modern film studios can't do that if their life depended on it. And I think that tentacle was probably the inspiration for the boss ""Morpha"" in that Legend of Zelda game. The aliens and the mother-ship were very well-done and Cameron would only get better with the special effects in Terminator 2.Also, Cameron's directing shows us a story about the survival of humanity and how we might be destroying ourselves. And that's what the aliens show Bud at the end when gets onto their ship. And they plan on sending a massive tidal wave to wipe everyone out. But after seeing Bud's message to wife, they realize that not all humans deserve to die, so they spare them.And as for the adrenaline rushes, you're gonna be relying on the thrills mostly. The part when the rig gets damaged and a few people drown is one of the best edited and one of the most suspense filled sequences ever. And when Brigman and Coffey face off in a brief fight scene, basically has James Cameron written all over it. And the sub chase is another one worth mentioning.""The Abyss"" is just another one of the greats that James Cameron has to offer, and he is only gonna be making more in the future.",The Abyss
199,Pinky-12,James Cameron does again.,9,14 January 1999,"Once again, James Cameron has done it again. As with Aliens and The Terminator, he has masterfully created a movie that is as entertaining as any other, and it runs almost three hours.  There is action, drama, comedy, and science fiction together with some of the most amazing special effects seen in a long time.  The acting is great, the story even better.  This movie is a must see for anybody, no matter what your taste. RANKING = 9 of 10",The Abyss
200,Theoriginaltruebrit,Better the second time around.....,10,29 November 2001,"I have always loved this movie.  I have it on video and have watched it many many times.  However, last year I was in a hotel in Charlotte on New Years Eve and turned on FX on the tv.  They were showing the movie so of course I watched it while I was getting ready to go out.  What I saw was a movie that finally made sense.  Immediately I realized that the movie I had been watching had been ""butchered"" at the editing stage for the sake of time.  I then had to have the ""special edition"" and now watch only that one and not the other.  The special edition finally explains everything and I think if I had been James Cameron I would have been thoroughly ticked off to have to edit the movie to the extent that the original was cut.  The ""special edition"" is the only one to watch because it is the only one which explains several of the previous ""plot holes"" in the movie.   The final scenes, with the tidal waves, are absolutely brilliant and give a nudge to the idea that while human beings think they are all powerful they are in fact infants in a more advanced universe.  Watch ""The Abyss"" in it's cut form for the sheer brilliance of the story and the brilliance of the special effects, then watch the special edition for an explanation of the story.  This is one of my all time favourites and I will always give it a 10.",The Abyss
201,rjpurves,What's going on?,3,19 November 1999,"You know, James Cameron supposedly started writing the script for The Abyss when he was 15 or so. Director's cut or studio version, I find it dull and uninteresting. If Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's character is such a b**ch then why doesn't she ever act like it? Why do the under sea creatures suddenly change their minds in the director's cut? And spectacular the CGI effects and action sequences are, these a film doth not make.",The Abyss
202,kdryan,An excellent Movie... (Light Spoilers),8,20 May 2000,"Minor spoilers included.
   I sat through the Special Edition of ""The Abyss"" tonight and was awed by the difference between the original and the new versions of this film.  28 minutes of footage certainly did make a difference in this case as the original release left so much to guess that it was almost incomprehensible. The added back story, the additional scenes showing the waves, the added country song (though I am a confirmed Rock -n- Roll fan) all added up to make a movie that almost breaks the rule about the book being better.I can't understand how people can look at this film and say it was boring. We have here a nutbag with a nuclear weapon at his disposal.  We have a deep sea crew trapped under water during a hurricane. We have the menace (hmmphh...) of an unknown entity out ""there.""  We have an underwater chase and demolition derby with submersibles.  Oh, and for good measure, the habitat is about six inches from falling into a 2 1/2 mile deep trench.  I think that the set that find this movie boring are the type who prefer movies like ""Con Air"" and the like where there are no deeper issues to think about and everything is nice and cut & dry at the end.  Not that there is anything wrong with pure action movies, but you really shouldn't limit yourself.     ""The Abyss"" also violates the ""Chris Elliot Rule of Unwatchable Movies"" which states that any movie Chris Elliot is in is inherently bad and should be avoided at all costs.",The Abyss
203,bfg-5,In inner-space no-one can hear you scream....,9,8 November 2000,"The Abyss was a watershed movie for me when I saw it back in 1990. It confirmed to me that there where other forms of movie to watch than shoot-em-up, cowboy & Injun, black hat, white hat movies out there. OK it has a science fictiony theme, but, the backdrop is human interest, character development and stunning, stunning cinematography. James Cameron showed his worth in this much better than the overblown Titanic he's best known for. All in all this movie is one of the best ways I know to pass a quiet evening, and, so far I've passed that evening dozens of times to date. Good job DVD's don't wear out.",The Abyss
204,pal-o-lo,Whow! what a undersea journey!!!!!!,10,7 November 2004,"I have seen this movie many times now, and each time it succeeds to make my heart pound wildly against my ribcage. the suspense, the mystery, the paranoia! It gets me each time. The acting is simply top notch by all actors. Mary Elisabeth and Ed were as always fantastic, but amazingly all the other actors followed up their performance with a fantastic of their own. Especially, I want to mention That guy who played Lt. Coffey. I am sad to say I don't know his name, but his performance as the Seal who is loosing his mind, is one of the most chilling performances I have seen. Those eyes were incredible!!!Further, the lighting and camera use were fantastic. You really feel that you have joined them underseas. Okay, the ending is really far out there, but what the heck, IT WORKS!!!!! It is so incredibly cool when they.... Okay, i wont tell you. You have to see the movie your self to know. It is well worth the time and money. Run to your nearest video shop and rent it!!!",The Abyss
205,northfacingphotography,A true masterpiece,10,12 March 2019,"There are very few movies that I've seen and have felt like I witnesses something truly special. The Abyss was one of those films. I remember going back to the theater over and over (as I was 14 on release) to watch it. Its still just as good. The physical sets, the subs, the lack of CG make it timeless. I know, there is that water tentacle thing and that was bleeding edge for its time. It still looks good. It has been a while, but seeing Aquaman reminded me of some of the beauty that was put in this movie both visually, story telling, and musically. The extended version give the NTI more ""teeth"" which I enjoyed but the run time was already very long. I can't help but love the casting and the acting along with superb directing. One of the great science fiction movies of all time for what my opinion is worth.",The Abyss
206,LordBlacklist,Special Edition is a must,10,8 February 2006,"In it's original form The Abyss is an absolutely brilliant film. I cannot begin to explain how different my viewing experience of the Special edition was from the severely truncated theatrical version. To sum it up, the special edition is a richly thematic and far more resonant experience, the difference between a good movie and a truly great film. Perhaps Cameron spends too much time in the beginning of the picture explaining the technology and how it works but I believe that knowledge only helps one immerse themselves into the world of the characters. The Abyss is actually three films; a technological thriller, a love story, and a lesson in basic morality. This is definitely a movie that warrants your full attention since the details are so vastly important to the whole that if you were to step out for five minutes (which no one should ever do!) you would become completely lost. This film has some of the most amazing scenes I have ever seen in film, and they are quite diverse. One would have to be the scene where Linsday chooses to drown and be taken back to the rig by Virgil...the real human element of that scene that struck me was when the water level started to rise over her neck, she doubts that it was a good idea. I can feel her fear as she desperately tries to keep her head above the rising water. Immediately following is the scene where Virgil revives Lindsay, screaming for her to fight while everyone else thinks he is crazy for trying to bring back what appears to be Linsday's corpse. That entire scene is so gut wrenchingly emotional that it's a good thing that there are a few quiet scenes afterward...we need to catch our breath, but then this also has to do with Cameron's storytelling, he knows we do too. The biggest moments of goose bump inducing awe that this film gave me came only from the special edition...the whole reason for the NTI's being there is explained and the reason they didn't go through with using the wave to wipe out mankind was because of Bud's own self sacrifice. It's hard to comment on a movie you love without getting incoherently jumbled, but this one will always be special to me because it does one thing that many films these days do not: it makes me feel something.",The Abyss
207,behamut,Really cool,9,22 September 1998,"First off, Cameron, what more can you say? After his success with Aliens, James Cameron made Abyss.  The hardest movie in history to make.  Over 40% of it was actually shot under water and all the actors had to become certified swimmers.  Ed Harris actually almost drowned in one of the takes. An interesting twist between a love story, suspense, action, and aliens (not Aliens). A deep-sea oil rig crew is told that a top secret Navy Seals team has come to board them to investigate a downed nuclear sub-marine.  In the course of this, they encounter an underwater alien species.  One of the navy seals (Michael Beign) goes berserk from the pressure and thinks the aliens are potentially dangerous and the rest of the crew is against him.  Stealing one of the nuclear subs missles, he tries to destroy the alien race and jeopardizes the whole crew. In the directors cut, there is about a half hour of restored footage which shows why the aliens are there and how they plan to destroy the human race because of how they fight amongst each other.  The directors cut and the ""regular"" edition are basically the same movie but very different story lines.  The directors cut added a lot more background info but just wasn't as enjoyable as it had a different feel to it.  The original wasn't as informative but a lot more fun to watch.",The Abyss
208,KMM,Director's cut is a great cinematic experience,8,16 February 2004,"I really enjoyed the theatrical version of this film when it first came to home video. I then saw the director's cut of the film and felt that an entertaining movie became a fantastic one. In the theatrical version it seemed as though the aliens kind of popped up at the end to save Ed Harris. The director's cut is by far a much better viewing experience because it gives more depth and reasoning for why the aliens are there and what there purpose is.   It has some underlying messages in the film about the dangers of nuclear war, but that was seen in many of James Cameron's flicks from the original Terminator thru True Lies.  Some of the characters are a little annoying at times, but I felt The Abyss is a great roller coaster ride with its action sequences.  The movie also did a great job in making the viewer claustrophobic at times, especially in the diving scenes aboard the sunken sub.  It amazes me that there is some negative feedback that appears on the IMDB regarding this film. I sit there thinking to myselfwhat film did that person watch? You only have to watch the documentary, Under Pressure: Making The Abyss, to have respect for the finished product, and an all-new respect if you have seen the film already.  Don't listen to the negative feedback about The Abyss.  Decide for your self by watching the director's cut today. It is a great cinematic viewing experience.",The Abyss
209,MarkCrozier,Classic Cameron!,9,24 December 2011,"Boy, do I miss James Cameron. By that I mean Classic Cameron, not the Cameron of Avatar fame. To me Classic Cameron is best represented by three movies: The Terminator, Aliens and The Abyss. To me these three represent the highest pinnacle of mainstream action movies. Of the three, The Abyss is the least perfect but its got a permanent place in my collection of movies that blew my mind and made me the movie freak I am today. The thing I love about this film is that it takes you to a whole new place. For me, that is what movies are about. Any movie that can convincingly transport me to a different time or place is a success in my mind. And The Abyss achieves that in spades. The second thing that makes The Abyss a great movie are the characters, in particular the three main leads. I think Ed Harris' character is one of the greatest and most believable action heroes of all time. Forget Tom Cruise, Bruce Willis, Schwarzenegger, Stallone... Ed Harris as Bud Brigman is The Man as far as I'm concerned. He never strikes a false note once during the entire 2,5 hours, even at the end which is the movies weakest point. Then there's Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Wow, what an awesome female character. Strong, fearless, yet so believable. Cameron writes 'em like nobody else. Their relationship is also really convincing and touching. I never fail to tear up when I watch the climatic scene when Bud revives Mary Elizabeth. It just kills me. Finally there is Michael Biehn as the inimitable Lt Coffee. I mean, come on! Has there ever been a more sinister bad guy? I don't think so... Michael was, of course, absolutely fantastic in Terminator but I think he achieved the pinnacle of his career as Lt Coffee in Abyss.Apart from that, there is so much else to enjoy here... the awesome underwater setting, the relentless action, the mind-blowing special effects, the humour, the unforgettable characters. My only regret is I somehow missed it on the big screen. But when I finally get that 40-inch HD flatscreen, you can bet the first movie I'll watch on it will be the Abyss. Classic Cameron!!",The Abyss
210,hipcheck,An unexpected miracle of a film,10,8 September 1998,"The Abyss had two things going against it, after production was wrapped (for the story of one of the most incredible productions ever, see the Laserdisc ).  First of all, There were two copycats, Leviathan, and Deep-Star Six, that managed to open before this film, making the original seem like the copycat.  Secondly, the movie was cut down horribly by the studio, something which Cameron takes the blame for, saying that no one wants to see a three-hour movie (well, maybe Titanic!).  The studio cut made the film no better than a very good f/x film, with a strong, but muddled story, and some really interesting characters, to go along with the usual brilliant Cameron visuals.Since its release as a ""Director's Cut"", I have managed to sway each person who has seen it, into dubbing it a ""spectacular piece of cinema.""  With the added scenes, the story makes sense, the finale has the right knockout punch, and the love story really takes center-stage.What the full version offers, is truly one of the great Hollywood love stories of our time, with one of the greatest scenes in recent years.  This is really a film for everyone, with unparalleled visuals, a tense story, and a terrific message, that love can conquer all.  If you have the chance, don't miss out on the Director's Cut, on as big a screen as you can find!",The Abyss

212,gheremond,Cameron's best?,9,18 August 2015,"This is my personal favorite of Cameron's. It showcases all his strengths and is 100% his child (unlike Aliens). His love for scuba diving gave birth to this unique deep sea adventure that manages to blend several genres, is loaded with seminal scenes and even has a Spielberg-like sense of wonder infused to it.If you bother to read up on the production of this film, you'll realize this was perhaps the single most difficult movie ever made. Huge underwater sets, remote controlled model submersibles, custom built scuba gear, life-size bio-luminescent puppets, ground-breaking CGI, the list goes on and on. The amount of work and attention to detail that went into this film is just crazy and it shows on every frame. 25+ years later, the quality of the production in the Abyss is a sight to behold. I cannot think of another movie that was considered an effects marvel back in the day and still holds up that well after all these years. Just looking at the bio-luminescent aliens in the Abyss puts Cameron's own work on Avatar to shame. What's more, the Abyss is filled with great action and is ideal for repeated viewings, despite its rather long run time. The final part of the film, where the mysteries of the abyss are revealed, will make your jaw drop and incorporates some stupendous sci-fi imagery, complemented by Alan Silvestri's majestic score (his finest work).The very best in deep sea adventures. Oh, and stick to the original version of the movie, strange as it sounds, it is a lot better than the director's cut.",The Abyss

217,petersaarloos,It's all downhill from here,6,4 March 2019,"This movie deserves a watch for anyone who finds the deep sea as scary as I do. It succeeds in being constantly frightening just because of its location and atmosphere. Ed Harris also has some amazing scenes.However, some have described it as boring, and they're not wrong. If you're more insensitive to the gaping blackness of the deep, you're really just looking at a three hour plot leaking with holes, unnecessary drivers, a horrible script and artificial and childish suspense, with an unnecessary romance shoveled in.It's remarkable to me how bad James Cameron is at making a believable story with something that resembles real dialogue. All dialogue exists to explain obvious things or to fill plot holes.It's his best movie in my opinion, but as you may have gathered, I don't think that's saying much.",The Abyss
218,ChrisMIN43211,one of my favorites,9,14 May 2003,"First of all, this is a review of the special edition version I first saw about five years ago. The Abyss is one of my all time favorites, even better than Titanic, which, like The Abyss, was directed by some hack whose name is James Cameron. First of all, what I love about The Abyss are the special fx, including the first appearance of the INT's, if I am correct. Then there are the performances by the leads, Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. One great scene for me is when Mastrantonio's character Lindsey has apparently died and Bud, played by Harris, attempts to revive her. It is an phenomenal shift from tragedy to relief, and as a guy, I will readily admit to have shed a tear. And all the moments of action and suspense, plus the end where the tables have turned and it is Bud who seems to have been lost forever after diffusing the bomb (another cut-the-wire situation).",The Abyss

If this had been a little more successful at the boxoffice, Ed Harris would have gotten an Oscar nomination, and I thing Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio would have too.And this movie also offers something no other movie does, two versions, one high-octane roller-coaster thrill ride (Theatrical Cut) and one which adds dept and character, a version when you want to get touched by a movie (Special Edition).",The Abyss
221,steve_baillargeon,Aquaphobic and awesome movie,8,18 March 2006,"Wow, what to say after seeing The abyss ? I'd say that it's a very awesome movie, and it shows very well that James Cameron is very talented. He made very good movies, like The Terminator, Aliens and this one, who's a sci-fi movie which plunges you to the deepest reaches where you've never been before.The alien life form which is made only of water in the station is very eye-popping for a 1989 movie, and I was glad to know that all of them were good with humans instead of bad like in many movies. They don't want humankind to kill each other, so they warm the entire population of Earth with a giant wave, which terrorize everyone in the peak of Cold war.Also, I like the aquatic world and all the scenery of The abyss, especially the submarine research station. There's many times when I felt nervous: when the station went to the deeps after the crane crashed in the sea and hit it, and when Lindsey almost died drown. When she recovered, I was happy that all the members managed to reanimate her.It was a very brilliant idea to make a so awesome sci-fi movie, cause it's a different one of the whole kind. But seeing it can make you aquaphobic (haha just kidding), but it also worth the extreme effort to gain a wonderful and superb experience.Steve Baillargeon",The Abyss
222,jonathandewaal,NTI's,9,1 January 2021,I absolutely love this movie! I'm an avid scuba diver and love the underwater realm.

I saw it again a few days ago and I have to admit I still like this one.(spoilers here) The Abyss sometimes lacks tension, and is divided into three sub-plots: a family movie with soon-to-be-divorced husband and wife reuniting again, a cold-war (?) movie with a S.E.A.L. commander strongly believing that the Reds have sunken US submarine and should be nuked for that, and a science fiction thriller about an alien race living deep in the ocean and their encounter with the human race. However, these three ""sub-movies"" are put together well, and the final effect is really good, despite the saccharine ending.This flick costed about 70,000,000$ and never was a blockbuster, but now has a group of diehard fans.

Bud's estranged wife, Lindsey, who designed their submarine platform, joins them with a team of Navy Seals. Soon, everything combines to stop them and endanger their lives  from a storm that isolates them from the surface to the Seal captain's depth sickness that makes him dangerously mad. Bud finds it quite hard to impose his views (""When it comes to the safety of these people, there's me and then there's God, understand?""). But their ordeal leads them to discover something much greater, much more awe-inspiring than a mere nuclear submarine Let's ignore the infantile morals and typical American values (although one has to admire how they determinedly strive to find every way to shoot their weapons and kill each other in the most unlikely places). The movie is well made, the creatures are beautiful, the underwater scenes are quite skillfully shot and there even are some attempts at humor  Ed Harris style.",The Abyss
226,Gabriel_Kuntze,Overrated Hollywood Garbage,3,20 December 2020,"My God, what a huge letdown this movie was. It starts off pretty good, with a submarine that crashes after a strange encounter with an unidentified underwater vessel. Then, a group of ridiculous cliched divers are recruited to find it and check for survivors, with the help of cardboard cutout navy seals.Is this movie an adventure? A romance? A mystery? A sci-fi? Well, it's none of these. It mixes every single plot you can imagine, and the result is an incoherent mess that doesn't really know what it's trying to be. I was surprised at how predictable this movie is: pretty much every single plot point is called in advance. The married couple who ""hated"" each other, the fat guy saying he can hit hard, the breathing underwater, the ridiculous plan of drowning but reviving because the blood is cold, etc. I could almost hear Crow's voice yelling ""plot point! plot point!"" every time a character made an obvious comment about something that would happen later.So anyways, after the initial 15 minutes the movie forgets the whole ""finding for survivors"" thing and becomes a disaster movie, in which this gang, which is composed by people who doesn't behave like normal human beings like, at all, tries to mantain their sub working. Then, aliens show up, but they may as well never been there because they have no relevance to the plot. Seriously, take them away or replace them with whales or something and nothing changes. Meanwhile, the movie goes on an on, it's so long it feels like an eternity, I haven't been so incredibly bored in a while.The part which disappointed me the most was the fact that the abyss is barely shown. I was always fascinated by the untold mysteries of the darkness below the depths, and I tought this movie would try and tell me more about them. Sadly, most of the action happens inside submarines, with people running in them and shouting random phrases related to, well, submarines. I guess it could be exciting if you like submarines.
At no point I felt they were below hundreds of meters of water. When they do show the outside you can barely see a couple of rocks and machines moving slowly, they may as well be in a small river. You don't see any fish, plants, anything, just a blue background and some rocks. So impressive.The ending is more Hollywood garbage, I stopped caring like an hour and a half. The characters are all so bad I couldn't force myself to give a damn about them. As a positive point, I do have to say that the special effects are quite good for 1989, but sadly good movies are more than just special effects.Just avoid this thing, it's overrated trash.

230,636,Nuclear sucks!,7,5 April 2000,"I bought the new special edition DVD of ""The Abyss"". I liked the DVD that showed how this film was made. I particularly liked finding out that it was filmed in an abandoned nuclear power building. The main theme of the movie is the madness surrounding nuclear weapons. All I could think about when I found out about where the film was made was ""Wouldn't it have been nice if they had abandoned the quest for the nuclear bomb and all things nuclear?"" Nuclear sucks!  Even though there have been societies that have lasted 2500 years without a single weapon being unearthed, it most certainly is not us. As much as I like the idea of other worldly life forms being highly actualized as the very benevolent creatures in ""The Abyss"", I am sure that the odds are they will be just as destructive as us. I found the special effects in this movie to be ground breaking and I appreciated them even more knowing how hard it was to do them. I liked the Director's special edition version the best. I think ""The Abyss"" is a seminal film and if you are a James Cameron fan then ""Under Pressure: Making The Abyss"" will show you a very interesting profile.",The Abyss
231,fwhichard-344-426261,"Stunningly Beautiful, Fractured Story",5,27 February 2021,"When I first saw The Abyss I was totally blown away by the cinematic beauty of the film. This movie is a masterpiece of cinematography. Every moment of imagery is still etched in my mind. Going back and watching the movie recently for a third time, I just can't reconcile the narrative elements. It seems to me the screenwriters wrote about 5 or 6 short films which Cameron then linked together to make what I still believe is a really fine movie experience. But the lack of a connected link from the beginning of the film to end leaves me slightly pained and dissatisfied. And I don't mind films that don't follow the standard 3 act narrative structure. I love Memento, Magnolia, and hundreds of films that break with traditional structure. But those films have scenes and acts that are connected. Viewers can follow the storyline, challenging as it may be. The Abyss proves that great actors, cinematographers, and directors can almost never overcome a clunky script.",The Abyss
232,luannastarster,The Abyss not at all extraordinary.,2,3 September 2019,"This movie is one that in concept seems interesting, but it is not. The story is very unrealistic and silly if you think a little. The plot and the dialogues are a joke, full of cliche. Watching the Director's version, then it was 2 hours and 44 minutes of winding that lead to nothing. When it arrived in the first hour it was already very bored. When Alien appeared I was disappointed. I really thought it was a science fiction and not an environmentalist fiction. This premise is very overrated, not a good movie.",The Abyss
233,DB-55,Spectacular but with unsatisfactory ending.,7,6 October 1999,While not the greatest Cameron movie at all time it's still pretty good. Ed Harris and( the vastly under-rated ) Michael Biehn manage to hold their own in what is basically a visual spectacular movie. Credit to Cameron for fleshing out the character parts sufficiently so that the human side of the movie is not overwhelmed by effects. The special edition is by far the better version to see. At times very gripping (the nuclear sub interior scenes and also the scenes where the mini-sub is flooding are stand outs) and overall very well made but the ending is less than great. The concept of the ending ( I won't spoil it and give it away ) is o.k but the feel does not match the mood of the main portion of the movie. A little less Disneyesqueness and more grit would have seen a much more satisfying end to basically a very good movie.,The Abyss
234,pharaoh-008,A Cameron original,10,19 August 2001,"Cameron (director) is always very strong in telling a fanastic tale with carefully chosen caracters. I think no movie ever is shot 40% under water. And no one ever will, because of the now possible computer generated effects. Cameron wanted everything built real time and in original size, so they built the complete station in a tank of a never finished nuclear power plant.The wonders the movie brings, the situations the cast creates, shortly said: it's a ride!!! Be prepared for a Cameron original.

237,Myssi from McF,My personal favorite,10,2 July 2004,"As a huge movie fan people attend to ask me my favorite movie. It's difficult to answer because there are so many excellent movies but if I'm forced to name one I always say Abyss. Oh yes, Abyss is the movie what includes all the major parts what makes a great film for me. It's sci-fi, it's action, it make you cry and it's 100% James Cameron qualityMovie is about underwater oil workers which are involved in a nuclear sub conflict what got something to do with extra-terrestrial life forms.  The best part in the movie, (in every James Cameron movie) is that even the plot is pure sci-fi it has been made so well that it doesn't feel supernatural at all. Master film `tweaker' Cameron has made the film with such a focused way that you can almost feel yourself diving with the crew. Part of the Cameron movie realism is that he tries to shoot everything in real places like in Abyss the actors were acting in a underwater station what was really put underwater. They were using the liquid oxygen for real and diving without any gear if that was necessary. No doubt that some actors don't want to work with Cameron anymore but the main thing is that the movies are great!Abyss is extremely fluent movie. Plot has action and drama well balanced with fancy twists. Cutting is made with extra care giving the film a perfect mood and pace and actors are giving their best to make believable scenes. Music is powerful and when needed very beautiful as well.  Cameron has taken everything out from the water element and the shots underwater are just overwhelming.I suggested everybody to watch the director's cut of the film witch I prefer to be the one and only version having included over 30 minutes extra material compared to the theater version. In dir. Cut you'll find plenty little details and answers what are left outside of the `normal version'. This is the movie what I'll watch at least one time in a year and every time I'm surprised of its perfection. Simply the Best!",The Abyss
238,Elliotdoesreviews,I liked it,7,5 February 2021,"Ed Harris gives us practical and engaging tips on how to perform CPR on a dead person and bring them back to life by calling them a bitch and following up with a hefty slap to the grill. Michael Beihn, who is my favourite actor of the 80s, does his best impression of someone having a hypoglycaemic episode in a snickers commercial and tries to nuke some underwater aliens, which is fair because he's only following on from his experiences with Sigourney Weaver where the aliens were less friendly aquatic creatures and more so assholey and acid-y. There's some oxygenated pink goo stuff too.",The Abyss

In fact almost nothing in this movie makes it feel old or of wrong decade, and that is the real magic of this film . Watching in the 90s -00s or even '19 , the effects , story and acting is on par with anyting made today .Everything is shot in real surroundings meaning no cheesy bad blue screens .

241,Tom-91,Two films -- one a masterpiece,10,15 July 2007,"There are two definitive versions of this film: the theatrical release which was an outstanding work of science fiction. The Director's Cut is transcendent of being ""science fiction"" in any traditional sense. It is simply breathtaking in its scope and commentary on the human condition as the Cold War still raged (though who would know that it would soon be over).The key addition to the Director's Cut is what I would term ""The Deluge"" or the ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" ending. Brigman, thought to be dead is brought aboard a wondrous alien spacecraft, the likes of which have never been seen in film, and without words are shown the evils of humanity, just as the aliens threaten to destroy the planet with giant water waves. This is interspersed with TV interviews of Americans who are afraid of the escalation of war, but seem very powerless to stop it (a very common feeling in the Cold War era of the 70s and 80s). But, in seeing Brigman's final message to his wife, the aliens' judgment is stayed .... it is done with a great deal of drama without getting melodramatic, and with very little dialog. How this scene was permitted to be dropped from the theatrical release is mind boggling. This scene IS the film.The other scene ... the one that was not cut from the theatrical release (Lindsay's drowning) easily ranks among the great scenes in film history. I'm not sure how far fetched it was .... I could see professional divers scoffing and saying ""ludicrous"". This is a great example of where the supporting cast is so critical to making something so unbelievable look so believable. James Cameron uses quick cuts among the crew to get very fast reactions of sadness, despair, concern that visually makes the reactions look believable instead of acted or forced. They are overshadowed by Ed Harris' hysterical rant, but they help provide the grounding that keeps the scene believable.The acting and writing are great, though several one liners are handed around to the various characters, Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio give truly beautiful performances ... two people in love who really don't know how to balance everything, and end up walking away from each other until they are forced back together (in some ways, their characters' relationship was very indicative of the 1970s-1980s era as the divorce rate went up and people were finding it difficult to juggle marriage and career) .... it was a wholly believable relationship being portrayed. I have enjoyed Ed Harris in several films, and performances like this show why he is among the greatest working actors to never receive an Oscar .....Any fan of great story telling, compelling drama, or truly good applied science fiction must see the director's cut of this film. It is easily James Cameron's best work, with great works such as Terminator, Terminator 2, Aliens, and even his Titanic standing in the shadow of this work. The theatrical version would rank somewhere in the middle of his work.",The Abyss
242,Moses-7,Excellent film,10,26 March 2000,"As a fan of James Cameron films, I enjoyed this film highly the first time that I saw it, in my 8th grade science class.  Nothing could prepare me, however, for the special edition, which I saw on TV a few years later.  That blew me away so far that I refused to buy the film on video, since it was just the regular edition, until one day I happened to see the letterboxed edition of the special edition.  If you plan on watching this film or buying it, I strongly recommend getting this version, as it is far more superior.(SPOILERS BEGIN) Now, onto the plot.  Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are excellent as an estranged couple who fall in love with each other again after an extraordinary ordeal under the sea.  Michael Biehn (one of my favorite actors), is also excellent as a paranoid military man who begins to lose his grip on sanity.  And, the part that blew me away, of course, was Harris' descent into the abyss, and when the aliens bring him over the crest in sight of the totally awesome spaceship!  Then, thinking that there was nothing left to blow me away with, the aliens cut loose on mankind by making giant tidal waves to destroy humanity with!!!  You won't find that sub-plot in the regular edition, so look hard for the special edition, all you fans of Cameron or sci-fi. (SPOILERS END)Well, anyway, this is a very good film.  Although not Cameron's very best, it ranks up there as one of the best.",The Abyss
243,brett-donald,All hail James Cameron,10,4 February 2014,"One of my all-time favourites, thankyou James Cameron. It's long, but that suits the unique setting, and lets the tension build slowly, which makes it more effective. The cast is great; there is a palpable sense of camaraderie between them which is entertaining and suits the setting as well. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is just perfect, convincing us that she is a submersible oil rig designer. But the movie belongs to Ed Harris: the man is a born leader; and a more accessible one than Tommy Lee Jones. His acting in the resuscitation scene is absolutely electric. A great movie needs a great villain, too, and Michael Biehn manages to scare our pants off. The movie breaks new ground with both its underwater footage and its special effects: water is notoriously difficult to simulate, but it all looks amazing.",The Abyss

But this is during peak James Cameron so I decided to give it a shot. The cast does a great job humanizing this movie and make the dialogue feel fairly natural. There's an odd amount of hatred towards Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, is it cause her ad Ed Harris are having marital troubles? Is it because she's a woman? Is it because she's a scientist? It's never really explored but everyone just really doesn't like her. Michael Biehn plays the overly aggressive military guy very well. The movie is a little slow but it didn't feel overly dragged out. The underwater shooting is impressive and still holds up quite well. 7/10 I'll add this to the list of Cameron movies I can return to",The Abyss
245,sbash22,Overrated But Fairly Entertaining,5,7 December 2018,"When I first saw The Abyss back in the 1990s I vaguely remember thinking at the time that it wasn't anywhere near as good as some of the reviews were making it out to be. Having rewatched it in 2018, and the 3 hour Special Edition no less, I can confirm that it is indeed an overhyped and overrated movie, with sometimes decent/sometimes over-dramatic and theatrical acting, mediocre script, average directing and a soppy love story serving as it's backbone. Instead of really being a full-on sci-fi movie, for the most part it's sort of an underwater soap opera with a few ""alien scenes"" scattered in very sparsely for good measure.With that being said it is mildly entertaining for the entire duration so worth watching to kill a few hours but don't have any high expectations of seeing a sci-fi masterpiece. In reality, it only very loosely merits even being called a sci-fi!",The Abyss

It has amazing special effects well before it's time, with probably some of the first usage of CGI in movies. Everyone is bashing the ending but lemme tell you this: Before this movie came out they had no idea how to choose the ending, they had a few in mind, so they had an advanced screening showing all of the alternate endings, and people actually voted on which was the best ending, and this one won, so obviously SOME people like it!

It seemed very slow until the alien lifeform as the strange water arrived. Micheal Biehns fight with Ed Harris also seemed confusing. In my opinion when Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonios character would not have been revived that long after taking in so much water!I also read that the breathing with liquid scene was actually real and the mice really did experience it, which led to some versions of the film being cut due to veterinary complaints.The ending with the aliens just seemed cheap and rushed to me, and reminded me of the simpsons episode where they think there's an alien but it turns out to be Mr Burns on medication!All in all one very long winded and confusing under water sci-fi farce!",The Abyss

I am not very moved by special effects, so perhaps I am neglecting something that for other people is most important. When I watch a movie I try to think if it makes sense, even if it is science fiction; the special effects are important if they help to make a good story. The science fiction part of the movie is irrelevant and does not add anything to the story, except that provides the way to a happy ending.

The scene where she comes up with the idea of drowning, have Virgil drag her back to the base and revive her is one of my all time favorite movie sequences.  The diving sequence ain't bad either.

Because they were going to contribute to the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of people!Why did we not see many aliens?

256,myrddinfyrch,"Cameron's ""Director's cut"" is unsurprisingly an anti-American screed",3,19 July 2016,"Why the low rating? Same reason it's on the Sundance Channel - because I watched the Director's Cut, rather than the original theater version. This may be called the Special Edition but I have no interest in figuring that out any longer.I had enjoyed the theater version on DVD since the concept seemed a relatively benign underwater alien encounter. It seemed disjointed, I had seen on TV the filming difficulties, and James Cameron is a preachy anti-Christian scumbag who was miserable to work with, but yeah OK it was watchable and has some decent scenes.Sundance Channel, of course, is Robert Redford's pet cable channel, and Redford is another notoriously noxious anti-American kinda guy (who earned much of his wealth playing military heroes &c.) So I thought I'd be interested in seeing what wound up on the cutting room floor. I was horribly mistaken, sitting through 4 hours worth of this atrocity (commercials included though, so I have no idea what the real length was; Special Edition is reportedly almost 3 hours).First, the movie lost nothing by such substantial cutting. The theater version was often turgid, but that was due to bad direction. The portions cut out of the backstory that are NOT directed at the main theme don't account for much; there's some more bits about the failed marriage of the two primary characters but nothing that builds any better empathy. About the only meaningful thing is that Ed Harris is presented slightly more ""good ole boy"" and Mastrantonio a bit more arrogant bitch.The bulk of the difference which was cut from theatrical release deserved to be. With Cameron's intent included, the movie turns into a preachy, clumsy anti-American screed that fails on pretty much every level. The American-Soviet antagonism which is not much more than a backdrop in the theatrical version is instead the main plot: the Cold War is about to explode into nuclear confrontation purely on the basis of the sunken US sub and an at-sea collision. The SEAL team are monsters, rather than just having a crazy leader. The aliens conjure a world-wide tsunami with their water magic, only to cause the wave to stop, with subsequent scenes of mindless human rejoicing.There's additional dialogue from Harris on behalf of the aliens which is more of the same ""UFO angels won't destroy you... THIS TIME"" Apparently the only reason the aliens didn't wipe out most of humanity was Harris' goodbye message to Mastrantonio? You can find it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD3vOduCwu0THOSE are the grounds for the not-well-explained saucer-city rising to the surface at the end of the film. It seemed pretty meaningless in the theatrical release, but now it's an obvious threat by a superior intelligence that humans are evil and better stop acting like children or we'd be wiped out be the angelic aliens.",The Abyss

259,ColtSeavers,Close encounters of the wet kind,7,12 December 2006,"Yesterday evening, I watched this movie (the extended version) for the first time. I was expecting some wonderful underwater photography, and a lot of chills and thrills. In hindsight, I must say that: The cinematography is actually breathtaking! The sets are great! (claustrophobic, dirty, dark, complex). The SFX are good, even by today's standards. Harris' and Biehn's acting was very good, but all the other characters (including that terrible woman) were only by-standers. However, the SCRIPT is, uhm, well, ridiculous. First of all, it's obviously a rip-off from several earlier movies, like (e.g.) ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". What's worse: It's completely absurd. Who in the world would believe this stuff: ""A Navy SEAL gets psychotic and tries to nuke some aliens, who are residing in an underwater trench, by using a nuclear warhead from a submarine that was sunk by those very aliens, whom he - the navy seal - mistakes for the Russians""????I actually found the first 50-60 minutes very exciting (most of all: the exploration of the submarine). Great stuff ! But when the SEALS started to pursue their own ""secret mission"" I quit. I watched the rest of the movie somewhere in between amazement ('cause of sets, cinematography and SFX), and amusement ('cause of the laughable story). It's hard to feel thrilled by something that you know would never be remotely possible. ""Contact"" by Robert Zemeckis was much more believable - and thus, much more involving. What also sucked was the ""climax"" close to the ending: Monster waves, summoned by the aliens to intimidate and impress the earthlings (cf. The Day the Earth Stood Still), are stopped just before destroying everything. And all the people in the world (e.g. on the beach) cheer, applaud and probably live happily ever after. ""There comes a time in each man's life when he can't even believe his own eyes"" (Plan 9 from outer space). My such moment was when I watched the ending of this movie. Finally, the aliens' mother ship (cf. Close Encounters) looked as if Tron had tried to bake a pancake with handles (sic). Despite these major flaws, I give ""The Abyss"" a 7, because of the many strengths it also has.",The Abyss

You never backed away from anything in your life! Now fight!"". When he finally revives her, it is an intense emotional moment. I always get goosebumpsThe other scene that I love is at the end, when Virgil comes walking out of the alien ""craft"" and Lindsey and the rest of the Deep Core crew sees him, god that scene is powerful. I am filled with such joyOverall though, it has a great story and some awesome scenes. The effects are quite good.Any Sci-Fi fan would love this movie.

The script should never have made it out of Cameron's office alive after he wrote it;let alone have been made into a movie. The premise is what first got me interested: (An American Nuclear sub goes down with all hands and when some underwater-Oil-drillers try to rescue them, they discover something in ""The Abyss...""); but that only got me twenty minutes into the movie, at which point, I realized I had some TWO AND A HALF HOURS to go. (unfortunately, I watched the ""long-version."")There were three problems with this movie:Firstly, it attempted to be character-driven, but the actors kept changing how they played the parts every ten-or-so minutes (Especially Mary Elizabeth Whatever-her-last-name-is)Secondly, I felt it showed what was in ""The Abyss"" too early, and once I saw it, I was mad!Thirdly, the ending was outrageously stupid. (Although I won't give it away, you can see for yourself.)Despite these problems, the film did have a few genuine moments of thrill and suspense. See it if you must, but don't expect too much.",The Abyss
266,yo-saff-brig,Special Edition is Superb! The theatrical cut...not so much,10,8 September 2005,"This is one of my all time favorite films. James Cameron knocks it out of the park as he did with Aliens and The Terminator just prior. It works on so many levels and is one of the pioneers of CGI special effects. But for some reason this film gets no love, and today I found out why. Today I saw, for the first time, the theatrical cut of the film which doesn't even compare to the far superior director's cut. The whole extraterrestrial storyline seems so out of place and it would have almost worked better if he hadn't included it at all in the theatrical cut. The theatrical cut just didn't work for me and I can understand how the critics weren't so sweet on the film. The special edition director's cut is something no one should miss! With the added 28 minutes you get more colorful/in depth characters, a film that carries a stronger dramatic punch, a greater sense of wonder when the E.T.'s grace the screen , and reasoning behind why the beings have traveled to our earth and do what the do. This is a film that doesn't get the recognition it deserves based, probably, on the far inferior theatrical cut. This film is a real gem and a must see.",The Abyss
267,ernesthaka,Has the most amazing scene,10,18 May 2021,"Without spoiling, the scene when the couple has to swim back to the rig, is the most tragic, heroic and breathtaking ever, and is worth watching the movie only for it -- but the rest is great too!",The Abyss

At that time i didn't know who James Cameron was until i saw Terminator 2.Forget all about Cameron's other films that have guns blasting everywhere and car chases, this film is totally different, a submarine has crashed landed on the bottom of the ocean and its up to a team of oil workers to rescue it, what they find down there is beyond belief and a crew member going berserk.Ed Harris and Micheal Biehn star in this awesome spectacular sci-fi film that will have you bedazzled from start to finish.",The Abyss
269,ETL,THE GREATEST MOVIE (If you watch the director's cut),10,11 November 1998,The first time I saw the Abyss I saw the director's cut. It was a great emotional sci-fi drama about love life survival and the humanity of the time that the movie was made. The aliens in this movie are unlike any other. The drama is so emotional it literally puts you to tears. Watch the director's cut. The original version does the movie no justice.Movie rating. 10 out of 10 **********,The Abyss
270,sabbk,It goes deeper than you think...,9,4 August 2000,"first of all, a great movie. Good story, good characters and very good acting. And when you have seen how they made the movie you get even more respect for it. All the hours under water, filming, waiting, it is impressive...And the way the characters interact with the ""alien"" which in reality isn't even there is very cool... And the effects are good even today:)",The Abyss
271,yougogirl00,Incredibly moving undersea drama.,9,8 September 2007,"This is the movie that made me fall in love with Ed Harris. What a fantastic actor. The emotion he puts into this part is beyond compare. The movie itself is an epic of humanity. Threat of nuclear war. The near loss of loved ones. The connection between the characters and the audience is palpable. The mystery and beauty of the 'alien' life adds an added dimension to this 3-dimensional blockbuster of action, suspense, terror and yes, beauty. The characters each have their own distinct memorable personality and you feel for them (or dislike them, as the case may be) and share in their peril. Wonderful acting and pristine directing add up to one of my favorite movies of all time. Watch it. You'll be glad you did.",The Abyss
272,abrondz,A good film with a horrible ending,5,18 January 2009,"I liked the film until the ending. The plot was a bit confusing at first, but as the film developed, it turned out to be quite good. The aliens who could harness the power of the seawater were quite interesting and somewhat mysterious. I especially liked the navy SEALs who tried to arm the warhead on the underwater rig. Lindsey Brigman was a bit annoying at times, but nothing too bad.Had the film ended when Bud cut the wires to the warhead on the bottom of the abyss, I'd give it 9/10, but the ending ruined it. When the aliens took the shape of the water, it was mysterious, when they looked like little green men, it just looked like a cliché. Finally, when the alien city rose to the surface, it couldn't have been more of a Hollywood-style happy ending, which I've grown quite tired of over the years. It just felt to me like the ending was a last minute addition to the plot to make it less dramatic.",The Abyss
273,jon-hayward1,Buy one get one free - not a good idea!,2,8 February 2004,"The Abyss is very much two separate films in one. It's almost as if the producers got scared and tacked on a sci-fi sub plot to make sure all of James Camerons usual fans turned up at the cinema, and I think this is the movies downfall.Film A is a brilliant tale of a lost nuclear sub, a civilian diving team, a squad of Navy Seals charged with recovering the sub and the seals seriously deranged commander (brilliantly played by Michael Biehn, a very underrated actor). It has tension, incident and characters we grow to care about put into danger. In short, a very good film!Film B is Sci-fi hocum, underwater lost cities, big Close Encounters style space ships and some exceptional CGI effects. Oh yes, and the same characters as film A!Film B doesn't really kick off until the close of the Navy Seals storyline - just about the point in this long films running time that you're bum is starting to ache and you're seriously regretting that large cola you bought. It's not that either part is BAD, it's just that they don't gel together at all and you leave the cinema with the feeling that something somewhere is wrong. Unsatisfying is sadly the appropriate word.",The Abyss

But does that mean you shouldn't watch this one, absolutely not. I watched this movie so many times when I was a teenager that I don't have count. It's a classic!",The Abyss
275,mr-bricoleur,"One of my favorite movies, but I can't actually say its good",4,13 July 2007,"I love this movie - Or rather, I love the Director's Cut, because it goes so overboard with subplots upon subplots, building up to B-movie shots of mile high waves suspended above the worlds shorelines, with 100s of extras running in fear. It has communist paranoia, hurricanes, underwater adventure thrills, a largely unknown and extra-size ensemble cast (though I love Ed Harris), submarines, nuclear warheads, divorcés trapped in a small space, and yes, aliens. Its like 70s disaster flick meets Armageddon meets the day the earth stood still meets the hunt for red October. Its just awesome.The special effects are quite good, and while much of the story is implausible, it is thoroughly entertaining and there are even a few classic moments, such as when ed harris has to save the world by cutting the right wire, but can't tell which is which because he is relying on the yellow green light of glowsticks.It all builds to a peak of hysteria that leaves me in hysterics every time. So i can't decide how to rate it and went for the low rating to judge its artistic merit rather than entertainment value, which is 10/10.",The Abyss
276,beat-my-meat,So awful I turned it off after 20 minutes,1,11 September 2015,"I was only able to manage watching 20 painful minutes of The Abyss before turning it off. The dialog by today's standards was just horrific. I've watched a number of sci-fi movies from this era and none of them damaged my soul quite like this. The introduction of Lindsey Brigman was very clichéd. Yes Cameron we get it... she's the sassy intellectually gifted woman and the chief engineer aboard the submarine. With her status she's in charge of a bunch of male navy SEALS and surprise, surprise, they don't respect her.Briman's leader status is unbelievable and even her mere presence on a United States submarine is a joke in itself. Although women have been allowed to serve in the Navy for many years now, no woman ever went on a voyage in a US submarine until 26 YEARS after this movie was made!",The Abyss

Alright, so you should know what this movie is about, right? I'm not going to tell you again. What I will tell you is that this movie is a classic.

Its rather long, most of it is underwater(probably 90%) and the subject just might not be of interest to most people. The film itself is more known for its behind the scene shenanigans. The plot takes a bunch of civilian divers who go down to the trenches of the Ocean to recover a lost submarine. What they don't realize is that there are far more powerful forces at play here. The original version of the film was derided on release but a director's cut with additional footage sets most of the detractors straight. The last few minutes of this director's cut are rather good so watch this version of the film. Still, the film is just alright and nowhere on the level of say The Terminator or Titanic.",The Abyss

In his field James Cameron is one of the best, he is the master in making effects fit the story, not making a story fit the effects. Both the theatrical version and the special edition work as great films and could almost be viewed as two separate films, but if you haven't seen either I suggest you see the original first and then see the special edition, that way you will enjoy both, if you don't when you finally see the original you will feel like the film is missing something.

286,vvvallaton,Just another Hollywood blockbuster.,5,4 April 2006,"I just watched the director's cut and i have seen the theater version years ago. I don't get it really, why people give this movie so good reviews. This is pure Hollywood entertainment with great special effects and dull storyline. First of all it takes about a half an hour before the movie even gets started after the first sequence. Typical blah blah about oilworkers who have to go to save the world and main characters ""ex-wife"" which is not an ex just yet. And would you guess they will be together again in the end of the movie! You get the feeling here that after Terminator Cameron has wanted to try something else like shooting an action movie under the water. Well, it's a nice idea but the movie's story is not very interesting in the first place. The first half of the movie actually works pretty OK(after the half an hour start). Cameron mixes some scifi themes here which seems like a good idea at first but in the end of the movie it seems like a scriptwriter has got a little out of hand. It would have been nice if Cameron would have had the courage to leave something for the audience and maybe not to explain everything in the end. There is some nice mystery feeling when Lindsey first time sees the ""Alien"" and you get sucked very well in to the mood. And it actually works until the ridiculous ending where Bud Brighman is brought to the Alien's spaceship and they'll explain to him why they deciced to save the world. Movie loses it's credibility at once. Terminator works because the whole story is more like black comedy and there is some irony in it and Aliens 2 is just great action movie. Here you get the whole movie in under the seas just moving around, almost divorced couple finding each other again and kind aliens saving the world because they think that love is worth saving. And of course clumsy dialog and stupid oilworkes telling stupid jokes from time to time so things don't get too serious.",The Abyss

288,johnsoncooper,One of the most Underrated in Sci-Fi!!!!,10,22 January 2021,"This movie is very very enthralling. I remember first buying a 20th century Fox Sci-Fi movie collection. The movies I was intending on buying were Alien and Aliens, but I didn't plan on even watching the Abyss. Once I finished the first two masterpieces I was very curious, especially with all the stories of a hellish production that took place to make it. Being intrigued at how big the production it was I decided to put it in my Xbox blue ray player and watch. I was more than satisfied. A very claustrophobic and thrilling story, with very human characters that you can relate with. The acting was spectacular and emotional, they make you believe the struggles they are going through are real. Not to mention we get to see the failing marriage between two of the characters take place that ends in a satisfying romantic climax. No matter what the production brought the cast and crew to, they still went forward to finish this very well done film. This is definitely one of Cameron's best films he has ever done.",The Abyss
289,ain,Special Edition makes it better,10,8 July 2001,"Special Edition makes it better, it explains what are aliens doing there and what is their purpose in that movie and explains little more about the relationships between the main characters. I still don`t understand why directors let their films to be raped(cut shorter). Most of the movies that are been cut that way have lost a lot(ex. Terminator2, LEON, Can`t Hardly Wait etc. etc. .....).And sometimes the scenes that are cut out have very important part in the whole movie and so if it's cut out the whole story is changed and there`s nothing left of the original idea. I hope who ever makes those decisions would come to his senses and stop it. I don`t mind watching a 3hour GOOD movie. SO STOP CUTTING !!!",The Abyss

He gets another golden opportunity at military-bashing here, and his fans probably won't be disappointed. I, for one, got tired very quickly of the characters constantly yelling at and bickering with each other. None of them are particularly likable, especially the female lead. The constant efforts by the female lead's ""ex"" to make her like him again grow equally tiresome. As a subplot his obsession ends up overshadowing the rest of the story-line. The special effects in this film received a lot of critical praise, but by now they look a bit dated and predictable. Worse yet, they're simply too cutesy to be taken seriously. There were times when I thought I detected the telltale influence of Spielberg in this movie -- and I don't mean that as a compliment.",The Abyss

Back in '89, he had some SERIOUS MOJO going on when he made The Abyss. This film is incredible, with excellent character detail, cool camera-work and masterful direction; the result of which successfully puts the audience thousands of feet beneath the ocean surface. As a science fiction film, the premise could have been explored in a more convincing way, it's almost as if Cameron bit off more than he could chew and tried to chop and edit and squeeze it all into a two hour format, so it's worth seeking out the Director's uncut version to really get the whole picture as it was intended. All else aside, see this film for the outstanding scene with Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio... you will never forget it. Some of the best acting ever captured in modern film-making; it's almost better acting than the rest of the movie can handle.

The director's cut moves the focus of the story away from the people and onto one of the sub plots, making the sub plot more of the main plot. The strength of this film is the people. The Director's Cut leans more toward the plot of the ""book of the movie"".As to the film itself. It is tense and interesting and when things go wrong it doesn't feel like just another plot twist.

298,ofirgraizer,Different Kinds Of Gods,9,4 November 2000,"Well, The Abyss is definetly more than just an action-movie. 8 Years before James Cameron directed ""Titanic"", another water-movie, he made a film that has more than the usual that stands for thos Hollywood stuff - The Abyss is a religious movie. It deals not only with fighting, aliens, or submarines flying underwater - it's a film about salvation, redemption, and the seeking of a super-being, maybe samiliar to Stanley Kubrick' super-child from Space Odyssey. Just listen to what the characters say in the film, things such as ""When it comes to my men, it's between me and God"". What I'm saying is that the film actually says that there is someone watching us and cecking us, and it's not in the sky - no, it's inside of us, deep inside of us, in the Abyss. I may sound like a christian redneck preacher, but I'm an atheist myself, and just find the point of the movie beautifole. It's goes further with the special edition, when you actually see the light souroundinbg the men of the Deepcore as they see the city coming towards them. I love this movie because it takes familiar religious symblos and puts them on a very well-made action pack. In the final shot, you see those two lovers standing on the water. Alan Silvestri's music just has to do something with why it sounds like angels. This movie is an outstanding cinematic work. Cameron is a genious, underestimaited for its plots and stories. His movies are not just excellnt. they are deep. Really.",The Abyss

This is displayed in scenes such as when the character Lindsay talks about the 2 candles in the dark. We also have the suspenseful white knuckled sequences and the parts that just blow you away more than many films ever could.Out of all of Cameron's films, this shows off the best performances, best screenplay, story and directing out of all of them and is the most underrated.

Without ruining it for people who haven't seen it yet, all I will say is there is 2 very emotional scenes back to back with Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth that are one of the best scenes in movie history. Ed Harris performance in this film is the best of his career. Painstakingly directed under water, to say this is James worst film is insane. Cameron did an excellent job.

Acting goes over almost any other movie (not Requiem For A Dream), the characters are interesting. Special effects by ILM, Fantasy II, XFX, Dream Quest, Stetson Visual, Steve Johnson's XFX and The Design Settlers haven't got age a day. Music composed by Alan Silvestri is IMO the best score in his career. The few action scenes ar well done. And the NTIs remind me for some grown-up E.T.s.

304,jannayu-subaju,Excleelnt!,9,23 March 2012,"The Abyss was a movie of destiny. First off, this movie either began or was the result of a lifetime obsession James Cameron has the ocean (see later Titanic and his IMAX deep sea movies). The Abyss is also full of echos of claustrophobic thriller/adventure movie Alien, in which Cameron directed the sequel. So combining one of Cameron's old movies with his new obsession, we get The Abyss, a solid sci-fi thriller starring Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Ed Harris plays Bud, the head of an undersea oil rig where very little actually happens and the people on the rig are only there in case something goes wrong. Well, wouldn't you know it, but an American nuclear submarine patrolling the US coast near the oil rig suddenly sinks, killing the sailors on board. The Americans suspect it's the Soviets, but we know better. Something pink and glowing does something to the submarine causing it to sink. A team of Navy seals, ferried down to the rig by Bud's ex-wife Lindsey (Mastrantonio), boards the oil rig and uses it as a command base for their mission to recover the submarine. And that is when the fun begins. Of course a hurricane has to enter into the plot, in movies like this, there is always a hurricane, but beyond, The Abyss is a solid sci-fi thriller, where the oil rig becomes a character in the movie. Much like the Nostromo in Alien or The Discovery in 2001, the tight spaces adds flavor to the movie, bringing the setting in as another character of the movie. The special effects were groundbreaking at the time and hold up well today. The scene of a column of water snaking its way through the oil rig still creeps me out to this day.",The Abyss
305,johnflorencesullivan,Entertaining!,8,28 May 2021,"This big creative movie is extremely entertaining and engaging. While the pacing sometimes is slack or uneven, the sheer novelty of half the film being filmed underwater is quite riveting. The cast plays their roles heroically, given the innumerable supernatural trials to which they are subjected. Mere mortals would break quickly under comparable situations.Michael Biehn steals the first half of the film with his performance as Lt. Coffey. Every shot with him is top gold. He continuously broadcasts a kind of intensity that is at once terrifying and comedic. It's criminal that he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actor for this role.

Once great - now a little ropey - FX, cheesy and poorly reasoned dialogue, over-sentimentality bludgeoning it's way through the last 30mins? Check that too if you're so inclined. At it's (Deep)core it was a personal labour of love for James Cameron, the nautically interested (crazed?) Director, gene-splicing Sci-Fi and the Sea, and for that it's a worthy film - ""Respect the Sea"" is a heavy (and far better) sub-text to the frankly ludicrous ***Spoiler*** pre-text of tensions between the Superpowers over a downed USN sub. The real-life Kursk incident was by comparison far more revealing of how nations might react to such circumstance.I watched the 163min special edited version, but was left wishing I'd stuck with the Theatrical Cut. The Abyss then - it's not for me, but it might be for you.The Dice Man.",The Abyss
307,dwezel,"The Director's Cut of ""The Abyss"" is fantastic.",10,19 March 2001,"Using some of the most convincing underwater special effects I've ever seen, the directors cut (with 28 mins. of new footage) tells a heart stopping and heart breaking story of love, heroism, loyalty and obsessions under the deep blue sea. The originally available edition was very good but the director's cut is FANTASTIC, fleshing out both the story and motivations of the characters.",The Abyss
308,bettina-lynn,Rent or buy the DVD version!,10,28 August 2001,"While the video version of this movie is great and highly entertaining, the DVD version with the added hour of footage if even better!  With the added time and footage, you finally know exactly what is going on, and several of the dialog portions now make sense, for example, near the end when the ship captain turns to the Military commander and says ""I guess that puts you out of a job"", with the added footage that makes sense.  Before, it was a nice line, and if you didn't listen to it, didn't matter.  It also explains the ""storm"" that wasn't expected, yet suddenly came up.

312,Stitchthingy,Wow that was a fantastic movie!,8,16 December 2003,I like short reviews so I will try to keep this short!Let me begin to tell you this movie is original! Not to many movies are being made that have an underwater setting.The movie is about a drilling team who operate a high tech underwater drilling station deep under the sea. As soon as they become cut off from the surface in a storm near an underwater crevice things are getting a weird.Strange in a way that the movie slowly shows that something scary and silent is there with them on the ocean floor. It builds suspension gradually until it ends within a climatic ending of the movie which I really liked (but some people have other opinions about that!)Acting is great and the story very original with just enough action!**** out of five!,The Abyss
313,jimlarkin5,Watch a Jacques Cousteau Rerun Instead,4,21 March 2020,"James Cameron is so generic.
No wonder all the actors on this film hated him. Synopsis: sone underwater crew is exploring the deep blue sea. It goes on and on and on. The story is unintelligible. Ed Harris is in it and clearly miserable. He's not even trying to act anything but wanting to survive and go back home.
All the actors look like they are being tortured for free hours while doing nothing underwater",The Abyss
314,sketch_09,Misunderstood Gem,8,30 January 2005,"If ya wanna see this movie the right way in it's best form, see the special edition. Believe me, without the extra scenes the original film is quite average. Fortunately, i saw the special edition first.A nuclear submarine is mysteriously sunk by unknown forces, provoking orders from a navy ship to a team of oil riggers to investigate the situation with the help of a group of Navy SEALs. A disastrous hurricane strikes, causing the rig to sink to the edge of a deep sea trench. What follows from here on in is a powerful insight into human nature and the strength of love surviving against the unknown in the abyss.WARNING: Only people who have seen the movie read on.I'd heard about this film vaguely before i saw it from watching a special effects documentary from ILM, which contained some footage from the water tentacle scene. Ever since i saw that footage, this became one of my must see movies, mainly because i'm intrigued in the early stages of CGI. You can understand my joy then when it showed its special edition self on sky one about three years ago. I taped and watched it, and frankly i was disappointed. What seemed like a fantastically timed sci-fi thriller/adventure up to the point after the tentacle, turned out to mainly be about human survival until the last half hour, where it went back to.....aliens? This was definitely the act that killed the movie for me, as i was expecting so much more than aliens. The point after the water tentacle really kicked the film into high gear for me. I was thinking, ""uh oh, they've upset something big, now all hell's gonna break loose"". The film really was just too good to be true in the end.Then i watched it again. Now knowing exactly what the film was about, i took it for what it was and now consider it one of James Cameron's finest. I embraced the end sequences and was just captivated by the sheer thrill and terror of the character acting and storytelling that was really about human behaviour in times of peril and in the fear and wonder of the unknown, plus how true love between two really can bring down walls, other than the full on sci-fi action i expected. Standout moments include Michael Beihn and Ed Harris' dual, the submersible chase, the scouring of the submarine, Mary Elizabeth's first encounter with the ET's, Ed Harris' descent into the trench (great display of the love between his and Mary's character) and the part that the original sorely missed, the special edition's extended Ed Harris ET encounter at the end, which i won't ruin for people who haven't seen the SE, but see this version and you won't regret it. But really, the finest scene in the film for me was the water tentacle. Executed with just the right pace and length, it really was the most captivating piece of cinema I'd ever seen, the way the alien tried to communicate, the pitch perfect acting to reflect everyone's amazement and realisation as to what they were dealing with. Plus u have the added bonus of the flawless effects work by ILM even by todays standards that give the sequence that added awe that's surprisingly rare in most modern effects films, and is a testament to the visual effects Oscar to this film's name.This film was made during the period where ILM started to win most of their Oscars for their experimentation into CGI (late 1980's to early 90's), which really went into full flow in Jurassic Park. But The Abyss is where it really started, and and it's quite obvious the technology in this film was in development to be later used to astonishing effect in T2. In both films by Cameron, the effects never get in the way of the character development and story. In fact, they enhance them by making the experience that more life like and exciting.The Abyss could have been so much more than what it ended up becoming in my opinion, but for what it is, it's a beautiful thing that deserves recognition not mainly for it's special effects, but for its heart and powerful story and premise into human survival and love. The science fiction element is more of a side story but it adds an ever present suspense that is broken in the last half hour of the film, and is replaced by generic, but well designed elements that aren't as good as the rest of the film, but concluded it well none the less.",The Abyss
315,rene2030,Wow!,10,19 March 2006,"Me and my friends wanted to go and see ""Back To The Future, Part III"", but when we arrived at the movie theatre there was a discouraging queue. Having had bad experiences with this (""sold out"" sign in front of our noses after having stood in line for 30 minutes) we decided to check out the other theatre in town to see what was playing there. It appeared to be ""The Abyss"". Half of our group hadn't heard of it, but some (me included) had seen 1 or 2 teaser trailers (the one with the ""alien water column spy cam"") and managed to persuade the rest to go in and see it. Three hours later we came out.....The only expression which comes near to make clear how impressed we were was ""Wow!"" (in the Keanu Reeves quotation)The storyline is ridiculous and if you take this kind of thing serious, then simply don't watch this. Depth records are crushed, aliens telling the world that they should stop their nuclear threats, and so on). But James Cameron manages to tell it with heart, pace and tension. The acting is great; the oil rig crew (led by an always amazing Ed Harris) is portrayed well, Michael Biehn gives you the creeps as psychopatic marine, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio fits her parts always perfectly. And the special effects are well worth the Oscar that was given for it. (hey, we're talking 1990 here)Sometime afterwards I learned how this movie was made and what kind of trouble Cameron and crew ran into while making it. Knowing that background it made me appreciate ""The Abyss"" even more, so I simply can't do anything else that give it a 10/10. Great Job James! You have probably created one of my top-5 all-time favorites.",The Abyss

317,floriankolle,The Best Underwater Science-Fiction Movie Ever,10,13 March 2019,"Just watched it again for the third time after 20 years and I still love this movie. Although there has never been an underwater station like this, the movie makes you think there is. Everything is authentic to the smallest detail. down to the scratches in Bud's special suit or the rust stains on the outer hull of the station.
But also the interpersonal relationships in the story give this movie an atmospheric density that modern movies are lacking, unfortunately. Would they do a remake, it would be probably with actors in their early twenties, full of flat jokes. There rarely are mainstream action movies like this anymore.

318,albertalvarez2k,Abys-mal,1,30 September 2020,"I tried to give this movie a shot based on its pedigree, but I found this movie to be dull, and insufferable, turned it off after an hour.
I can't quite put my finger on it. The film feels claustrophobic, you don't feel how deep they actually are, it feels like its taking place in a tank of water. For being a deep sea movie you don't feel immersed in the vastness of the ocean.
Dialogue is bland, does not help the abysmal pacing or understanding of the story. Rag tag bunch of dysfunctional characters that aren't entertaining. I could barely make it through an hour of the directors cut, not sure how much different that version is from the theatrical version, I don't want to find out.",The Abyss

Believable characters, believable plot.  In fact, an awe-inspiring hope for the future. This movie as well as Contact, and Close Encounters, show us the wonder and joy in finding alien life.

320,dcousquer,wet,8,24 August 2002,"technically, the movie is great and wonderfully made. curiously, the only scenes that are lousy are the over-the-water ones (boats are too evidently models). However, there are two stories in one, which is one too much. first part of the movie is a classical drama. after that, the last part is more like close encounters of the third type, which is a bit disappointing. the movie becomes suddenly more poetic than action-like and even if the aliens are well made, we do not have time to be interested to them. so, all in all, a good movie but a far from perfect one.",The Abyss
321,CSM101,One of the greatest science fiction movies ever made.,9,7 August 2000,"James Camerons' ""The Abyss"" is one of the most original, powerful human stories ever made. The film is set 2,000 feet below the oceans surface, in an environment where humans rely on technology to survive. Despite the film having action, hardware, and technology it is really about the human bonding that occurs when people encounter an alien species and are trapped in an environment where all the elements are against them.The friendship, the tragedy, the self sacrifice and the powerful love story of Bud and Lindsey is the true heart of the film. We learn about Bud and Lindseys' past, and how they react to one another when they have to stay on an oil drilling rig together. But when disaster strikes, and they are cut off from the surface, their frustrated relationship turns into an intense love story.The crew use submersibles, ROVs' and specialised diving equipment in a very casual manner. The effects created are totally believable combined with ground-breaking special effects (for the time) such as the pseudopod. The music brilliantly emphasizes the discovery and wonder in the alien life as well as the human love and sacrifice.The action in this film is incredible. The rig gets dragged across the ocean floor, submersibles chase and collide, hardware implodes, and men engage in hand to hand combat. Animals and men breathe fluid and bud descends on a deep journey into the unknown.No underwater movies have ever been as adventurous, suspenseful, and emotional as ""The Abyss"" is. The film leaves us with a great sense of awe and wonder. The special edition emphasizes  the powerful message about the human race and the importance of love.",The Abyss

323,vbrunner_,"Absolutely wonderful, but stick to the theatrical version",10,21 May 2002,"I can only agree with setanta-, the theatrical version is much better. Sometimes it's nicer not to get everything explained, and that's definitely the case with this movie. The special edition loses most of the feeling of mystery that is so prominent in the theatrical version, and instead tries - in a fairly lame attempt - to propagate for world peace.However I did enjoy the other additional scenes, most of them are found in the beginning of the movie and there are a few more along the way. These establish the characters a little bit more before the movie gets going. I didn't feel that they slowed the pace down at all (the movie is already pretty slow). On the other hand they didn't really add very much either, but I enjoyed seeing them. I would have preferred the special edition to include only these scenes and skip the whole world war deal that gives the movie a wider scope. That said, this is without doubt one of my favorite movies of all time. The atmosphere is incredible! It's almost thick enough to touch, and still unsurpassed in later movies. All actors do great performances, but the most outstanding are Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn. The story is compelling and intelligent, and all the characters are really believable. My interest is kept up at 100% throughout the entire movie, something I have never experienced in other equally slow films. I'm sorry, but I just can't find a single negative point to make! It's a wonder this movie is so underrated. It is one of the few that actually deserves a full score.",The Abyss
324,nif_t_alban,outstanding,10,23 April 2006,"The director's cut of this film is in essence one of the best science fiction films ever made. His follow up to Aliens is quite the accomplishment for acclaimed visionary James Cameron. Almost two years in the making, his fascination almost got the better of him. Assembling an astounding cast that included Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Todd Graff and the always brilliant Michael Biehn as lt. Coffey. It's unfortunate that the theatrical release of this film was missing the substance that made it great. Balking at the initial runtime of the feature, the studio freaked but when he recut it for the special laserdisc edition (then later for DVD), the added sequences made an already great film even better. The wave effects propel the 'brink of world war' scenario as the nti's were simply trying to save mankind from itself and mass destruction.",The Abyss
325,kranbot,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz,4,13 December 2007,"Just watched this film for the first time in years. Wow, is it a yawner. The characters lack dimension entirely--we're supposed to buy into a deep love between the two main characters just because they swoon at each other a lot? Secondly, it's so cliché. What saves the world? The hero calling a woman his wife. Note the giant zoom in on the word ""wife"" as it's projected onto the wall of water. Way to reinforce convention--on one hand it's nice to see a film reinforce relationships, but on another, it's just another boring nondescript pairing. I get that the aliens were impressed that he'd give himself a ""one way ticket"" into the abyss to deactivate the bomb, but really, isn't that a bit pat? And how many other thousand times have we seen this story done better and with more depth of feeling? This movie left me as cold as the water it's submerged in.",The Abyss

Not only does this movie has suspense from the beginning on, it just keeps on getting weirder (and I like that a lot in a film) and weirder until finally the end of this film strikes you (and especially the DVD special - edition, click on DVD-details to know more)and leaves you wanting more....

The relationship between Mastriano and Harris is the pivot point of the movie, and it's outstanding. It also provides the opening for an unexpected encounter in the abyss. The movie is thought-provoking, heartening, and worth every minute of viewing. However, a word of caution regarding the ""Special addition"" with the additional 28 minutes: a few scenes added to the movie, but for the most part the additional footage relegated the Special Edition of The Abyss to the category of disaster (or near-disaster) flicks that are rarely worth the time.

329,joshlemli,Ground-breaking film about discovery and humanity.,10,30 December 2003,"Despite Titanic's evilness, James Cameron has made some extraordinary films. This is one of them, right up there with Aliens, The Terminator, and True Lies.  This was one of the first movies to use CGI (computer generated images/imaging) successfully.  It was definitely the first film to CG an entire character, albeit for just one scene.This movie takes us to the ocean bottom, where a deep sea oil-rig is commandeered by the US military/navy/whatever to investigate the mysterious demise of a USNavy nuclear submarine.  The Navy sends down some SEALS to help out, but the depths of the ocean can cause anybody to have problems. The film pits the crew against the SEALS against everyone's fear of the unknown.  Though there are no car chases, there are some gripping action sequences, owing mainly to the fact that the people in this story are battling against not just each other, but so many other odds as well.Hurricanes, the danger of deep-sea pressure, and the unknown.  Whether the mysterious abyss is home to aliens, deep-sea denizens, or just the imagination of a stressed group of people, is for you to decide (well, kindof).This film is definitely worthy of a once-over view, and I would recommend starting with the cinema version.  If you see it and liked it, try the extended director's cut for a whole new perspective on what Cameron had intended with the movie.  The original ending was cut down quite a bit, as it had implications ""too grandiose and intense"" for the general public to be exposed to.

Because it combines the intensity of a great action movie with a wonderful spiritual message without getting preachy.And yes: it is early evidence that James Cameron just has ""a thing"" for ""deep blue under-water stuff"" that led him to creating the biggest box office success of all times (Titanic), and some more great ""bottom of the ocean"" films such as ""Ghosts of the Abyss"" (there's that ""Abyss"" thing, again, and filmed in 3D, nothing less).So, what's going to be next?

332,stevebyars,"Awesome, powerfully filmed, good acting, thrilling contact with a different species",9,12 March 2006,"A believable science-fiction story, well told. A great movie for those of us with a fear of water, enclosed places, cliffs, and highly trained killers with brains about two steps out of contact with reality. I.e., this movie has the potential to scare you silly! Yet it really does no such thing. Instead, you are entertained. Given realistic views of the possibilities in underwater living (sans appropriate color scheme). Show a possible scenario for contact with non-human intelligence. It would be easy to call this a morality play, and you wouldn't be wrong. But, it is much more than just that. I am not sure just how this movie was filmed, but you definably get the feeling that you are deep in the ocean living in a very unique environment. All is not good though. Seems like any deep-sea environment designed for an isolated crew would make much better use of color and the layout of living spaces. The ""furniture"" provided the dwellers is poor inducement to ever return. Military racks, bunk-beds, hard chairs. The general industrial design and coloration (hundreds of pipes and fittings are unlabeled and not even color-coded, walls, floors and ceilings all the same dingy brown-gray, Highly unlikely if the operations people have any hope for the efficiency and mental health of those living in such a situation to say nothing of safety and operability. NO cogent designer would design critical wiring that looses its identity in emergency lighting. A cold (and cooling) environment with freezing water, yet I never saw anyone actually shiver.

333,ske1fr,Below the surface is a different world,10,12 April 2005,"Warning, Will Robinson! This comment DOES contain spoilers.This is a story about underwater aliens. Wrong. This is a story about love, faith and humanity.I enjoyed this movie simply as an SF story first time around, but that was before I got married and had kids. The version I saw was the theatrical release, and it has to be said that the ending in that version looks incredibly contrived. As an aside the climax of the TR is reminiscent of 2001 in some ways, in that a lone figure is removed from their familiar world and placed in almost an alternative reality. That Brinkman is saved because he has a wife seems bizarre at first, but bear with me.I read the novelisation of this story too at the time of it's release, and I've just read the script (google for it) , so I can now fill in the blanks that were created by the editing for time.The Brigmans are separated when we first meet them, yet Bud still wears his ring, and indeed it saves his fingers from being crushed. When they are trapped together on the submersible with only one dive suit it's Lindsey who has faith in Bud, and volunteers to ""die"" in order to be saved. And when Bud brings her back to life, ignoring his colleagues' pleas to give up, it's he who in effect rekindles the marriage.If you've only seen the theatrical release then this part of the movie alone is worth the viewing, but the fact that Bud literally steps off then into the abyss, leaving even the little pocket of humanity on Deepcore behind, is a heart-stopping moment. Cameron captures this perfectly with the camera shot from the side.Contrast this plummet into the deep with Coffey's. What message do we take from this? If you are alone, you die alone. Bud dives into the Abyss alone, yet connected symbolically (and electronically) with his wife. When we realise he can't return, we're there with him and her, and at that moment he IS married. EDIT: There's another element to this story that I've only just realised. Remember how the way Bud can plummet into the abyss to defuse the nuke is by using the liquid breathing system? How Monk the Navy SEAL says ""We all breathe liquid for nine months, Bud. Your body will remember.""? Bud is taken into the 'mothership' through what I've just realised is a symbolic birth canal. When he pops the seals on his suit and coughs up all the breather fluid, he is effectively being reborn. The final symbolic element is the actual form of the 'mothership'. Take away the spires and what do you have? A placenta. Check Wikipedia if you don't believe me. I knew I recognised that from somewhere.It amounts to quite brilliant use of a number of elements to symbolise the need for us to be ""reborn"" in order to survive. This is a visual feast of symbolism that repays further viewing. I can understand critics feeling that they're being preached at, but this is a director using the tools at his command to tell a story. If you don't like the story you can still admire the skill of the storyteller.If you don't ""get"" this movie then never mind. If you do get it, welcome to the human race.",The Abyss

336,AriMov86,"An incredible, unique Sci-Fi Thriller",8,17 June 1999,"This is an incredible sci-fi classic.  It is realistic and thought-provoking, yet comedic, too. The opening scene of a nuclear submarine crashing and sinking to over 2,000 feet underwater was stunning.  An underwater oil rig is assigned to look for survivors and dangerous radiation in the sub.  The scene where part of the crew of the rig, along with two navy SEALs is chilling, and realistic of what a recently sunk sub must be like.  More stunning is the scene where a crane sinking an abyss barely avoids pulling down the entire rig to the bottom of the abyss, over four miles down. But the plot thickens... entities begin to show up.  They are beautiful and graceful, like living machines, but not of steel... f flesh.  One takes on the form of a ""water tentacle"" that moves  gracefully through the rig. When it encounters some of the crew, it perfectly imitates their faces. The scene is, to say the least, breathtaking.  Eventually, a nuclear missile from the crashed sub is stolen and dropped into the abyss.  It's on a timer, and when it goes off, the explosion, even though miles underwater, will destroy everything for miles.  One of the crew (Ed Harris) has to  go into the abyss to defuse the bomb.  At the bottom, he discovers an incredible underwater city.  Running low on oxygen, he defuses the bomb and passes out, but is led to safety by the creatures of the underwater city.  In the last scene, the underwater city rises up to the surface, with the rig and an oil tanker that had been floating above on top.  The massive oil tanker is dwarfed in comparison to the breathtaking city.

I sat through an hour and a half before its soporific effect caused me to switch off and find something interesting to do. Very poor story line, though the special effects were very good - and expensive, but a turnip is still a turnip, no matter how many carrots they give you with it! The pressure effects of working at depth were completely ignored, and it was frequently quite hard to know where the actors were actually supposed to be.A far cry from Alien or Titanic. I'm not surprised it did badly at the box office. It has cult status - a cult is not enough to make up a minority and most of the cult seem to have written comments on this website!",The Abyss

341,Lee Jee Keng,Non-terrestrial Intelligence (NTI),7,30 May 2001,"Probably those into UFOs and alien as a subject of interest would appreciate this film more than others since this is what it's all about. This movie potrays USO, unidentified sinking object (or underwater flying objects for UFO if you so wish). Paranormal events such as sightings of unidentified crafts have occured in air as well as in the sea. There is strong speculation that aliens, whether extradimensional or extraterrestrial are here on earth. There are tales from witnesses and experiencers that aliens are abducting humans for whatever reason or are here to deliver a message....Stop destroying Earth. There's a also a theory that perhaps these aliens could be God. All in all, there is no scientific proof for such a proposition. It remains an abyssal enigma. The truth is out there.",The Abyss

E. Mastroantonio). No one liked the Mary Elizabeth character. Not the characters in the movie who knew her, not the strangers who just met her, and certainly not the audience.

343,darraghw87,Great but with a stupid ending,8,22 January 2002,The Abyss is a fantastic film with some stunning acting (particularly from Ed Harris and Michael Biehn) but the story takes a huge left turn at the last 20 or so minutes and it starts to resemble the most cheesy of science fiction films.

344,amartin04,Was Cameron confused?,6,14 September 2002,"Throughout the movie, and especially in the ending, I wondered why Cameron chose to include aliens.  It feels like two movies are being made here: an underwater thriller and a cheesy, sci-fi/fantasy movie with a hackneyed political message.  If Cameron had made up his mind what he was trying to do in this movie it would have been a lot better.  In fact, the movie isn't even about the aliens at all until the ending.  It was as if Cameron had made the movie, then the studio took control and tacked on a ridiculously rushed, upbeat ending; much like RKO did for The Magnificent Ambersons.  I say this because in the later part of the beginning of the movie Cameron showcases all sorts of technology, paying great attention to detail.  However, in the end all of it gets thrown out the window.  One character explains an impossibility simply by saying something to the effect of ""Something must've happened!"".  Watch this movie for the the middle of the movie, not for the _very_ beginning or the end.",The Abyss

347,flanger216,Cameron Does Spielberg,6,10 May 2003,"A slight slip-up inbetween the brilliant ""Aliens"" and ""Terminator 2,"" James Cameron's ""The Abyss"" is an indulgent and overlong foray into themes and techniques much better explored in Cameron's aforementioned classics.  For instance, while Cameron again demonstrates his mastery over tense, cramped interiors, he never even approaches the pulse-pounding fervor of Aliens, and the occasional action pieces, particularly a dull underwater-probe duel, completely lack the hyper-kinetic flow of Terminator 2.  Of course ""The Abyss"" is intended primarily as an emotional human-drama, and two scenes, a desperate CPR revival and a heroic but doomed dive, work exceptionally well. Unfortunately, these scenes fail to save what amounts to a ridiculously long ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" retread, especially when this near three hour movie has such an anti-climactic ending.  ""The Abyss"" is a decent movie but a disappointing James Cameron film.*Note - don't bother with the special edition:  it only serves to exacerbate things by adding even more length (!) and including one of the most cloyingly cliched and sophomoric anti-nuclear war subplots this reviewer has ever witnessed.",The Abyss

The Abyss was the first movie I had seen upon my return to the states.  I was very impressed and thought it a good movie, one that rivaled the Star Wars trilogy as my all time favorites. It wasn't until a friend brought me to his house to view the director's cut on laser disk that this movie became my favorite of all time.  The regular movie is good, with interesting effects and story line, but the DC made the movie, adding additional story lines as well as clearing up some of the plots left in the theatrical release.  I don't understand why James Cameron cut so much out of The Abyss, but left Titanic as the marathon love story it is.  You shortened the wrong flick, Jim.A great Sci-fi action/adventure!",The Abyss
349,roosevelthertz,An Abyss Odyssey,8,3 April 2011,"When it comes to the 1989 film; ""The Abyss"" a few things come to your mind. It is important to state that i saw the Special Edition, not the normal one. The movie has a lot of great features, and some less great ones too - some times the action scenes would become a bit lame, but the fight between the crazy guy and Ed Harris was a real nail biter. I really like this film for 3 reasons: 1: the very human and touching portrayal of the characters which were very lifelike and made you connect and sympathize with the characters. Due to that there are some really great scenes in this movie. 2: The usage of the camera inside the Commandpost/base in some situations which was very intense at some times and would follow the ""oilers"" while running down halls and trying to close hatchets while fighting a seamlessly endless battle against the forces of nature. It sort of reminded me of ""Das Boot"" or something like that. 3: The slow but steady creation of tense.You shouldn't watch this movie for its aliens, special effects, or pretty obvious and way over the top anti-war-statement-post-cold-war-pacifism-ending. Its OK but a bit to corny i suppose. This, and the fact that there really is no explanation as to why the alien-thing had to swim right pass the third-world-war-sub, thus destroying it, makes it impossible for me to give this more than an eight though i would like too.Watch this film for its musicological dramatic tensions between the actors and the deep blue.",The Abyss
350,sheldonvh,The most underrated Cameron movie ever. Period.,10,5 August 2004,"I just wanted to say that no matter what anybody else thinks, this movie is still one of the most underrated James Cameron films out there. Everybody loves Titanic and everybody loves Terminator 1 and 2, but this movie speaks to us on a totally different level. It's a 171 min (special edition) motion painting. There is so much to love about this movie. The action sequences, the variety of characters, the pod chase and fight, the alien encounters, and the fact that it's set in the most unstable environment imaginable.First, Alan Silvestri's score is compelling and eerie, only adding to the amazing visuals we see on-screen. Ed Harris is the main character and stands out as the leader of the oil crew and he carries this movie right to the end. Michael Biehn should have won an Oscar for his absolutely wicked portrayal as the Navy Seal who gets mentally sick and winds up being the bad guy, unintentionally. He nailed that role perfectly. And for James Cameron, his movies are like algebra is to math. His vision of this movie is displayed wonderfully on screen and everything you see has been well mapped out. From camera movement to sound to lighting, he is the jack of all trades on the movie set. And there is nothing in this movie that doesn't have the 'official' James Cameron stamp on it. Apparently, this IS James Cameron's most favorite movie that he's made. Don't quote me on that, but it's just what I've heard. So, now that you've read what I've had to say about the most underrated James Cameron movie ever, why aren't you in front of your TV seeing if what I've had to say is true. Either, A: You've seen it and don't care for it. Or B: Hopefully you still have to go rent it from the video store. Enjoy.",The Abyss

352,Thuriboh,One of my all time favourite sci-fi movies,10,24 February 2012,"Well, this is my very first review here on IMDb so I wanted to make it a good one by choosing a great movie I can still remember!The Abyss is a masterpiece in my opinion done by none less than James Cameron himself and this movie is an unforgettable adventure and epic in length. This movie has it all: fast-paced action, tension, sad moments and just pure eye-candy for enjoyment. What made me love this movie so unexpectedly might be because my expectations was not high or low, I had heard it had gotten good reviews and not so good ones too. So I got on hold of the extended special edition and saw it instead of the theatrical one and it just blew my mind.There are not many (if any) sci-fi movies made today that are as mind-blowing or as fresh like The Abyss, and it was made in 1989!Okey now for the acting: I liked everyones performances in this movie and almost all actors were new to me, except for Ed Harris and he and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are the more outstanding characters because of their relationship and opinions about each other.For me I think the ending to movies are important for the flick to make sense and really be worth the build-up its making, like this one. I'm not gonna spoil anything but the ending contains a deep message and could have not been more perfect than it is.I can easily say that James Cameron is one of the best directors and writers living today and we can thank him for giving us this one, Terminator 2, Aliens (not seen it yet), Avatar and Titanic to name a few.I highly recommend this movie to everyone actually and not just to sci-fi-fans because it keeps your interest throughout the whole 2h and 43 minutes (S.E) but I haven't seen the theatrical cut but see the extended first and you will enjoy this awesome masterpiece to the fullest. :)",The Abyss
353,cgb-583-94364,How Could This Get Mixed Reviews?,10,14 January 2014,"Reading through some of the ""reviews"" of The Abyss on this site, those who bagged on this film cited how this was just so cliché, and been done to death... My jaw dropped upon reading that a story about a salvage mission half a mile under sea level despite a bowie-knife wielding jar-head, that results in an underwater submersible battle to the death, followed by a man jumping off an underwater cliff has been done to death... Oh yeah, I see this plot line ALL the time.I can't even think of ANY other underwater sci-fi flick in existence, so how could this be a boring cliché? It was the first and last of its genre: Underwater SCI-FI... made...Utter nonsense....They said the dialog was either too vulgar in some reviews, or too simplistic in others. Well, which is it? They compared this movie to Aliens quite a few times, despite the films having nothing in common besides James Cameron. I have become a bigger Cameron fan with each subsequent movie he releases, as have most people. The haters of this movie likely hate ALL Cameron films, and lump this in. I think one of my most favorite scenes of all time is when Ed Harris's Bud Brigman has to watch his wife drown right before his eyes, ON PURPOSE. Tell me where in the heck THAT scene has been done before? I recommend the Director's Cut, but was perfectly okay with the supposedly abhorrent Theatrical Cut as well. Purists shouldn't point to an edited version and call it trash, and THEN laud the Director's Cut. Someone should have locked Peter Jackson in an edit bay until he got his movies under 24 hours apiece..The movie offers pulse-pounding excitement from the 20 minute mark all the way to the end, and has everything you look for in a great film: artistic greatness, innovation and heart. It has all 3.",The Abyss
354,timcassini,Underrated Classic,10,21 September 2005,"(Spoilers).The acting was great by the three lead stars, Masterantonio, Ed Harris and Michael Biehn. Alan Sivesti's score was good, The love story element between Lyndsey (Masterantonio) and Bud (Harris), was well done as it was a married couple for once and not too soppy. The suspense over what Coffee was going to do next (biehn) was well portrayed as he slowly slipped into Psychosis and the scene where Lyndsey has to drown in the freezing cold water in the little sub to be dragged back to Deepcore for me is one of the best moments in a film. The revival sequence is well acted by all, especially by Ed Harris; the expression on his face as Lyndsey came around from her near death experience. The special effects were good, such as the water tentacle sequence and the way in which the submersibles were used was good too. The underwater environment was beautifully portrayed, Dark and menacing, I really felt that the under water oil rig Deepcore had a kind of soul to it. The bit were the rat breathes the liquid oxygen is clever (this technique has been use on people as well) The action sequences were good as well (such as when coffee's submersible exploded under the pressure of the ocean and the suspense over whether the aliens were good or evil was well put together.

It's clear that the underwater camera work was used to good effect in his later picture, Titanic.

James Cameron reportedly came up with the idea for this movie during a boring biology class, penning down his thoughts in a short story fashion, and then later making movie history by writing and directing The Abyss. Some of the best special effects I have ever seen to-date, and definitely some of the best under-water cinematography.  The full story (almost 3 hours long on the special DVD version) is worth the watch, and is engrossing from beginning to end.  This is definitely my favourite film of all time.  It is hard to believe the film is over 10 years old and can still be so convincing and heart-touching.

369,caitsith01,Massively over-rated nonsense,4,3 March 2010,"I watched this movie based primarily on my love for other Cameron movies and the mostly highly positive reviews here. What a mistake! This movie is deeply, deeply flawed, both as science fiction and as a matter of film-making. It suffers from many of the worst clichés of 1980s American films, and displays none of the sense of atmosphere, imagination and style which are present in Cameron's best work. I find it almost unbelievable that he followed the amazing Aliens with this movie.So what are the problems? First, the plot. It is clichéd, silly, and resolves with a laughable deus ex machina. Like many a poor action/sci-fi movie, it relies almost entirely on coincidence and contrivance to develop the story, rather than being driven by strong characters with believable motivations. For example, we are presented with a series of pathetically derivative stories - the estranged husband and wife who we know are going to get back together from the first second; the psycho, chain of command-loving military guy; the rag-tag bunch of lovable tech specialists who find their beloved undersea rig taken out of their hands; and on and on. Characters live or die based on unlikely coincidences, the worst of which is undoubtedly Ed Harris' character being saved by his wedding ring, which he never takes off - symbolism doesn't get much more obvious or ridiculous. The main action sequence, an underwater sub-fight, drags on and on for no real reason. Nothing here is remotely new or interesting. Not content with that though, we also have ""man's folly with nuclear weapons"" and ""is man inherently good or evil?"" thrown in for good measure. Ultimately we get a preachy, silly ending which gives virtually no resolution to those questions - the characters learn nothing, except that if we're naughty the aliens are going to drown us all.Second, the characters. They are just totally implausible. In Aliens Cameron gave us a more believable bunch of characters, despite the fact that they were billions of miles away and hundreds of years into the future. Here they are just clichéd, boring, unappealing and predictable. The 'lovable' undersea cowboys talk in ridiculous slang and catchphrases. The military guys (perhaps presaging Avatar) are robotic and wholly defined by crew cuts and personal aggression. Of course, there is the 'crazy' guy who no-one takes seriously but who turns out to be right, the cold-but-sexy woman who knows how to take control, even a sassy black chick. It's all so predictable, and there are no surprises at all.Thirdly, as a matter of ""science"" fiction, this movie is an epic failure. We learn little to nothing about the science allegedly involved. The undersea creatures display no characteristics which reflect their environment (why would they have technology to control water through the air when they live entirely UNDER water?). The physics on display is awful (a huge station presumably weighing hundreds of tonnes is rapidly dragged by the weight of a small crane, for example). Even the science of deep sea diving is largely ignored - things crack and crumple when it is convenient from a plot perspective, but other times the characters and equipment seem to be immune to the effects of being deep underwater. Where, incidentally, there is no life, and the water is a pleasant, clear aquamarine colour.Fourthly, and most importantly, this movie is simply boring. When you have a silly plot and characters who are far from engaging, the last thing you should do is have a film which drags on and on and on, but that is precisely what this one does.A word about the special effects - they are OK by 1989 standards, but pretty awful by contemporary standards. The undersea creatures look like a bad children's cartoon, and the much celebrated water effects definitely show their age. Much more impressive are the underwater and flooding scenes, but even these are fairly average by current standards.This movie seems to hint at what was eventually going to be done much better in Avatar (right down to the fluro blue aliens). Although Avatar repeats some of the mistakes listed above, it is a far more coherent and, more importantly, engaging film. This film has plenty of defenders, but the truth is that even amongst Cameron's own body work there are many films which are far, far better than this. I refuse to believe anyone can watch Aliens and then watch The Abyss and come away thinking that this film is even half as good.",The Abyss

374,mark-jennings-2,Read the book then watch the special edition of the movie,10,24 January 2007,"When this movie came out I did something that I do not normally do - I read the book first (by Orson Scott Card if memory serves me). As previously stated, this is not something I normally do but this time it worked to my advantage. The original theatre release of the film was chopped so badly that the ending made no sense, and the start to the film throws the audience straight into a failed relationship between the two main protagonists with very little explanation. By reading the book first I was able to fully understand the film plot, and the subsequent release of the movie on video with the full ending made even more sense. The book also explains the character of the Navy SEAL commander giving insights into why he acts like he does and who he really is. I love this movie, especially the bit where Virgil is trying to revive a dead Lindsey with the lines 'don't give up bitch, you never gave up on anything in your life so don't start now!'",The Abyss
375,westj517,Overall I love this film,8,26 July 2014,"The actors and characters they play were just right. I feel the effects and underwater graphics were amazing the actor that plays Coffee adds the spark to this movie knowing that if I were stuck in his situation I would absolutely go crazy, no way to communicate with the world, stuck in a place not knowing what is there in a place that is dark and cold. when I read the book was unable to put it down, was on the edge of my seat and even though they don't tell you what kind of aliens they are was just outstanding ( I pretty much thought they were angels ) being that they can control water, water can cause a lot of damage it would have been interesting to see what they looked like when not in water. Like would they float, fly or can they walk. This is a movie that I could watch repeatedly never get tired of it.",The Abyss
376,rafalprzondo,Sci-fi without Sci (Spoiler Warning!!!),2,21 January 2003,"Well, I found that movie just a Sci-fi without Sci (and logic). I agree sometimes we have to believe what is shown, but this time... People swimming in light suits (or even WITHOUT) that deep? A guy going down as far as 5km and able to move and breath (not even to mention that his helmet is not broken immediately while.... his robot IS broken by the pressure as well as the sub of the evil Navy Seal). No logic in all that at all. And why are those Aliens for (except from saving lives of the characters)? Stanislaw Lem said once: ""Science fiction IS science fiction if one cannot remove the science fiction elements without damage to the plot"". In this case one could easily do so as the aliens are mere ornaments. Besides, movie is quite dull and far too long as for thriller without much surprises.Oh, quite thoughtless decision of drowning of the main female character: why not take a deep breath and let Ed Harris drag her to the platform? Seems like quite better chance to survive (even when drowned on the way) than drowning in the damaged sub...As a plus: quite nice special effects.",The Abyss
377,tntjones-899-212976,Fiction - But no science,5,16 November 2010,"I just watched ""The Abyss"" for the first time last night. Sure, it was glitzy with plenty of eye candy in the special effects department, but woefully lacking in the science department.First, we see the dinky crane which connects the ship to the deep-sea drilling rig and that presumably pulls the thing up off the ocean bed get yanked off the ship far too easily. Then after hitting bottom, it falls over the edge it suddenly gain mass and almost pulls the rig with it.But the diving stunts were the absolute worst. The make a big deal about the intense water pressure (they talk about how much decompression they have to go through to get back to the surface and and using mini-subs (Coffey buys it when his sub implodes due to the water pressure). Yet, for some miraculous reason they have a pool which connects directly to the outside. The air pressure necessary to keep that water from flooding the rig would turn everyone into mush). Oh yeah, and despite the intense water pressure, they can still swim around down there without the need of, well, anything as our star shows when he goes out through a hatch and swims over to the equipment bay, a distance of a hundred feet or so with no suit and just by holding his breath. Wow! Superman, eat your heart out.The only possible way to enjoy this movie is to turn off the your ability for logical thought.As for the characters. The only character I kinda like was Coffey (even if he was the homicidal nut job of the movie). I really didn't care much one way or the other about the others.",The Abyss
378,GreeMovie,Awesome Movie - Extended Version,10,30 August 2013,"I really do not usually do this but I was just watching this and I wanted to take a second and say this could easily be Ed Harris' best acting role, He is an amazing actor and it really shows and all this time I always said Needful things was his best, but Ill give it up to this one instead. Everyone is awesome in this film and its one I have always liked but it really moved me a little bit today and I wanted to say if you haven't watched it yet, you should. The film is amazing for being from the early 90's its really well done, No wonder Cameron is the best and has the best movies. This one really holds up for being 20 years old.",The Abyss
379,vondy88,"Great movie, right until the last 10 minutes...",6,11 August 2012,"The Abyss was a film that I heard a lot about on forums and saw plenty of ''if you like this, you may like...'' from Amazon, IMDb, Lovefilm, etc when looking at other films relating to the deep sea and sci-fi thrillers. So I thought I'll check it out.I found it quite entertaining for a while and interesting for the most parts. The characters were basic but understandable and you got to know the setting and situation they are in. The parts which drew you in the most were the scenes with the ''organisms'' (NTI's) flying around the base, it was mysterious and you were drawn closer as you become curious to know what they were.Much later in the film with the scene where Ed Harris jumps down into the trench to find the warhead, was when it started to get a bit absurd as he ventures into the extreme depths, but hey it's a sci-fi, so why complain right? It was actually gripping to see him go so deep. Although 5 minutes from that, the film took another route and that's when Cameron started waterboarding me with his typical ethics and morality vomit that his films are known for. I couldn't help but sulk at the end when we find out that the NTI's had been there the whole time and are going to flood all the land above due to humans destructive nature.The whole film right up to the scene where Ed Harris' character is communicating with the NTI's is a good movie, borderline great as it was entertaining, but when that scene started, it threw everything away which it had built. Suddenly I lost all interest and did not care. This film would have been an 8 from me, but due to Cameron failing to resist his classic urge to try and make the human race feel guilty, I had to sink it to a 6.Never the less, I still recommend this movie!",The Abyss
380,agnoli_cucina1,Stuning,9,25 February 2012,"The special effects are stunning. As with a lot of Cameron's hits, this was an innovator in special effects. If it wasn't for this film, films such as The Matrix and Lord of the Rings would not be here or at least would not have been able to express themselves in a visual sense.Cameron is the ultimate director. Although he is a pain to work with, he gets his image across and proves why he is such a hit machine. No one compares to him when it comes to picking a cast. Even though most of this cast were, and still are, unknown, the performances in this are fantastic. I know I always praise him but Michael Biehn as Coffey is one of the best acting performances I have ever seen and the fact that Biehn was not even Oscar nominated is a travesty! He is great to watch as the maniac who is irate and just plain horrible. Ed Harris is on par with his good performances in The Rock and Apollo 13. You just want to be his mate in this movie despite the fact he is another pain (see Rock out takes) which is why him and Cameron have not spoken a word since this film. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was a bit of a fad. She didn't last very long being in good films but she is good as the hard nosed estranged wife who near the end, becomes wonderfully vulnerable and loving.",The Abyss
381,DTMTP,Okay movie. Crappy ending.,6,20 January 2005,"This movie starts off great. A crew of oil workers on a submersible drilling platform, led by Ed Harris, are reluctantly asked by the U.S. Navy to assist in a rescue operation involving a sunken nuclear submarine. So far so good. Then a violent hurricane cuts them off from the surface and the rest of the outside world leaving the survivors stranded underwater in their now damaged rig. Still good.Then this wet, otherworldly aqua-phallic thing shows up and this is where things start to go downhill. This movie would have been much better as a straight up action/adventure yarn but no, Mr. Jim had to crap it up with these Sci-Fi elements that in my opinion just don't work. Don't get me wrong, I really like Science Fiction, but it just didn't belong in this movie. The filmmakers tried too hard to give us a sense of wonder and all I got out of it was a sense of embarrassment. Especially when Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio spits out the line, ""It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!"". She actually had to shut her eyes for that one.I dunno, maybe I'm being too hard on it. The cast is good. The production design and FX are first rate. I just wish it hadn't ended on such a cutesy/corny note.",The Abyss
382,tecso,edge of my seat,9,1 October 2005,"I just saw this thriller I'd never heard of - despite the fact that it came out what, 16 years ago? Wow, I was on the edge of my seat by halfway through the film! Loved it! Tension builds and a nice pace, until you are holding your breath along with the characters in the film. Nicely acted by leads I haven't seen much of (always a plus in my opinion). Plot turns surprised me too. They are clearly taking some liberties with the facts of science, like many Hollywood films. But I was so caught up in the movie, I didn't necessarily care. One criticism, the movie may have gone on a shade longer than it should have; this is a very long movie that could have benefited from a director's cut to the ending. Recommended for anyone who likes Jacques Cousteau documentaries.",The Abyss

384,bas_buiting-1,don't know how this rating has got so high,1,21 January 2006,"I have rated this movie with awful. Although the effects are quite o.k. for a movie from 1989. However the story is really not good. When a US submarine sinks, maybe at that time the Russian were interested in the heads of the missiles. However the interference of aliens is very sf. Too much and overdone. The story gets worse and worse after half an hour, and the first half hour is really boring, because you might think that a great story will begin. Don't see this movie, if you don't want to waste time.Normally I don't comment, however when I saw the rating I looked forward to this movie, and maybe with more expectations then it is really worth.",The Abyss
385,knoxville13,This film was very exciting and interesting and i would like to watch it again and again,8,14 April 2005,Overall i thought that this film was very interesting and it showed me what may happen to the future of the earth many years from now. Before watching this my favourite sci-fi film was the terminator films but after i saw this amazing film i made up my mind and suggested that this would now be my best sci-fi film that i have seen. The storyline was great and the actors that played all the characters were very good. I really liked this film and if i get the chance to see it again then i will be watching it for certain. thanks for making this film and i hope that you make more films like this so that other people can watch it too and then they may also write comments like what i am doing now.,The Abyss
386,donufro,Amazing Film,10,1 June 2005,"This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated movies in history. It's a spectacular film, with great acting, an interesting story, entertaining characters, social relevance, great musical score, and great special effects. Even though it was made in 1989, I'm not joking when I say that most of the effects still hold up today. The plot remains interesting with all kinds of twists and action sequences, but the heart never leaves.Basically, film is a very imaginative underwater action adventure that's just plain fun for everybody.Be sure to watch the Director's Cut, though, or the Special Edition DVD with the 28 extra minutes. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT watch the theatrical version because they cut out pivotal plot points and some of it doesn't make sense - especially the entire end of the movie.",The Abyss
387,Witkh13,Klassik,8,20 May 2015,"Movies that depict Extraterrestrial Biological Entities as benevolent, or multi-faction interest in Terra and it's indigenous life forms is something I greatly enjoy. I mean to suggest that it is insane to expect any advanced civilization to be free of the debate between state versus individual liberty and our Goddess given inalienable right.While this show's underwater EBEs are entirely one dimensional characters, the idea that they are living underwater where we have yet to truly explore is... or at least it 'was' amazing when it was first released. Even now, about a quarter tuns {Mayan Calendar, 360 days} later, the closest Hollywood foray into the field was SeaQuest and that was still almost two decades ago.All those who have a similar taste as me and highly value classic comedies {instead of tragedy}, and a romance shares center stage with another other science fiction plot or two. They will greatly enjoy the movie as I do. It is one of those movies I watched yearly when I was younger.Despite my favor for the show, I limited it to 8/10 simply because of the ending. It showcases the stereotypical silent stoic EBE that is 'horrified' at our nuclear weapons. That is just a bunch of statist propaganda that completely ignores the circumstantial evidence that suggests the EBE's have an entirely different view.That is the EBEs' are marvelling at how the public has abundantly allowed the statists to cease control of Nikola Tesla's working diagrams for power generators and relays for wireless transmission of power.. That is through air, earth, or water.Ask a pilot how much easier it would be to fly without the process of carrying fuel with the... Not to mention safer.",The Abyss
388,tieroc,"Romance in ""The Abyss""",9,22 July 2017,"""The Abyss"" is absolutely wonderful to watch. The SFX are beautiful, both practical and computer. But I think it is the characters, their relationships to each other that provide the heart of the movie. And the heart of that heart are the Brigmans. ""The Abyss"" is science fiction with romance at it's core. Cameron is a hardcore romantic. His movies are about love. In ""The Abyss"" Ed Harris has an occasion to kiss his wedding ring. The scene is powerful, explodes with joy. Every time I see it I feel it.",The Abyss
389,AlienX69-1,In Regards to the DVD releases !!!,10,27 August 2009,"The is an EXCELLENT movie, it's in my TOP 10 list !! I can watch it again and again, especially since getting the 2-Disk Extended Release (2003-09-23)on DVD (171 minute version). I saw this movie when it was first released in 1989 at the theater. I read the book first before seeing the movie and was amazed at how well they produced the CGI for the ""Pseudopod"". My only disappointment is with the screen format on all the DVD releases. This wonderful movie has yet to be released in Anamorphic WS. All DVD versions have been 2.35 LETTERBOX, very disappointing !!! The Bonus Disk has some GREAT Features, and definitely has one of the nicest Menus I've ever run across.FYI's: First, to properly view on a 16x9 WS TV your set/projector needs the capability of Zooming. Some set-ups require you to set the resolution to 720p to get the proper Zoom functions, i.e. my 52"" Phillips LCD. Secondly, I noticed that the Audio defaults to 2.0 Stereo instead of 5.1 Dolby, so make sure to change if your viewing on a Home Theater set-up !!",The Abyss
390,menager-bertrand,"feel from ""the abyss""",10,8 January 2006,"When i discovered ""the abyss"", it was the first time i saw a James CAMERON's film : the story took me down into the abyss, and i watched the whole movie in an only one evening, included the making of, i went to bed past midnight, it was breath taking, i cried in the pivotal moment when Lindsey drowns, and Bud saved his wife, the music kicked my adrenaline rate, it is a ""must have"" movie in your collection!!!! Michael BIEHN was excellent in his part of a military person, the SFX were astounding, the Oscar for the pseudopod sequence is justified for ILM, the sound immerses you underwater. Mary Elizabeth MASTRANTONIO and Ed HARRIS were fitted for their parts. I rate ""the Abyss"" : excellent!!!!!",The Abyss
391,kratzerjulie,"Abyss, a great film",10,12 March 2006,"Despite reading the ""goofs"", I love watching this movie. Abyss continues to be one of my all-time favorite films along with Independence Day, Twister, among other. Bud and Linds are indeed a great couple and that rat is too much. The rest of the cast compliments them both. Being a former Navy brat, I understand the ""language"" is critical to being an honest Navy film. Loved ""one-night"" and Mr. Burmeister (have seen him on Law and Order as a lawyer). Tried to find out about that rat but its not in the credits. It looked real but these days you never know. I realize that some things are a bit far-fetched in this movie but the action, underwater sequences, and the final saving of Bud in the end by the aliens was masterfully done. A truly great film, I have a purchased copy at home and take the time to watch it whenever its on Sci-fi Channel. Being a sci-fi enthusiast, an original Trekker, etc., I love good science fiction.
