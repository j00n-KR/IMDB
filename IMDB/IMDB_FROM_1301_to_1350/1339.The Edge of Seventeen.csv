0,SnoopyStyle,funny,8,2 June 2017,"Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) loved her father and battled with her mother (Kyra Sedgwick). At 13, she lost her father. Her life is one of miserable sarcasm except for her best friend since second grade, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson). She hates her perfect brother Darian (Blake Jenner). Dorky Erwin Kim has a crush on her but she's in lust with delinquent Nick Mossman. To her horrors, Krista starts dating Darian. The only person she could turn to is equally sarcastic teacher Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson).It's funny. It's touching. It's poignant. There are no superficial characters in the main group. The jokes are great. Everybody's great. Woody is a real standout. The only drawback I can remotely dig up is that Hailee Steinfeld is too pretty. She follows a long line of Hollywood beauties who dress down to do 'She's All That'. The Pedro joke is hilarious which helps a lot. However, she's never going to be Danny DeVito level. The reason it works so well is a terrific performance from Hailee. She really sells this self-obsessed bitter teen while maintaining a great likability. One roots for her and sees the world from her eyes even as everyone knows that she's wrong. Hailee shows some terrific acting talents once again.",The Edge of Seventeen
1,nogodnomasters,You need to watch for run-on sentences,8,31 July 2017,"This film has nothing to do with the rock anthem ""Edge of Seventeen."" It is sort of like watching ""Harper valley PTA"" and discovering it was a different Harper Valley PTA where nothing went on.Hailee Steinfeld has inherited the moody maladjusted teen role from Ellen Page, who could probably still pull it off, we just wouldn't believe it. We see Nadine ""suffer"" through all sorts of teen angst and faux drama, like her best friend (Haley Lu Richardson) is dating her hunk brother (Blake Jenner). I am not sure what the issue is there, but whatever it was, it was big. She does not confide in her mother (Kyra Sedgwick) and growing up, she was a daddy's girl until he passed. Her loan confidant is her history teacher (Woody Harrelson) who has his own way which adds to the humor of the film. Nadine is crushing on Nick (Alexander Calvert) while Erwin (Hayden Szeto) crushes on her...more like ""Love Stinks"" than ""Edge of Seventeen."" The feature was a comedy for much of the time, except for that one moment near the end they are required to squeeze in drama, so we can have that formula ""feel good"" ending.Guide: F-word. Implied sex. Groping. sexting. No nudity",The Edge of Seventeen
2,jboothmillard,The Edge of Seventeen,7,15 May 2020,"I found this film when it was broadcast on television, I remember the actress being fantastic with her Oscar nominated debut in the remake of True Grit, and now she's made the successful move into pop music, I was looking forward to seeing another well-rated film with her. Basically, Nadine Franklin (Golden Globe nominated Hailee Steinfeld) is a seventeen-year-old high school student living in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon. As a child, young Nadine (Lina Renna) was very close to her father Tom (Eric Keenleyside), and eventually found friendship with young Krista (Ava Grace Cooper). Unfortunately, when she was thirteen, she suffered tragedy when her father died of a heart attack. Since then, Nadine has had difficult relationships with her popular older brother Darian (Blake Jenner, Caitlyn's son) and her image conscious mother Mona (Kyra Sedgwick), but she maintains a strong friendship with Krista (Haley Lu Richardson). At Nadine's home, Darian throws a pool party where Nadine and Krista get drunk. Nadine falls asleep and Krista goes downstairs and talks to Darian. The next morning, Nadine finds Krista masturbating a naked Darian in bed, which puts a strain on their friendship. The next day, Darian and Krista run into each other, he asks her out. Nadine feels desperately alone, she turns to her classmate Erwin Kim (Hayden Szeto), who has a crush on her, but Nadine is attracted to older student Nick Mossman (Alexander Calvert). Darian invites Krista to a house party, but she insists Nadine join them. There, Nadine is left on her own when Krista is introduced to other students. After failing to mingle with anybody, Nadine sits outside, where a fellow partygoer makes an insulting remark. After Nadine leaves the party, she invites Erwin to an amusement park. He attempts to kiss her but is rejected. They still finish the date, and Nadine tells Erwin he is a great guy. At school, Krista confronts Nadine for ignoring her. Nadine tells her Darian does not really care about her and will eventually drop her. Krista retorts by telling Nadine that he has asked her to be his girlfriend and to be his date for the prom. Nadine makes her choose between herself and Darian. As Krista does not want to choose, Nadine feels betrayed and angrily ends their friendship. Nadine finds a source of support at school from her teacher, Max Bruner (Woody Harrelson). She vents to him, and he humorously teases her by admitting that she is his favourite student. Nadine has become lost due to not seeing Krista, she calls Erwin and invites herself round to his swimming pool, much to his excitement. Nadine realises he is rich showing up at his house and that he is an animation filmmaker and accepts his invitation to the school short-film festival. Following an argument, Mona brings Nadine with her to work. There, they continue to argue, during which Nadine's late father is mentioned; Mona tells Nadine that he would be extremely disappointed in the way she has turned out. Nadine angrily steals Mona's car and drives away. Feeling alone and desperate, she writes a sexually explicit text to Nick, but instead of deleting it, she accidentally sends it. Nadine confides in Mr. Bruner that she is going to kill herself after this has happened. But she is surprised and delighted when she receives a reply from Nick asking her out. After Nadine has got ready and snuck out, Mona returns to find the mess, and calls Darian tells him to find her. On their date, Nick kisses Nadine and repeatedly attempts to have sex with her in his car. Nadine rejects his advances, she assumed that he genuinely wanted to spend time with her and get to know her. Embarrassed and heartbroken, Nadine runs away and calls Mr. Bruner, who drives her to his house, with his wife (Meredith Monroe) and infant son. Darian arrives and tells Nadine that he has been pressured having responsibilities in their father's place, he says he feels trapped and has only applied to colleges nearby. Darian confesses that the only person who makes him happy is Krista. Nadine confesses her own feelings of self-hatred, intensified by her jealousy of Darian's popularity. They hug, ending their feud. As Nadine leaves for the film festival, she is met by Darian and Krista. Nadine and Krista reconcile and agree to catch up later. Realising that Mona is still worried about her, Nadine texts her that she is safe, and Mona decides to trust her. Erwin's animated film turns out to be a story about an alien boy who falls in love with a girl at high school but is rejected. Nadine apologises to Erwin for taking so long to accept his feelings for her. Erwin is congratulated by his colleagues, and introduces Nadine, she smiles and finally feels confident in herself. Also starring Nesta Cooper as Shannon and Christian Michael Cooper as young Darian. Steinfeld gives a fantastic show-stealing lead performance as the awkward teenager having agonising misadventures, including clashes with her mother and brother, having bad dates, tense friendships, and unrequited crushes. But there is also a terrific supporting cast, especially the brilliant Harrelson as the sarcastic droll teacher unafraid to bite back at Steinfeld's snappy digs, but also help her however he can, some of the best and funniest scenes are them bantering. This film steers away from teen movie clichés and make it feel really fresh, with a witty script perfectly capturing the often agonising teenage experience and complexities of growing up, with memorably funny and dramatic moments. It is aimed at the social media generation, but anyone can watch it, and you are guaranteed to laugh and wince in equal measure, a terrific coming-of-age comedy-drama. Very good!",The Edge of Seventeen
3,Quinoa1984,"it asks for your sympathy, or more-so your empathy, while being very funny and perceptive",9,20 November 2016,"If you're on the outside, in a strange way it may be preferable in certain ways than being the ""perfect"" child. I know this from experience - being a teenager sucked, and felt very much alone and alienated and without many (if any) friends, and feeling like everyone around was full of crap and not worth paying attention to - that there is this ironic thing that being someone like Nadine in this story is that it makes that person feel special. This is a revelation that comes late in the movie, but it's something that should've been seen for so long: you now, Nadine, the 'perfect' ones are pretty damn miserable too. Know that and see that. That's a message enough.The other problem for teenagers, which I think a lot of people (myself included) can relate to, is that sense of low self esteem. All the time, always, pervasive, even if life is, when looking from outside, not too bad. Nadine has a good friend, Krista, who she's been close with since she was a little kid, and she has a loving mother (though a little too, what's the word, not relatable or able to connect with or aw hell mothers and daughters at that age never get along for like two years), and also a perfect brother... and then the conflict comes when, outside of anything Nadine does, Krista and Darian (Blake Jenner) become a serious couple. Oh, and Nadine's dad died when she was 13 so there's that on top of everything else.The filmmaker Kelly Fremon Craig makes sure there's enough inner conflict so that when Nadine does go into what could be called a spiral of despair and depression, there is *some* context for it. I have to wonder if I would have liked the film as much or found enough to be sympathetic and/or even empathetic (yes, as a guy I can feel in her shoes, it's past gender and into how a worldview is at that age, of other people in general), if there hadn't been that past baggage, of having identity issues in a family, or lacking the father who was the one who loved her the most, if she was just, uh, another teenage girl with issues of identity and crushing on the cute unattainable boy (with that hair, the girls will say!) I think the power and brilliance of the script, and there is brilliance to it for the most part, is that Craig makes sure to have characters call Nadine on her problems, that she is surrounded by people who both care about her AND make sure to see through her poutier/more dramatic moments.And there is a lot of drama here, a lot of it may be (or just is) Nadine's own making. The movie opens with the scene we've seen from the trailers where she tells Woody Harrelson's teacher character that she's going to kill herself (his response, in the ways of knowing, sympathetic but No-BS teachers who have clearly seen girls like Nadine before, has his own ""suicide note"" that he reads to her, undercutting her immediately), and it makes for something that is funny and poignant and incredibly clever; his response to her frantic sense of panic over sending the message asking the cute-boy to do things to her (and her to him) in the Pet-Land backroom is the kind of witty line one might expect in a less-strict script from the 1940's. There's wit burning off the screen here.These characters, for the most part here, are not dumb characters or stupid, or if they make the wrong decisions (Nadine most of all) it's out of not being able to control themselves emotionally. I do wish that Krista had been a little more in the film, or a little more developed. But it's not her story anyway; if anything this filmmaker knows that in other conventional stories, it might be her story and Darian. But Nadine is interesting *because* she is so messed up and we want to see her get better, or to connect more with the genuine nice guy (aka slightly ""dorky"" but in a way that should be attractive), and Craig may make her unlikable to some in the audience - those, maybe, that just see her as the ""B"" word that can't get her s*** together and smarten up (the only criticism I thought of was when she asked Erwin if he had a pool, and when he said yes and that she had one too I thought, 'huh, alright, that should be fine shouldn't it?') I think the key to The Edge of Seventeen's success is that the script was one thing, and it is already a smart and perceptive script - dare I, oh, hell, I'll just say it, I like it more than something that is quirkier but still in the pocket of certain clichés like JUNO - but the actors have to make it come alive. Steinfeld is spectacular in making Nadine someone who you more than feel fore but can put your shoes into, of that insecurity matched with that ""I hate all these other people"" feeling, and that she makes her charming despite those moments when she does some terrible things to her family. Harrelson is the ""wise old man"" of the film (and he's BALD too, or, you know, sort of balding, that's the best Nadine can come up with as far as a put down), and Sedgwick is wonderful as the mother too, making someone who is seen one way to her daughter and to us another way as frustrated, flustered and still loving deep down.",The Edge of Seventeen
4,edwagreen,**1/2,6,1 October 2017,"Dysfunctional is certainly the word here as Haile Steinfeld is becoming of age. Problem is that the film lacks true grit in every sense of the word.Rebellious and sad from an early age, her mother is equally off the wall as played by Kyra Sedgwick. Matters get complicated when her fun loving dad collapses and dies while driving his car with his daughter next to him.Woody Harrelson plays an off-beat history teacher who in reality really gives a bad name to the teaching profession. He becomes Nadine's counselor, especially when she tells him of her plan to commit suicide and he responds that he is planning to do himself in as well.The story goes on in an unending set of circumstances, Sedgwick's widow lady having an affair with her dentist, Nadine's older brother falling for her only friend that really sets her off. Is this sibling rivalry, jealousy or just a mixed up girl taking out her frustrations with life?The odd-ball ending where the brother tells off the sister and saying that she has been right all the time leads to a presto normal girl. Does life really work that way, or is this wishful thinking on the part of the cast?",The Edge of Seventeen
5,michaelRokeefe,Straight forward look at reality,10,8 May 2018,"Kudos to Kelly Fremon Craig for her writing and direction of this coming-of-age drama that features well placed moments of humor. Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) is a 17-year-old that feels very awkward and is still grieving the death of her father after four years. Her closest friend is Krista (Haley Lu Richardson) in this edgy dynamic of high school society. Things become a bit more twisted when Nadine finds out that Krista is secretly dating Nadine's detested older brother, Darian (Blake Jenner). It is not like Nadine has exactly lost her only friend. When she suffers her day-to-day tragic problems, she rushes to the classroom of Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson) and unloads on him as he casually tries to eat his lunch; Nadine is berating him and insulting him with little mercy as this is the way she calms herself down. Miss Steinfeld is absolutely tremendous in this role. Playing her role so seamlessly; so fresh and even genuine. And you get no idea Steinfeld is actually 19 years old playing a girl two years younger. For Harrelson, no one could play his part any better. His devotion to a troubled student, all the while he himself has life problems of his own.Rounding out the cast: Alexander Calvert, Nesta Cooper, Hayden Szeto and Kyra Sedgwick.",The Edge of Seventeen

It will not be remembered with the same affection as those films.It's not without charm, it has good performances, but it's nowhere near as good as Hughes's films, or even the best attempt at mimicking them that there has been in recent years.I believed the hype about this film, but there's nothing really to get that excited about.",The Edge of Seventeen
7,oscaralbert,Two doors down from me lives a troubled 17-year-old . . .,8,22 November 2016,". . . (plus or minus a few years) who emerges from his home without any warning once or twice (day or night) to emit loud moans and groans at the top of his voice. These hopeless screeches, most often without any coherent words, seem likely to carry a block or two (depending upon which way the breeze is blowing). They can be best described as the perfect audio track to fit artist Edvard Munch's iconic painting THE SCREAM. Though I have not met this tormented individual, my housemate has, when she felt threatened as he pursued his pet white collie into our yard. This morning was a rare instance in which his shouts could be deciphered, as in ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"" My guess is that he was sorry for letting the collie out of the house again, as it apparently makes a beeline to get as far away from the troubled master as it can any chance that it has for canine normalcy. I assume that the presence of 24-hour caregivers at the home, along with frequent visits by fire engines and ambulances, indicate that the all-hours screamer has some sort of mental deficit. (If he lived just ONE door down from me, I'd probably know more, but here in America we mind our own business since we never know if our neighbor is a serial killer, or--even worse--a Racist Rump supporter.) However, our neighborhood Mystery Youth was the first person of whom I was reminded while watching this Canadian version of JUNO play out. ""Nadine"" is a mean-spirited rooster-tease (if you substitute that four-letter rooster synonym beginning with a ""c"" and ending with ""k""). Because she lives in Canada, she doesn't wind up pregnant like JUNO, since rapists are effectively deterred there by the threat of amputation. Though viewers will realize that someone as full of ""Teen Angst"" as Nadine would never enjoy a ""happy ending"" in America, I guess North of the border all things are possible.",The Edge of Seventeen
8,neil-476,"Really? I mean, really?",6,16 May 2018,"17-year old Nadine has felt out of place since she was small. When her best friend since childhood, Krista, takes up with her hated older brother Darian, Nadine feels even more isolated than usual, and her Drama Queen antics lead in an even more negative direction than usual.Hailee Steinfeld plays Nadine, and I have rather liked this young woman's performances since she first exploded in the Coen Brothers' True Grit. In this movie, she plays Nadine brilliantly.The trouble is that Nadine is not very likeable and not very believable. She actually has quite a nice life, being well provided for by her single-parent mother, and also enjoying the fact that her brother takes on various parental roles, notwithstanding normal sibling antagonism.So when she utterly selfishly forces her best friend to make the choice of her brother or her, she loses any audience sympathy she may have had, and it wasn't much to start with. And the sequence where she accidentally sends a sexually explicit text to a boy she fancies, goes out with him when he responds, and is then horrified when he expects her to deliver on the text - well, words failed me, notwithstanding ""No"" means ""no."".Perhaps it's an accurate reflection of teenage angst, but it's quite different to the teenage angst I went through.And the resolution of the film was glib beyond belief - here is a youngster, who on the basis of what the film shows us, has been somewhat socially inept, or worse, since childhood, and all of a sudden she develops a sunny disposition towards others simply because of some home truths and a new friendship? I don't buy it. She should be in counselling.If it's not obvious, let me spell it out: the trailer sells this as a teen comedy, but it's not. It's a character-driven drama, albeit with some amusing moments. A slight and everyday drama, to be sure, but a drama nevertheless. The trailer deceives.It's not all negative. As well as Steinfeld's undoubted skill in selling her character, the film also benefits from Woody Harrelson as a humorously cynical teacher, and the luminously lovely Haley Lu Richardson as Krista, some decent support work among the rest of the cast, and sufficient interest in the characters to keep your attention throughout.",The Edge of Seventeen
9,evanston_dad,The Teenage Battle Field,8,11 October 2017,"At first I thought ""The Edge of Seventeen"" would grate on my every nerve. The jokey tone felt forced, and I didn't know if I could stand two hours of Hailee Steinfeld's character, an unlikable girl who thinks she's funnier and cuter than she is. But if you're feeling this way yourself, stick with it, because the film expands into a much richer and much less glib examination of adolescence than it appears that it's going to be at the outset.Steinfeld gives a wonderful performance, and pulls off a tricky role. Characters like this are always a gamble for actors. They have to be played just right or we just end up disliking them. Steinfeld manages to make us exasperated with her even while we understand that her unlikability is her armor and the thing that stands between her deep insecurity and the fear that she is going to be rejected. Better to be the one who rejects and therefore the one in control of any given situation. One thing I liked most about this film is the complexity it brings to every character. We see them first as one- note caricatures because that's how Steinfeld's character sees them, but over the course of the film she and we realize that they have much more complicated inner lives that she was missing because of her self absorption.The ending of this film is a bit too pat and neat, and once again suggests to unwary moviegoers that people with emotional challenges can just be better if they decide they want to be. But overall I very much liked this study of what it's like to be a teenager these days, even if it doesn't remotely resemble my own teenage years.Grade: A-",The Edge of Seventeen
10,Uriah43,A Stark Contrast Between Drama and Comedy,5,15 March 2019,"Insanely jealous of her older brother, ""Darian"" (Blake Jenner) a young girl named ""Nadine"" (Hailee Steinfeld) has only one friend she can confide in and count on who goes by the name of ""Krista"" (Hailey Lu Richardson). And they remain best friends from the second grade to their junior year in high school. However, when Krista starts dating Darian, Nadine's world falls apart. So to combat her lonliness she attempts to socialize more with others which, due to her lack of social skills, leads to one bizarre scenario after the other. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an uneven film which featured a stark contrast between the drama and the comedy. Although it was certainly watchable, I thought that the constant sarcasm on the part of Nadine was over-played to a certain degree which detracted from the film more than anything else. In any case, while it wasn't a bad movie by any means, I honestly thought it could have been better and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",The Edge of Seventeen
11,deloudelouvain,If you're over twenty-five I would just watch something else.,5,20 August 2017,"My wife saw The Edge Of Seventeen and told me it was a chick flick. So I was warned but I still did watch it though. And I can only come to the conclusion that those ose kind of movies are just not for me. I can get that teenagers like those kind of movies, because maybe they can recognize some stuff from their own adolescent life. But for a grown childless man like myself the last thing I want to see is whining adolescents during ninety minutes. Because that's what you basically get with The Edge Of Seventeen. Hailee Steinfeld plays Nadine, a teenager that complains about almost everything while in my humble opinion she has absolutely no reason to. The movie is shot nicely though, the acting is just okay, the script is boring. Boring for almost everybody past twenty-five.",The Edge of Seventeen
12,Mr-Fusion,Steinfeld's a treasure,8,5 August 2017,"From what I've seen, ""Edge of Seventeen"" is marketed as a teen movie, but there's irony to that. There are the usual genre tropes, but it's also laced with startling pain. The humorous highs are matched by one wince after another, personified by Hailee Steinfeld (who makes bad temperament an art form). Her part is so well cast that the adolescent suffering of Nadine is palpable. I can identify with some of her woes. Woody Harrelson is the other integral piece, the comic wit to balance her angst. His scenes are among the best and he's ideal as the weary history teacher saddled with high school drama.Even when the movie takes a midpoint swerve into abject bitterness, it's concern for Nadine's story that kept me glued. There is a light at the end of this tunnel and it's really a catharsis. You want her to get through this. It's a tremendously affecting movie.8/10",The Edge of Seventeen

And 'The Edge of Seventeen' is literally a John Hughes coming-of-age film, without his name on it, but of a fan, a very talented storyteller named Kelly Fremon Craig, who brings us a film for the ages. And how great is Hailee Steinfeld here? 'The Edge of Seventeen' Synopsis: High-school life gets even more unbearable for Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) when her best friend, Krista, starts dating her older brother. 'The Edge of Seventeen' is about growing up, despite life hitting you hard. I was 17 once, I was anxious, excited & confused, all at the time same. The film's protagonist, Nadine, is exactly how we've all been in our late teens. Kelly has written her protagonist with gusto. Right from giving her immense tragedy as an early teen, to her unknowing selfishness that almost leads her to lose her best friend (only friend), is Written with genuineness. I was engrossed by Nadine's complicated mind & I was waiting to see what she does next. Her journey is a delightful mix of ambiguity & immense pain. Kelly's Writing is strong, keeping us engaged in her Portagonist's journey!Kelly's Direction is simplistic, but perfect. Kelly is a Storyteller to watch out for! Her work here as a Writer & Director, deserves immense praise. Cinematography & Editing are well-done.And now coming to its Ace - Hailee Steinfeld. Steinfeld is mesmerizing as Nadine. The Oscar-Nominated performer blasts up the big-screen with a knockout performance. She emotes each & every emotion, with genuine feeling. Its impossible not to love Nadine, despite her flaws. This is career-high performance, that was overlooked, unfortunately! Steinfeld is perfection! Of the supporting cast, the always-reliable Woody Harrelson scores as Nadine's teacher, who in many ways turns out to be her only mentor. Haley Lu Richardson as Nadine's best friend, is first-rate. Blake Jenner as Nadine's older brother, is natural to the core. Hayden Szeto as Nadine's secret admirer, is fantastic. And Kyra Sedgwick as Nadine's mother, is just right. On the whole, 'The Edge of Seventeen' is an experience you simply can't afford to miss. Say YES To Great Cinema. ALWAYS.",The Edge of Seventeen
14,Hellmant,Beautifully illustrates what it's like to be a social outcast in high school!,9,2 December 2016,"'THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)  The critically acclaimed coming-of-age comedy-drama, from debut feature  filmmaker Kelly Fremon Craig (who also wrote the film). The movie tells  the story of an awkward 17-year-old high school student; that breaks up  with her best friend, when the friend starts dating her older brother.  Life then becomes even more unbearably frustrating for the teen. It  stars Hailee Steinfeld, Woody Harrelson, Hayden Szeto, Blake Jenner,  Haley Lu Richardson and Kyra Sedgwick. It's received almost entirely  positive reviews from critics, but it's only performed moderately well  at the Box Office (thus far). I really enjoyed it.  Nadine (Steinfeld) is an extremely depressed, and very unpopular,  17-year-old high school junior; that's constantly whining about all of  her problems, to her best friend, Krista (Richardson), and her favorite  teacher, Mr. Bruner (Harrelson). One night, while Nadine is  passed-out-drunk, Krista has sex with Nadine's brother, Darian  (Jenner); the two then begin dating. Nadine hates Darian, who's really  popular at school (and an all-star athlete), so this news destroys her.  She then stops talking to Krista, and Darian (mostly), and she feels  more alone, and depressed, than ever. Then she befriends another social  outcast at school, named Erwin (Szeto), who also happens to have a huge  crush on Nadine. Things could finally get better for Nadine, if she can  just learn to let them.   This movie is destined to become a beloved cult classic teen flick; it  very beautifully illustrates what it's like to be a social outcast, in  high school, and it's nice to see it from a young woman's perspective,  from time to time (I wish it was a lot more frequently). The film is  also never too upbeat, or overly positive (in any way); it always takes  a pretty harshly realistic perspective on things. Steinfeld is great in  the lead, and Harrelson is a scene-stealer. I'll definitely be watching  for more movies from Kelly Fremon Craig, and I think this film  definitely deserves some Oscar attention, come awards time (but I doubt  it will get any).",The Edge of Seventeen
15,cherold,"Funny, thoughtful teen angst film fueled by Steinfeld's brilliant performance",9,27 June 2019,"The Edge of Seventeen is a movie about an unhappy teenager being unhappy. It's a common theme, but this one is elevated by a sharp, witty script and a bunch of excellent performances. Chief among these is Hailee Steinfeld as Nadine. She is amazing as a girl who's high-energy desperation makes you feel like she's about to explode through her own skin.Nadine is a wonderfully real character, awkward and angry and funny and sad and, down deeper, reasonably decent for a teenager. She deals with the LIFE OR DEATH problems of teenagehood, like getting in a fight with a friend, being ignored by the really hot guy, and figuring out what to do about the not-as-hot guy nervously chatting you up.The movie begins with a scene of her bantering with a sardonic teacher played wonderfully by Woody Harrelson, and their conversations are wonderfully prickly and offbeat.I do have a couple of quibbles. First, it's not entirely convincing that someone as attractive as Steinfeld would be ignored as thoroughly. Yes, attractive people can be shy and awkward, but an attractive girl is going to get some level of attention beyond one geeky guy.Second, the ending feels like an unrealistically abrupt transformation. It's emotionally satisfying but annoyingly unconvincing.But overall this movie is terrific and you should watch it.",The Edge of Seventeen

It's a dry, somewhat sardonic but ultimately quite uplifting piece with a keen focus on its over-reacting protagonist and her slightly skewed but valid and understandable world view. The experience is an entertaining if pretty predictable one that is sometimes surprisingly moving and always enjoyable even during its most paint-by-numbers moments. 7/10",The Edge of Seventeen
17,ThomasDrufke,"Fresh, Endearing, and Funny",8,18 November 2016,"I can't say that I expected to see this movie opening weekend, or at all for that matter. But I'm glad I did. The Edge of Seventeen is an awkwardly charming coming of age tale that flirts in the same vein as some classic John Hughes 80's flicks.I think all of us have been keeping an eye on Hailee Steinfeld since True Grit in 2010. When you can steal scenery from the likes of Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin, you know you have someone special. The Edge of Seventeen is an entirely different genre and obstacle for Steinfeld, however. I almost think that the coming-of- age-teenage-angst-comedy-drama's are the most difficult films to reach a broad audience, perhaps even more so than westerns. I usually need something to hook me before I spend money on one of these, and that came by way of Woody Harrelson.Harrelson play's Steinfeld's teacher and common companion at lunch when there's no one else to sit with. The brilliant thing about this relationship is that its neither too dramatic nor too goofy, the writers find a nice balance between gut busting laughs on Harrelson's end to a nice dramatic payoff in the latter half. For all the clichés that this film inevitably has, this relationship was something very refreshing and served as the highlights for most of the film.Nadine (Steinfeld) has several issues with her mother, brother, and best friend to figure out throughout the course of the film. But it was pleasing to see that the writers didn't choose to make any one character in the right or wrong. I constantly felt like I was playing out both sides in my head as to who I believe had the right to be mad at the other or vice versa. Being in a family of 7, I can definitely relate to some of the family obstacles Nadine goes through, and it wasn't Hollywoodized just for the sake of pushing the plot forward. There's unfortunately quite a few clichéd tropes that this film ends up taking you toward, but it felt more natural than most of these types of films. This could be attributed to the welcomed R rating the film received.It isn't for everyone, and I wouldn't even consider myself the target audience. But it speaks to larger personal and family issues than the trailer sets up. It's also one of the best Woody Harrelson performances I've seen recently, even if he is probably as reserved as he's ever been.+Steinfeld carries this film+With the help of the hilarious Harrelson+Writing-Inevitably some clichés and predictable plot points8.0/10",The Edge of Seventeen
18,gbill-74877,"Strong cast, strong script, great direction",8,27 December 2017,"Hailee Steinfeld is a revelation in this film, playing an incredibly awkward and difficult to like teenager who spirals after her father dies and her only friend (Haley Lu Richardson) begins dating her brother (Blake Jenner). We empathize with her and understand that she means well, but we cringe as she's incredibly insensitive to her teacher (Woody Harrelson) and a boy who likes her (Hayden Szeto). Kyra Sedgwick is good as the mother, dealing with her own pain and insecurities, and yet also unkind to her daughter. It's a strong cast, and a strong script as well - emotionally honest, and never cloying. Steinfeld's scenes with Szeto on the roller coaster and swimming pool are very well done, as are her scenes with Jenner late in the movie. Throughout it all, Harrelson dispensing tough love hits all the right notes. It's hard to do films in this genre because there has been so many over the years, but director Kelly Fremon Craig gives this one a sense of depth and substance.",The Edge of Seventeen

The movie is rated R, and I think that is actually the right rating for this. There is some sexual content in this but no nudity, I say that because for those parents that are wondering if your teen should watch the rating is because of the subject matter and the way she thinks. 14-15 year old girls will miss the meaning of the movie. This movie is more mainstream than Perks of Being a Wallflower but is relatively geared toward the same audience and has some of the same morals.

Its all just clicked here very well, it is a perfectly balanced comedy which is always on the edge on the drama. Writing (and directing) by Kelly Fremon Craig was great. Acting by Hailee Steinfeld was very good as well as from a supporting cast. Overall, at running time 1 h 40 min i was involved into this movie more then i thought i would be, because it is not a very fresh or original story, but it was written and acted so good that i watched this film in one sit - and that happen kinda rarely these days.

It is a fine, sensible drama with some fun. It's a dream debut for the director. Being a woman and making a film on the same subject, especially teenager issue, really well investigated and turned into the beautiful film. Yeah, it is now one of the cult films and by the years pass on, it will gain more popularity with a certain group of people.A teen girl who lost her close friend to her brother after they both falling in love which she did not approve. It's only the beginning of her worst life in her mid teenage. So now she has to find a way to turn her life around, or she can live her life as it is, but with complaints. The second half of the film is to cover her attempt to recovery, if she achieves one.The surprise was, I anticipated normal teen comedy that targeted teens only. But it is almost for all ages, excluding the little ones for its strong thematic contents. Kind of inspiring and entertaining film. The casting was awesome. Hailee nailed it just like Ellen Page did for 'Juno'. Yeah, the people were comparing it with that film already.

24,sol-,From the Edge,7,5 January 2017,"Life proves challenging for a teenage social miscast when she chooses to ignore her only friend in this bubbly comedy-of-age comedy starring Hailee Steinfeld. It is a performance that earned Steinfeld a Golden Globe nomination and good reviews. Her narcissistic, cynical character is not always easy to relate to, however, Steinfeld brings enough wit and spunk to the role that she always feels like a real human being, if an incredibly impulsive one. Her brother and mother are also well-written characters who gradually seem less and less like stereotypes as the film chugs along. Solid as the characters are, the plot is not exactly new or original with a 'love is closer than you think' angle almost identical to Steinfeld's previous film, 'Barely Lethal'. Hayden Szeto is, however, perfectly cast as the potential love interest in question. Between his nervous mannerisms, wicked sense of humour and private celebrations while trying to woo Steinfeld, he manages to come off as incredibly down-to-earth. Woody Harrelson is also well cast as an ostensibly lazy history teacher who Steinfeld seems to perceive as a kindred spirit of sorts, and the film additionally offers Kyra Sedgwick her most dynamic turn in years as Steinfeld's long-suffering mother who is not quite as oppressive as she initially seems to be. In fact, one of the most refreshing things about the film is the lack of antagonists. There are no teenage 'mean girls', selfish jocks, odious siblings or evil teachers in the mix. Everybody present is a flawed a human being. How many teen films can one say that about?",The Edge of Seventeen
25,zkonedog,"Authentic, But Not Necessarily Always Entertaining",5,18 March 2017,"Much of the positive buzz about ""The Edge of Seventeen"" came from positive comparisons to films like ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""16 Candles"". As I'm always up for movies that describe the emotional state of the teen years (provided they aren't gross-out/sex comedies...I don't care for those all that much), and am a big fan of Hailee Steinfeld, I decided to give this one a try. What I found is that while the film is most certainly authentic (i.e. seems to be true to what teens go through these days), I can't say it was really all that entertaining either. It just lacked that emotional investment towards the characters that one needs to truly fall in love with a film.For a basic plot summary, ""Edge of Seventeen"" tells the story of Nadine (Steinfeld), a teen girl who doesn't fit in with anyone in her school. The only way she wards off utter depression is that best friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson) always has her back and teacher Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson) proves to be a great sounding board for her problems. Things don't get much better at home, as Krista resents her super-popular brother Darian (Blake Jenner) and mother Mona (Kyra Sedgwick) struggles to function after the death of her husband. A chain of complicated events/emotions is put into play when Krista and Darian become a pair, prompting Nadine to really examine many different aspects of her life.First and foremost when evaluating ""Edge of Seventeen"" is the fact that this movie is completely and utterly carried by Steinfeld. She is a true acting talent (and has proved as much in previous films like ""True Grit"" and ""Pitch Perfect 2"") and dare I say without her presence this film may have been a complete dog. Even when the beats seem predictable or the acting isn't up to the highest standards, Steinfeld can carry both the light-hearted and emotional scenes. The only times I was emotionally invested in this film whatsoever were when she was front and center.Unfortunately, there are just too many other problems that plague this movie to really give it anything higher than a middling rating. For example...-Richardson's Krista looks like she is going to be a great character...but then is basically abandoned about halfway through the film.-Blake Jenner is cast perfect for his role in terms of physical appearance and stature, but I felt that perhaps his acting chops weren't what was needed for the part. I won't go so far as to call him a ""poor actor"", but a big part of family dynamics on the film center on him, and I was wholly underwhelmed when that was the case.-After the first 30-40 minutes (in which I was quite engaged), the rest of the way felt rather predictable and uninspiring. In other words, the setup was far, far better than the resolution.I realize that it is perhaps difficult for me (as an over-30 male) to fully identify with this movie, but I wasn't a teen in the 80s either and I still love ""Breakfast Club"". What that movie had that this one lacked was a such of dramatic flair, not being afraid to really break down what was going on in the minds of the characters. I feel like in ""Edge of Seventeen"", the focus was more on ""authenticity"" (making sure the look/feel of things seemed right) than ""dramatic entertainment"".So, while I think that the target audience (teens) will like this one more than I, I also don't think this will stand the test of time as a ""standout teen flick"", either. If you value authenticity and love to be totally immersed in the daily life of an era, this one may peak your interest, but in terms of really high drama it might fall a bit flat.",The Edge of Seventeen
26,eddie_baggins,An above average coming of age feature,7,20 August 2017,"Ah, if only you could be 17 again.The joys of not having to worry about much more than homework, hanging out with friends and genuinely having a good time, being 17 is a breeze right? We all know that's not exactly the case, sure many of us so called ""adults"" wouldn't back away from an opportunity to be relatively care free and 17 again, but entering into the often harsh world of adulthood, as the grown up world creeps up ever so surely on us isn't entirely the smooth sailing ride we all wish it was.Well documented in countless teen movies over the years, from full blown comedy too far more serious in tone events, covering that awkward age between teenage life and impending adulthood isn't a new thing to do in movies by any means but debut director Kelly Fremon Craig's likable and believable coming of age dramedy The Edge of Seventeen brings enough heart and soul to the table with sprinklings of nice originality, that this easy to digest event is easily one of the better pictures on the topic in recent times.Spearheaded by another impressive turn from Hailee Steinfeld (in arguably her best role since her breakout in the True Grit remake), Edge see's Steinfeld's complicated and in many ways hard done by Nadine try and keep her head above water as her best friend dates her brother and various other trials threaten to get the best of her and with clever writing from Craig and a feeling of genuine heart and some very observant wit, Edge is a step above others in its class.There are some heavy issues spoken about and dealt with within the film, enough that it may even make viewing uncomfortable for some but Craig should be commended for not shirking away from these hot topic issues like depression/technology and with Steinfeld on good form and the likes of Woody Harrelson (playing extremely tolerant teacher Mr. Bruner) and Kyra Sedgewick as Nadine's single mother Mona only help but bring the film's tough moments home.Where Edge falls down curiously is within Nadine the character.A tough one to get on board with, Nadine's needy and often irrational behaviour isn't always endearing (perhaps that's the point?) and had Nadine been a more consistently tolerable core to the film, its highly likely that this slice of teenage life could've easily entered into the classics of the genre and while not game breaking, Nadine's whining and bad manners don't come across as earnt most of the time.Final Say – The Edge of Seventeen is a film that all of us could relate to in some way or another and this darkly funny and occasionally touching film that includes some noteworthy performances and a winning script is worth seeking out, even if Nadine herself isn't exactly someone we'd want to spend too much more time with.This is a highly polished debut film from Kelly Fremon Craig that marks her down as a talent to keep a very close eye on.3 ½ cookies out of 5",The Edge of Seventeen

28,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Paints one of the most honest portraits of coming-of-age while honoring the tradition of such films,9,3 May 2017,"Coming-of-age indies are a dime a dozen, but something is different about Kelly Fremon Craig's ""The Edge of Seventeen."" It might even be so simple as her perspective as a woman. Honestly. There's not enough of that making it to the big screen. On a less binary note, however, there's also something profoundly more real about it too.""Seventeen"" stars Hailee Steinfeld as Nadine, your average privileged white high school student who feels the world doesn't understand her. Role your eyes at her if you will, but Nadine also lost her father when she was 13 and has never been able to connect with her mother (Kyra Sedgwick), or her brother, Darian (Blake Jenner). So when her best friend, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), the only other person she's close with, hooks up with Darian, she begins to feel her world is falling apart.The story is a roller-coaster/push-and-pull between empathizing with Nadine and her tough situation and having no pity for her whatsoever when she takes certain actions. No, on paper that doesn't sound like the most fun protagonist to watch, but it means that Craig has created a character that is unmistakably human. And Nadine isn't the only character who gets this balanced treatment in the script. All the main players are cast in both shadow and light, challenging our brains' desire to sort characters into good and bad boxes and project our own moral framework onto everything we see. That's just not the case with most movies about young people discovering who they are. We normally can sort the bad influences from the good. Life, however, is shades of gray, and rarely do we see that so clearly in a movie about rich or upper-middle class teens and their families.Part of this balance is epitomized in the relationship between Nadine and her teacher Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson at his comedic best). Nadine comes to Bruner when she's looking for pity, wisdom or a sounding board, and Bruner takes her the exact opposite of seriously. Somehow, they both know that someone telling her she's ridiculous is precisely what she needs, which is why she keeps turning to him. Their relationship is both the safest one in Nadine's life and the one that pushes her the most. As a perk for us, their repartee is on point.Steinfeld shows that earning an Oscar nod for her first ever big- screen role (The Coen Brothers' ""True Grit"") will not likely be a fluke with this performance that juggles comedy with deep, sincere emotion. She makes Nadine a classic teenager having classic teenager reactions; Nadine puts on a boisterous, humorous front, but almost as quickly as she can crack an insult, Steinfeld can reach down for raw moments of personal discovery. It's as easy to see yourself in Nadine as it is to be annoyed by her attitudes and behaviors.Truthfully, those of us who are no longer teenagers, or no longer the parents of teenagers, have the benefit of hindsight when watching this movie. Craig in ways forces us to relive these moments not with a nostalgic fondness, but with all-too-familiar pangs of reality.That's well and good if you have experienced those things, but it would be interesting to get the take of a current teenager on this movie. At one point, Nadine bemoans her generation's attachment to their phones and declares herself an ""old soul,"" but it's hard to say whether that's true or just the byproduct of Craig's own limitations telling the story of a young woman coming of age in a world that looks much different than the one she came of age in. All this to say, the film doesn't suffer for this, but it might not speak the truth of the young adults it depicts so much as the truth of audiences watching this film and recalling their long-passed youth. Named after a song like any film with an ""old soul"" that's aware of the homage it owes to John Hughes, ""The Edge of Seventeen"" both recognizes the mold that it's made from but challenges it in appropriate ways. Craig doesn't try to subvert the ""formula"" with an unhappy ending or something else unexpected, but she makes appropriate tweaks to these genre conventions. No grand romantic gestures, no emotion-filled moments of reconciliation – just characters having experiences and growing from them.~Steven CThanks for reading!

30,paul-allaer,Watch it for Hailee Steinfeld's performance,7,25 November 2016,"""The Edge of Seventeen"" (2016 release; 104 min.) brings the story of Nadine, a 17 yr. old junior at Lakewood HS. As the movie opens, Nadine is racing the school's hallways to meet with her favorite teacher and tell him ""I'm going to kill myself!"" The movie then goes back in time to see how we get to this point. After a short look at ""Nadine, Age 7"" and ""Nadine, age 13"", where we learn how socially awkward things are for Nadine, but for her strong friendship with her BFF Krista. That brings us to ""Nadine, 17"". At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the directing debut for writer Kelly Fremon Craig (who wrote 2009's ""Post Grad""). Here, Craig takes another shot at bringing the social awkwardness of being in high school and trying to survive all of the pressures that come with it. When was the last time that I've seen such an awkward teenager, who blurts out ""I'm seeing myself and I can't stand it. I gotta spend the rest of my life with myself!"". So nothing original here as such, except of course that Nadine is played by none other than Hailee Steinfeld, yes the little girl who was nominated of an Oscar in 2010 for ""True Grit"" is now grown up into a wonderful young lady which bunches of acting talent. Steinfeld basically carries the movie on her back, and is in virtually every single scene. There is some terrific support from Kyra Sedwick as Nadine's mom and Woody Harrelson as Nadine's teacher, but believe me when I say this is all about Hailee Steinfeld. Last but not least, the movie has a TON of great songs in it (check out the soundtrack).""The Edge of Seventeen"" opened nationally this past weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (about 10 people in the entire theater). This movie has not gotten a big marketing push, and it remains to be seen whether it will benefit from strong word-of-mouth. I quite enjoyed it for what it was, a strong vehicle for leading actress Hailee Steinfeld, even if the territory she explores here has been done before and doesn't offer all that much new. If you get a chance to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I'd suggest you do and draw your own conclusion.",The Edge of Seventeen

That's the case with The Edge of 17.Hailee Steinfeld plays a seventeen year old having a meltdown when her perfect twin brother starts to date the only friend she has in her life. She can't go to her mom who she thinks thinks her brother is just perfect. With her life being over, the only person in the world she can talk to is her Teacher, played by Woody Harrison.I loved Steinfeild in this movie. She was capable of fulling going annoying teenager without being a turn off to adults like myself watching. She was able to lore me into her life without sucking the life right out of me.Also digging Woody Harrison as her teacher, the type of man who has spent the last 30 or so years of his life dealing with seventeen year olds, so nothing that she's going through phases him, and he's able to keep the cool head needed to deal with her problems.All the characters in the movie were impressive. Somehow the archetype of the dumb jock that was done in this movie was not as much of a flat concept as it usually is, even from the very start before we get the characters overall picture.The Edge of seventeen was a movie made by the same people who make the Simpsons , and like the Simpsons, The Edge of 17 is all about an interesting ensemble of characters able to poke fun at all walks of life without insulting anyone.It most likely will be one of those films that goes down in history as one of the best Teen comedies ever.http://cinemagardens.com",The Edge of Seventeen
32,jtindahouse,A great debut effort,7,22 January 2017,"We all know teenage girls are an enigma, even to them self a lot of the time. Some of the things they say and do and get bothered by are utterly bizarre to the rest of us. 'The Edge of Seventeen' is a film that does a great job of exploring this bizarre phenomenon. It's a comedy with mostly surreal characters, that somehow manage to create an excellent level of reality. It never appears to want to take itself too seriously, yet at certain times it also demands to be.This is the debut film for writer/director Kelly Fremon Craig and I have to say I was thoroughly impressed. Large portions of the movie are absolutely masterful and the only thing holding it back from being truly great is some polishing here and there.I read a quote from someone saying if John Hughes was still alive this could easily be one of his movies. I questioned myself during the film about whether I agreed with that. I did in part, but also found that it was lacking the structuring he always managed to achieve in his films. The characters lived up to his fantastic ability, but the story couldn't quite match it. I feel he would have had another layer in there that drove things and kept everyone's motivations relatable.All said and done though this is a very good effort for a first timer. Being a film maker who can create great characters is a terrific skill to have, because it means there is zero limits to the type of films you can create. I look forward to seeing where Craig's career goes to from here.",The Edge of Seventeen
33,Turfseer,Run-of-the mill coming-of-age tale of teenage angst enhanced by strong lead and redemptive denouement,6,17 October 2017,"Films that feature depressed characters with virtually no ego usually don't work. If you come across some of my past reviews, you'll see that I refer to such characters as ""sad sacks."" The focus is usually on the character's internal arc—and usually it's either a lack of insight or tragic flaw that the character's creator holds out as some sort of a great revelation. The one-dimensional Norma Desmond from Sunset Boulevard is one such example—a film (i.e. the one starring Gloria Swanson) has great atmosphere but the downward spiral of the faded screen star is wholly predictable as it plods along.Fortunately Kelly Fremon Craig's coming-of-age dramedy, The Edge of Seventeen, features a protagonist, Nadine Franklin (played winningly by Hailee Steinfeld) who doesn't fall completely into the pit of blatant ""sad-sackism"" due to a plot that offers a small measure of redemption at film's end.The question is whether do you want to sit for about an hour and a half and watch Nadine decompensate to the point of suicide? As a matter of fact, the film's ""inciting incident"" occurs when Nadine approaches her high school teacher, Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson), right during the opening scene, and proclaims that she intends to do herself in.We're then presented with Nadine's backstory, which chronicles her road to extreme depression. There's the death of her kindly father when she was 11 who acted as a buffer between her and her neurotic mother, Mona (overplayed a bit by Kyra Sedgwick). The loss of the father figure is obviously the underlying reason for her problems but the burgeoning romantic relationship between her best friend Krista and handsome, socially adept older brother, Darian, is what sends her into a tizzy in the present.Krista and Darian prove to be throwaway characters as they're simply designed to be Nadine's glorified support system. More interesting is Nadine's interactions with potential flames— the ""bad boy"" Nick and nerdy film student, Erwin Kim.Nadine impulsively sends a sexually explicit text to Nick and after going for a midnight drive and parking at a lover's lane, she realizes that she is not cut out for a one night stand. Erwin also puts the moves on Nadine in his family swimming pool, but unlike Nick (who could be potentially dangerous), Erwin proves to be a clumsy ""nice guy,"" easily dismissed by the confused Nadine.Only later, when Nadine attends the school film festival and sees how talented Erwin really is, she begins to re- examine her feelings toward a guy who she dismissed earlier as basically a goofball. It's really Nadine's turn-around, where she starts accepting herself and overcomes her crushing depression, that allows the film to be not so completely one-note.As for Mr. Bruner as Nadine's sarcastic teacher, the sarcasm is a bit of a twist but ultimately he's nothing more than another supportive adult who ends up giving Nadine a ride home and a few choice words of encouragement.Ultimately, the supporting players here don't have a lot to do, but Steinfeld (who impressed in her auspicious debut in True Grit) proves to be a real star in the making (she not only can act but sings as well, as evidenced by her performance in Pitch Perfect).There is nothing extraordinary about Edge of Seventeen but given the solid lead performance and the aforementioned ""redemptive"" climax, this is a film that probably rates a decent 6 out of 10.",The Edge of Seventeen
34,jadavix,A silly teen flick with the odd dirty line,6,4 February 2017,"""The Edge of Seventeen"" is a typical PG-13 teen girl flick which just happens to have its mind in the gutter. With the potty mouthed characters, underage drinking, and implied sexual acts, it feels like this is a movie reaching for greater realism, but never grasping it.The main character is the typical adult-in-a-child's-body that anyone who has seen any other teen flicks will recognize. Sure, she's not perfect, but adults aren't perfect either. The thing is she is always so self-aware and reflective that it is hard to believe she has actual faults. These characters are so separate, not only from real teenagers, but real people in general, that to encounter one would be like meeting an alien trialing human emotions in a public sphere. Or, you know, an actor, acting.The problems the character has are of the soap opera, luxury variety: her best friend is dating her hated, over-achieving brother. This would be more of an issue if she really had any reason for hating him. Someone who is capable of constantly witty, reflective dialogue, parodying herself and pointing out the ridiculousness of her hopes and fears, should not have such a massive problem with this.""The Edge of Seventeen"" is reluctant to commit to having a believably flawed protagonist, and it's similarly craven in regards to whether it wants to be an edgy, realistic look at teen life or just another ""Mean Girls"".",The Edge of Seventeen

This is a coming of age teen comedy. Hailee is on the verge of 17-hence the title-and has lots of the usual teen problems. First of all, she has insecurities, self-loathing and is jealous of anyone's good luck. Her brother, Blake, is the opposite of her, being quite popular, so of course, she hates him. She doesn't have any friends except Haley, and things change when Haley starts dating Blake. Hailee is overly dramatic- and when you are a teen, that is just a normal way of thinking, that everything is centered around them and even the little things might mean the end of the world. Of course, a lot of Hailee's selfishness and self- destructive behavior stems from her father dying when she was 13-a big devastating blow for anyone, especially for a teenager. Kyra plays her mother who can not handle Hailee on her own and Woody is a teacher that takes an interest in Hailee and tries to help her. If you are interested in the life and problems of a teenaged girl then this is a good manual because the acting by all participants is great.

It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be a good rental.",The Edge of Seventeen

The man absolutely steals this one, delivering a wonderfully glib performance that also manages to have a lot of heart.But for as many good things that this movie has, the overall experience is just kinda meh. There were too many moments where I couldn't suspend disbelief. Too many times where what I'm seeing on screen just doesn't feel like reality to me. Too many moments where a character will dramatically lurch forward and leave me thinking, ""Wait, what?!""

41,truemythmedia,Wonderfully Honest,8,11 September 2019,"Coming of age stories are a dime a dozen. It can be tough to make one film stand out from the hundreds of similar others out there, but ""The Edge of Seventeen"" does just that. ""Seventeen"" feels like a John Hughes film for the 2010s; the situations are realistic and relatable, the humor feels fresh and fun, the characters are delightfully likeable, and the way the characters change throughout the film feels natural. This is, in my opinion, the very best kind of coming of age film because it feels so very balanced: the drama doesn't set the stakes super high, but the events are life changing for our protagonist; the humor is situational and character-based, making that humor feel more natural; the characters are flawed but they still have characteristics that make them sympathetic. Movies like this- that show the real, honest pain of growing up as well as the giddy fun parts- are rare enough to be called phenomenon.",The Edge of Seventeen
42,Amari-Sali,"Depending on how you look at it, a selfish girl gets a reality check or a girl who has long been just holding on is reminded that she isn't the only person struggling.",7,17 November 2016,"Characters & StoryNadine (Hailee Steinfeld)You can look at Nadine in one of two ways: you can feel bad for her since her father died and he was the only one who really got her or else you can see her as someone who is kind of insufferable, selfish, and needs to get over herself. It really is all a matter of perspective.What is indisputable though is her sole friend is Krista (Haley Lu Richardson). She, since around 2nd grade, has been a pseudo- replacement for Nadine's dad. Someone who usually stuck up for her and favored her like her mom favored her brother Darian. So when Krista and Darian become a thing, it feels like Darian has everything and she is once again left with the same feeling she had when her dad died. This feeling that she has no one in her corner.Darian (Blake Jenner)An extrovert, a jock, someone who has the world on his shoulders. Yeah, the world isn't his oyster but instead, he has the world on his shoulders. Not because he is a star athlete or anything like that, but due to being the man of the house. A title which isn't just honorific but has real responsibilities attached. The kind which weighs down on him and rather than verbalize his displeasure like Nadine, he holds it inside. So when Krista goes from his sister's best friend to his girlfriend, while it causes strife for him and Krista, it is hard to not do as Nadine and be a little selfish as he finally gets someone who lets him breathe.Mona (Kyra Sedgwick)Being a single parent is hard. It is even harder when you have one child who is pretty much self-sufficient and then the other needs almost all the time and energy you can give her. Meanwhile, you are getting up in age, miss the idea and access to having a partner, husband, and best friend, and sometimes the world just seems against you. Yet, you don't have time to cry, you don't have time to wallow in your own pain. You have to ask for help, sometimes even from your son, because bills need to be paid and kids need financial support. Thus keeping you on this treadmill in which you have to constantly pretend you don't sweat.HighlightsAn Asian Love InterestThough not mentioned in her character summary, Nadine has an admirer named Erwin (Hayden Szeto) and he is one of the rare Asian love interest you may ever see. He is cute, as awkward as Nadine is around people she likes, and while borderline perfect, his awkwardness helps to keep him from being a straight up trope.A Protagonist Who Wasn't Always or Often LikableI'm trying to grow as a viewer/ audience and take what Viola Davis said about her role on How To Get Away With Murder to heart. She, in this case, Steinfeld is embodying a person, not a character. Someone who in one scene you may root for and the next you may find irredeemable. To me, that is what Nadine is, on a narcissistic teenager scale. You understand her due to the fact she felt the balance of her dad choosing her and her mom choosing Darian was broken by his death and Krista sort of made up for that. Making it where when she, Nadine, becomes the 3rd wheel, you can slightly understand her asking to be chosen for she feels like she is losing the person who chose her when no one else would.Yet, she is kind of an ass for asking her best friend to do that. The best friend who has put up with her, seemingly without much complaints, for years. On top of that, the amount of apologies Krista gave and then Nadine says something really nasty to her. It is like, they send you on this roller coaster of feelings, in terms of relating to Nadine's awkwardness and then thinking you are nothing like her because she can be such a moose.Overall: Mixed (Home Viewing)To my knowledge, there weren't a lot of coming of age films this summer. Which seems kind of strange since that is usually the season when the best ones come out. So, while The Edge of Seventeen fills a void, it, unfortunately, does so solely out of existing. For while it is easy to relate to her feeling like the world is against her, she never gets what she wants or needs, and everything that brought her some sense of peace is being taken away, as you look at her home, as you see her school, as you realize the opportunities she has, it becomes hard to feel for her. Especially as she cuts off her only friend to spite solely herself.Yet, as Darian reveals his own issues and Nadine learns to appreciate Erwin for trying and working with her even at her worse, there is a silver lining. That is what kind of brought the film back from the rocky road it was on. For when Nadine is allowed to set aside this desire to be seen as some special snowflake of her generation, that is when we see this awkward girl trying to find someone who could love her and try to understand her like her dad did. Thus giving the film heart.",The Edge of Seventeen

44,davidmvining,A well told story,8,22 November 2019,"What an unexpected little surprise of a movie. What feels like it should have been merely a sarcastic but amusing teen comedy by its trailers ends up being a surprisingly affecting exploration of loss, friendship, and family.Nadine is an awkward girl with a single friend, Krista. They're alone against the world, scoffing at everyone else's phoniness, especially Nadine's older brother who bears every outward sign of a jock save a letter jacket. The friend and the brother hook up one night, throwing Nadine's entire sense of meaning out the window as her authentic friend begins to really like the inauthentic Darian. Now, Nadine, who's been alone against the world with her best friend, is simply alone against the world.There's a running gag through the film that really highlights Nadine's situation really well. She can't drive. She failed her driving test and she's completely reliant on other people to get her from one place to another. When she was best friends with Krista, that was no problem. She always had a ride. When Nadine ends that relationship, she has to rely on her mother, who has her own stresses stemming from Nadine's father's death a few years prior. Nadine considers herself independent, but she's always relying on other people to simply get to school.There's one teacher that comes to the fore in this tale of high school, Mr. Bruner, played by Woody Harrelson. He gives equally sarcastic responses to Nadine, seemingly unconcerned with her plight which he views with disdain. It's only when she ends up making some really bad decision at the nadir of her situation and she reaches out for help outside of school that we see Mr. Bruner open up to her. His sarcastic exterior seemed to be hiding a similarly empty existence as Nadine, but he's actually quite the happy guy at home. Nadine sees that she can keep who she is but live a happy life away from her best friend at the same time.It's not a complicated movie. It's simply a well told story, and it works really well.",The Edge of Seventeen
45,rgkarim,Edge of Seventeen will not keep you on the edge of your seat. But Represents the Culture Well,8,19 November 2016,"Teenage years can be tough, but with generation gaps one may not understand the new morals and traditions the modern era establishes. Enter Hollywood, who may help bridge the gap by making a movie to hopefully shed some accurate light on the subject. This brings me to my review this morning, Edge of Seventeen, a coming of age film starring Hailee Steinfield, Woody Harrelson, and a slew of other actors. Robbie K here, bringing you another movie review, so let's get started. LIKES:  Realistic portrayal of teens  Witty comical writing  Good moral lessonIf you want a realistic movie, then Edge of Seventeen is for you. It dumps special effects and original tales for a better portrayal of the culture around you. This film drops you into the life of a ""typical"" teenager and all the drama that comes with the hormonal changes of those trying years. One will get to see the concepts of sex, relationships, family, and self-worth as you follow Nadine's journey into growing up. Those who are ticked off by today's morals need to skip this film, but those with an open mind may enjoy the psychology involved with the decisions made by youths. While I'm certainly no teenager, I felt this movie did a nice job representing the turmoil some youths feel, primarily in the social pressures established from trying to grow up too quickly. Fortunately, the movie isn't just about portraying the different morals of teenagers, but instead tries to teach lessons about life. While preachy at points, the movie does a nice job illustrating that the everyone has troubles we all must deal with. Nadine brings a lot of teenage angst and rebellion under the guise of life sucks, without realizing others may be suffering just as much. And the screenplay writers do a bang up job teaching her, and hopefully the audience, important lessons about empathy, open minded thinking, and not relying on social media to rule your life. Two thumbs up in my book. While the realism brings about a lot of drama, cause let's face it the modern world is a bunch of drama, it also brings about very intelligent writing. Edge of Seventeen has plenty of meme worthy faces and one-liners, the comedy as a whole is quite witty. Steinfield's lines, while simplistic, are timed well as she delivers them with emotional affect needed. Hayden Setzo as the geeky Erwin, brings the awkward teenager character to life, equipped with nervous stuttering and awkward moments that are truly entertaining. The biggest source of laughs come in the form of Woody Harrelson as the mentor/uninterested teacher whose sarcasm and insults are the definition of intelligent writing. All of this provides a bunch of laughs, or at least chuckles. DISLIKES:  Slow at times  Nadine is quite annoyingYes, this is a common complaint of mine in films like this, but hear me out. I and some of the other audience members, found the Edge of Seventeen a tad slow at parts of this movie. Nadine's journey to growing up gets a tad repetitive at times, adding some unnecessary moments that could have been left for the director's cut. Some of the repetitive drama points or seeing her crying on screen were emotional yes, but sometime unnecessary and helped trim some time off the film. And because of the sad, somewhat depressing tone of the movie the film dragged at a bit at times as well, especially when there were few positive moments to relieve the negativity. Yes, I get this is the point and the perspective most teenagers take, but Hollywood magic would have been welcome here. And as for Nadine, never have I both enjoyed and loathed a character on screen at once. Being a teenager can be rough, but this character crossed the border to annoyingly crazy a fair number of times in the movie. Whether it was the whiny element to her voice, the whimsical use of the F bomb, or perhaps the repetitive complaints of the problem, there was always something irritating about this character. Eventually other characters were introduced to help temper these moments, but some of the extreme brat like behavior, and how blind she was to it, was a little over the top at times. Maybe this is how teenagers act and maybe it isn't, but the team could have designed a little more balance to Nadine in my honest opinion. The VEREDICT:The Edge of Seventeen is certainly an artistic movie worthy of some attention for realistic portrayals of a culture and some grade A acting chemistry. Witty writing and relevant references make this film an enjoyable piece of work for many and the morals add a teaching element for future classroom movie days. Yet the pace could have used some picking up and the annoying primary character need some fine tuning to help smooth out the rough edges of the movie of this otherwise predictable tale. Nevertheless, this movie has the potential for nominations, and could be good for some to visit the theaters. Yet I suggest skipping this film for the theaters and holding out for Netflix/Redbox for viewing pleasures. My scores: Comedy/Drama: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",The Edge of Seventeen
46,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Edge of Seventeen,8,26 November 2016,"The Edge of Seventeen is my latest review. And no, I'm not talking about the Stevie Nicks pop hit from the early 80's. ""Seventeen"" is an insightful film that's raw, real, and one of 2016's best. Mean Girls becomes ""keen"" girls. Heck, She's All That becomes ""she's"" a doormat. Anyway, towards the middle part of this vehicle, a main player quips, ""rise above yourself Nadine"". Well ""Seventeen"" ""rises"" above almost every teen farce and/or drama that's come out in the past fifteen years. Filmed in British Columbia and featuring an intelligent, often complex screenplay, The Edge of Seventeen gives lead Hailee Steinfeld the chance to equal her brilliant turn from 2010's True Grit. She succeeds. Steinfeld plays unflinchingly, a coming-of-age, 17-year-old girl named Nadine Franklin. Nadine is a spunky 11th grader who can't seem to connect with people her own age. To add insult to injury, her father died unexpectedly four years ago. She has one best friend named Krista (played by Haley Lu Richardson), a dopey mom who she barely interacts with (Mona Franklin played by Kyra Sedwick), and a popular brother she can't stand (Blake Jenner as Darian Franklin). When she confides in someone with various problems, she ends up going to one of her teachers named Mr. Bruner (played by Woody Harrelson).As ""Seventeen"" shifts out of its 10 Things I Hate About You/Clueless- like territory (in the first half hour or so), Nadine finds out that said best friend is actually dating her perfect brother. This throws Nadine into a tailspin. She contemplates suicide, tries to form relationships with two guys, and all the while sort of finds her battered self along the way.Now make no mistake about it, The Edge of Seventeen is not some cutesy high school flick that is deemed appropriate for young teenagers. No this is a darker affair with various sweet moments kind of buried beneath the R-rated raunch and the R-rated angst. The writing is nevertheless crisp, the casting is almost spot-on, and there are some adequate character revelations.The director of ""Seventeen"" is Kelly Fremon Craig. With the exception of just three writing credits to her dossier, this is the first thing she has ever helmed. Watching The Edge of Seventeen, you realize that the happenings pertaining to her Nadine, might have been from her own personal experience as a confused Generation Z (with a smidgen of social anxiety disorder). I might be speculating but everything Steinfeld's trouper goes through comes off as detailed, bona fide, and authentic. In jest, Craig might have wanted to translate her brooding nature through her muse's seasoned acting ability. What can I say, it just works.In conclusion, I asked myself two questions after last night's screening of ""Seventeen"": Would this film garner some Academy Award nominations? Maybe. Would this film give Miss Steinfeld a well deserved nomination for best actress? I sure darn hope so. Playing Nadine, you can tell she's digging deep. Her mannerisms, her body language, her feeling of malaise, it's just so darn genuine. Rating: 3 and a half stars.",The Edge of Seventeen
47,pc95,"Good Writing, Directing, and Acting",8,5 May 2017,"Reminiscent of John Hughes movies, but with its own new angles, character, and wit, director and writer Kelly Fremon Craig's ""Edge of Seventeen"" ought to be called one of the better teenage drama and comedies in several years. I thoroughly enjoyed the cast and lead Steinfeld in this bittersweet ""dramedy"" of a woman coming of age enduring odds of sibling rivalry and parental controls, things that most if not many can identify with. The movie pays a short homage to ""Napolean Dynamite"", a little less serious but equally good movie that predates it by over 10 years. Craig digs deeply into female angles on friendship, sex, and belonging while Hailee Steinfeld gives an equally good mix of emotion and sarcasm thanks in no small part to Craig's material. Woody Harrelson has a smaller but fun grounding-rod part that he looks to be enjoying. Very Good and Recommended 8/10",The Edge of Seventeen
48,bkrauser-81-311064,Not Your Typical Teen Movie,8,19 November 2016,"For those who enjoyed the brittle humor of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl (2015), swooned over the youthful spirit of Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) and thought to themselves; ""can we get shades of John Hughes up in here?"" Boy is there a movie out there for you. Written and directed by first timer Kelly Fremon Craig, The Edge of Seventeen is one of those rare movies that works as a gentle, general audience-pleaser and a laser focused dialogue, calling out the gawky, shoe-gazing teenager in all of us. There are typical teenage movies, then there are movies like The Edge of Seventeen.""There are two types of people in this world..."" remarks Hailee Steinfeld's rancorous beginning narration. ""Those who seem to have it easy, and those who hope those people die in a fire."" The assumed ""other"" person in her discourse is her brother Darian (Jenner), who is first introduced a young boy, running out of the family car to glob onto his group of popular friend. By the time Darian is in high school, he looks like he should be on the cover of an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog. Nadine (Steinfeld) on the other hand is terrifyingly hyper-aware of herself - immured by her various faults to the point of drowning. Yet since early childhood Nadine has had one faithful ally: her best friend Krista (Richardson). ""She appeared like an angel,"" continues Nadine in voice over - seemingly unaware that Krista and Darian are doomed to start a perky high school romance that sends Nadine's world crashing downward.While one could talk for ages about Fremon Craig's uncannily confident direction, and the wistful autumn time cinematography of DP Doug Emmett, the success of The Edge of Seventeen rests almost entirely on the shoulders of Hailee Steinfeld. To that end Steinfeld proves not just stellar but invaluable. Her role requires a lot out of her. As a solipsistic and morose teenager she has to be a bully, a misanthrope and an impatient, neurotic browbeater convincingly seeing the apocalyptic in the trivial. All that and she has to be likable too! Thankfully Steinfeld doesn't merely rely on clever dialogue and the audience's shared feeling of embarrassment to carry her through. Her expressive body language, flawless delivery and disarming lack of pretense keeps you invested and rooting for her all the way through.To my recollection only Alicia Silverstone's performance in Clueless (1995) can really compare. As Nadine, Steinfeld colors and shapes the entire movie, bridging clichés and obligatory story elements with pure, unadulterated, sometimes painful truths. And yes there are a lot of obligatory story elements which thankfully aren't inserted ironically in a post-modern ploy to appeal to the masses. The laughs here are actually earned and because the quiet, bittersweet moments are actually given room to breathe, the rollicking, hilarious moments are good enough to be remembered for decades.Sharp, witty and respectfully grounded in the emotional epicenter of teenage life, The Edge of Seventeen is simultaneously one of the funniest movies this year and one of the most honest. The script, despite treading on familiar paths, has a lot to offer as far as hilarious quotes and painfully awkward situations. Yet thanks to the brilliant work of Hailee Steinfeld and the deft support by veteran actors Kyra Sedgwick and Woody Harrelson, the film gracefully crystallizes into something a little bolder, truer and more authentic.",The Edge of Seventeen
49,michaeltrivedi,Another Stupid High School Movie,3,30 November 2019,"Yes, I watched it all the way through so it had something there. But looking back, it was a bit of a bore. The main actress is kinda funny. She seems to drift through life invisible. But she had the right friends and is still doing cool.The movie is ordinary high school drama stuff. Nothing too great here.Skip or watch. Whatever.3 stars",The Edge of Seventeen
50,Screen_Blitz,"Hailee Steinfeld is charming and funny in this appealing, if ordinary coming-of-age comedy",7,6 March 2017,"The Edge of Seventeen often feels like a late refurbishment of the John Hughes teen flicks from the 80s. Hughes who directed classics such as 'The Breakfast Club', 'Sixteen Candles', and 'Pretty in Pink' became a staple of coming-of-age movies during the decade, and his works inspired many comedic tropes that still lie on many teen films today. This film directed by Kelly Fremon Craig in her directorial debut carries a few of those tropes, but rarely brings anything new to the table when portraying the anxiety and social pressure of high school teens. Nonetheless, the film delivers roughly an accurate depiction of how high school can some of the most awkward and embarrassing four years of your life regardless of if you were in the popular crowd or not. Did you ever feel like an outsider? Did you ever face unspeakable embarrassment when trying to get around the social pressures that littered your proposed high school experience? This movie greatly capitalizes on these concepts. This film follows 17-year old Nadine (played by Hailee Steinfeld), an irritable highschooler who's life is falling apart beginning with her best friend Krista (played by Haley Ru Richardson) sleeping with her older brother Darian (played by Blake Jenner). With no one to talk to but her eccentric teacher Mr. Bruner (played by Woody Harrelson), she eventually forms a friendship with her Asian classmate Erwin (played by Hayden Szeto) who becomes her sign of hope.If you are looking for a teen comedy that greatly benefits from laughs and charm, this one hits the mark. But if you are looking for one that blossoms inspiration beyond the typical teen fare, that is another story. This film never quite strolls out of the ordinary of coming-of-age formula, and at times gets a little predictable in a few of its proceedings. But Hailee Steinfeld steps foot in the lead role luckily saves the day. The young actress does a solid piece of work at delivering laughs for a fair amount of time she's on screen. From the clever badinage between her and Woody Harrelson, to her chemistry with Hayden Szeto; Steinfeld puts her role as an average angst teenager trapped in a social blackhole to great use. Although the humor occasionally stumbles or falls flat upon arrival, Steinfeld along with most her supporting cast make a redeeming points. The story is nicely paced and remains mostly grounded to reality of what is high school feels like, and the characters themselves (particularly the main character) serve as figures many teens and adults can relate to rather than run-of-the-mill stereotypes.The Edge of Seventeen is a charming, funny coming-of-age comedy destined to appeal to the teen crowd, and certainly a good portion of the adult demographic. It marks a fun, if not groundbreaking comedic role for Hailee Steinfeld. There is anything that halts this film from being a standout in its genre, it may the lack of coming-of-age innovation. Beyond that, it can make a good recommendation.",The Edge of Seventeen
51,leftbanker-1,Teens with Swimming Pools with Problems,6,29 January 2017,"If only the whole movie were just scenes with Woody Harrelson cracking jokes with the girl. These were the only moments that I really enjoyed and thankfully there were a few of them. Most of the rest of the film was entirely forgettable.The revenge of Long Duck Dong as Asian Americans get a representative who is a little cooler than the John Hughes slur from 16 Candles. In this version he is stinking rich so that we can accept him a little more because a middle class or, god forbid, a lower middle class Asian boy would just be unacceptable.The less ""acting"" we see from teenagers in a movie the better. This means no crying scenes and really not much in the way of what you might call real emotion because it's just tedious to watch and completely unconvincing so please, please stop! If you want to make a teen comedy then make a damn comedy and try to limit the DRAMA (James Earl Jones voice over for that last word).Way too much drama from this over-privileged little spoiled brat. Screw her and all of her teen problems none of which approaches anything even remotely essential to what anyone would consider a decent life. Does she think that everyone is guaranteed a boyfriend and love while in high school? Jesus, grow the F up already. Few kids this age can handle relationships involving sex and everything that goes along with that. I don't think that many university students are ready for that kind of commitment which usually drains the individuality right out of them.High school is something that almost everyone simply survives so that hopefully you can go on to have something approaching a satisfying life. Most of the people who had these supposedly satisfying relationships at that age went on to marry the slobs they were with or someone exactly like them a few years later. News flash: most of them went on to be the butt of jokes for all of the kids who were dorks in school.But for any problems I had with rich kids with problems the end was sweet, so there's that.",The Edge of Seventeen
52,areatw,Accurate and funny representation of life as a teen,7,7 September 2017,"'The Edge of Seventeen' is a realistic and highly enjoyable comedy/drama about a girl and her struggles growing up. Unlike the conventional comedy film, it seeks to do more than simply make you laugh. The drama is very much at the forefront of the film, with main character Nadine attracting a lot more than just laughs from the viewer.This is very much Hailee Steinfeld's film, she carries the whole thing from start to finish with another exceptional performance as Nadine. Even small details such as her mannerisms were so accurate and true of a typical teenager. The rest of the characters are also relatable, even for older viewers. 'The Edge of Seventeen' is more than just a teen comedy, it's also a very accurate portrayal of teenage life.",The Edge of Seventeen
53,sharky_55,Do you even realize how sick in the head you are for bringing that up?,8,27 February 2017,"When you watch a teen movie like The Edge of Seventeen you'll usually find yourself siding with either parent in the family like Nadine and her brother do. This time it's the mum who she's constantly at odds with, and the dad who steps in and saves the day. He's the cool one, the one who understands her the most, and when her voice-over warns that ""tragedy soon struck"", we're pretty sure that the movie is gearing up to kill him off. But for a teenager like Nadine that tragedy just might be her insane, out-of-control hairdo and a sprouting monobrow. The resulting punishment of such a fashion faux pas is of course social exclusion, and for a high-schooler those are live-or-die stakes. And then for good measure, her dad dies anyway, and sends her life into a miserable spiral. In most of these young adult stories that alone would be a good enough reason for Nadine to retreat into her shell and start to hate the whole world, and therefore legitimatise all the jaded cynicism and self- pity she radiates with every furious move. But Kelly Fremon Craig doesn't orient us with a timeline, and that provides the opportunity for a wicked takedown of her pity party; Nadine springs the 'my dad just died' to avoid handing in homework, only for Mr Bruner to reveal it is now five years after the fact. The joke effectively pulls the rug from under our feet, and suddenly we're all recalculating, and shifting all those expectations that the genre has instilled into us year after year. The seemingly plucky Nadine is played by Hailee Steinfeld, who broke out with True Grit, a role where she was required to babysit Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon. If you've watched that you'll recognise traces of her ability to scold and talk to down to anyone in her radius, and here it is laced with teenager bitterness and envy - Nadine has single-handedly claimed misanthropy for herself, and anyone who tries to help or improve her (namely her brother and mother) is sent packing. Steinfeld does well with the overlapping, self-important dialogue, but praise must also go to the wardrobe departments, who dress her in puffy retro striped jackets and velcro-laced sneakers, so she's a hipsterish standout amongst the ""mouth-breathing"" crowd. The bright blues and reds make her pop against the dull grey photography; she's an old soul, and dresses not merely as a facet of self-expression, but as rebellion. The movie takes everything we know about cinematic teenagers and flips them around. We're still learning. For so long the status quo was that you were a child, and then an adult, the hard times meaning that no one had any time to grow and develop and mope about growing and developing. Then James Dean opened up his heart and soul, and John Hughes and The Breakfast Club introduced us to the rest of the gang and their own worries and ambitions. The teen movie has almost always been rigidly fixated on the plucky protagonist's point-of-view, celebrating their coming-of-age and phoenix rebirth from loserville. They can do no wrong, and everyone else is there to pat them on the back and boost them up. The Edge of Seventeen isn't just afraid to call Nadine out on her behaviour, it's also mature enough to show her the people who are hurt from these actions. When she taunts her best friend and predicts that she'll eventually be dumped by the hot jock (her brother, no less) for ""someone hotter"", that's years and years of conventional genre experience talking, then the movie reaching up and slapping her in the face for making wild assumptions. Why should Krista be blasted for trying to make friends with someone who isn't the main character? The movie also slyly plays the apparent blandness of Nadine's designate love interest against her; the more she and Erwin hang out, the more crazy discoveries she is making about him, and that only further drives home the point about how self-centred she is and how little listening she actually does. What we need to realise is that there is an entire cluster of kids that aren't wildly partying, downing shots and flaunting their promiscuity (and even if they are, it doesn't make them the bad guys). Instead they're wrapped up in their own bubbles, watching Futurama on the couch and aiming death stares at those who dare tread past their domain. They internalise misery and contempt but are blind to their own faults and ignorance - Blake Jenner's climatic confession is a big whack to the head of the audience and Nadine, who have both built him up the perfect older brother, chiselled and handsome, competent and mature. Nadine isn't the perfect little snowflake that makes the whole school stop still for her, and when she eventually realises this she learns two things. One, she's actually the bad guy of the story. Two, she's not nearly as bad as she might have believed, and with a little help that can be fixed.",The Edge of Seventeen

55,rockman182,The Edge of Seventeen (2016),8,8 December 2016,"Honestly, I'm not the biggest fan of coming of age films. Some work really well and others do not portray a realistic experience of an experience of growing up. This just about met my expectations and was enjoyable. Hailee Steinfeld is great in it, perfectly plays the awkward and angsty teen. Its a female's perspective of the dramas of a teenage high school life but god its relatable. I think most people will relate to it somehow. Whether its the strained relationship with a parent, the best friend who becomes the backstabber, the perfect older sibling, or the awkwardness of romance and trying to fit in in high school; there's something there for everybody. Laughed a lot more in this film than I thought I would. The dramatic moments don't always mesh well with the comedy but its forgivable. The best parts of the film is the interactions between Steinfeld and Harrelson. I wish there was more of it in the film. The one notable omission was not putting Stevie Nicks' ""Edge of Seventeen"" in the film. Was very much expecting it.8/10",The Edge of Seventeen
56,jon.h.ochiai,Love Thine Own Self,10,20 November 2016,"Some of the best comedies distinguish the touching hysterical irony of life's joy and tragedy, and celebrate the very best in people in life's paradox. ""The Edge of Seventeen"" is that and much more. First time Director and Writer Kelly Fremon Craig masterfully navigates that fine line between cleverer than thou, and the reckoning of one's self. Craig captures the natural speak of high school kids without some of the pretense of ""Juno"". ""The Edge of Seventeen"" makes you burst out loud with laughter, and touches your heart. Hailee Steinfeld makes this all possible. What a revelation. I remember Hailee from the Coen Brothers' ""True Grit""— phenomenal. Here she is a star. Steinfeld's performance is funny, vulnerable, and fearless. Hers is one the year's best as well. ""The Edge of Seventeen"" begins somewhere in the middle of the story. Steinfeld's teen drama queen supreme Nadine interrupts her favorite teacher Mr. Brunner played by Woody Harrelson, ""I'm gonna kill myself"" After a deadpan stare, Mr. Brunner reads Nadine his own drafted suicide note. Too funny. Steinfeld artfully invents Nadine as worthy of love, even when she says the vilest things. She tells literally her only friend in the world Krista (big hearted Hailey Lu Richardson) to choose between her and Nadine's brother Darian (dashing and surprising Blake Jenner). On the ferris wheel ride with Korean American Erwin (good-looking and whimsical Hayden Szeto), the charming animation nerd who is so in love with Nadine, she spews out a comical stereotype rift about of his parents. Then she admits, ""All of it was racist."" Craig and Steinfeld compassionately walk that fine line with inspired humor. At a defining story arc, following a drunken indulgence Nadine weeps to Krista, ""I've got to spent the rest of my life...with myself."" This is heartbreaking. Her self-loathing is visceral and sad. Growing up in her eyes, older brother Darian was her parents' favorite. Not at all his fault. She constantly clashed with her Mom Mona (Kyra Sedgwick), who just did not 'get her'. Fortunately, her Dad Tom (patient and kind Eric Cooper) was not so much the buffer between Nadine and her Mom, rather the only one who could calm the fear deep in Nadine. As Nadine narrates everything tragically altered when she was 13 years old. She was with her Dad when he unexpectedly passed way. Now 17 years old Nadine is a junior in high school and in seemingly self imposed exile with her only friend Krista (Richardson). Darian (Jenner) is the high school teenage god—handsome, smart, popular, and captain of the football team. Mona (Sedgwick) is the overwhelmed single Mom, venturing in the perils of on-line dating, and grateful for raising her perfect son. Nadine yearns for ""hot"" mysterious loner Nick (Alexander Calvert), who works at the local Pet Land. She indifferently dismisses Erwin (Szeto), who wears the crush for her on his sleeve. History teacher Mr. Brunner (Harrelson) is Nadine's only adult confidant and caustic reality check. Hailee Steinfeld is radiant, pretty, and killer smart as Nadine. She wears the uniform skirt and cool shoes as eclectic couture. Outwardly, she would not occur as social pariah. Steinfeld naturally realizes her social outcast with Nadine's merciless words and her tragic refusal to love herself. All are armor to cover the hurt buried within her. Waking up from a hangover, Nadine catches Krista 'handling' Darian in a bedroom tryst. Nadine reacts like Nadine, and life spirals out of control. She loses her only friend. Her desired rendezvous materializes and is nearly costly—strikingly and gently envisioned by Craig and Steinfeld. On the bright side she begins to see the wonderful guy in Erwin. Now if she could only just 'shut up' long enough. Nadine's words have a mind of their own: both a curse and an expression of her miraculous being. Director and Writer Craig eloquently has Nadine's back. Darian and Krista might have been revealed as selfish jerks. Instead Jenner and Richardson only have unconditional love for Nadine. Jenner is impressively strong in the scene with his Mom. He reminds that though she is the only adult in the house, she calls him when there is trouble. The theater was silent as he and Nadine say, ""Good night."" Sedgwick's vulnerability strengthens the desperation and spirit of their Mom. Szeto is disarmingly brave and humorously clumsy as Erwin, who really sees Nadine's beautiful soul. Harrelson is subtle comic genius, and anchors ""The Edge of Seventeen"". As Mr. Brunner, we like Nadine underestimate him. Harrelson's hysterical cynicism masks the most generous soul. He sees the possibility of greatness in Nadine, even though she can't, yet. ""The Edge of Seventeen"" is a wonderful surprise. Hailee Steinfeld is witty and boldly human as Nadine reluctantly emerges as the hero in her own story. Her performance is raw— we feel her agony, fear, and joy. We pull for her Nadine to love thine own self. Above all Nadine deserves to love and be loved. We can all see the possibility of this for ourselves as well. ""The Edge of Seventeen"" is one of the best movies of the year. Thank you, Hailee and Kelly. You've done great.",The Edge of Seventeen
57,Holt344,Great drama with strong acting with an important message,9,24 February 2019,"I walked in for Woody Harrelson and Hailee Seinfeld who starred in True Grit and after I watched that movie I saw the potential of greatness towards her as an actress as she did an amazing job and does an even excellent job in this movie. With seeing some great performances I also witnessed a movie that is written and directed in such a perfect way for the genre, making something special and real. It's not a movie for everyone but I found it great, I didn't feel happiness until the very end but I believe that was the right thing to do with the story of the coming of age story, showing the life of Nadine through personal loss and depression, it was written with an realistic mind set, making us see in detail of what kind of unlikeable person she sadly is but ultimately realizes and improves in every way to become likeable to friends and family. Excellent writing from Kelly Fremon Craig.The ensemble cast is well put together, no one delivers a bad performances, there were only believable ones. Hailee Seinfeld stands out the most as I wrote before, she's the heart of the movie and does an incredible job as the lead. Everything is perfect, couldn't be better. I recommend it for people they like strong acting and a movie with a good message, showing how hard people can have it in their homes. It's really for all ages but mainly under mid twenties to teenagers is what I would guess. I enjoyed it quite a bit.",The Edge of Seventeen
58,RforFilm,"Thanks to the writing of Edge of Seventeen, Nadine fits alongside with Ghost World, Juno, and Daria",8,21 November 2016,"If there is something that a teenager values more then friends is their boyfriend/girlfriend. The feelings of love and passion are amplified for the juvenile as their sudden change in body chemistry gives them the naive but exciting notion that they are grown up and feel like that their responsibly to juggle a relationship along with their daily high school life. Let's not forget that before the rise of the suburban family, it was actually fairly common for teenagers to have already chosen their partner and maybe even already start a family. Though when boy meets girl, what happens to the friends they've had to slightly leave behind?When someone is told by their friend that their going to be spending a lot more time with their loved one, they unfortunately mean it. That's how you identify that a relationship is going good. For those that were popular and a lot of friends, they we're probably not that disappointed by this. But for those that are more quiet and stick to a few friends, this can feel like a major loss, like seeing someone else taking away something that you thought was yours. The Edge of Seventeen deals with one girl losing her friend to a relationship.Seventeen-year-old Nadine Byrd (played by Hailee Steinfeld) is an unpopular angst girl who claims to be an old soul and has major distaste for the image of the modern teenager. With her only family supporter, her father, already gone from heart disease, her only solitude comes from her lifelong friend Krista (played by Haley Lu Richardson). They enjoy sitting away from the lunch tables and often spend most free time doing nothing. Things are thrown out of proportion when Krista ends up sleeping with Nadine's older brother Darian (played by Blake Jenner).When Nadine makes Krista chose between them, she chooses her new boy friend over her best friend. Now on her own, Nadine puts her focus on being the object of the boy she likes, Nick. Meanwhile her relationship with her mother Mona (played by Kyra Sedgwick) and Darian become further strained when she begins to act more selfish and only finds one of her teachers Mr. Bruner (played by Woody Harrelson) to even communicate with. Things do take a change when she seems to be getting attention from fellow student/animator Erwin. Though she seems to like his company, she still wants to be with Nick.You might be seeing this and thinking, ""another story about teenage angst?"". On the one hand, when you think of Ghost World, Juno, and the TV series Daria, you'd think this was cliché. Though it may seem so, Nadine is an interesting character to follow, as she seems like a real teenager. I'm glad to see another teen movie that embraces it's R rating and allows their adolescents to not only communicate in a way that feels like high school again, but to seem flawed enough to understand that they still have a lot to learn. Hailee Steinfeld is showing off that she has a chance to make it as an adult actress. What's fascinating is that even though her character is annoying and can be quite shellfish, she's still interesting enough that you want to see what she'll do. She seems like a character out of a John Hughes movie.Speaking of John Hughes, The Edge of Seventeen took a cue from his work to craft an atmosphere that feels that it could be timeless (in this day of evolving phone and computers, is not easy). This happens to be an excellent film in general, even if it can run slow in a few moments.I'll give this eight regretful texts out of ten. I highly recommend The Edge of Seventeen as something honest and maybe hard, but entertaining nonetheless.",The Edge of Seventeen
59,cultfilmfan,The Edge of Seventeen,10,19 November 2016,"The Edge of Seventeen, I am pleased to say is a little film that came out of nowhere and not only did it far exceed all my expectations, but it turns out as of now to be one of my favourite films of 2016, if not my favourite film of the year and yes, it is that good. Within the first little while of the film I really was not expecting much as this seemed like another version of 2007's Juno, where you have a highly educated and yet very socially awkward teenager who has a very large vocabulary and speaks probably different than the grammar and language skills that most teenagers at that age possess. Unless of course you happen to be Ellen Page in the film Juno, which for the first while of the film I felt this could be a more adult oriented brother, or sister film to, which I was really hoping it was not. Nothing wrong with the film Juno per se, but I have already seen that before and was hoping not for an exact carbon copy of it. Thankfully as I gave the film time, it really ended up surprising me and I would say it is just as good as Juno, or as my initial reaction was that this film may even surpass that. This is a film that conveys beautifully and by beautifully I mean it is so true and honest about what an awkward and sometimes absolutely loathsome time both high school and one's teenage years could be. The film shows our main character Nadine, who is here played by Hailee Steinfeld, who I have not seen in anything since the Coen Brothers' 2010 remake of True Grit, but here she delivers what I think is so far my favourite female performance of 2016 in a role that is not just a cookie cutter outline of what we think teenagers in movies are supposed to act and behave like, but this film and Steinfeld's performance goes much deeper than that. The film truly shows that as teenagers we have a lot of growing that we do and not just in size and shape with our bodies. One's adolescent years often accompany many different changes in our lives from things going on in our own families, to things with friends inside and out of school and I am sure that some teenagers have home lives that are even more volatile and dysfunctional than anything that we can dream up for a movie and even getting out of bed for them in the morning to face a new day can be that challenging. Nadine, has had several setbacks, or difficult situations that have all occurred within a very short period of time. Most of these as with most changes in life, have nothing to do with any fault, or blame on her behalf, but still dealing with these things proves to be more than difficult for her. Because of this, Nadine chooses to lash out at the world and has in general a very negative and pessimistic outlook on life. We see her make so many bad and regretful decisions simply because she is unhappy and looking for any and everything to fill that emptiness and void in her life which she thinks she can fill by being rebellious and her own boss, but it will ultimately lead her to more trouble until what she needs is a good wake up call and some decent people who actually care for her, to step in and show her that people do actually care about her and that she has more than enough potential and so many wonderful qualities about her, if she would only let people see them. Steinfeld's performance can be extremely humorous at times because of Nadine's neurotic whims and quirks, but we also see her pain and suffering and her anger at the world which is portrayed here with so much emotion and depth that it is as I said this year's best female performance so far and hopefully one that is not ignored come awards time. Equally good here in a much different role is Woody Harrelson, as a teacher who becomes a pal and almost one to confide in for Nadine, who is more empathetic and caring to her needs than what he lets on. It is a humorous performance, but one played so well that at times it also shows a beautiful side to it of caring and just being the kind of great teacher that we all so badly deserve in high school. The Edge of Seventeen has wonderful teenage characters and it's depiction of not only them, but also of the parents and adults in this film is so spot on and accurate that it has not been this perceptive, or good probably since Todd Solondz's film Welcome to the Dollhouse, which is another great and accurate film of the pains of high school. This film has wisdom beyond what it shows and is a great showcase for this up and coming director and is a film that teenagers will not only relate to as well as adults and anyone who has even been in high school for a little while. One of the most intelligent and astute films in awhile and also so far this year's best.",The Edge of Seventeen

62,dave-mcclain,"This is a fun, funny, heart-felt and insightful update of the time-honored coming-of-age story.",9,24 November 2016,"It's exciting when talented young actors and actresses come along and they keep leaving Movie Fans wanting more. We marvel at the amount of talent they have at such a young age, we enjoy watching them in just about everything they do, we can hardly wait to see what they'll do next and where their careers will take them. Hailee Steinfeld is such an actress. Her first feature film role was as the tough, stubborn, revenge-seeking girl in 2010's ""True Grit"". She was only 13-years-old when the movie was filmed, but her performance earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Next, she made some forgettable films (paying her dues, as young actresses must, no matter how much raw talent they have), but also starred in 2013's ""Enders Game"" and, the same year, in the remake ""Romeo & Juliet"". 2014 saw her appearing in movies with the likes of Oscar-winners Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones. In 2015, she established herself in the ""Pitch Perfect"" franchise and, just over a year later, began earning raves as the star of ""The Edge of Seventeen"" (R, 1:44). (And all that before her 20th birthday!) In that coming-of-age comedy-drama, Steinfeld is Nadine, an awkward 17-year-old girl who is anything but comfortable in her own skin and feeling kind of lost. With her beloved father (Eric Keenleyside) no longer in her life, she's being raised by her self-absorbed mother (Kyra Sedgwick) and constantly overshadowed by her ""perfect"" older brother, Darian (Blake Jenner). Nadine has really only had one friend since childhood, a classmate named Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), and now has a love-hate relationship with her caring but sarcastic high school history teacher, Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson).Nadine's already uncomfortable existence turns chaotic and even more lonely when Krista starts dating Darian. Nadine stops talking to Krista, Nadine's mother pretty much tells her to get over it and the only person Nadine now has to confide in is Mr. Bruner. Sure, Erwin (Hayden Szeto), the sweet but nerdy guy who sits next to Nadine in class, wants to be friends (and maybe more), but she has become obsessed with Nick (Alexander Calvert), the bad boy at school who also works at a local pet store. As disagreeable as Nadine is, she does have people in her life who care for her and she shows she is capable of growth.""The Edge of Seventeen"" is a fun, funny, heart-felt and insightful modern look at teen angst. And Steinfeld isn't the only impressive young talent who makes this movie work. The film's screenwriter, Kelly Fremon Craig, also makes her directorial debut here and gives us a story which is perfectly balanced between humor and pathos. Mostly, what she gives us is truth, which Steinfeld completely and adorably embodies throughout. Meanwhile, her costars prove to be up-and-coming talents in their own right. Comparisons to John Hughes' 1980s teen comedies are obvious, but apt, as this film wonderfully updates Hughes' sensibilities for the early 21st century. ""A""",The Edge of Seventeen
63,swilliky,An interesting take on a the teenage dramedy,7,22 December 2016,"Hailee Steinfeld is brilliant in this coming of age, teenage drama, comedy that utilizes the excellent young actress and captures the awkward frustrations of being a white middle-class teenager. Steinfeld plays Nadine, an unsocial young woman who only has one great best friend and constantly torments her history teacher. A brief introduction gives viewers the background to know she lost her dad in under tragic circumstances at 13 and has been dealing with the results for several years. Nadine's brother Darian (Blake Jenner) seems to have everything together as a popular cool senior and makes it even worse for Nadine when he starts dating her only best friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson). Nadine starts to make rash decisions and seeking out boys for company. Really capturing the awkward high school conversations are Nadine's blossoming relationship with artist Erwin (Hayden Szeto) who struggles to be flirtatious and charming and is not successful at winning over Steinfeld's Nadine at first.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",The Edge of Seventeen
64,Movi3DO,Funny and Relatable,8,10 May 2021,"You need to watch out for run-on sentences.I have heard about this movie for a while, and a friend also recommended this to me. A slice-of-life look at a high school student going through a tumultuous life.What I enjoyed the most was the jokes, especially from Woody Harrelson's character. They sounded pretty simple, yet were effective and full of savagery. I was gaping and could not believe the replies from the characters.The characters were interesting and relatable. I like and relate to the character Erwin the most. He was very cringe at times and not crafty at socializing and choosing the right time when talking to his crush.The theme of the movie was that everyone has their own problems, and sometimes people forget about that. Also, the movie emphasized the familiar theme of the complicated life of a teenager. This was shown through the main character, portrayed wonderfully by Hailee Steinfeld, as she struggled to socialize and keep those close to her.As for issues, the plot was pretty predictable, and I was not surprised that much. However, this does not mean that the story wasn't real and relatable.Overall, an entertaining and relatable drama. 8/10.",The Edge of Seventeen

66,msbreviews,Rating: A-,8,6 August 2017,"I didn't have any expectations for this movie, even when its percentage at RottenTomatoes was near 100%. I just thought it was another coming-of-age film like all the others, with no particular difference ... Ups.The Edge of Seventeen is fantastic! It isn't a conventional coming- of-age movie, it has so much more to it. Starting on the rating, I love the fact that this is rated R. There's never a single scene where someone tells a teenager ""oh, you can't say that"". All of the youngsters in this film talk like high-schoolers, they say ""shit"" and ""fuck"" like they say in real life because that's actually realistic. Kelly Fremon Craig does a great job not manipulating what is real, she just shows how it is in our world nowadays with no strings attached.Hailee Steinfeld ... Wow. I never thought of her as a real contender for big parts in big movies, but after this one, she definitely saved herself a spot on the top. She's so real, she says everything that once went through our minds during this time and she perfectly captures all of it: sadness, depression, suicidal mind ... happiness, pride, sense of relief ... She carries the whole film and I wouldn't be too surprise to see an Oscar or a Golden Globe nomination.The rest of the cast is also great. Everyone from Haley Lu Richardson (Krista), who plays her best friend, to her teacher, Woody Harrelson (Mr. Bruner). The humor involved between the characters is super funny, the writing is on point for each of them and the story is also really good.I guess my only complaints are the slightly rushed ending and some personality details about Nadine that should've been better explained instead of just being left out there (like her being ""an old soul"" and not having anything in common with students around her age).Either way, The Edge of Seventeen is one of the greatest surprises of 2016 and one of the best coming-of-age movies in a long, long time. Hailee Steinfeld is pitch-perfect on his role as Nadine, the writing is great, the story is good and the humor is super funny throughout the whole film. Some minor issues bring down the movie a little, but it is still an amazing time at the theater.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",The Edge of Seventeen

69,oOoBarracuda,The Edge of Seventeen,10,25 November 2016,"Kelly Fremon Craig wrote and directed the 2016 coming-of-age story, The Edge of Seventeen. Starring Hailee Steinfeld, Haley Lu Richardson, and Woody Harrelson, The Edge of Seventeen tells the ever so familiar tale of navigating high school and the awkward teenage years just as your world begins to fall apart. Kelly Fremon Craig follows the formula of a coming-of-age story while still managing to tug at the heartstrings of the audience and keep us engaged through the final scene. Brilliantly written with a wonderful cast, The Edge of Seventeen is sure to gain attention this Oscar season.Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) has always been, a little different. There was a time in her life in which she felt like such an outcast, she refused to get out of the car and enter school. Everything changed when she met Krista (Haley Lu Richardson) Finally, Nadine had a friend and felt like she belonged with someone. Nadine and Krista were attached at the hip, navigating life's challenges and the unique difficulties of their lives. Nadine has always felt overshadowed by her older brother Darian (Blake Jenner) who seems to never have a challenge with any aspect of his life. Nadine never felt worse about her brother than when he began dating Krista. The union between Krista and Darian was too much for Nadine to bear, and she drew a line in the sand presenting Krista with the ultimatum of choosing between Nadine and her brother. When Krista refused to answer, Nadine abandoned their friendship forging through life and high school and every awkward situation that comes with it friendless and alone, with the exception of her favorite teacher, Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson). Kelly Fremon Craig crafted a brilliant script, reminiscent of Diablo Cody, with a perfectly conversational tone and wonderfully engaging pop culture references. The most brilliant aspect of the script was that each character was fully developed. It is so rare, especially in a coming-of-age story to have each character so beautifully fleshed out so the audience can understand the film from each perspective. The Edge of Seventeen, especially, was dependent upon being able to see the perspective of each character, as Nadine was often criticized for being self-centered in her belief that she was the only one experiencing problems in regards to the change in her family. The edge of Seventeen was an incredibly relatable story, which is the driving force of a coming-of-age tale; this inherent relatability is in no small part aided by the wonderful acting of the film's lead. Hailee Steinfeld played a perfect lead and was scene stealing and captivating every moment she was on-screen. Kelly Fremon Craig also makes some brilliant directorial choices to allow the audience to see their own similarities to the tale. The fact that the principles attend Lakewood High School reminds me of a line from A Nightmare on Elm Street, ""In every town, there's an Elm Street. My hometown in Colorado has a Lakewood High School, and I'm sure, most towns in the U.S. do, as well. The most striking stroke of relatability is the illustration that we are all struggling through our own unique journey, and there is no one among us to save us. Many teenagers believe that when they are an adult they will have all the answers and won't have to struggle through life so much, only to find out that it is only the circumstances with which one struggles with that changes. There is no rule book for understanding given once one becomes an adult, and there are never any easy answers no matter how old we become, the best we can do is find someone that makes the struggle worth it, and navigate life together. The Edge of Seventeen was a bit formulaic and predictable in parts, but that is easily forgiven, considering it is a coming-of-age film. The script and cast avoid the predictable hole the film avoided. Whether you were a Darian, who on the surface never met a struggle, or whether you were a Nadine, a self-described ""old soul"" who always felt out of place in your generation and missed out on the ""beer pong ice breakers"", there is something in The Age of Seventeen for everyone.",The Edge of Seventeen
70,SquigglyCrunch,Beautifully Written and Fantastically Acted,9,22 March 2017,"The Edge of Seventeen follows a young girl in high school who, after learning of her best friend's and brother's romantic relationship, begins to distance herself from other people and ultimately ends up diving into something of a depression. The writing here is fantastic. I don't think I've ever seen a teen 'comedy' as relatable and real as this one. The characters talk and act like teenagers, and despite being a male, I was able to relate to most every problem Nadine (the main character) faced to an extent. And the other characters are interesting and, again, relatable. The movie progresses in a way that typically proves to be unpredictable simply because we don't get a lot of movies that capture teen-hood this well, so while I expected some conventional- ism, I got little to none of it. The acting is all great. While everyone gives a good performance, Hailee Steinfeld stands above each one. She gives a performance that topples her first Oscar nomination in 'True Grit' without a doubt, yet somehow she got snubbed. Regardless, I think we can all appreciate just how good her performance here was. The comedy is really well integrated into the movie. I used the word 'comedy' in quotations earlier because I wouldn't necessarily call it that. It's a teenage drama that has circumstantial comedy in it. It doesn't go out of it's way to make the audience laugh, yet it still manages to capture the hilarity of being a teenager from time to time, and for those who can relate they prove to be very funny parts. I don't usually complement a movie for it's pacing because the expectation is that a movie is well-paced. If it's boring, usually that means it failed. If it isn't, well good job movie you met my expectations. And yet, this movie is completely enthralling from beginning to end. Not once was I bored by it, nor did I ever really care to check the remaining run time. In fact, I wished the movie would just keep going on forever by the time it ended. If I have but one problem with this movie, it's the way it started. Something about it was just a little shaky. Looking back now I'm not entirely sure why, but it seemed a little off, and I wasn't exactly sure what to think of it.Overall The Edge of Seventeen is fantastic. The writing, characters, music, pacing, and acting are all just that. And on top of it all, it proves to be very emotionally effective. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",The Edge of Seventeen

The only downside was the insufferable behavior of our heroine throughout most of the movie. She was thoroughly unlikable. Also, the improbable casting of Hailee Steinfeld as someone who would be unpopular in high-school with her gorgeous face and super-model body and quirky fashion-sense, was eye-rolling. The writing was excellent as there was not one one-dimensional character in the cast. No one was all bad or all good. This movie turns the typical John Hughes- type cast of characters on their ear: the nerdy Asian with a crush on Nadine, the former friend who abandons her for the popular clique, the dumb jock brother, the neurotic mother, the trusted, unconventional but wise teacher, the handsome entitled and popular unrequited love interest. they are all here...but not here. They are different. Even our lovable but awkward heroine who finally finds her way. Like I said, she is not all that lovable. Hmmmm. I take back what I said about this being a downside. As far as the ending: Yay! this is how Pretty in Pink should have ended.",The Edge of Seventeen

Any sign of self pity and my mom would give me that look and I knew it was trouble before my tantrum even began (and I love her for doing that). That being said, I really liked this movie.

73,ethanbresnett,Great film,8,5 July 2021,"This film really shocked me by how good it was. These sorts of teen coming of age films can always be a bit hit and miss, but this was a massive massive hit.Primarily this was due to the performance of Hailee Steinfeld who was so brilliant. I can't remember seeing a better performance from a lead in a teen movie. She just played the part to perfection, presenting quite a troubled and brash character in a very sympathetic way so that we could fully root for her. The supporting cast were all perfectly good, but Hailee eclipsed them all.The plot was also very strong, and maybe not what you'd expect from the synopsis. It has a well developed protagonist at its core who is great to follow, and does a brilliant job of exploring her motivations and actions even if we don't always agree with them. On top of this there are lots of poignant and moving moments, as well as a script that feels authentic. Sometimes you can tell that these teen movies are written by adults who have no idea how teenagers actually speak and act, but this all felt very believable.The positives keep on coming as the soundtrack, direction, pacing, all that good stuff, were spot on.Loved it.",The Edge of Seventeen
74,estreet-eva,"Reminiscent of Savage Steve Holland's""Better Off Dead""",7,6 March 2017,"Kelly Furmon Craig pays homage - perhaps subconsciously - to the Savage Steve Holland and Steve Hughes dramadies of The Big 80's with this winning portrait of way over dramatic teenagerhood and the consequences it brings. Hailee Steinfeld nails how every glance, conversation, and text can seem life or death when you are on the edge of seventeen (thanks, Stevie Nicks!). She also nicely mixes in the subconscious search for a father figure after watching her own die of a heart attack. Her surrogate father lies in the person of the bitter, jaded English teacher Woody Harrelson who gets many of the film's best lines (these are not plentiful; having said that the writing is generally good). As an aside, kudos either to Craig, the makeup staff and/or to actor Eric Keenleyside who plays the father and even before his fatal heart attack appears like a man somehow looks like he's overdue for a terminal cardiac episode. Anyway, Steinfeld's Nadine so wraps herself in her own teenage narcissism that when we meet Harrelson's Mr. Bruner's family it feels like a revelation but is only because we have been seeing the world through Nadine's limited vision. So the movie excels in tone, realism and, to a degree comedy but nearly all limited to the Nadine / Bruner dyad. The script could have used some punching up when it comes to side characters including Haley Lu Richardson's Krista and Hayden Szeto's Erwin. Neither is given more to do than to be The Best Friend and The Silver Medal Love Interest respectively. Remember Anthony Michael Hall in ""Sixteen Candles"" doesn't get top billing but nonetheless, Hughes kept him integral to the plot. In short, while not quite the classics ""Better Off Dead"" or ""Sixteen Candles"", the movie contributes an entertaining and somewhat original interpretation on the subgenre.",The Edge of Seventeen
75,CineMuseFilms,"One big quirky, intelligent and funny coming-of-age cliché.",7,13 January 2017,"Coming-of-age films appeal to most audiences but some never realise that it's a genre full of gender stereotypes. Male coming-of-age films are about high-risk adventure, physical challenge, and enduring friendships, while the female versions are about popularity, mean girlfriends and emotional insecurity. Manhood is usually portrayed as dramatic achievement while womanhood is a melodrama of anxiety and victimhood: are these the only options? Such clichés are alive and well in The Edge of Seventeen (2016).The plot line follows the narrative shape of most coming-of-age films. At 17, Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) is a gawky, angst-filled over-thinker who hits the edge of teenage sanity when she finds herself in an emotional vortex. Her father died a while ago; her mother is a bit loony; she worries about her looks; and the mean girls are giving her hell. Life sucks, and then the cruncher: her lifelong best (and only) friend Krista starts dating her infuriatingly perfect older brother. Betrayed beyond belief, Nadine busts up with Krista and ends up chronically lonely. When her secret crush turns sour, she gravitates to a sweet nerdy guy who has been watching her from afar. Throughout all of this is her sardonic teacher, Mr Bruner, who tells her that she'll have to join the queue if she wants to talk about suicide during his lunch hour.While the plot line is one big cliché, the casting and acting are simply outstanding. The spotlight is totally on Nadine and she shines in every scene. She is the quintessential uncool teenage girl: gorgeous without knowing it; street smart about everything and nothing; juggling a dozen emotional balls at once; but still a sweet kid who needs a hand to survive the usual mistakes that must be made on the way to growing up. She is needy, defiant, and funny all at once, while Krista and Mr Bruner bring out the best and worst in her.Does this film raise the standard of stereotypes in the female coming-of-age story? No, not at all, and melodrama seems to be an inescapable part of the deal. But it tells the story in a refreshing way with an intelligent script delivered mostly through Nadine's quirky personality, aided by a top support cast. With a natural filming style and a great soundtrack, this story is told with realism, charm and hope.",The Edge of Seventeen

The third act flirts with greatness with hints of deeper character examinations (see Nadine at Mr. Bruner's house; Darian's doorstep speech; the beautiful hallway vulnerability) that could've gone a bit further (the ending is a bit too happy and easy considering Nadine's stark confession of real depression the night before).

78,dcarsonhagy,A Very Nice Change of Pace,9,21 February 2017,"It is so refreshing to see a movie made about teenagers that doesn't try to dumb them down, make them all look like they are hornier than goat, or having them lined up to be butchered by a maniac in a hockey mask. In fact, ""The Edge of Seventeen"" is one of the best movies ever in this genre.Nadine was always friendless and picked on. She never had any friends until one day an ""angel"" fell from the sky. This angel was Krista. They immediately become friends and have each other's back all the way through high school. Nadine's life was pretty much a nightmare. She loses her father (who she thought was her only friend) at an early age. When Krista came along, she finally had something solid. Her mom doted on her brother, Darian, who was the popular jock at high school.Nadine's life seems to be going just fine until after one drunken night with Krista, Nadine wakes up on the bathroom floor, hears some giggling, and walks in on HER best friend...who just happens to be in bed with her brother. Her entire world collapses. In a fit of rage, Nadine tells (not asks) Krista to choose: her or her brother.This movie was well written, well directed, and extremely well acted. Harlie Steinfield plays Nadine as close to the ""truth"" as you can get. Everyone remembers high school, right? It was for some of us the worst times of our lives. It seems Nadine's only friend now is a teacher, Mr. Bruner, wonderfully underplayed by Woody Harrelson. Blake Jenner plays Nadine's brother, Darian, whose life isn't as perfect as Nadine assumes. Hayley Lu Richardson plays Krista, but for me the actor who stole the show was Hayden Szeto, who plays Erwin, a boy who is secretly crazy about Nadine but is paid absolutely no attention.The movie is rated ""R"" for language and adult situations. Hope you enjoy this one as much as I did.",The Edge of Seventeen
79,dansview,Jocks are People Too,6,13 February 2019,"Well, don't judge a movie by whether you like the characters. Judge it by whether the characters are realistic. Because people are not always likeable in real life. But their story can still be compelling.
So while our protagonist may have been self-absorbed and overly dramatic, was she believable as a modern teen? I think she was.
Keep in mind that this is just another in a series of one billion films about Godless people with empty lives. But that's who writes and directs many films. People write about what they know.
Having a dorky Asian high school male character was refreshing. I also like that our main girl gives him a chance.
But what was the most refreshing was the portrayal of the popular jock older brother as actually a pretty solid guy who is the glue of the family. Two thumbs up for the reliability of alpha males. Meanwhile, he also gets a chance to share his own frustration at needing to be the rock of the family. Of course he looked way too old and mature for high school.
As others have noted, the lead actress is reasonably attractive and quick-witted. Those of us who were neither in high school may have a hard time understanding why she has such low self esteem. If only we had her assets when we were young.Nevertheless, low self esteem is often in the eye of the beholder. Meaning that people look down on themselves for a variety of complex and subjective reasons that others may never understand. It is what it is.The story did a good job of having the supporting characters remind our main character that she was being unreasonable, overly dramatic, and selfish.I agree with other reviewers that it's a sad commentary on modern culture that teens judge the value of their lives based on whether they have a romantic partner. But loneliness and desire are powerful forces, and if there is no other narrative to balance out that potential void, it will consume a person who doesn't have the gravitas to see it in perspective.I didn't notice any music. Meanwhile others say that the music was significant. It made zero impression on me.There is no nudity, limited sexual references, and less profanity than in most films. But this film is not for the socially conservative. The main girl speaks her mind, including describing sexual fantasies and scenarios.
I've never seen the lead in anything prior. But she seems quite talented and natural. Good performance with the material she had to work with.",The Edge of Seventeen
80,James_De_Bello,8.5/10,8,1 February 2017,"Everyone knows that growing up is hard, and life is no easier for high school junior Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld), who is already at peak awkwardness when her all-star older brother Darian (Blake Jenner) starts dating her best friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson). All at once, Nadine feels more alone than ever, until the unexpected friendship of a thoughtful boy (Hayden Szeto) gives her a glimmer of hope that things just might not be so terrible after all.Being a huge follower of the coming of age/teen drama from the Hughes days in 80s to all of the modern incarnations, I was very excited by the prospect of another teen dromedy and getting to finally see it was a real plesure, full of brilliant witty comedy in the same measure of heartfelt drama.What strikes me the most about this film is the fact that its a debut feature for director Kelly Fremon Craig. She demonstrates a confidence in the storytelling that is something we have seen from very few debuts. The material is so varied and touches, as said above, the extremes in both comedy and drama, yet the coherence in the tone of the film never, ever wavers, every scene, as in all great storytelling, catapults us into the next one, the characters constantly evolve and learn new things and probably, the very best part, is that everyone of them, from leading to secondary supporting, has a truly three dimensional dynamic, you understand where all of them come from, nobody is condemned to a clichéd flatness and from this emerges constantly entertaining conflict.The cast is a showcase of great actors making justice to great characters, none of them come out as seen-before characters, they all find a place in the story and make the most out of what they can do with the fascinating script. Other than the fact that Steinfield's work is Oscar level acting, she gives such a beautiful portrayal of the sadness in the character she plays and how she comes out of it. Hayden Szeto has to be mentioned in particular besides her because his timing, his awkwardness and ultimately his heartfelt performance make for a very, very good, touching, quirky and genuine character.This film perfectly incarnates the vision is sets out to complete, it is surprising and unpredictable at every turn, constantly engaging you in the novelty of the characters, it has character narration done incredibly right. The beauty of laughing hard in a scene and going to the completely opposite emotional spectrum five minutes later and feel elated by both of the dynamics is a joy very few films manage to nail and ""Edge of Seventeen"" does that, it is an incredibly mature film in the way it faces its themes and gives, in my humble opinion, a very good example. I had a blast with this film.",The Edge of Seventeen

This movie is so funny, you may end up rolling on the floor literally. Hailee Steinfeld nails those awkward teenage years spot on. And so clear your plans this weekend to make room for THE EDGE OF SEVENTEENTHE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN marks the feature directorial debut of writer/director Kelly Fremon Craig who superbly wrote this wonderful hilarious coming-of-age story that's candid and unadulterated. Hailee Steinfeld plays high school junior named Nadine who's already having a hard time with awkwardness and fitting in but things get even tougher when her best friend, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson) starts dating her older brother, Darian (Blake Jenner). Feeling more alone than ever, Nadine finds new friendship in Hayden Szeto's character, Erwin, a thoughtful student who turns out has had a crush on Nadine for quite some time.I knew this movie had something special when I heard that the legendary producer James L. Brooks (""Terms of an Endearment,"" ""As Good As It Gets"") was involved. Whenever Brooks believes in a project, then that deserves my attention because Brooks knows funny and Craig's script is all that and a bag of flaming hot potato chips. THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN gives you an honest look at what teenagers in the suburbs deal with these days. And much of it is thanks to Hailee Steinfeld's performance that can't get any more real and authentic. As Nadine, Steinfeld makes Malcolm In The Middle look twice as clueless.You wouldn't believe half the things that come out of all the characters' mouths because the things they say are so blunt and so spontaneous and edgy and unapologetic, they're like curve ball thrown at you. And Steinfeld is surrounded by equally appealing talents like Kyra Sedgwick, Blake Jenner, Haley Lu Richardson, Hayden Szeto, you can't keep your eyes off of them. Not to mention Woody Harrelson in what I think his best role yet as the sarcastic teacher who reluctantly helps Nadine figure herself out. All of these actors completely understand their respective characters, they totally get who they are and so all Craig had to do is roll the cameras and just let them run with it.

But there just so much of it you can take of it,before it becomes a standard and annoying clichéd formula.I also found it a bit strange,that nobody reacted to her big brother hooking up with her best friend,who was way younger. Maybe it's cultural thing. But my impression of school has always been,that people tease you for that stuff. But her brother got no grief for it.And she seem to fit in really well with his friends,which was also a bit strangeThey have tried to take everything that was good or funny in the J.Hughes movies. But they've missed the whole essence of it.

Absolutely magnificent work by Kelly Craig a first fully written, directed and produced movie and such a great and powerful storytelling. Hailee Steinfeld played Nadine and what a job did she do. This is one powerful and moving performance by such a young actress that will surely have a great things in front of her. Her emotions, charisma and truthfulness were astonishing.

Nadine, the main character is supposed to be the withdrawn and socially awkward sister of the most popular boy in school. She grows to resent him for it and they fight. Nadine has one good friend though who... of course.. falls for the brother. This sets off a rage spiral in Nadine. Now alone without her besty she flounders for a while - learning some hard lessons.. you know the drill. I could relate to every aspect of this movie but... I can't say I had a good time.
First problem for me was that Haliee Steinfield was just too good looking to play an awkward loner. Second problem was that Woody Harrelson was a stand out as Nadine's teacher - but he wasn't in the movie that much. Honestly I wanted to see those two in a movie. Thirdly, though I related to this flick, Nadine's problems make her look childish and they are entirely self made.

I caught this film online when the trailer first premiered or at least the red band trailer and was like this looks so good. I didn't think there would be much promotion for the film like on TV but to my surprise there was. I don't watch a lot angsty teen films unless its got actors I really like, Easy A has my celebrity crush Emma Stone and Breakfast Club is just one of my favorites because of the identifiable characters. This film has Hailee Steinfeld who is an actress I don't see a lot of film except that last Pitch Perfect movie. And her music career which I'm loving. Hailee Steinfeld plays Nadine an angsty teen who believes there are two kinds of people those who radiate confidence and those who believe the world sucks because of all the misfortune going on in life. She falls into that second category. She's only had one friend since second grade Krista who after one night starts dating her brother Darian is no longer speaking to her. Nadine and her brother Darian lost there father in a car accident when they were younger. Nadine is just very rude and aggressive towards everyone except a boy named Erwin and her teacher Mr.Burner. This probably Hailee Steinfelds best performance I mean yeah shes a great singer in that Pitch Perfect movie. But this tightly scripted coming of age story packs punches and is actually true to High school the students talk like how high school students would now. Edge of Seventeen does have some very obvious and familiar tropes that you would expect from this kind of film but is tightly scripted well acted and actually feels like a modern high school.

89,solojere,I had the worst thought: I've got to spend the rest of my life with myself,10,8 August 2021,"The Edge of 17 is an emotional film that does an amazing job of illustrating what it is like when you don't like yourself. The film follows Nadine, a socially awkward teenage girl who has the two most important people in her life. Her dad died of a stroke, and her best friend betrayed her by dating her brother. As the film progresses, we learn that Nadine has low self-esteem. In her own words, she states, ""I had the worst thought: I've got to spend the rest of my life with myself."" We also learn that Nadine has no other friends, so once her dad and her best friend are gone, she is left all alone. As someone who has spent a lot of time alone, I really related to Nadine and her struggles with depression and just trying to find her place in the world. Hailee Steinfeld's performance is simply amazing. The way in which she plays Nadine really sells the complexity of the character, and it's incredible the wide range of emotions she can display. And while I think she is great in all of her films, this one defiantly stands out as it illustrates how she can carry a film. Hailee and Woody Haralson also have great chemistry in the movie. My only criticism was the ending felt a little too neat and maybe slightly rushed. However, I don't think that takes away from the film at all.

The Edge of Seventeen is about an awkward teen trying to find her way in the world. Yes an old story, but every single actor works their chops off in this movie and there is not one single poor or even average performance. They all excel and also they all have fabulous chemistry on screen. One of my real pleasures watching it was that you could hear all the dialogue, and while there was music of course it never interfered with the film as a lot of new films seem to allow. Excellent cinematography with no shaky cameras or too-dark-to-see scenes, and the dialogue was in fact exactly what you'd expect to hear from those people in those situations. There was no ""uptalk"" that is popular at the moment but which I despise, where people speak sentences which are statements, but end on a high note as if that statement was delivered as a question. I hate that, it's so childish and affected, and there was none of it so I was very pleased. While there was a small sex scene there was no attempt to over sexualise the teens in the movie gratuitously as is often common. It was focused on the story of them and their experiences and while it dealt with difficult issues it did so with aplomb and humour and intelligence. Hailee Steinfeld rocks this movie and although she is 20 now she really nails the teen angst/passion/enthusiasm/cynicism/hate/love easily and completely. She owns the role and the film and I think we're going to see some stunning performances from her in the future.

She doesn't get on very well with her family either. Things get worse when her best friend Krista starts dating her brother Darian. It is a pretty basic plot and something which we have seen plenty of in the past but with Hailee Steinfeld giving an outstanding performance in the lead role, this film had a likable character that I actually cared for. Usually in films like this it's ALL about sex, and although this film did revolve around sex at times, it was more about her character growing as a person, overcoming her struggles, meeting new people & making new friends. There was a lot of depth to Nadine's character and the scenes with Woody Harrelson (teacher) were some of the best moments. It was a thoroughly enjoyable film but I wish it had been tied up a bit better at the end. Although you get the general idea with the ending, it would've been nice to see a little more.

Nadine's customary smouldering resentment is fanned into a white-hot blaze of jealousy which propels her into greater isolation, as she makes a difficult situation worse through needless conflicts and unwise choices. The film has an original slant, but dilutes much of its potential by repeatedly going in search of easy laughs and tear-jerking.The acting is above average for this kind of project, but Nadine's relationships with both Krista and Darian are given perfunctory treatment, and the script's main narrative arc and various sub-plots are utterly predictable. The direction could have exercised more self-restraint at dramaric moments, while it could have used more flair when depicting Nadine's everyday life.

I certainly do, and even for a more-than-normal case like me the school years were sometimes like a prison sentence, with hormone-crazed and totally devoid of empathy kids making a mess of each other's lives because they simply didn't know any better.So imagine yourself being a kid again. Now add to this a mother both overbearing and helpless, an older brother who's a light-headed jock who doesn't seem to give a damn about you, a girl who seemingly changes your friendship for a chance to date your sibling and a dad who's perfectly awesome but has unfortunately been dead for four years already. Join this whole list of things together - and there you go, you're in Nadine's shoes. Now go deal with it! Let's see if you manage.The brilliance of the coming-of-age movies these days is how spot-on they manage to be getting into the teens' heads and depicting their lives and the pitfalls of those. Maybe it's the whole infantilism of the current generation of screenwriters having an upper side after all, or maybe they do hire real teenagers as out-of-staff consultants, but it seems like almost every single serious teen movie I've seen in the last couple years knew exactly what buttons to push to bring back the adolescence memories and feelings you thought were long buried and gotten over.This time it's a bit different though, because I, as a male, had never been inside a head of a girl going through growing up and maturing. And, truth be told, that's a very messy experience. The mood swings, the unexpected desires and unlikely dilemmas... Watching The Edge of Seventeen definitely feels like an out-of-body experience, thanks to Hailee Steinfeld's intense and eerily complicated character. I can't claim that I know what girls really go through in that age, but, judging from my personal experience of communicating with people, she did an unbelievable job portraying a troubled young woman going through that period of her life. The fact that she hadn't got an Oscar nomination for this role makes me wonder what JLaw had been critically acclaimed for in the first place. But I digress...Now let me ask you a question. If you did find all the people around you either self-centered or being jerks or outright primitive, and if you felt lonely because of the vacuum those people, or the lack thereof, were creating around you, what would you do? Would you rather fly solo until you actually met a soul who shares some traits with yours? Or would you give in to the pressure and simply try to adapt and imitate similarities with all those people? Just a little time ago we've seen how the latter looks, in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. And while that movie tells a very different story, one thing it tells for sure is that imitation is never a solution.That's why it's been a surprising pleasure to see that in TEoS Nadine went on to openly rebelling against the system, both letting it hurt herself and actually admitting to not willing to comply. Those passionate monologues of a half-grown person both immature and dependent and at least honest about her own difference from the rest of the pack, are as naive as they are respectable. At least I wish I was as bold and daring in her age.And then... there were the issues. The awkward scenes and the moments of totally erratic behavior even I could feel ashamed of, simply because you could put yourself in her position and know how it's gonna feel a moment later. The Edge of Seventeen not only does a great job showing us the insides of a female teen's life, but also avoids the sin of idealizing its protagonist, so we actually see Nadine not as a precocious young person well ahead of her age but as a vulnerable kid who sometimes acts irrational or even dumb. That honesty with the audience is what really helps us stay tuned to the development of Nadine's character and care for her.Yet for some reason the filmmakers didn't dare to go as far as did the authors behind The Perks of Being a Wallflower. They didn't dare to avoid an ending which would sprinkle some sweet harmonization all over, making our heroine change overnight and become all convenient and agreeable. As if starting to smile at people and participate in those nice warm small talks would actually change the people around and turn them from the selfish creatures we all are into someone actually altruistic or putting your needs first or even caring about you when they already have what they need. That's the biggest lie people tend to tell themselves and each other: that if you treat someone right they'll do the same back at you. Bullsh!t, the truth is, the people will just keep doing what they are programmed to do, whether it's caring for their own needs only or trying to dedicate a segment of their lives to yours as well. And if there ever could be any moral in a story about becoming an adult, it should have been not ""be positive and the people will be drawn to you"" but rather ""learn to tell selfish a$$holes from those who care, and set your priorities accordingly"". If we could somehow follow that simple logic, the whole life would've become a lot easier.",The Edge of Seventeen
97,isaacochoterena,I felt identified,8,4 October 2021,"This film stands out in the comic and the sentimental, but not much in the story to tell.With a very good performance by Hailee Steinfeld, the main character becomes endearing and you even feel identified, the script has in its favor the good development of all the characters, why the characters feel that way, the jokes and the sentimentalities are balanced, but the plot is not well defined and it is difficult to keep up with the film. I think it becomes the only thing that fails in this movie.This film makes you identify how you felt in the moments when you began to see the world in a different way and you began to feel differently, it makes you identify with the things that the protagonist goes through and leaves a very valuable lesson, especially for adolescents, everything will be fine.",The Edge of Seventeen
98,SpoilerAlertReviews,"Honest, brave, refreshing and highly enjoyable.",9,4 December 2016,"An incredible, impressive directorial debut from Kelly Fremon Craig who also wrote this bittersweet teen-something movie about a socially challenged, awkward high school girl who periodically freaks out in glorious fashion triggered by friendships, or lack of, sibling rivalry, and romance; but not in the conventional way, more like how it happens in real life. Hailee Steinfeld is simply amazing as Nadine suffering from low self esteem, running through her daily routine sometimes hysterically, when thing so tragically don't go how they're expected. She emits that feeling of being unheard, inadequate and mostly misunderstood. She's constantly fighting a losing battle, mostly against herself. Blake Jenner plays her perfect brother who's supposedly self obsessed, the popular high school hunk and the obvious favourite of their flamboyant mother who's played by Kyra Sedgwick. Her childhood best friend, well, only friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson) is partly her anchor, a refuge that understands her, but friends have their falling outs, and this sisterhood falls in epic proportions. One other person who gets her is her teacher, Mr. Bruner, who she both despises and pesters in lunchtimes of ranting frenzies. Woody Harrelson is brilliant as the sarcastic, apparent- imprudent figurehead. Oh, and let's not forget her admirer, Erwin, perfectly played by Hayden Szeto sharing his own awkwardness that makes way for some great comical scenes. There's no Stevie Nicks track though, but that doesn't meant the soundtrack isn't good, because it is but isn't actually dominant like it can be in these kind of movies. It's more like background music as oppose to the soundtrack however there's amazing tracks from The Cinematic Orchestra', Amiee Mann, The 1975's, Phantogram, Birdy, Cloves, Santigold and Two Door Cinema Club; with Atli Örvarsson providing a good piano score. This certainly puts both Craig and Steinfeld on the map, being superbly paced, flowing gracefully, making a perfect snapshot of Nadine's teenage life. Going through the mixed emotions of hate, disgust, fear, laughter and love. Craig really proves her love for the movies, knowing the craft exceptionally well, with her camera work and movie references. It's an honest, brave and daring observation of how troublesome teenage life in western world can be and a great reminder that we're all just trying to get somewhere some of us don't even know until we get there.Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 9 Script: 9 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for a perfect debut, a refreshing and highly enjoyable story.

I have never wanted to punch a character in the face more than Nadine.""Boo hoo my dad died years ago so everyone should feel sorry for me.""

And must mention Hayden Szeto what an awesome actor and so funny. I really loved the chemistry between Nadine and Erwin.

103,ReganRebecca,Perfectly sweet teen comedy,8,7 February 2017,"It's rare for teen comedies to get made nowadays but it's even rarer for them to be this good. Writer/director Kelly Fremon Craig absolutely nails her debut movie and it's a true joy to watch. The film is about Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) who, as the film implies, is seventeen. Nadine tends to run her mouth off and is anxious and unpopular. When she was thirteen her father, the parent she was closest to, dies abruptly in front of her, leaving the family in disarray. Even four years later, the family is still struggling to hold themselves together. That all changes when Nadine's best (only) friend Krista falls for her older, perfect, brother Darian. Feeling like she's on the verge of losing the only person who really cares for her Nadine issues an ultimatum to Krista and when Krista fails to choose between Nadine or her brother, Nadine makes the decision for her and abruptly cuts off contact between the two of them forcing her to reach out and make new connections. This is just a great movie all the way through. Great cast (one quibble is that Hailee Steinfeld never feels as gawky or as awkward as Nadine is alleged to be, she's like Hollywood plain, i.e. a brunette). Also despite the fact that this is ""just"" a teen movie there are so many beautifully framed shots and Craig never plays it safe with making the movie feel good. A tight, clever script, great cinematography, colours, costumes, everything.",The Edge of Seventeen

Nadine lets out her anger and frustrations about life to her teacher, callous and calm Mr Bruner (Woody Harrelson). Mr Bruner is an excellent listener and understands the turmoil of a 17 yr old female who lost her father at a very young age and now has to cope with life's mole hill problems turned into mountains because of her anger and jealousies. Movie is very pleasant and Hailee Stenfeld has potential to do good roles. I enjoyed conversation between Krista and Nadine after Nadine sees Krista with her brother.

It has that same kind of coming-of-age feel, along with the quick and intelligent humor. But it's definitely tailored to today's audiences. Not in the sense that it's littered with pop culture references (Nadine spends an entire scene condemning that part of Millennials), but that it's not a glossy, watered-down version of what high school is like. This film shows you the grit and grime of your high school years. The language, the attitudes, the mindsets-- it's all there. And even if your not a girl, you can relate to this film and the character of Nadine because her issues and her problems go beyond her gender. The sh*t she goes through in this movie is universal, and that's what really caught my attention about this film. I was sitting there thinking ""Yep, I've done that"", ""I've definitely thought that before"", ""Holy sh*t, this is pretty much me on screen"".

109,lovettstough,Hailee Steinfeld part/role was perfect 10/10 A+,5,10 February 2019,This was not the greatest movie but it wasn't worst either. Hailee steinfeld character was the best. In the movie or in reality the friend should've never did what she did or vice versa the brother should've never did what he did. Neither one should have done what they did. I don't blame Nadine for the way she responded or anything she did in response. That was or is a line that friends and siblings just do not cross. This would be a good educational movie if an adult with good morals is present and tells the kids watching you don't ever do what Nadine friend and brother did. You just do not ever cross that line.,The Edge of Seventeen
110,untilnow99,It has its moments,8,29 January 2017,"There's not much new to be seen in this film. Angsty teenager fighting against the world type stuff. The movie does have many entertaining moments, but also a lot of predictable groan-worthy, eye- rolling bits, too. Does Haillee's character really have to dress like she's bucking to be the least attractive girl in her school? I'm no fashion maven, but enough already with the black tights and tennies. Bleah.I'm already way off track here. Please don't get me wrong: I enjoyed watching this. I particularly liked ""breakout star"" (as ""they"" are calling him) Hayden Szeto. Watch this film to see him, if for no other reason. It's terrific how he nails High School awkwardness when, in reality, he is 31 years of age. Yep. Those Asians sure have a knack for looking young, young, young. Blast their hides.Blake Jenner, on the other hand (age 24) is seriously miscast as Hailee's older brother. Who was it who thought this manly hunk could pass for a High School Senior? What a joke. That said, having ""discovered"" Blake (didn't we all?) in ""Everybody Wants Some,"" I have to say that watching him in action is certainly immensely pleasurable. He is one gorgeous and talented guy. He does a great job of playing the brother, but only if you pretend he's a College Senior.Woody Harrelson, after his stupendous acting in Zombieland and No Country for Old Men, continues to grow and mature and evolve as an actor. (I know that sounds trite and even cornball, but it is true.) I love watching him. This film has him playing the stereotypical ""I don't care, but yes I do care"" teacher. He has some great lines, though, and that kind of makes up for the two-dimensional part he is given in this.All in all, I would say you could do a lot worse than watch ""The Edge of Seventeen."" Just because I didn't suffer as a High School seventeen-year-old doesn't make it any less believable to me that others did suffer and suffer mightily. And who doesn't like a good story about an angst-ridden teenager confronting her inner demons and taking it out verbally on others?

112,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Enjoyable teen film,8,25 September 2020,"Finally, a teen movie that got it right. 'Edge of Seventeen' was surprisingly clever with sharp screenplay and relatable characters, without coming across as overly preachy or annoying. The movie succeeds because it's actually self aware of Nadine's selfish personality and doesn't attempt to make her likeable, so we are never forced into the position of trying to root for the protagonist. Nadine was also relatable and realistic, as the film doesn't hold back in presenting all her flaws and insecurities, and thus she's a wonderfully human character. For example, her lack of social skills at parties, the tumultuous on and off relationship with her best friend, and her longing to stand out from this generation are all issues that teens go through. Edge of Seventeen strays far from glamorising the life of a young person, and in fact does the complete opposite, giving us a refreshing perspective of a seventeen year old. The performances were excellent, with special mention to Hailee Steinfield and Woody Harrelson. The film incorporated a perfect balance of comedy, drama and romance, neither of which fell flat. I especially loved the witty yet intriguing relationship between Nadine and her teacher, which offered something far deeper than at first glance. His character was played wonderfully and he added a lot of warmth to an otherwise rather sad movie. Superb direction, colourful characters and a self aware screenplay make this a great watch. Highly recommend.",The Edge of Seventeen

I went into this film expecting a descent movie, not a great one.Hailee gives an epic performance in this movie, something that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. She fades between comedy and drama perfectly, and she shines as the main lead. The supporting cast, such as Woody as the teacher are great additions. Woody gives a great and funny performance here, one of his best in years.This movies'strongest point is is dialogue.

It was one of the more joyous films I had ever seen in my life. I was floored with it from start to finish. Hailee Steinfield captivates you from beginning to end. The jokes given to her are delivered in such fun and engaging ways. The story of this youthful teen is done in such a sweet and inviting way. It really understands what it can feel like to be a young teen just growing up in the world. And that was something I really did enjoy. The film also respects all of its characters. Giving them each interesting dimensions. It really allows them all to develop quite a lot. This made for a film that while a bit predictable gave it some edge. The characters themselves aren't complete clichés and are each written like real live human beings with thoughts and feelings.

118,TheCasualReviewer,Maybe Woody Harrelson greatest role,8,7 May 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) is a teenager going through the loss of her father, living with her annoyingly perfect brother, a fight with her best friend and everything else that comes with being a teenage girl. She struggles as she tries to find little things to make her happy and fit in.REVIEW:
This is some of the greatest writing in any film I've ever seen. It's so disgustingly realistic that I can literally sympathize with every character. I have this issue with films based around films that revolve around the life of a high schooler and it's either corny or not an accurate depiction of how teenagers act, but this film hits it on the nose. Then the humor in this film is catered directly for me. I don't know if it's the writing or the acting from Woody Harrelson or both that makes Mr. Bruner one of my single most favorite characters in any film. The sarcastic, dry humor is played like no other character I've ever seen. The chemistry between both Steinfeld and Harrelson works so well that I couldn't imagine anyone else in either of those roles. Hayden Szeto as Erwin was also really well done. I felt he was really this super nervous kid talking to a girl that he has a crush on. Quite possibly overly nervous, but I'm sure that's how some people are. One flaw I would have to say is the acting from Blake Jenner as Nadine's brother, Darian. He's not awful, but there wasn't much display in emotion, but more so an increase and decrease in volume of his voice depending on the situation. I do, however, really enjoy a couple of the final interactions between his character and Steinfeld's. This film is filled with laughs, sad moments, moments that you relate to down to the bone and just overall great dialogue. It's on Netflix as I post this, so if you haven't seen it already, add this to the top of your list. 8.7/10.",The Edge of Seventeen
119,quiqueperezsoler,Very hard to review...,7,13 May 2021,"Everytime I rewatch this movie I feel like I'm ready to like it but I just never entirely do so. Because I know it has great acting, great writing, it's funny and realistic to what teens angst is all about. The characters are interesting and are put through a lot of potentially engaging situations. However, I can't escape the feeling that some scenes and words that characters say make me cringe a bit. Not like in a bad way, but in a way that the scenes or interactions are so awkward or are made so awkward by the characters, that I can't watch or listen.I love Hailee Steinfeld, she is an amazing actress and I love her in this role, she might be the main reason I feel engaged in this girl's ""status quo""; but her character is written, and I think others have pointed it out already so I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks so, like the most agressively angsty teen I've ever seen.High school coming of age movies tend to be either a caricature or light-hearted essay of the high school experience, or tend more to the realistic more grounded aspects of life where everything doesn't always work in our benefit and we don't always have that happy ending but rather a bittersweet one (like in Lady Bird). This movie is a mix of these two. For the entire movie you feel for this girl, you see she was difficult already as a child so you don't attribute her ""bratty"" outbursts and attitude to some impactful events that unravel in the story; but the way she treats other people through it (and I mean secondary people, not the main romantic situation shown in the trailers) it makes her look so selfish and egocentric. Like if the rest of the people didn't have problems too.It sucks because i really think this movie is special, it has a lot of potential and the premise is unique and refreshing to the genre. And perhaps the fact that I'm more inclined to like the coming-of-age movie approach of ""Superbad"" or ""Booksmart"", which may emphasize more in the comedy angle than the deep more ""slice of life"" aspects; I love Lady Bird, I love Breakfast Club but I'd rather watch a movie that, while grounded and layered in message and characters, emphasizes more in the good parts rather than the awkward or tougher aspects. Because, in the end, noone wants to relive those parts of our teenage years. Sure, we awknowledge them but they are simply hard to rewatch.And that's what this movie makes you feel: you watch all these sequences so real and well written that it makes you feel like you are going through them. And perhaps that's the best quality of the movie, is just that, at the end of the day, I'd much rather have her be less of a ""trouble maker"" (literally) to everybody and give her just one good comendable quality to make her a bit more charming and less of a broken down, lonely teenager. Even for loners it's too much (and this coming from an ex-teenage loner).IN CONCLUSION, Edge of Seventeen is a greatly written and acted coming of age teen movie with an interesting take on the genre because it uses the real and hard-to-watch situations to develop the cons of being a teenager, with some really funny sequences and witty dialogue; but it surprises you with a touching ending that I'm still on the fence about considering it fitting to the tone of the movie or rather a left-field conclusion to leave the audience with some good ""feels"" after watching the parade of harsh situations of which the main character doesn't seem to be able to catch a break from.",The Edge of Seventeen
120,Oberrated,A breath of fresh air,8,23 November 2016,"So, from first look, this film has a chance to be seen as childish or the plot could be seen that way as well, but fear not, this film is rated R and for good reason. With plenty of language, crude jokes, and a realistic look on how high school aged individuals interact, the movie easily appeals to the 17 and up aged movie goers... 'Edge of Seventeen' was a breath of fresh air to me. It was a change of pace from the stereotypical teenage drama. What I liked most was how real it felt. The struggle of a growing young adult with a not so great of a life. With problems that seem giant to herself but extend way farther than meets the eye. An excellent story that was flawlessly executed... Speaking of execution, I was overall astounded by everyone's performance. I wish to see every one of these actors and actresses in future movies because I thoroughly enjoyed everyone incredibly much to their own respect... The humor in this film is a very dry, one-liner, quick quipped humor. In the trailer, this film could be quickly slated as a constant comedy with consistent one-liners but it was far from that. I, myself, expected that but was fine with being wrong. It had its moments where it seemed to be drawn out at times but regardless, there are plenty of moments that had me laughing in my seat and even an occasional long-lasting one.Overall, 'Edge of Seventeen' was a very well done film, strongly performed, and refreshing to watch. It is a drama with a story to be told. A real story that many teenagers to young adults deal with. Definitely worth the watch and definitely one to remember.-- Oberrated --",The Edge of Seventeen
121,makleen2,Clichéd teen movie tackles borderline personality disorder,6,19 September 2017,"In The Edge of Seventeen (2016), 17-year-old Nadine Byrd (Hailee Steinfeld) navigates the awkwardness of becoming an adult in her junior year of high school after her father dies of a heart attack. She reaches a crisis point when her only friend, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), hooks up with and begins dating her older brother, Darian (Blake Jenner). Her relationship with her mother, Mona (Kyra Sedgwick), further deteriorates as Nadine vents her frustration on friends, family, and her history teacher, Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson). The cloud has a silver lining when she meets a similarly awkward young man, Erwin (Hayden Szeto).The film has some bright spots, and some genuinely funny or touching moments, but mostly it is just the same clichéd teen movie we've seen a hundred times before. Not Another Teen Movie already satirized this film in 2001. It may have a deeper meaning, however, if what I perceived as a genuine portrayal of mental illness turns out to be accurate.Critics loved this movie, and for the life of me I can't figure out why. Molly Eichel at the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, ""The Edge of Seventeen is funny and tragic, but most of all it feels real in the same way John Hughes movies felt real. It's not a candy-coated version of teenagedom. It's harsh, and awkward, and funny, just like being a teenager."" Other critics called it ""straight and sincere,"" ""smart and perceptive,"" and ""there isn't a moment in this movie that doesn't feel completely true."" Who paid them to write this nonsense? Numerous critics have laughably compared this film to John Hughes' 1980s teen comedies. If only it was half as authentic. The Edge of Seventeen exists in an imaginary world where everyone owns a backyard pool, no one is overweight, and even the nerds have washboard abs. I actually rolled my eyes when geeky, stuttering Erwin takes off his shirt to get into the pool, revealing a toned, athletic figure. Nadine Byrd is another shy, awkward character played by a runway model who becomes beautiful and well dressed after spending a quick montage at the bathroom mirror.As I was watching The Edge of Seventeen, I realized that something was going on beyond just the typical ""awkward self-loathing teen."" Although the film is purportedly about a young woman dealing with typical teenage angst, most of the teenagers in the movie actually seem happy and well-adjusted. It's subtle enough not to catch, but if you pay attention, you will realize that Nadine Byrd and her mother are seriously mentally ill. Nadine's mother is hysterical, controlling, promiscuous, and dependent on her teenage son for stability. At one point, she turns to her daughter and explains that she only pretends to be happy, when she really feels empty inside.Nadine acts very much like her mother. She has unstable relationships with other people, an unstable sense of self, and unstable emotions (acting out in fits of anger). She has an extreme fear of abandonment (revealed in her overreaction to her brother and best friend's relationship), dangerous behavior (telling a boy she just met she wants to sleep with him, then allowing him to drive her to a remote parking lot where she suddenly changes her mind), a feeling of emptiness, and self-harm (binge drinking, threatening suicide). These are all symptoms of borderline personality disorder. BPD can be inherited, or triggered by a traumatic event (death of a close loved one, for example).If true, The Edge of Seventeen has a terrible message for viewers, which is that Nadine will simply ""grow up"" someday and stop feeling this way. Yes, everyone does grow out of typical teenage awkwardness and identity crisis, but a serious mental illness like BPD requires regular medical attention. I've known people who suffered from this disorder, and it has a lasting, devastating effect on personal and romantic relationships. If left untreated, Nadine's disorder will likely follow her to college, where she will engage in riskier behavior, substance abuse, and continue to have feelings of abandonment and self loathing.Woody Harrelson's character, Mr. Bruner, is a bright spot in the film. He plays the part of an aging, sarcastic teacher well. I wish the rest of the film's dialog was as witty, subtle, and surprising as his exchanges with Nadine. Unfortunately, The Edge of Seventeen is one awkward scene after another loosely strung together by a boilerplate plot, resolved neatly at the end because ""love conquers all."" Much to my disappointment, it's not as witty, genuine, and endearing as critics claim.",The Edge of Seventeen
122,kingsx_64,Not just teen angst,7,10 July 2019,"As many reviewers have stated, the main character Nadine is more then just going through growing pains. She shows signs of deeper emotional problems that go way beyond losing her father.
Almost all of Nadine's problems are brought on by her own actions. And when one is unaware that they are the problem, it will continue. Unfortunately here, she does a complete 180, over the coarse of a night. I didn't like that. But maybe time constraints prohibited from telling this gradually.
One of the strongest disagreements I've seen in reviews has been over her life long friend. To me this might have been the ONLY thing Nadine was justified at feeling betrayed. Key is lifelong friend. Who we see in one scene is actually targeting her brother. Then in the next she's found in bed with him. Then in the next she's all mushy mushy with a girl who wouldn't talk to her before. So yes Nadine, giving her an ultimatum was probably not the right next move, but never speaking to her again would have been. You just don't do that to friends.
I found Woody to be a great choice in a supporting but important role as a very grounding and level headed teacher.
Hailee Steinfeld's performance once again shows she's a force now, and in the future.
Though the ending was to quick at resolve, it was definitely worth a watch",The Edge of Seventeen

125,plasmapilot,THE ANGST OF ADOLESCENCE 😬,10,7 August 2021,"What a superb film for the entire family! My time in high-school was relatively great, but NOT without it's downside. The portrayal of the emotional upheavals that accompany adolescence was very realistic! I found the actor's to be believable & the storyline drew me back to a time of major life changes. Growing up is complicated and difficult. Sometimes we forget that struggle,but in hindsight we can realize that time helped us build character and become stronger as we reached adulthood! What an eye opener to see it represented so beautifully on film. Share this gem with your family!",The Edge of Seventeen
126,warthogjump,Flawless coming of age story,10,8 January 2017,"Even going in with good expectations due to the positive reviews, I was very impressed with this simple, heart touching gem of a film. Everything is perfect. The script is flawless. The acting is superb. The story is very topical to modern times. Every scene is filled with either happiness or sadness. There are no 'boring' scenes. The film starts off strong, continues without wasting a single second on screen, and finishes beautifully. None of the characters act 'out of character' for their respective roles and this is what makes the story even truly more believable. Every character has been crafted beautifully by the writer, portrayed unbelievably by the respective actors, and directed with precision and fine eye for detail to bring the emotion of every scene true to life. The film is rated MA - RESTRICTED for under 15's in Australia and R in other America. I have heard so many people say there is nothing explicitly graphic in this film; there's no need for the highly restrictive rating. Well, I tell you what - this kind of reasoning is exactly what has lead to the downfall of young teenagers and adolescents. There is plenty in this movie, in my opinion, to warrant the restrictive rating. Nothing explicit; but plenty of reasons. The film is a very realistic portrayal of youth today, and shows the difficulties of fitting in with a world so ever fast changing for the worst - at many times very neglectful actions with grave consequences are shown as glorified and justified (for the intention of filling the film's purpose) and for this reason youth who attend this film will get WRONG IDEAS about major decisions they make in their life. Albeit, my criticisms are of no value, since 90% of the cinemas was filled with 12 year old's in their groups of guys and gals cuddling and meddling with each other throughout the film and giggling at credits - this is precisely the reason why films like this should not be watched by these kids yet not only is the restrictive rating not enforced by cinemas (obviously), but even much worse, the parents! Kids have been left with no guidance or support and left to roam - we have a movie that essentially demonstrates this quite well (among many other relevant ideas) and yet the people watching the film are the kids themselves! There is nothing traditionally 'epic' about the edge of seventeen, but yet it is a masterpiece of pure simplicity which is almost impossible to achieve in cinema. Do yourselves a favour - watch this film to learn how youth is developing to apply better parenting at home! Don't bring the kids. 9.5/10",The Edge of Seventeen
127,hthbrr2,2 characters/actors make the movie unbearable,1,26 February 2017,"Those are Blake Jenner who plays the older brother. And the character of Krista. Who cares about her real name, she is a secondary character this film needed. She will go back to the D-list after this.....lolWHY are they still hiring Blake Jenner? I hate him. Let's just get that out of the way. He just looks....off. Maybe since every new actor trying to replace the Glee originals was basically hated. Maybe because he looks deformed, no offence. But mostly since he can't carry a movie. He is meh at best. He failed in Glee, he failed in Everybody Wants Some, and what else did he even do? Does he get hired because he is tall with abs...and the whole Glee singing and dancing thing? Pretty sure there are better looking guys out there that can actually carry and movie, and you know have actual star power.These two ruin this movie for the reason that they are both truly disgusting repulsive characters that are selfish beyond belief. The older brother has been treated better all his life, he turned out better. What a shocker! Then we get turncoat Krista who was BFFs with the main character. But left her in a second for the D....seriously, the scene where the main character learns of her betrayal LITERALLY involves her bothers D. And they later even have a discussion about it.....not even kidding.Just really sick and tired of people BLAMING THE VICTIM. When will it stop!? ""Hey we bullied the heck out of this kid and made his life miserable, why did he snap and kill everyone?"" REALLY? Do these people not hear themselves?I see Nadine as the victim. Played by the lovely and amazingly talented Hailee Steinfeld. I mean wow what a performance! They say she is disagreeable? I wounder why (her life treatment). I mean I was confused who I was supposed to root for. Was I ACTUALLY SUPPOSED to root for the older brother? Who was treated as the golden child? For the supposed BFF who the SECOND she RANDOMLY got a whiff of some D dropped her best friend in a hot minute? Who gets all b!t(#y and judgmental of her and acts all high and mighty as if she is her mother now???? REALLY!?!?!?Just so disgusted by these two characters. If they were TOTALLY cut out of this movie I would have given it 10 stars to be honest. But no it gets 1 since they are in it. Just really hated looking at her former BFFs smug judgmental face. What a b!t(#. Just wow. REALLY filmmakers why did you ruin your movie with these two? I feel like I have to take a shower to clean off the disgust of these two actors/characters. Now the mother of Nadine is also not innocent. But Kyra Sedgwick is such an AMAZING actress, that she adds shades of gray to her character. She makes her character likable. But when you hire Blake Jenner and have a random D-lister try to play characters we are supposedly supposed to root for you eff up the whole thing. They are just jerks, that's it.It's really a shame since Hailee Steinfeld really makes Nadine someone you wanna root for. She is just a girl that wants to be loved, cared for, supported. Is that really bad? Isn't that ALL of us!? I mean really. Why is Nadine of all people painted as the supposed villain? Young and stupid strikes us all. I was so disgusted at how ALL OF A SUDDEN Krista became an adult. Why did she hook up with her BFFs older brother again? Oh yes it was never explained. They need to do a re- edit of this film with NO older brother character or BFF character. Really LOVED Erwin, an adorable character played perfectly by Hayden Szeto. Hell even the guy Nadine liked but turned out to be a 'jerk' (just trying to bang her) was more likable than her older bro and BFF. THAT is how bad those 2 are! OMG I almost forgot Woody Harrelson! At this point this movie stretched the grips of reality that a teacher exists like this. He was a funny character and I loved how he cared so much for Nadine. I mean he could exist, maybe everyone in the school got so used to the way Nadine speaks that they got desensitized? But yeah this movie had lots of good characters, actors, scenes, etc....all over shadowed by the big pile of the steaming dump that is the older brother and the BFF.",The Edge of Seventeen

Some touches of Juno, of Easy A, even The last American Virgin. Not that that matters. It's a feel good movie in the long run. It might be a bit rough around the edges for younger kids, but there's nothing there today's teens aren't exposed to daily. Kudos to the cast for drawing me in with their performances.

132,artmania90,A better film is hard to find. Funny and tragic.,10,16 January 2017,"If I could only shower enough praise on this film I would. I don't think such volumes are possible. Few films I have seen began with more tepid anticipation and finish with such wonder. As the credits rolled I realized I had a wide grin on my face that I wore the entire 90 minutes while watching. Such is the wonder of ""Edge of Seventeen,"" a directorial debut by Kelly Fremon Craig that joins the ranks of ""Juno"" and ""Breakfast Club"" to become a quintessential high school flick. More so than that, this movie rises above the tropes to become something I'm sure many people will be talking about for a while.For such high praise I will tell you that this is a predictable movie. It follows many of the conventions we would come to expect about an awkward girl navigating her Junior year of high school. Our heroine, Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) is an awkward, confrontational girl who has always lived in the shadow of her popular brother, Darian (Blake Jenner, who also starred in ""Everybody Wants Some!"" earlier this year). Her one friend, Krista, is a source of strength throughout her education, and they grow up as the closest friends. One weekend with their mother out of town, Krista and Darian meet up and soon begin dating. Nadine sees this as an ultimatum: her best friend must choose either her or her brother. There can be no compromise. She chooses the boy.What follows is a descent into the awkward stages of high school that so many films in the past have glossed over. In the years before college, social status is what makes or breaks you. If you don't have friends you have nothing, and with Nadine losing all her chips in one fell swoop, she is forced to analyze her life and what little meaning is left in it. Her mother, a control freak with a few shining moments but little knowledge of how to raise a girl, is oftentimes absent and unhelpful in her advice to her young daughter. Her father, who passed away when Nadine was 13, was the one source of solace in her life, and now it would appear that she is unhinged.So begins a fiery relationship with her teacher, Mr Bruner (Woody Harrelson as one of the great teachers in movies). She criticizes his lectures and only seeks to belittle his efforts. Bruner, in turn, dishes it back to Nadine and makes fun of her lack of friends and social status. It's a complicated dynamic that eventually shapes itself into one of respect as Mr Bruner slowly fills that gap left in the absence of her father. Along with the professor, Nadine begins chatting with a classmate, Erwin, who is clearly infatuated with her in the most lovingly-awkward portrayal. Nadine only has eyes for Nick, the hottie rebel who spent time in juvie and works at the local pet store.There is a strong identity I felt with Nadine, a girl who hides behind a rough facade to protect a more fragile heart. Hailee Steinfeld (herself an Oscar nominee for ""True Grit"") hits all the right notes and with any luck would return to the Oscar ceremony for a richly- deserved nomination playing a young girl simply navigating the hardships of maturation. Her delivery of the dialogue presents some of the funniest moments, and her timing is impeccable. Kelly Fremon Craig, a first-time director no less, dazzles with a thought- provoking script that has all the workings and understandings of a tenured filmmaker.There's something very special about ""Edge of Seventeen"" that isn't blatantly apparent when I rethink it. It's a straightforward comedy with the expected rising action, an emotional climax, and a happy ending with a bow on top. Predictable, yes, but boring, not in a million years. I think there is a lot that audiences could identify with, and I'm sure that accounts for it's enormous success among critics and audiences so far. This isn't a story that sugarcoats childhood and youth and makes it something inconsequential. This is a story where we understand the full weight of any given situation and find ourselves utterly invested in the outcome. That's all thanks to a great cast and talented writer/director. What an achievement.",The Edge of Seventeen
133,katiefanatic-791-306918,What 'Lady bird' wanted to be.,8,21 December 2018,"I've spent a lot of time over the years trying to figure out the humor I like and movies like this pin it down for me. I like awkward humor. Nadine is all kinds of awkward and that's what makes her relatable and adorable. You empathize with her and the problems she's going through, and through the eyes of an adult, of course you laugh at how overdramatic she is, but in a FUNNY way. It makes for some comedic relief between her and her teacher delightfully played Woody Harrelson, who just ignores her neuroses. What makes the film a pleasant experience is the way she is played by Hailee Steinfeld. There's a few minutes here and there where they venture into 'I will punch you' category, but nowhere near the insufferable 'lady bird' I had to turn off after ten minutes. Definitely a recommended film for those who empathize with growing pains.",The Edge of Seventeen

135,jackcwelch23,Doesn't hit as hard as it should,7,12 October 2017,"I know most people would have felt sympathy for Nadine. I personally wanted her to follow through with her suicide threats at times. I always struggle to connect with protagonists who hate themselves and actively try to make situations worse by saying the wrong thing. It comes from an attention seeking place and is inherently self absorbed. Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic playing her of course, I don't fault her performance for a second. She was just not much of a character to root for. From what we see Darrian really only insults her after she insults him first, and for the most part just wants to live his life, he isn't a complete alpha male asshole who thrives on power, just a kid who happened to be born good looking and thus got what most of us want, popularity. The movie is good, but not great. It is not as powerful and memorable as recent teen dramas that came out in recent years. It also has clichéd silly music and sitcom moments where it really should have picked a tone and stuck with it. Also Krista's character is woefully underdeveloped. Would have been nice to see a few more scenes where they confide in each other about Nadine's behaviour. Woody Harrelson elevates this from a 6 to a 7 by just being Woody Harrelson.

Some films strive for greatness and fall drastically short under the pressure. Some come out of nowhere, completely surprise and pass the 'greatness' test with flying colours. The Edge of Seventeen falls in the latter category, crafting a touching and poignant coming-of-age comedy-drama that achieves the distinction of standing among the genre's best. Starring Hailee Steinfeld as the film's lead - with a performance that could very easily catapult her into Hollywood stardom - The Edge of Seventeen considers the troubles of growing up in a way that very few writers could get a grip of so well.(...)It may indulge in Hollywood tropes a little too willingly towards the end, but that doesn't stop The Edge of Seventeen from being an absolute gem of a film. It's poignant, honest and authentic, with wonderful work from Steinfeld, Harrelson and Craig in particular, who are central pieces in the brilliant work the film does. It succeeds because of how perceptively it approaches its subject matter, how tenderly it considers its themes and how it touches a nerve with everyone that has ever experienced/is experiencing growing up.

138,phantom_pixie,Unlikable film with an even more unlikable lead,2,5 March 2017,"I gave this movie an extra point for Woody Harrelsson and for the witty dialogue, but besides that, there is absolutely nothing likable about this film.Nadie is a whiny and self-centered young girl, with imaginary problems and self-created drama. Besides this film being obvious and so boring that you sigh out loud several times, there is just nothing redeeming about Nadine. I can see that she has had a rough time in life, but her father's death doesn't seem to disturb her nearly as much as her friend dating her brother. And it kind of leads you to think if this is a movie about mental health issued mistaken for a comedy, because Nadine is just angry and rude. I found it hard rooting for a girl that is just a horrible person.The worst part about this film is the message it sends, ""Your life is worth nothing if you don't have a boyfriend"" because that is what is all comes down to. Krista just like Nadie have a 180 on their personality as soon as they get a steady beau. Then you can be open and social and make new friends, if you are single you are not worth anything and you should just stay in your room and get drunk. Alternatively kill yourself, because loosing a parent is not enough to put you over the edge, but your friend dating, that is want to make you jump in front of a truck.

It is the compelling portrayal of a struggling teen unable to deal with the razor sharp edges of high school life. We see the forces of peer pressure tormenting Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) when her only friend (Haley Lu Richardson) finds a loving relationship with her handsome brother Darian (Blake Jenner) and social acceptance from his group of friends. Darian has his own painful story that neither Nadine nor many of us bother to read because we have already judged that book by its cover. We watch Kyra Sedgwick (Mona) tip the teetering balance between her strengths and weaknesses with a single two letter word and lastly see Woody Harrelson play his typecast role of the older, wiser mentor (Mr. Bruner) to perfection. Harrelson has amassed an impressive body of work ranging from a renegade cop in Rampart to a skilled illusionist in Now You See Me.

I was amazed how Nadine kept doing the dumbest things imaginable over and over again, how many old teenage movies plot tricks there are, how every 'person' in this movie is just a plot device to push the 'story' a bit further, how muddled and awkward this bore fest feels.The only good thing about the movie was in the title of my review. The teacher, played by Woody Harrelson. And by the way, apparently in that school there's only this one guy, because you never see other teachers or our heroine taking some other classes. So our main character is constantly coming to him to throw up her verbal diarrhea about her miserable life and the guy wants to help her, but she doesn't listen, because she's just sad, annoying brat with mental problems.Few words about R rating. There are 2 categories of R rated movies. The ones that feel natural, where violence and profanity feels like an integral part of a story (Tarantino and Scorsese movies for example) and movies like Edge of Seventeen in which characters just swear a lot. It comes out as fake and forced and it doesn't impress me in the least.SPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING The ending is just laughably bad. The change of Nadine's character is one of the most unconvincing in movie history. She just magically turns 180 degrees overnight. Angst is gone, problems don't matter anymore, she's just happy person all of the sudden! She even starts dating this talentless, rich, clearly retarded (can't even construct a proper sentence) Asian guy that was hitting on her for the entire run time of a movie and everything's fine now, happiness is all around, so hooray. I guess.END OF SPOILERS So yea, The Edge of seventeen. A movie about loud, aggressive girl with imaginary problems and poor Woody Harrelson plopped as a cherry on top of a crap cake.2/10, terrible movie.",The Edge of Seventeen

156,nikhilmanahs,Seems forced and dull,5,18 February 2017,"I am a big fan of coming-of-age stories, have seen almost all of them. So was naturally inclined to see this one. But this one falls way short of making an actual impact such story can make. First of all the protagonist 'Nadine', comes out to be not so real and one who lacks depth. I found it very hard to build a connection with her and was never able to even sympathize. She's so pretty why wouldn't the boys want to hang out with her? Maybe it was a case poor casting ? Other supporting characters also let down with caricature mom and similar brother. Her best friend is also depicted as a boring cardboard character. Humans even adolescents are much are complex and nuanced than that. Also there isn't much action going on in the film and most of them seem out of place. Nothing much exciting or unpredictable happens in the film. It feels like forced entertainment, which is produced only because such movies mostly go down well with the audience. But sorry not this one. I should go back to watch Rushmore or 400 blows or Breakfast Club.",The Edge of Seventeen
157,silverpinkcity,A fun (and funny) coming-of-age movie for any age!,9,15 June 2021,"First of all, I love this movie! (I guess that's obvious from the nine stars I gave it). I may not be the ""target audience,"" but so what? I can appreciate good writing.This movie is almost as good as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Breakfast Club...two of the all-time best coming-of-age movies, since (like those) Edge of Seventeen combines both depth AND humor....plus great character development. It also has narration, which I really appreciate since it offers us viewers a glimpse as to what's going on in the main character's head.In the movie, Nadine is an awkward seventeen year old girl who has ONE best friend...a best friend who starts dating Nadine's popular brother, which then causes all sorts of problems.That's the basic plot, but there's also Nadine's awkwardness (combined with her extreme intelligence and wisdom beyond her years) creating other interesting (and strangely amusing) situations. Like the ""hot"" guy Nadine has a crush on, and how she flirts with him in the pet store where he works...plus Nadine's difficult relationship with her mom...along with the friendship she has with her sort of odd teacher (played by Woody Harrelson), and the burgeoning relationship she develops with the nice (sort of nerdy) guy.This movie is fresh and unique...many of the lines hit the mark, making you laugh out loud. That goes back to the excellent writing, as opposed to the usual ""formulaic and dull"" writing we run into these days. Excellent directing, too, we could add.The acting is amazing, as well. Hailee S. As Nadine is so authentic....so fantastic in this role, you honestly believe the character is the real deal. Even though the actress herself is so attractive it's hard to believe she would ever be such an outcast. However...the fact she pulls this off, says a lot about her acting abilities.I think this movie works because of the awkwardness of the main character. Most people can relate to this...how difficult it is to be that age. Also, the character is loaded with personality; and I need that, or I tend to get bored. The ending is a bit trite, but that's okay. You won't be disappointed. It'll just make you feel good.Why didn't I give the movie ten stars? Well...there's some crude stuff in there that probably isn't necessary. Just saying. I also wonder about a student being THAT friendly with a teacher. I mean, maybe some firmer lines should be set between teacher and student. They aren't meant to be ""buddies,"" after all.Not that there's anything gross or sexual going on between them, it's just.... I don't know. It seemed a little weird.Then again, the whole movie is a little weird, and maybe that's why I like it so much! Normal is boring. Weird and awkward is and always better.",The Edge of Seventeen

At times, these interactions are difficult to watch – whether this be through an innate sense of impending dread or simply via anticipating a character's next self-destructive life choice (a plot device the film plays with extremely well through it's use of physical imagery and representation: deleting draft texts; the camera movement to show a character's continually shifting viewpoint; etc.) – but it is difficult not to swell at the sight of character's fulfilling their respective arcs on-screen.

God i love him and love their teacher-student relationship, with their witty conversationsSteinfeld did an amazing job portraying struggling-teen Nadine. Being a teenager is all about being overdramatic and insecure, which usually turn to self loathing on daily basis. These are pretty much what drive sarcastic Nadine to act the way she is in the movie. Sometimes you root for her, but other times you feel like you wanna pull her hair just to make her come to her senses.

And I think that mainly comes down to how well done its characters are. Hailee Steinfeld is nothing short of amazing, and her simple conversation with her brother (played by Blake Jenner) towards the end is somehow the film's highlight. To say it's a comedy is a bit much, but it does have a lot of funny lines, most delivered by Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson) or Erwin Kim (Hayden Szeto). This is almost my favorite movie, and though it's certainly not going to appeal to everyone, I can't recommend this simple movie enough.",The Edge of Seventeen
167,heartcore9,For John Hughes Lovers,9,25 April 2018,"This was such a sweet, funny movie. It's very reminiscent of a John Hughes type of film, a film that's great for teenagers and adults. Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic as a teenager dealing with loneliness, social awkwardness, and buried grief. As often is the case in teen movies, her main parental figure (her mother) is a bit of a ridiculous mess, so she turns to her teacher played by Woody Harrelson, who's also great in his role. This story manages to address family issues at home, dating woes, friendship conflict, jealousy, and more. It walks the line between drama and comedy, serving up some very touching moments AND some big laughs. That's a tricky balance to achieve and this film succeeds with flying colors.",The Edge of Seventeen

I am mainly a thriller or drama fan.I finally decided to see it after more clips with Woody Harrelson and Hailee Steinfeld. This film captures a family tragedy, a young woman growing into adulthood and all the details in between. How many times can one laugh and have happy or sad tears all at the same time in one movie? Over and over is the answer, for this movie. I was glued to the screen and it could have been longer, I would not have minded. The soundtrack is is just icing on a perfectly layered cake.The ending was GREAT, have no idea why some posters were unhappy with it. I imagine there is a ton on the cutting room floor I want a peek at. The acting and pacing is perfect. The comedy, both obvious and understated is genius. One of Woody Harrelson's best performances. Animation fans will get a little treat, as well.Hayden Szeto is a breath of fresh air. This movie is a perfect 10. I am sure that movies more epic in scope and historical will be up for Oscars, but it would be a great shame if this one was looked over.It's been said by at least one critic, but John Hughes would have indeed been proud.",The Edge of Seventeen
169,nhojnivra,One of the best coming-of-age film ever made.,9,13 March 2017,"One of the best coming-of-age film ever made. The Edge Of Seventeen is just the typical coping-up-with-teenage-problems story, however, it is the movie's wit and edgy humor partnered by Nadine's rough, spoiled-brat, stubbornly and a total out-of-control attitude that brings life to its piece.This, I consider is one of Steinfeld's best performances as an actress, with her natural charm and skills she, indeed, deliver her role amazingly, where it seems that Nadine is Hailee and Hailee is Nadine. I like her scenes where she's being stubborn with her mom (Kyra Sedgwick) and older brother (Blake Jenner), its looks natural, no joke, seems like Hailee is born to be a rebel kid.Not just Steinfeld, but also Hayden Szeto's, and their awkward friend-to-lovers story. Erwin's (Szeto) sheepish and nerdy attitude blends well with a hard-headed girl like Nadine.This is Kelly Fremon Craig's directoral debut and she already made a marvelous job in this likable teenage-comedy-drama, where only a few can actually interpret a teenage angst on-screen, some of them are just focusing on building up a love story between their characters, whereas, Edge Of Seventeen created a wall so they can stick with their agenda, to relay the events that's happening to teenagers, in a way that parents would understand.The Edge Of Seventeen tells about a girl, named Nadine, whose at a very young age is a total mulish up until she reached her teenage years. Then one night made the worst ever worse, she saw her older brother hooking up with her bestfriend, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), which ruined their year-long friendship. Despite not having much of friends she's still her teacher's, Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson), favorite student, who, also served as her personal adviser.

I may not even have bothered with it at all if my curiosity wasn't drawn by some of the reviews saying how the central performance elevates it above most teen movies. They were not wrong - I was absolutely blown away by Hailee Steinfeld's confidence, charm and nuance in this role. She brings such life to it! I laughed, I cried, I recognised my teenage self in it; this is a really strong turn by someone so young and now I'm really excited to see what path she takes in the coming years. Very, very impressed.The script here isn't bad either, by the way. Very honest and unafraid, also funny. Woody Harellson plays a decent supporting role too as the teacher.

174,danjamz,Great dialogue in a flawed movie about a very aggressive girl,3,21 January 2017,"Here's the thing, this movie paints a very authentic portrayal as life as a teenager, and the dialogue is fantastically well written, being funny, cutting and emphatic. The problem is the main character quite literally creates almost all her own drama and problems through being aggressive to everyone around her, and then does it again, again and again.It's not the teenage angst or the introverted awkwardness (both of which she has in spades and which are reasonable character traits for her to have), it's the fact that she consistently verbal attacks her friend & family, especially when they are trying to apologise or reason with her kindly; and this aggression is often the only thing driving the story. I guess that could be considered perfectly realistic, but it makes everything in the movie so predictable and hard to feel much sympathy for her.(SPOILERS) Unsurprisingly life gets consistently worse and worse for her and if you stop the movie when she goes to bed five minutes before the end, the main character is exactly the same as at the beginning: selfish, aggressive and with no confidence (so zero character development there). Lo and behold she wakes up a completely different person: confident, polite and kind to all around her - an utterly unbelievable and unrealistic transformation, literally overnight.So I'd have to say it's a mostly fun movie, with well written dialogue, but a repetitive story and a sloppy tacked-on ending.",The Edge of Seventeen

The supporting cast are all solid and Hayden Szeto is adorable as the atrocious useless flirt who crushes on Nadine but who she sees as more of a cute puppy dog friend than a boyfriend, but of course you know how its going to pan out. But its the clever way it leads to the obvious end point, and the interactions of Nadine and her family and friends along the way that raise this above the crowd.

And you know that other thing where you wonder if the world of reviewers and movie watchers that leave reviews were all on drugs or drunk or distracted or didn't watch the movie but gave a review for some reason or another while thinking ""hey, people say it is good"" and ""hey, why don't I compliment it in the same way others have"" and then they write their pretentious dribble about what is basically a second-rate after school special from back in the day in America when networks would make those corny ""life lessons for teens"" melodramas which had nothing of any value in them but showcased young pretty people in the hopes of getting ratings from teens and tween girls who just got home from school and didn't want to watch talk shows or game shows and were bored wit nothing to do?

I loved that her awkwardness wasn't played off as cute adorable rambling like they usually do in films. I felt like the awkward things she said or did were really accurate. My heart was breaking for Nadine as you watch her make mistake after mistake because she just can't seem to understand how to handle the problems in her life. This is truly a coming of age story but one that actually delves into mental illness without making it a major part of the film. She is clearly suffering from anxiety and depression from the passing of her father and can't seem to work through it on her own.

Well, no... this is an excellent film for even, yes, 'old' people like me!What I really liked about it is that the main character Nadine (played by an excellent Ms Steinfeld) is basically, a dickhead (someone even plays a little tune that says as much to her at one point!)... she's arrogant, constantly on the defensive, thinks the whole world is bullying her... when, in actual fact, she is treating people in the exact opposite of the way she would like to be treated herself. Yet still you feel for her... she's a messed up kid doing her best and making wrong decisions all the time. Well, that sounds like me in my teenage years! ;o)The supporting cast are great as well...

I think it makes the movie more than other teen movies, but at the same time is a coming age story too. Hailee Steinfeld is wonderful in this film. We find the the usually teen movie elements like: mother-daughter conflict and drama, best friend(here the movie give you more the average teen movie, this is one of the best parts of the movie), an annoying brother, trouble in school( nobody likes you), a guy who the girl like, but not the right one and the guy who the girl like, but not that way, like the guy, and the end she finds out he is the right one. We must say something about the characters, in this movie I find the most too irritating character I ever see in a teen movie: The brother, Darian. He is the worst brother, whom you wish yourself. He is selfish, self- conceited, and the best he sleeps you best friend and after they ask what is your problem with that??? He thinks why should bother you I ruin your relationship with your best friend, I didn't - he said. You did. I just slept with her and after that, I start date with her. I can't understand you. Best friend, Krista. She is a betrayer. She won't think she ruins, his relationship with Nadin. She asked why don't you happy when I am happy because I find a boyfriend myself? Aw, your brother is, but doesn't matter. After that she won't understand why Nadin said: I never want to see you again!!! I think this too characters forgot the number one rule, about relationships: Never dating your best friend brother/sister or never date your sister/brother best friend. Or this is my own number one rule??? And everybody okay with that???? Of course, you can do if want to ruin one of or both relations or if you have a strong and broadminded relationship with both. The mother, she is selfish too, she thinks she has one and only perfect child, not a very strong person. The movie is good, but you see above has some very annoying character. You definitely watch the movie, probably you won't find this to characters annoying. A scene that doesn't work in the film: After Nadin and Darian fight, and Nadin go home and apologies to Darian, and the hug each other, this scene just doesn't work. Nothing truthfulness in here. The brother starts, but this scene seems very fake. I thought when I am seeing the makers just put here because we want to solve the brother-sister conflict problem because the genre and the positive ending is necessitating, but I think it is pointless. Reason one: the qualities of the characters won't allow us a scene like that. Reason two: the whole scene seems fake because of the reason one.",The Edge of Seventeen
181,diegojosmer,So Relatable,9,21 December 2018,"The Edge of Seventeen is a movie I stumbled upon. I did not know what to watch next and saw this movie available to stream. Once I started watching I absolutely fell in love with this movie. It's a coming of age story that could not be more real about the life of a teenager. The movie is awkward, funny, sad, frustrating, and emotional, and that's exactly what being a teenager is. Hailee Steinfeld perfectly plays a character that I've seen has been labeled unlikable. I read other reviews and some just say that ""she is unlikeable and thinks she's way hotter and funnier than she really is."" And that's absolutely right, her character, Nadine spends most of the movie not knowing why she feels so frustrated. She just is. And me being a teenager myself I know that is absolutely accurate. Sometimes I just feel angry because I do, and sometimes I'm really anxious and awkward without wanting to. This is the first movie in which I have really seen myself reflected onscreen. The main character is a teenage girl, but this movie is so greatly written that it isn't only relatable to girls but to all teenagers in general like it happened to me being a guy. The whole arc the character goes through is not about her changing everything about herself, but about recognizing that everyone has problems and everyone feels all of those emotions she feels. The dialogue was perfectly written, it reflected everything about being this age. The performances were amazing, Hailee Steinfeld is a really talented actress.
I was genuinely surprised about how great this movie was. It's such a relatable and heartwarming story that at times may feel a little irritable or all over the place, but that's just what being a teen is.",The Edge of Seventeen

It was better. This movie showed an average girl have a whole life turned on its side and showed her try to go on with her life from there the best way she could and was capable of. I cried throughout the movie, being able to relate to some of the issues she was going through as well as the feelings she portrayed. Honestly can't this was one of the best movies I've watched so far and is in a level of it's own when it comes to normalising issues teenagers and young adults go through, instead of glorifying or simply trying to eradicate the issue as a whole.

187,malseeds,Great potential but an awful ending,3,27 February 2019,"The first 3/4 of the movie are completely enthralling, there's no doubt about that. It's a whirlwind of events and life's curveballs, conflict that only gets worse and messier as the plot goes on, all building to the climax, which is meant to be the protagonist's catharsis.So then why is Nadine, the one who has been beaten down the most without remorse, the only one apologizing at the end? The brother who treats her like garbage and says unforgivable things makes no effort at an apology, instead his only resolution is a single hug he gives her when he accepts her apology *for her entire life*. And the mother who has emotionally abused her for as long as she can remember? Well her non-apology comes in the form of deleting an angry text she's about to send, instead simply letting her be.And then there's the lifelong friend who betrayed her trust in the first place. What does she do, other than deny any responsibility for abandoning a friend in an unfamiliar atmosphere at the party when she's supposed to be trying to make amends for screwing Nadine's brother? No really, I'd like to know, because that's the last meaningful interaction they have. Nadine gets ditched, and when she holds Krista accountable all she says is that's not what happened. The next interaction they have is in the last minutes of the movie, and it's as emotionless and simple as just accepting that they're maybe talking again.The only person who makes any progress in the entire movie is Nadine, and nobody else is held accountable at all. It's nice in the sense of yay the movie ends on a good note for her, but the character is left with a still toxic family who accept her apology and offer none of their own, which isn't exactly inspiring for any imagined epilogue.",The Edge of Seventeen

Idk why I wrote it so long lol but I have a lot to say.Teens of all age might experience the situation of awkwardness in the party, loneliness during luncheon time, feeling so damn lost and self-abased in some ways, or even hated ourselves from the bottom of our hearts, not to mention expecting others to like us. Somebody's attentiveness is luxurious to us.
And sure I did.
Like Nadine hate what she saw, how she's acting, the way she sounds when she's like floating outside of her body and looking down on herself. The inferiority swallows us, swallows rest of a bit confidence and dignity till we build up a tough wall against others.
Up to someday, there is a one who genuinely cherish you, love you and find out your special. Then the sincerity finally let down our guard so that we can finally get our reliefs.
It's not telling us do not break the hearts of those who's totally snowflakes, easily to get hurt and over sensitive. Instead, we should have greater empathy with others, because everyone has story.One of the impressive scene that Nadine's moms said: Here's what I do when I'm feeling down. I get very quiet and very still. And I said to myself "" Everyone in the world is as miserable and empty as I am."" ""They're just better at pretending."" I just deem it really helpful to me though.Although the most touching scene is the hugging scene Nadine and her brother did, I still especially loved the swimming pool scene in Erwin's house. They are sooo good together and Haley looks insanely pretty in that scene.
It's about growing, understanding, and empathizing. Highly recommended. Btw I need an Erwin in my life.",The Edge of Seventeen
189,zonkerjohn,cute to an extent but had many flaws,2,14 April 2017,"OK, first the good. it was a cute story with charming actors and it kept your attention. Woody Harrelson did a good job as the teacher, and had some witty lines. The not so good. I thought her acting was poor. I looked at many other reviews, (most of the bad ones) and nobody mentioned her acting. I am no expert, but it just seemed to me that at various times she was TRYING to act. almost as if she was playing a parody of herself. That is fine if the movie is supposed to be a parody. I thought the same thing could be said about Teresa Palmer in'the Choice'. but if you are good looking, and/or in the case of Steinfelds case have a movie under your belt (True Grit), you can get away with anything, and more so when people expect you to be good, they see only the good. the movie also did a poor job of really zoning in on the true issues that face most teenagers. the potential was there for a good movie, but it really was not brought home.",The Edge of Seventeen
190,sssachin26,Kind of expected more from it.,6,2 February 2017,"After watching the trailer, it creates an idea of how good this film could turn out but when you finish watching the film, you realise you've finished watching almost 90% of the movie with the trailer. It feels like whatever they showed you inside the trailer, just picture all that with some filler scenes in it and the film is complete. The initial ratings of this movie are alluring but it certainly disappoints. I think the concept of the film isn't something new. But I genuinely expected more turnouts from it. The end feels incomplete, the climax isn't something you won't expect. In the end, I think I'll prefer 'Kings of Summer' or even 'The Way Way Back'",The Edge of Seventeen

WTF bro ? Can you explain how did you end up with Nadine feeling sorry and apologising to her brother for being mad at him for f*cking her best friend ?How is this acceptable ? Why should Nadine feel happy and ""okay"" after she practically lost her only friend to her brother ? Because when her friend got in a relationship with her brother we clearly see her overcommitting to her new boyfriend and leaving Nadine behind. How is that okay ? How is that something that nadine should accept and embrace ?Her brother obviously doesn't care about hurting her feelings, her mother do no understand or support her and on top of that she insults nadine by telling her that her father wouldn't be proud the way she turned out. And after all this cr*p the movie throws at the protagonist, she makes her look like this rebellious teenager that she is mad for no reason at the very end of the movie.Good job movie. Good job .",The Edge of Seventeen
194,Jessicat66,An emotional rollercoaster for loners of any age,9,28 June 2018,"Though this film fits the coming of age genre the struggles that Nadine, the main character, is going through are not purely 'teen problems', As a 20 something year old this film deeply resonated with me and though similar to Nadine I was a socially awkward, defensive and pessimistic teenager it wasn't just the teenage me who could find the character relatable. I've noticed in the low rated comments one of the main reasons people didn't like the film is because the main character isn't likeable. And though I loved the film, I would agree; she isn't likeable. And the film is more realistic and better off for it. In real life we aren't always likeable people ourselves and the film almost acts as a tool to allow us to step back and really look at our current or teenage selves. Nadine does realise and understand towards the end and throughout the film her erratic and selfish behaviour is a result of her self loathing because she knows she doesn't want to continue being that way but she's stuck in this endless cycle and doesn't know how to get out. The valuable lesson from the film and her journey within it is that we often bring misfortune and unhappiness on ourselves in the way we handle and respond to bad things in our lives. I think this film will speak to anyone who has felt alone in the world, lost without purpose or anywhere to fit in. If you like films about people rather than action and you watch a film to be taken on a journey (albeit an emotional one) rather than to have an enjoyable couple of hours then this may be the film for you. It helps that is has an excellent cast, each actor fitting their roles well and bringing them to life.Another positive note I took away from the film is the way it handles and represents mental illness/ distress as it does so without labels and in a subtle way without needing to bring it to the forefront.",The Edge of Seventeen

197,elijahpitts-09626,"one of the best directed and acted ""comeing of age"" movies ever.",8,3 June 2019,"The edge of seventeen is a surprisingly thoughtful movie that feels all to real to a real high school experience. Hailee Steinfeld acts as a perfectly balanced and relatable Nadine. Nadine's arc in the film is one of the best I've ever seen in a teen drama movie. She starts out as a self absorbed teen that has a awful life, she starts out by thinking she is the only person that goes through rough times but has a come around and eventually relies that life is good. her whole arc is super realistic and relatable to a lot of us. Woody Harrelson acts as Nadine's mentor throughout the movie and is the tipping point for her realization that life is not all that it seems. Haley Lu Richardson playing Nadine's bestfriend and Blake Jenner playing Nadine's brother Darion, both having great arcs and played very believable by the actors. Overall The Edge of Seventeen surprised me with how smart the comedy was and how great all the actors did, which it not common in this genre. This movie helps cement to me that Hailee Steinfeld is one of the best up incoming actresses and I'm excited to see what Kelly Fremon Craig directs next.",The Edge of Seventeen
198,markaaron-97974,Exploits then trivializes serious mental disorders,1,22 April 2018,"Nadine is the kind of ""unlikable"" character that critics love (her mother is a close second). It means that this is serious cinema that challenges you because it's so unpleasant to watch (wanting to watch something enjoyable is so plebeian.).She's abrasive, rude, obnoxious, unstable, attention-seeking and indulges in dangerous, even life-threatening behavior. Some might even call her toxic. OK, so far so good. Handled skillfully this could be the making of a compelling film, but the filmmaker also wants John Hughes style cuteness to leaven the harshness (and perhaps increase the box office). It doesn't work.Nadine lives in a world of teenage suburban privilege--great schools, stylish homes with pools, all the electronics a kid could want--,but lacks the one thing she desperately needs: a complete neuropsychiatric work-up.That no one around her sees the seriousness of her mental condition and gets her the professional help she desperately needs is the real story here. But that wouldn't allow for the John Hughes style ending.Personality disorders are no laughing matter and aren't solved by clever plot points.",The Edge of Seventeen

Lets see, ""Growing up is hard"" and for most parts of Nadines life I agree, bullied and losing your dad is hard. But what for some reason takes the cake is when her friend starts dating her brother. We already know That Nadine is whiny, selfish and annoying, but she just takes it to a whole new level. Not able to act like a normal human being... Until she gets a boyfriend her self. Both Krista and Nadie are the kind of girls that have no life, no personality or anything going for them until they get a man by their side. After that life is peachy, such a great story for young girls. You don't need friends, you don't need friendship, what you need is a man on your arm, and life will sparkle. Your other alternative is to claim that you will kill yourself as the drama queen you are. Besides this movie is formulaic and obvious, I seldom watch movies where I hope the main character will jump in front of a U-Haul.

Kyra Sedgwick nails the role of the lost mother of the brother and sister pair who can't quite seem to get her own crap together. The actors who play the brother and sister pair are spot on playing the awkward, trying to get through life kids! The performances felt real and you watched this cute quirky girl go through the hell of fitting in when it seems your world is falling apart around you! I really thought it was a great reminder of how tough it was to be so unsure of yourself, to care so much what your peers think of you while trying so hard to create the ""you"" that you want to be!

I'm really trying to like it, as so many of the reviewers do. They say it's a coming of age story about an awkward girl trying to navigate high school, and it's so honest and real, etc. But this girl isn't just awkward. She is seriously in need of help. She has had only one friend in her whole childhood and a great relationship with her dad. But had he lived longer, would he have seen what was happening? Nadine is seriously depressed, anxious, socially awkward, and hates herself. The mother is useless and never realizes that her daughter needs counseling..
I know it's just a movie, but I'm very aware of the warning signs of mental illness. The writers and producers, however, don't seem to. As in all movies, I'm sure there will be a quick and happy ending. Can't wait to see it. But in real life It's not so easy.

She in my opinion is the one who deserved this be said about her acting in this movie; if anyone can steal greatness in cinematic acting from from all the combined and various movie performances of Meryl Streep, Jody Foster, and Sally Field, altogether, Hailee Steinfeld did it in one performance in one movie of one hour and fourty-five minutes, which is shorter than other movies that allow more time for the acting to shine.

I think a lot of people probably questioned Nadine's relationship with her teacher (Woody Harrelson), about whether it crosses any lines and I definitely don't think so, there seemed to be a real bond of friendship there as well.

Here the focus is honed in on a person with an outsider's sense of not belonging, and yet clearly painted as someone with a distinct and agile personality.

The main character, Nadine, seems to be struggling as a child and during adolescence. The story of Nadine and her best friend was presented pretty well. However, Nadine's brother character, who is very important, doesn't seem really genuine, it's confusing and not deeply enough explained. On the other hand, the context of some important events of this movie is not clear enough. (Don't want to mention which ones, to avoid adding spoilers.)The film portrays very well the downsides of being a teenager. Friendships, family, relationships' problems... Dissatisfaction with misgivings of life. At the end, I must say that the movie was quite boring because most of the time nothing happens.

A true story about a 17 year old high girl as a school junior who feels more alone than ever in her life. This movie is passionately. Hailee Steinfeld did a good fabulous job as Nadine. Her performance is really inspired with some energy to it. For example, Nadine felt aghast when this guy Nick tried to kiss her, but her couldn't let him to touch her ""You-Know-What"", gets out of his car and cries her tears. Like me, I felt more aghast than Nadine. I know there are some depressing scenes like I was talking about. But I think it is the truly real-life and coming-of-age story.

It is great fun!There are fantastic jokes and fantastic surprises.  The story is of a girl who desires foolish and unnecessary things and is upset when she is not given them, although some of them do not affect her and others she is not sure if she wants anyway.  Along the way, her mom also acts like a very unhelpful idiot.  The sane and responsible people are her brother and the girl who becomes the girlfriend of her brother, and this also upsets our lead character named Nadine.Included in the movie there are times Nadine is dressed in a pretty way in her skirt and stockings.  I am not sure if the girls in high school actually wear ""stockings"" as much as does Nadine, but they are fun to see.In the last fifth of the movie, she learns some maturity and finds peace and happiness. The first four fifth are a comedy of errors!The movie is rated R, but I think that is not a reasonable rating.  The film conveys the idea of sex a few times, but it is not even close to depicting sex or nudity.

It doesn't actually bother solving even a single one. Some issues include Nadine and her mother's broken relationship, her mother's habit of being a damsel in distress, Nadine's depression, etc.The film has Nadine, a girl on the edge of seventeen, have her bestie ""betray"" her by sleeping with her brother. She also had her dad die when she was 13, coz of reasons unspecified. So, basically, we get to watch her teenage angst and a bunch of crazy stuff happen to her for the entirety of the film spare the last few minutes ,where, with a little heart to heart with her bro, in which she tells him what we have been hearing for the entire duration of the film (she thinks she sucks.) , something her brother knew all too well ,and, bloop! Everything is fixed. The sun is shining, she is prettier, her mom's sweet and she has a boyfriend who's rich and popular, blah, blah, blah. You get it.Since the entire thing feels nothing more than a waste of time and energy, the entire support cast seems unnecessary, the stupidest been the teacher, though his filler jokes are the only thing the that helped me get through the damn thing. Well, those and Blake Jenner's cute looks. Sigh...Though, it does do one thing right: portray the teenage angst properly.While Hailee Steinfield did a great job, the five feet apart actress did awful.

Edge of seventeen is more than just your average, witty dramedy. This movie is charming from beginning to end with so many dense, intricate characters that no matter who you are, you'll find someone to relate to. This smart yet hilarious story follows Nadine, an awkward, confused, and lost teenage girl whose life seems to only spiral further out of control after the death of one of her only true friends, her father.Nadine manages to get by in life with her best, and only, friend Krista. Her brother, Darian, is an outgoing, self-centered jock who naturally excels in life. The polar opposite of Nadine. Their mother,Mona, a similarly self-centered woman, who seems to focus all of her attention on her son. This causes lots of tension between Nadine and her mother. Even in the moments that they are getting along, Mona abruptly centers the conversation on herself. After Darian sleeps with Krista and decides to start dating her, Nadine cuts off all ties with her best friend and becomes more lonely than she has ever been before in her life.Edge of Seventeen is fantastic in the sense that anyone, girl or boy, can relate to a lonely, helpless character like Nadine. This movie delivers powerful performances all around, especially Nadine, played by Hailee Steinfeld. The plot never seems to never have a slow moment which is surprising for a movie of this genre. The ball gets rolling at the beginning of the movie and only picks up momentum right through to the end. The humour is sprinkled over the tense story perfectly and acts as just the right amount of comic relief. Woody Harrelson's character as Mr. Bruner,while it may be a shorter role, is hilariously bold and well performed. The connection between his character and Steinfeld's is very fun to watch. I found this movie to be quite similar to Easy A, another teenage dramedy/comedy hit. Don't underestimate this movie by any means. I really enjoyed Edge of Seventeen for its clever humour, bold story, and outstandingly relatable performances.",The Edge of Seventeen

I completely missed this film in 2016 and just watched it in 2018. I might have never seen this movie if my friend hadn't mention it and boy was I surprised. When you have overdone cliched teen movies for decades and had completely lost faith in the genre, The Edge of Seventeen was a breath of fresh air. It was fun and charming. Beautifully done cinematography, brilliant set of cast, a strong story and a very well executed film this was. This film really left me with an heartwarming experience. I don't remember the last time I really laughed out loud to a movie and at the same time cared for a character as much.For all of you who are tired of superhero flicks, this will be refreshing watch.

232,dianebrauch,Excellent script. Outstanding acting.,9,1 December 2016,"Hailee Steinfeld is someone to watch for. I think this was Oscar quality acting. Woody Harrelson was charming in a small role. The writing was unique and original. Every time you were sure what would happen, it didn't, and a whole new twist was created. There was only one weak spot for me, when she met the bad boy, but we needed a villain to keep the movie rolling so it did it's job. Steinfeld's character was charming, confused, but underneath it all mature with great common sense. Lots of humor that generally came as a surprise. Showing teenagers as thinking beings was an interesting take as well. It doesn't happen in too many of the movies. Kyra Sedgwick played an excellent single mother of two teenagers - angst and understanding at the same time. She was never a cardboard cutout which you could either love or dislike. You had to do both at different times.",The Edge of Seventeen

The movie is well made, the story might be a little bit foreseeable, but it is in most ""teenage movies"", but the main character is so difficult to relate to, it's horrible. Every other character is more likable, it somehow hurts to watch and ruins the whole movie. The teacher played by Woody Harrelson is great and that's what earned the three points. You somehow want to make it stop, but still obviously due to some masochistic tendencies we endured it till the end.

These are the pessimists and old souls under us.
If you're in the last group, you will relate to the character Nadine who is played by Hailee Steinfeld. The movie is about a teenager struggling being a teenager.And it's ok. We've all come to the point where our pessimistic side is stronger than our optimistic side. But what makes this movie so great, is that we can relate to it much more than we think we would do.

If it weren't for her acting performances, the whole story deserves 1 star. Kyra Sedgwick (the mom) and Woody Harrelson (the teacher) totally compliment the great performances that Hailee Steinfeld presented, in my opinion the interaction between Nadine and her mom, and Nadine with her teacher was well done, presenting the issue that Nadine was going through as a teen. However, Krista (played by Haley Lu Richardson) was not even serious in her acting, I can't help but to see every interaction that she do was trying ""not to laugh or smile"" even when the scene is supposed to be a serious one. It was cringe-worthy to look at Haley Lu Richardson's acting skill in this movie, such a bad acting. Overall, Hailee Steinfeld, Kyra Sedgwick and Woody Harrelson saved the movie from being a total garbage. I rate this 5 because of these 3 great characters' performances.",The Edge of Seventeen
237,kaliahdickens,Great Movie!,10,9 February 2017,"The Edge of Seventeen is one of a kind, at least in the recent years. Personally, I feel it's one of the first movies I've ever seen that actually conveys what it's like to be a teenager. Unlike other coming-of-age movies, the Edge of Seventeen is realistic. It doesn't show a conventionally beautiful girl and her minor struggles and thirst for popularity which she will almost always get in the end. It shows you that you aren't always going to end up with the popular kids or win the boy of your dreams. Coming from someone who is seventeen Hailee Steinfeld's performance as the 17-year- old, antisocial, angsty, and slightly over-dramatic Nadine is completely accurate. Some might argue that Nadine's over the top reactions to her self- made conflict isn't realistic at all. But isn't that what being a teenager is about? Overreacting? Blowing things out of proportion? And I think this movie portrayed that perfectly. Steinfeld's performance isn't the only thing that deserves praise. Woody Harrelson as Nadine's unprofessionally rude English teacher, Mr. Brunner, is what I think ties the entire movie together. Nadine and Mr. Brunner's sweet but comedic relationship adds a little heart to an otherwise depressing movie. Without this humor, it would just be Nadine's dysfunctional life, and us watching as she stumbles through it. What I think makes this movie so great is that the things Nadine wants at the beginning isn't what she gets at the end and I feel that that's a very important message that needed to be told and The Edge of Seventeen did that flawlessly. Not once did it ever feel cheesy or did the dialogue feel out of place. This movie showed what it's really like to be an awkward seventeen-year-old.",The Edge of Seventeen

She makes bad decisions, gives an ultimatum to her one and only friend, treats her family like dog poop and then expects everyone to feel sorry for her.I will say that Hailee Steinfeld is a great actress because I truly believed that her character was this bratty girl.

252,SkyDeshpande,"Certainly beautiful, but not the best!",6,16 May 2017,"'There's nothing for an introvert to find someone like them to share the loneliness with.' I don't remember if I have read it somewhere or my mind just made it up after watching this film; but that's what I felt after watching it. The plot is nothing much complex. The film is about a girl, Nadine, who had difficulty to connect with anyone and was jealous of her brother who was always confident and better at communicating with most of the people. So, she used to be alone. When she finds a friend- Kyra- a loner like her, with whom she easily connected; they shared the most awkward things with one another. But things change when they grow up. That friend starts dating her elder brother and it becomes even more unbearable for her. What I loved the most about this film is, it didn't try to justify how some character was morally right or wrong; when there were so many chances to do so. Just for creating sympathy, Nadine was not shown as the sanest person or other characters like her friend or brother unjust. She was still the stubborn, vulnerable teenager. She was not insane. She was just what she was. Woody Harrelson was flawless for sure. Even after seeing only little of his work before, I was quite impressed. But, Hailee was something else! She was totally in the character's skin. This film made me instant fan of her. She said every dialogue as it was meant for her. But it was the moments in between where she really shows her shine. Whether it was the scene where she was left alone when Kyra went to talk with others or while she was at her teacher's house, looking at other side of his personality; she nailed it! As I said, this was so relatable to introverts. Maybe that's why I liked it more than I needed to!",The Edge of Seventeen

The emotions and experiences the film conveys do not feel artificial, and Hailee Steinfeld shines! Intelligent writing and little twists here and there will likely leave you genuinely invested in the life of these characters and leave you wanting more. Woody Harrelson plays a wonderful image of a teacher dealing with his life amidst high school drama and Kyra Sedgwick's performance as a struggling mother was especially heart felt and real.

In the mean time, she is obsessed by this rebel senior year boy, ignoring the interest of one of her classmate.The film starts with Nadine rushing yo confess to her favorite professor that she is done with her life. As a classic narrative structure , the film goes backwards to explain the current situation. It adds also a couple of flashbacks about Nadine's childhood in order to built the character. Otherwise, the plot is not very original but works well to deliver its message, even of the character development is a bit too predictable.On the technical aspect, there is not major problem in the editing or directing choices apart maybe for the numerous text messages' scenes with a cut on the phone screen to read the message.

I was exactly 10 minutes in when I whispered aloud, ""Wow, this is already a great movie."" And it continued to be great all the way up until the credit began rolling at the end.The story line itself was quite a simply and slightly over done one but I never once got that feeling while watching this movie. I have a habit of trying to predict what happens next and I loved that for the majority of this film, I was wrong.MASSIVE shoutout to the screenwriter, because the even the simplest of lines were written in a way that made you feel things deeply.The characters were so so so so developed. I felt like I was watching someone's life unfold and that these weren't just characters on a screen. I have to mention Nadine: so often I see movies where we have a main character who is innocent in everything that happens to them and just watches their life fall apart around them.

The movie gives a realistic view of what seventeen year old girls go through in high school and everyone should watch it because of this.In The Edge of Seventeen, the main character Nadine, loses a friend because her only friend ends up dating her older brother, ""I can't help how I feel Nadine."" This obviously upsets her and she has no idea what to do. Her friend was her support in high school, so she figures she needs that support again and goes to her teacher one day during lunch for advice to meet new people. She shares her very opinionated words with this teacher about how she dislikes high school and her life at the moment, ""I don't really have any friends, at the moment, and, to be completely honest with you, i'm not interested at all. At all. My entire generation is a bunch of mouthbreathers."" She also makes it very clear that she dislikes life, ""I don't want to take up a ton of your time, but i'm going to kill myself. I just thought an adult should know."" She is clearly miserable because she lost her best friend, now she has no friends, hinting at the fact that she needs advice to find a friend so she won't be this lonely. The teacher, not very good at giving advice, gives it a shot, ""Life's about taking risks. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there."" She takes his advice and meets a new friend named Erwin, who becomes pretty fond of Nadine, but in the long run they end up staying friends. Erwin becomes the supportive friend that Nadine needs because she's still devastated that Krista would do this to her. She's not only mad at Krista, but also at her brother for doing this because her brother has been there for her for the longest time, for her whole life. Even though they had a normal brother and sister hatred for each other, they still supported each other. Nadine feels like they both basically betrayed her.Nadine also has her mom that supports her when everything is happening to her, ""When I get mad I get really quiet and really still and I say to myself 'Everyone in the world is as miserable as you are. They are just better at pretending'."" This is really good advice to give to Nadine so she doesn't feel alone with what she's dealing with, so she isn't that lonely. Nadine makes many mistakes when trying to impress a boy that she has a crush on, and Erwin is there for her when her heart gets broken, and when she makes mistake, like any caring and supportive friend should. Erwin introduces her to some of his friends at the end of the movie, and all problems are solved.The Edge of Seventeen includes a great learning experience for teenagers or anyone that watches it, however the ending was a bit rushed and all of the problems were solved rather quickly, but still a great movie!",The Edge of Seventeen

268,vtoivon2,Can seventeen be that bad?,8,2 November 2016,"Remember all those teen movies about how much fun it is to be a teenager? Porky's, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, all those American Pie movies and movies that spend an inordinate amount of time at the beach, to name a few. These are typical teenage movies. The Edge of Seventeen is not a typical teenage movie, and that is what makes it so great. Oh, there have been other great non-typical teenage films of late, like The Perks of Being a Wallflower, but somehow Seventeen stands alone.Perhaps it is the intense and thoroughly committed performance of Hailee Steinfeld who started her film career under the tutelage of the Cohn Brothers in their remake of True Grit (oh yeah, and was nominated for an Oscar at the age of 14, although principle filming occurred while she was 13). Hailee so captures the angst of Nadine, whose name alone sets her apart, (Nadine was the most common name given to baby girls in 1958); that one cannot help but ache for her. Nadine carries the weight of the world on her shoulders and believes herself to be unlike any of the other kids who text each other about the tacos they're eating, and communicate in emojis.She plays well alongside her favorite teacher, portrayed cheekily by Woody Harrelson who provides some of the best laughs in the film, as one might expect. Also of note, I think, is the quirky, lovable and downright cute performance of Hayden Szeto as Erwin. Erwin sits next to Nadine in class stumbling and bumbling his way through awkward repartee in the hopes of some sort of hook-up. But nothing is typical here, and the course that said repartee takes leads us into uncharted teen territory. It might also be interesting to note that the name Erwin was the most common baby name in 1918, which makes this Erwin an old soul, to be sure.Kelly Fremon Craig has written a real gem here, and his first directing effort will earn him much critical acclaim, to be sure. The thing he does masterfully is take us inside the character of Nadine by giving us so many moments alone with her; moments when we experience in her stillness, in her eyes, and in her facial discipline as an actress the absolute bankruptcy of her isolation. None of us would want to be seventeen again, or ever; at least not her seventeen.I am grateful to the studio, and to the Marcus Corporation for giving some of us movie lovers an opportunity to pre-screen this film that will be released on November 18th. I suppose they hope we will say good things about it and get others to go see the film. Well, go see the film. You will laugh, and you will need a few tissues, but you will not regret having spent a few hours walking in Nadine's shoes. Perhaps there is a little Nadine in all of us after all.",The Edge of Seventeen

Reasonably attractive and maybe a tad introverted but not shy necessarily, and they are hardly that awkward. In this film, however, while the leads are all attractive, it's their personalities and actions that shake things up. Stuttering and weird timing contributed to the surplus of almost cringey awkwardness (in a good way). There was the inclusion of consuming teen depression and also the difficulty some people have when it comes to connecting with other individuals.

Of course teenagers do stupid things all the time but the writers should decide if she's an ordinary girl who does dumb things or a smart girl who knows what she's doing. The teacher had some cool moments but what was the meaning of his appearance? Him and Nadine had some cool lines in the trailer which made me interested but in the movie they're such a bore. At the end, I didn't feel anything. I didn't know what I was supposed to feel. The character development was unimpressive and lame. The story was lame too. I gave this a 6 because despite the movie was bad in its own, I still enjoyed watching it (idk why either) and because I like Hailee. Her acting was very natural.",The Edge of Seventeen
271,kate_funky_princess,Nothing compares to Juno!,3,30 January 2017,"To be honest I get the point of the director, but the movie was below average. Nothing to do with Juno or Clueless (as the trailer displayed) Truly being seventeen is not being totally selfish, mean, impolite, irritating and unsympathetic! The story is about a self-adsorbed bitch that in the last 5 minutes figures out that other people have problems and that she should be a better person. Yeah if all the people in the world got so many chances as you did and everyone was so forgiving! Also the fact that sex is such a cool issue for a virgin so much that she sends her crush(who thinks she is a loser with a capital L) a place to do it, had me in laughing tears of what I am seeing. Oh yeah! Sexting is a thing now and everyone has a pool in his house! Even if these things do happen should a movie portray them like that? But the only thing that saved this movie is the actors and the music! Woody Harrelson is amazing as always and the only one that cracked some jokes in this film!

274,judyppcd,A disappointment,2,3 May 2018,"The Edge of Seventeen has many strong, positive aspects. The acting, by Hailee Steinfeld as Nadine and Kyra Sedgwick as her mother, Mona, was outstanding. Woody Harrelson nailed the part of the burned out teacher, Mr. Bruner. Actually, Hailee Steinfeld carried the movie as the lost and disturbed Nadine, making her into a character we can sympathize with. The high school was realistically rendered both physically, and in terms of the general student population. The end of the movie was well done with Nadine working out issues with her brother, Darian, played by Blake Jenner.
 On the other hand, there were glaring flaws in this production that cannot be overlooked. First of all, the script was often lacking in substance. Do teenagers really talk that disrespectfully as Nadine does with both family and friends? Also, why has no teacher, coach, principal, or counselor gotten help for Nadine? She was unhappy, or disturbed, depending how you look at it from kindergarten through 11th grade. The death of her father only made things worse. After all, she lived in an upper middle class neighborhood and attended schools that seemed to have everything. Why had nobody noticed how unhappy and lost this girl was? This was unrealistic. And why hadn't Mr. Bruner, her history teacher gotten her help from a counselor? He was obviously ill equipped to help Nadine himself.
 The boy Erwin was well portrayed by Hayden Szeto, but it seems unrealistic to have Nadine take a sudden interest in him as a boyfriend at the end when she had previously made it quite clear that she only wanted him as a friend. There was no build up for this. The end was well done but there should have been more than one night between the mixed up Nadine and the totally transformed Nadine of the last scene.",The Edge of Seventeen
275,andressacipriano98,"Selfishness Is Ok, Because You're Seventeen",3,16 January 2020,"So I don't really understand how so many people enjoyed this movie so much. I really don't.
Nadine starts by having a troublesome life by being bullied and the losing her father. The only person she has for everything is her childhood friend, who was the first to talk to her.
At this point I felt really empathetic for the lead character, but it doesn't last long.
I can understand the surprise in seeing your bestifriend and your friend hooking up first thing after a hangover, but the way she reacted was just childish - even for a teenager. She's almost 18 for goodness sake! How can the girl simply not feel an ounce of happiness for her childhood bestfriend? It's unbelievable.
She complains about a friend changing and ""abandoning"" her, but at the end of the day all she feels is jealousy. Her friend tried to continue their friendship, but she is the one who couldn't accept this new chapter in her friend's life. What does she do immediatly after hearing the news?
Flirt with a guy, and then with another, nicer guy. The ""happy ending"" she got happened when the guy introduced her to others, just like her brother did to her best friend. This to me just proves how this girl is living in a world where everything has to be about her, and only her.
Let's remember that the movie showed us how the friend had a difficult childhood as well, so why can't Nadine accept her happiness away from her?
It's, to simply put it, a broken girl who could never deal with her emotions and past traumas porperly (at one point she even stoles her mother's car), but a sadstory does not excuse this girl's behabviour.
Simply selfish, blaming the world but not herself.",The Edge of Seventeen

It's not even the completely unlikable protagonist (quote: ""They're all mouth=breathers... I am an old soul""). What really bothers me about this movie was that after all the cringe, after all the ""realness,"" that it lacked the balls to reach a real conclusion. You feel helpless because you hate so many things about yourself but you'll never be able to change any of them? A hug can fix that. You're ugly but also too superficial to settle for less than perfection? Don't worry, some kind, rich, handsome guy (who's even less socially adept than you) will come along and settle for you, even if you friendzone him. Twice.

283,fraggingrev,A breath of fresh air,8,27 October 2016,"I just saw an early screening of the movie at a local Cinemark in Texas. It was really good! Had a very unique and fresh feel to it. Hailee Steinfeld did a fantastic job selling the role and coming across naturally as a seventeen year old trying to figure out life. She has a natural talent for comedic timing and she was just downright enjoyable to watch in this movie as her character Nadine. While being a immature teenager with next-to-no friends who feels like she has the worst life ever, she surprisingly has a lot of depth. Most of her conflicts she causes herself due to her stubborn and self-loathing personality. These things along with her insecure personality make for a realistic approach to a seventeen year old constantly desiring to fit in but not possessing the social abilities to do so. She is not the most likable person but as the movie progresses she slowly starts becoming more tolerable. Other conflicts relate to her brother Darian (Blake Jenner) who she is envious and resentful of, best friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), and occasionally her mother (Kyra Sedgwick) as well. The cast great job overall and I would have to say there wasn't really any performance from this cast I did not enjoy watching. I already mentioned that Hailee nailed her role, but it was Woody Harrelson as Nadine's teacher Mr. Bruner that completely shined in every scene he was in. I could have watched Nadine and Mr. Bruner in a classroom for the entire movie, because their comedic chemistry was such a pleasure to watch. Mr. Bruner is a cynical school teacher that is constantly being bombarded by Nadine with the drama and troubles she goes through on a frequent basis. The scenes with his character always had the theater laughing and he added a great touch to this film as her teacher. There were only a couple of issues I had. While Nadine was an very enjoyable character to watch, it was sometimes hard to believe her situation being as bad as it was. Being played by Hailee Steinfeld, she is not exactly unattractive even without make-up. One scene when she dresses up in the movie she is downright stunning, which makes me wonder why she didn't just dress this way all the time? That is instead of complaining about how much she hated her face, voice, etc. They did a good job attempting to dress her in a way that she would not appear as attractive, but you can only do so much as Hailee is naturally attractive and this made her troubles at times unbelievable. There would be several scenes in the movie where she would be unable to relate or socialize with others, such as at a party. She would state on several occasions that she hated how insecure she was and hated several of her characteristics, but then scenes later had no issue going swimming alone with a boy for several hours and not appearing socially awkward in the least. These inconsistencies made it a bit hard to narrow down her personality but it did not take away from the entertainment value of the movie. Overall I really enjoyed the movie and believe it was very well done. Nothing too serious but definitely a breath of fresh air in this type of genre.8/10",The Edge of Seventeen

It's frustrating because it's so, so close to capturing the feeling of being a seventeen year-old-girl in one moment, then wildly misses the mark in the next. No reasonable seventeen-year-old girl abandons her decade-long best friend for a guy without some other falling-out first, and most of us had to save ourselves (or our friends) from our own escapades rather than having our clueless brothers do it for us. Really confused by this movie because at first it feels like they're trying to give an honest picture of female adolescence, but then they censored anything that might have felt too real.

Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic as a teenager dealing with loneliness, social awkwardness, and buried grief. As often is the case in teen movies, her main parental figure (her mother) is a bit of a ridiculous mess, so she turns to her teacher played by Woody Harrelson, who's also great in his role. This story manages to address family issues at home, dating woes, friendship conflict, jealousy, and more. It walks the line between drama and comedy, serving up some very touching moments AND some big laughs.

304,chocolateisuniversal,10 Hell Yeahs,10,25 July 2018,"I have never sucked dick in a PetLand.The Edge of Seventeen opens up a real window into the movie in the title. You get a peep-shot straightaway with the yellow border and black font as to what kind of movie this is going to be: edgy, with seventeen-year-oldsDespite not knowing even what a PetLand was, I felt more connected to The Edge of Seventeen more than I have any other teen movie in a long time. It probably helps that I am seventeen. It plays so truthfully to the gross, weird adolescent experience that I felt like some scenes held up a mirror to my sloppy hair-bunned face and said, ""Look! Look, everyone is just as awkward and miserable as you are.""The beginning is cliched, but forgivable because it provides a quick pocket of exposition that reveals enough to allow viewers to understand Nadine's reactions. The dialogue is biting and earns more than just a nostril snort, and most importantly, reminiscent of how teenagers actually speak to one another. Characters tackle several tropes: brother dating best-friend, bad-boy, nerd-who-has-a-crush-on-me, and the all-important teen movie party scene with all the finesse that real teenagers would possess.It's hard to speak about what makes this movie so real, so cringey, and so well-done. That's probably why I am not a movie critic. However, I can say that it strikes that perfect balance with awkward, cringey scenes (like someone getting an unsolicited kiss on a Ferris wheel) by using jokes that don't cheapen the severity of the situation, but rather diffuse it, just like real life. Characters fumble through with some forgivable mistakes that I could see becoming fond adulthood bar stories.Instead of making caricatures and grotesquely dramatic scenes, it imbues that same heartfelt humanity in awkward, painful, and ""yikes"" scenes that radiates through the rest of the film. In no scene does this film make the characters over-react for the sake of tension. All characters, not just the titular whiny Nadine, suffer humilations, desires, and motivations. That allows them all to develop and break out of the stereotypes that usually plague secondary characters.Edge of Seventeen also tackles a tumultuous familial relationship, with an eventual reconciliation (spoiler, but come on. It's a coming-of-age movie.) that doesn't feel forced and unnatural. Waterfalls don't come pouring out of one another's eyes in a sobbed apologies. It is awkward, but charming. It leaves you with that glimmer of hope that follows every awkward familial apology after a Desert Storm level fight-that your family, and the argument, aren't fixed, but they're not inflamed. It's healing.So, yeah. I've never sucked dick in a PetLand. But neither has Nadine.I give this movie 10 Hell Yeahs.",The Edge of Seventeen
305,khw-37249,Must Watch Movie,9,21 February 2019,"The Edge of Seventeen is a very bittersweet movie about a 17 year old named Nadine (Hailee Steinfield), who is trying to navigate her way through the awkward years of high school. Life at home is rather difficult as she often feels inferior to her popular older brother, Darian (Blake Jenner), and she can't seem to get along with her mother, Mona (Kyra Sedgwick). Every thing seems to fall apart when her best friend, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), begins dating her older brother. At this point, Nadine is only able to find reassurance through her friendship with her history teacher/mentor, Mr. Bruner, and her compassionate classmate, Erwin Kim. The Edge of Seventeen is a must watch movie that incorporates important social issues, good humor, exceptional acting, and well thought out cinematography to keep the audience engaged.
Throughout the movie, depression plays a big role in the life of the main character. Depression is a relevant sickness that many people deal with today. In one scene, Nadine takes a pill then coincidentally receives a phone call from her classmate, Erwin Kim. She answers the call in a monotone voice saying that she will call him later and abruptly hangs up. After realizing her rudeness, she calls Erwin back and explains to him that she just took an antidepressant pill and is waiting for the effects to kick in. Nadine goes on to ask him if he thinks she is pathetic, and he responds by insisting that she is perfectly fine. This scene normalizes depression and shows teen viewers that it is okay to not always be ""fine"". Another social issue touched upon is misunderstood teenagers. Teens often feel misunderstood and alone, and this problem is highlighted in the movie. Nadine is frequently misunderstood by her mom. They have a complicated relationship where they never see eye to eye leading Nadine to feel alone as she doesn't get along with her brother either. Darian, her brother, also feels misunderstood because his whole family began to rely on him once the father passed away. They think of him as the ""rock"" of the family although deep down inside he can barely keep it together. Juggling his social life at school while dealing with the wrath of his sister and being the personal emotional support system to his mother, Darian's life isn't as perfect as everyone thinks it to be.
Acting plays a big factor in the movie. Hailee Steinfield is given the difficult task of playing a depressed and unhappy seventeen year old. With the help of some makeup work, and her sassy, sometimes sarcastic attitude, she is able to portray a seemingly helpless teen who thinks the world hates her. Her use of sarcasm also helps to add to the humor of the movie because there are many scenes where she sarcastically jokes around making a seemingly serious moment more lighthearted. On the other hand, Blake Jenner uses his manly charisma to play a very confident character with a tough personality, with the exception of one scene. During one scene, Blake's character, Darian, has a very intense conversation with Nadine. Both actors become vulnerable and their characters are able to share a connection which ends up changing the feelings of the movie. The camera work also helps theses actors portray their characters. When it is a rather intense or touching moment, the camera will be zoomed in and there will be no background noise. This helps the audience focus their attention on what is going on. Interestingly, the movie doesn't use effectively use music as a tool to help evoke emotion. This is surprising considering The Edge of Seventeen is a movie directed at teens who's lives happen to be heavily influenced by music.
Overall, I would rate this movie a solid 9/10. It is a great movie but I would not recommend it to younger children. Some of the humor is more mature and there are some inappropriate scenes and foul language. I would recommend this coming of age movie to all teenagers because it provides valuable lessons such as always be yourself and always put your family first. Me being a teenager, this movie also reminded me that although you may believe you are alone in this world, there is always someone who understands you.",The Edge of Seventeen
