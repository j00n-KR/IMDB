0,TheLittleSongbird,"Deliscious eye candy, but lacking in substance",5,13 September 2010,"I really wanted to like this film, as it did have a lot going for it. However, it is lacking in a few too many things, such as substance. The film does look truly exquisite- the cinematography, costumes, sets, scenery, locations, interiors, wigs and makeup are truly sumptuous and a real feast for the eyes. The story did intrigue me too, while in terms of acting Kirsten Dunst is suitably naive and coquettish and Jason Schawartzman is a dashing yet shy Dauphin. While Rip Torn is surprisingly subtle. However, Marie Antoinette does suffer from being too long and I think too slow too. And the film is further disadvantaged by one too many anachronisms, particularly the music which is too contemporary for my liking and there is too much of it(ie. the masked rave to Siouxsie), and historically the film never feels authentic. Sophia Coppola's direction is unfocused too, too much is spent on the not-so-important moments and the more significant moments feel skimmed over in contrast, while the script is rather weak as it goes overboard with the sugar and froth. To conclude, not terrible but it is not great really. Worth seeing for the period detail, but little beyond that. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Marie Antoinette
1,SnoopyStyle,more costume than drama,6,19 July 2016,"In 1768, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is a young princess in Austria. Her mother sets her to marry the future French king Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). She is naive and inexperienced in the ways of the Versailles court. There is King Louis XV of France (Rip Torn), his mistress Madame du Barry (Asia Argento), and Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis). The Dauphin is distant and Marie struggles to connect with him. They are not sexual and she's under pressure to give an heir to the throne.Sofia Coppola delivers a bright, light Marie Antoinette. She's very modern. There is some nice tension as the pressure builds for a baby. The movie fades away after that as France falls into revolution. Dunst is better as the young teen more than the older queen. The movie has the costumes but the drama isn't always there.",Marie Antoinette
2,Horst_In_Translation,A good period piece that is sometimes style over substance,6,18 March 2019,"""Marie Antoinette"" is a co-production between USA, France and Japan that is mostly in the English language and was released back in 2006, so this one will soon have its 15th anniversary. What made me most curious about this film here probably is that it was written and directed by Sofia Coppola and was the first full feature film she made after ""Lost in Translation"", a contender for my number one favorite film of all time. But we shall talk about that one on another occasion, so now let's look at these slightly over two hours we have here, fairly long for a period piece. You can read the name of the main character in the title here and she is played by Kirsten Dunst, who was really a big thing back then, not so much anymore today, but yeah I think she is an okay actress and also fairly attractive taking into account that I usually don't like blondes that much, but overall I can see why she was cast here, even if Scarlett Johansson could have been interesting too.The rest of the cast includes more than just a few big names. It was sure unusual, but interesting and fun at the same time to see some of these play influential members of the Royal French Court, such as Rip Torn, Judy Davis, Rose Byrne, Tom Hardy (yep!), Dannny Huston, Mary Nighy (Bill's daughter) and Jamie Dornan. And I sure did not expect Steve Coogan and Molly Shannon in here. But everybody played their parts pretty well, even if some of them really don't have a lot of screen time at all. Huston for example only has one scene. The film starts with the main character moving from Austria to France in order to marry the heir to the throne. There is no charming love story that brought them together, but it was an imperial decision made by others. Still they seem fairly fond of each other. This is never a movie about unrequited or unhappy love by any means. Even when Marie Antoinette has an affair with a Swedish count on one occasion, it is never really causing any problems as some may know about it, but it does not result in a scandal. Still I was curious if her second child, actually the new heir to the throne, was fathered by the Swede. But keeping up the royal status was not exactly a relevant subject anyway with what was happening towards the end when everybody had to leave the castle and eventually also King and Queen. Oh I forgot to mention Schwartzman, how could I as he probably plays the male key character in the film, perhaps because his character is really the most stoic presence in the film and not really one that required great acting, just composition. By the way, Schwartzman is Coppola's cousin.This film went 1 for 1 at the Academy Awards taking home the Best Costume Oscar and I am not surprised. For Canonero, it was the third of so far four Oscars. I am rather surprised this one here did not manage any other nominations as it seems like an obvious choice for set decorations, maybe soundtrack too. And a nomination for Dunst was also not highly unlikely I assume because she really was in every scene of the film and had also great baity material like when she really struggles with the prince's lack of interest in her or let's say that he is too scared to show his interest as it is obviously there as we find out quickly. Then there is the cheating, then there is the struggle with the people and of course also that she originates from a place that is completely different compared to where she ends up in France. Her crying for her pug says it all. There are more scenes like that. She is more like a girl really. On one occasion, there is talk about a political conflict and all she wonders about is her dress. At least they make sure she never really made that cake comment. There are many films about Marie Antoinette, but probably this is the most known one. And there is certainly no other as packed with pink, sweet and pompous dresses as this one we have here.Coppola also made some really interesting musical choices. Period pieces are normally films where you just have a soundtrack of classical music involving no singing and certainly not as much really loud pop music as she used here. I think it fit and that was quite an achievement. My favorite is probably ""Fools Rush In"" (NOT by Lil Bow Wow) followed by ""I Want Candy"". By the way, I was literally feeling my kilograms increase while only watching all the sweets and delicacies shown in here. Okay, let me think what else can I say about the film. The last scene inside the carriage was good as well with his question about the lemon trees and her answer that she is bidding farewell. Great moment to have the credits roll in. We find out a lot about life at the court and honestly, like with some other Coppola (daughter Coppola) films, you can certainly say that there is not really that much happening here admittedly. At least not constant action and scheming or so like in many other old period pieces focusing on female characters at the very center of it. It is not a film designed to make audiences laugh on too many occasions, even if there is a moment here and there. It is also not much of a drama I would say, even if obviously there are many dramatic moments. This absence of genres can be explained through the lack of a constantly developing plot. Most of the time, it is more about depicting the state of things, except the ending of course that goes strongly against everything before that. It is a historical costume movie, maybe the best way to describe it. It wasn't a great or outstanding watch and I'd put it nowhere near my favorites from 2006, but still an okay little movie. Probably girls will generally enjoy this one more than boys. No hesitation for me in giving this one a thumbs-up. Go watch it and if you like both the genre and Kirsten Dunst, then it is close to a must-see I suppose.",Marie Antoinette
3,Prismark10,Dunst checks in as the Queen,5,5 September 2019,"I think Sofia Coppola aimed to make a brash fun historical drama such as Amadeus. She lacks the skills of writer Peter Shaffer who wrote Amadeus first as a stage play. She also lacks the audacity of Baz Luhrmann who bought a different visual spin to his modern interpretation of Romeo & Juliet.Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is a young woman from the powerful Austrian Hapsburg dynasty who through marriage formed alliances with its European neighbours. She married the Dauphin of France, the future Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) and they live in the extravagant Palace of Versailles.Marie is first inexperienced with the ways of the world and the marriage is not consummated for a long time. The reasons because her husband does not engage in having sex with her. Marie is under pressure to produce a heir.Over time, her husband becomes King of France, she does have children and becomes known for grand parties and lavish spending on clothes.When revolutionary fever hits France, the royal family are at risk.The film is gorgeously photographed, has wonderful costumes and exquisite art direction. You can see the money spent on the screen.It has a modern take, such as contemporary music and it does feel like those high school rom coms transplanted to historical France. It is self indulgent with a thin frothy story that goes on for too long because Coppola wants to film sunrises and parties.Dunst is fine but she is not well served by the script but as Marie matures she dolls up her hair, wears lavish clothes and has a collection of shoes. She even takes in a lover. Coppola follows in her father's footsteps with a little bit of nepotism in the casting. Jason Schwartzman is her cousin and he is weak here, maybe because the script has given him little to do.",Marie Antoinette
4,jboothmillard,Marie Antoinette,5,16 August 2020,"All I know about Marie Antoinette is that she was queen during the French Revolution, and that she was beheaded for treason, and I all knew about this film was the leading actress and director Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation, The Bling Ring), I was hoping for something fairly good. Basically, fourteen-year-old Maria Antonia (Kirsten Dunst) is the beautiful, charming, and naïve Archduchess of Austria, the youngest of Empress Maria-Theresa (Marianne Faithfull). In 1770, Marie Antoinette is the only of her sister left unmarried; she is sent by her mother to marry the Dauphin of France, the future Louis XVI, to seal an alliance between the Austria and France. Marie-Antoinette travels to France, relinquishing all connections with her home country, and meets King Louis XV of France (Rip Torn) and her future husband, Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). The two arrive at the Palace of Versailles, they are married at once and are encouraged to produce an heir to the throne as soon as possible, but the next day the king that ""nothing happened"" on the wedding night. As time passes, Marie Antoinette finds life at the court of Versailles suffocating. Her husband's courtiers despise her being a foreigner and blame her for not producing an heir, although the fault really lies with her husband, and they do not consummate the marriage for a long time. The French court is rife with gossip, and Marie Antoinette consistently causes upset and offense by defying its formal rituals. Marie Antoinette also refuses to meet or speak with Jeanne Bécu, Comtesse du Barry (Asia Argento), the mistress of Louis XV. Over the years, Maria-Theresa continues to write to her daughter, giving advice on how to impress and seduce her husband. Marie's attempts to consummate with her husband fail and the marriage remains childless. Marie spends most of her time buying extravagant clothes and gambling. The King dies of smallpox on May 10, 1774, and Louis XVI is crowned King of France at the age of 19, with Marie Antoinette as Queen at the age of 18. Marie Antoinette's brother, Joseph II (Danny Huston), Holy Roman Emperor, comes to visit, he gives her advice about her constant partying, but she ignores this. Joseph meets Louis XVI at the Royal Zoo and explains to him the ""mechanics"" of sexual intercourse. Thereafter, the King and Marie Antoinette have sex for the first time, and on December 19, 1778, Marie Antoinette gives birth to a daughter, Princess Marie Thérèse Charlotte of France. As the child grows up, Marie Antoinette spends much of her time at the small chateau Petit Trianon, in the park of Versailles. Sometime later, she begins an affair with Axel von Fersen (Jamie Dornan). As France's financial crisis worsens, food shortages and riots increase, her public image has completely deteriorated by this point, her continued luxurious lifestyle and seeming indifference to the struggles of the French people earned her the title ""Madame Deficit"". As the queen matures, she focuses much more on family than her social life and makes what she feels are significant financial adjustments. Her mother dies on November 29, 1780. Marie Antoinette gives birth to a son, Louis-Joseph, Dauphin of France, on October 22, 1781. She also gives birth to another son, Louis-Charles on March 27, 1785, and another daughter, Princess Sophie on July 9, 1786, who dies on June 19, 1787, a month before her first birthday. As the French Revolution erupts with the storming of the Bastille, the royal family resolves to stay in France, unlike most of the court. The Paris riots force the family to leave Versailles. The film ends with the royal family's transfer to the Tuileries. The last image is a shot of Marie Antoinette's bedroom at Versailles, destroyed by angry rioters. Also starring Steve Coogan as Florimond Claude, Count of Mercy-Argenteau, Rose Byrne as Yolande de Polastron, Duchess of Polignac, Molly Shannon as Madame Victoire, Judy Davis as Anne de Noailles, ""Countess of Noailles"", Shirley Henderson as Madame Sophie, and Tom Hardy as Raumont. Dunst gives a good performance as the coquettish queen who does not stick to tradition, and utters her famous phrase ""Let them eat cake"", and there is some good support from Coogan, Davis and others, while Schwartzman is just blank. This film has an interesting approach to telling the story, it is edited like a music video or something, with lavish costumes and magnificent sets, but a soundtrack made up of glam rock/pop songs that we recognise, my favourite being the ""I Want Candy"" by Bow Wow Wow sequence. This is both the film's strength and weakness, the look of the film is good, and it does make for a fun watch, but it would have been good to have more authenticity, and I definitely wanted the ending to be Marie Antoinette executed by guillotine, beheaded for high treason, all in all, not a bad historical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Make Up & Hair. Worth watching!",Marie Antoinette
5,rmax304823,"Boy, Did They Eat Cake.",3,10 April 2008,"The film has a fine cast and there are some original touches. The American actors speak unaccented English, without as much as a nod to any alien phones, for instance, despite the late 18th-century French setting. And there may be snatches of rococo music but most of the score is electronically amplified rock with, at one point, a singer belting out the old Frank Sinatra standard, ""Fools Rush In."" There are multiple close ups of lavish plates of exquisitely prepared and presented food. And minute examination of clothing, wigs, fabrics, jewelry, and period shoes -- especially shoes. (The hairdresser who dolls up Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette is a fairy and is played for laughs.) Miniature dogs. Lots of miniature dogs slurping up charlotte russes or other desserts.Okay -- decadence in abundance. It might have taken ten minutes. Instead, that's what the entire film seems to be about.You have to applaud the director's intent to do something different, something original. The problem is that it doesn't work. Rip Torn's speech doesn't sound too much out of place but most of the rest of the women sound like Valley Girls. And, boy, they gossip! In extended scenes, they gossip! They talk behind one another's back about hair styles and personalities -- ""She's so political."" Stuff you could find on MySpace.It wouldn't take much in the way of rewriting to turn this story of self-indulgent aristos at Versailles into a handful of high school kids in El Cerrito. And it didn't need to be directed by Sophia Coppola. Martha Stewart could have phoned it in while under house arrest.I don't know which audience this was aimed at, but I can recommend it for selected groups anyway. Those youngsters who, in a recent poll, identified Toronto as a city in Italy, for example. Or the fourteen percent of us who believe Barack Obama is a Muslim. Or that majority of high school seniors unable to place the American Civil War in its correct half century. At least they'd gain some familiarity with the dress of the period French court.",Marie Antoinette
6,ma-cortes,Lush and big-budgeted costumer retells life of title role from Austrian princess to doomed queen,6,8 March 2015,"Epic on life of famous French queen has Kirsten Dunst in title role but lacks perspective and historical accuracy , though sets & costumes are excellent , being marketed for an adolescent audience . This is a sympathetic biopic of the 18th-century queen of France , retelling of France's iconic but ill-fated queen , Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) . The queen was a teen then as well as the Dauphin who later becomes Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) . The dauphin was only 16 when he met Marie (who was 15) in the opulent and eccentric court at Versailles . From her betrothal and marriage to Louis XVI to her reign as queen at 19 and to the end of her reign as queen . Marie discovers high society, with the help of Duchesse de Polignac (Rose Byrne) , Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis) , her brothers-in-law and her aunts : Victoire (Molly Shannon) and Sophie (Shirley Henderson) . Her foolishness is at its height when she meets a Swedish count, Axel de Fersen (Jamie Dorman) . He helps her see her fecklessness and she matures from a teenage bride to a young woman and eventual a nice queen of France . In the second half of the film, she avoids an annulment, becomes queen and bears children , and ultimately the fall of Versailles . This is a glamorous as well as opulent film of life of 18th century French queen filled with agreeable drama , luxurious gowns , impressive palaces but lacks good pace and historical events ; as this story is not historically accurate . Based on the award-winning biography Marie Antoinette : The Journey by British author, Lady Antonia Fraser , it tells the story of the most misunderstood and abused woman in history, from her birth in Imperial Austria to her later life in France . Kirnsten Dunst captures essence of title character giving an acceptable acting . She shines in this enjoyable , lavish & sadly neglected film . The movie had thousands of costumes and lavish set designs . Some gowns became extremely heavy due to the embroidery, flounces and precious stones used . This film is really a historical/""pseudo-historical"" drama , with the Versailles Court as the back scenery, for all kinds of entertaining intrigues . Spectacular and colorful scenarios , in fact , crew was allowed to film on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles . Evocative and brilliant cinematography by Lance Acord . Plenty of inappropriate modern songs and contemporary musical score . The motion picture efficiently produced by Francis Ford Coppola was middlingly directed by Sophia Coppola . The film based on historical deeds and adding more happenings , these are the followings : The life of Marie Antoinette (1755-1793) from betrothal and marriage in 1770 to her getaway from Versailles palace . At first, she's a Hapsburg teenager isolated in France, living a virgin's life in the household of the Dauphin, a shy solitary man who would like to be a locksmith . She then matures and becomes a responsible ruler . Over the next few years, France continues to subsidize the American Revolution by giving funds and troops to the new nation to help fight the British, despite the enormous expense . Food shortages grow more frequent, as do food riots in Paris. Marie Antoinette's image with her subjects has completely deteriorated at this point. Her luxurious lifestyle and apparent callous indifference to the common people result in unflattering and obscene political cartoons in the local newspapers and earn her the title ""Madame Déficit"" . Later on , the affair of the necklace and the general poverty of France feed revolution ultimately the fall of Versailles . She is condemned to death by beheading but faces death with dignity . The flick also recounting some important facts as when France played a disastrous role in the Seven Years' War, which among other loses , included losing Canadian territory to the much hated British , the French revolution and kings escape until Varennes . In the film appears some historical characters such as Emperor Louis XV (Rip Torn) , Empress Maria Theresa of Austria (Marianne Faithful) : mother of Mary Antoniette and emperor Joseph II of Austria (Danny Huston) and Madame Du Barry (Asia Argento) ; the latter was a wanton, vivacious young woman, catches the eye & the heart of the aging Louis XV and quickly becomes his mistress . After the death of Louis XV in 1774 she retired to a life of luxury in her private château and kept up a schedule of intrigues & dalliances throughout the reign of Louis XVI . With the outbreak of the Revolution, Du Barry escaped to England in 1793 . Foolishly, she returned to France & was arrested on charges of conspiracy against the New Order. Du Barry had her appointment with Madame Guillotine on December 8, 1793 , she was 50 years old.

7,moonspinner55,"""This is ridiculous!"" ... ""This, Madame, is Versailles!""",7,28 July 2007,"Avant-garde, 'revisionist' history, with writer-director Sofia Coppola proving to be adept at capturing the look of 1768 France whilst eschewing the textbook facts (which is both boon and bane). A dimply child-woman from Austria is brought to France to be married to the King's grandson, soon to rule as Queen of France, although royal titles mean little to her other than providing an ample opportunity to spend money and revel in lavish parties. Kirsten Dunst gives an amazing performance as Antoinette: neither lascivious nor pretentious, she strikes a nimble chord between giggly girlishness and patient, perplexed young adult, never pushing her mostly sexless marriage to Louis XVI nor putting him down for being an inattentive lover (their relationship is fascinating, if a bit undernourished as written). Coppola mostly seems interested in displaying the similarities between life in this Royal Court and the wild partying of today's youth; while certainly a good starting point for the film, the inelegant gossip and game-playing, feminine dress-up occasions and catty speculations eventually fall into a somewhat repetitive pattern--we sense Coppola belaboring her points and the obvious irony. There are, of course, different ways Marie Antoinette's story can be brought to the screen, and this is just one filmmaker's vision, however the picture is succinct is capturing the imposing introduction she faced entering this snobbish monarchy, the numerous obstacles (of the human and etiquette variety) she came across while attempting to get her bearings. The movie is impeccably cast and scored with an intriguing mix of operatic and classical pieces, lovely mood music and New Wave rock songs (the only one of which that errs is Bow Wow Wow's ""Fools Rush In""--which can be forgiven since it is a great song--but it juts in, sticking out as an artifice). Coppola offers up these anachronisms rather nonchalantly, and her artistic eye never gets in the way of her narrative, which is strongest when centering on the human interaction. Not a great film, but quite a good one. *** from ****",Marie Antoinette
8,blanche-2,Beautiful bore,6,6 November 2007,"Kirsten Dunst is ""Marie Antoinette"" in this anachronistic 2006 film directed by Sofia Coppola. The other stars include Jason Schwartzman, Rip Torn, Judy Davis, Marianne Faithful and Molly Shannon.I can only guess that the reason for making this film was to show a teenage Queen of France cavorting with her girlfriends and shopping until she dropped while remaining oblivious to the plight and unhappiness of the French people. In actuality, that's probably pretty close to the truth about this historical figure. Norma Shearer was very good as Marie Antoinette, but she wasn't a kid. I think this version had the right idea. The only thing Coppola omitted was Marie's story, so the movie is instead about the above-mentioned teen partying, shopping, being unfaithful, wandering the grounds, while giving us a look at royal tradition, gorgeous costumes and dazzling scenery. Little else.Marie Antoinette's life was full of drama - her liaisons with Axel von Fersen, the Affair of the Necklace, her husband's medical problem which prevented the couple from having children for so long, the revolution, the family being taken to prison, and the guillotine. Some of this is touched on or mentioned in passing; most of it is left out. There are five exciting minutes or so toward the end of the film.In a way, it's a shame, because this film could have given us great insight into Marie Antoinette by having a very young woman play the Queen as these events swirled around her. But in order to do that, characters would have to have been developed, and there didn't seem to be any interest in that. If you love color, beautiful costumes and scenery, this is the film for you. Don't bother if you're looking for any kind of content; like the vacuous queen, there's no there there.",Marie Antoinette
9,Quinoa1984,"Coppola's personal take on a historical figure is keen, hip, too loose and very stylish",7,24 October 2006,"Sofia Coppola challenges the idea of doing a costume/period drama with her film Marie Antointte, and it's an interesting exercise in the art of showing how empty and frivolous royalty can be. It also reminded me that, compared with this, Lost in Translation's screenplay is actually much more focused and cohesive- in the sense of the structure of nothing going on (yet things seeming to be going on all the time). It's a European style character study where the characters don't have a whole lot of depth to them, even if the first hour or so delivers on being absorbing entertainment and craftsmanship (err, Craft-woman-ship now I guess). Coppola has her heels dig very well into the history and period detail of it, but she's actually not even that interested in the politics and the main desires of the people of France and elsewhere in Europe (in fact it isn't until the last ten minutes that the audience is really aware of a mass public who hates their guts to pieces). The world of the French royalty in the late 18th century- where Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is plucked up from Austria at 14 and picked to be the breeder for Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman)- is an insulated one, and the picture really becomes about how these two young people deal with this kind of heavenly constrictive paradise.Coppola does a lot to make the costume drama a lot more spiffy and fun than one might find in the common Ivory/Merchant film. We get 80's pop and new-wave songs on the soundtrack, many times over in the midst of some regular classical music in the halls of the Versailles. And there are many a montage devoted to shoes and pastries and cake. But through this, as mentioned above, the first hour is the most compelling and fascinating, as the first twenty minutes actually come off more or less like it could be all silent- the images totally speak for themselves, in the very restrained, always-pattered way of life that's lead for Marie and the King. It becomes apparent that Louis isn't really all that interested in her- matter of fact not really interested in anything at all, kind of incurious aside from his locks and hunting (kind of sound familiar, cough- Bush- cough). Schwartzman plays this superbly well, with a countering to what Dunst does with her main female protagonist. While Schwartzman is always reserved, a little dim, and trying to always cling to the proper ways up until the last dinner, Dunst's Marie starts off not totally sure what to make of this environment, and finds that the escapism of this world is the only way to find some kind of fulfillment, however shallow it might be.It's in the second half, however, that Coppola's script becomes a little more than meandering. It's like as if things just seem to be happening, though not really at the same time. While there is always the obvious, welcome influence of Antonioni lurking in many scenes (Coppola admitted to him being an influence at the 04 Oscars), particularly towards the end in showing the lack of true emotive connectedness between people in the upper class, there is also a lack of cohesion to all of this that wasn't as apparent in 'Translation'. There is a good sub-plot involving Marie's tryst with an American officer, but more often than not we get scenes with her doing not much at all, wandering aimlessly, fooling around with her kids, wandering hallways, etc. Moments like these are fine over the main context of the first part, as Marie is under pressure to bear children, but after a while the thread, however loose, gets a little un-reeled. Even an interesting moment like transitioning through time via paintings becomes obvious.In the end, I liked what I saw, and liked the intentions that Coppola had with the material, and especially the cast that she assembled (aside from the other two, Judy Davis, Asia Argento, Steve Coogan, Rip Torn, Molly Shannon and Marianne Faithful are among the many talented members of the cast), but it didn't amount to something that would mark it as a great film or even as an important one. It's a well produced, self-conscious interpretation that gives a few sparks to the notion of how material like this can be approached differently, though also longer and not as altogether as it thinks it is. I'd love to find the soundtrack though.",Marie Antoinette
10,edwagreen,Sophia Coppola Bombs Again-Marie Antoinette-A Bore **1/2,5,28 October 2007,"Kirsten Dunst is so stilted in the title role.She totally lacks the finesse of the 1938 Norma Shearer masterpiece. Jason Schwartzman seems awkward for the part of King Louis, which was so memorably created by Robert Morley in the '38 film.If you snapped your finger, the revolution would have passed you by. You do see the lavish living of Queen Marie and her cohorts. There is a new twist added here. Part of the reason that the people rebelled was because France was aiding the U.S. in its struggle against England. Interesting proposition.The excellent actress, Judy Davis, is wasted here as the Contesse, the head woman in charge of the manners of etiquette at Versailles. How many times do we have to view the morning curtains opening to see the royal couple in bed? Nothing has been accomplished during bedtime.Nice to see modern music intertwined in our story.In many scenes, prior to the revolution, Dunst appears that she is ready to cry.

11,michaelRokeefe,Dunst is fit to be Queen.,5,4 March 2007,"I really enjoyed Sofia Coppola's VIRGIN SUICIDES, but this is not exactly what I expected. Kirsten Dunst is the movie to me. Of course, the scenery is awesome and a killer soundtrack. This is Miss Coppola's candy-coated and slightly imaginative telling of the young Austrian princess forced into an arranged marriage at the age of 15 to Louis XVI(Jason Schwartzman)of France. The young free-spirit will become Queen at 19 and fall into an opulent and scandal ridden lifestyle that will make her the subject of the French populace's hatred. The end of her reign and life will be nothing short of legendary. Other cast members of note: Rip Torn, Judy Davis, Rose Byrne, Asia Argento, Steve Cogan and Marianne Faithful. The soundtrack delightful as decadent features the likes of The Strokes, Bow Wow, Air, New Order and The Cure. Let's say that Dunst as Marie Antoinette is a sight to remember.",Marie Antoinette

13,jotix100,Versailles,10,8 December 2006,"The luxury and the royal decadence of the late XVIII century in France stand a good reason for the French Revolution. ""Marie Antoinette"", the wonderful new film directed by Sofia Coppola, serve to illustrate why that violent turn of events happened in that country.Marie Antoinette, the tragic Austrian princess, is married to the French Dauphin, in order to cement her mother's strategic alliances with other European monarchies. This young woman, in a way, was sacrificed to complete the ambitious plans of her mother. We are given a scenario in which a somewhat naive young woman steps into a culture and a society she didn't belong. To make matters worse, her husband, the Dauphin, was a man not interested in a wife that was imposed on him by his own father.When Marie Antoinette leaves Vienna, she enters a pavilion in the middle of nowhere where everything Austrian is cast away, even her beloved lap dog must be sacrificed. The Comptesse Noailles, in charge of protocol, guides the young girl into what is awaiting her at the court of Versailles. The Austrian princess is not ready for what awaits her in the sophisticated world of the French court.It is somewhat clear that Marie Antoinette never felt love for her husband. She just was the vessel through which the successor of the throne of France would be conceived. When the children did arrive, her husband, then king Louis XVI, was too preoccupied with his own problems to really mean much to his queen. When he gives her the Petit Trianon, a place of her own, Marie Antoinette's real character comes through. She is not aware what her excesses do to the impoverished people in the country. She even had her own fling with Count Fersen. Her fate and her husband was sealed after the storm of the Bastille prison. We witness their departure from Versailles as they leave for an impending death.Sofia Coppola, a director with a style of her own, shows why she is one of the most talented women in the business. Working loosely on Antonia Fraser's novel, she has given her subject a great reading in this film of epic proportions. She was lucky in her choice of collaborators for this project. She counted on people of the caliber of Malena Canonero for those elegant period pieces we see on the screen. Anne Seibel's art direction is flawless and Veronique Melery's sets show us the French court in all its splendor. Lance Acord photographs the historical palace in all its majestic beauty.Another triumph for Ms. Coppola is in the choice of music for ""Marie Antoinette"". She blends the exquisite music by Jean-Philippe Rameau with modern classics, such as ""Fools Rush In"", something unheard of in a period film, yet, it makes sense and doesn't feel out of place.As the heroine of the film, Kirsten Dunst, who has worked with the director before, makes a great Marie Antoinette. Her blonde good looks blend perfectly with our idea of what this tragic woman was like. Jason Schartzman, on the other hand, doesn't quite give us the impression he is either the Dauphin, or Louis XVI. Rip Torn plays the earthy Louis XV, the man who kept his mistress, the infamous Madame DuBarry, at the palace to satisfy his passion.Some of the minor characters receive great readings from among others, Judy Davis, who is perfect as the Comtesse Noailles. Rose Byrne is Marie Antoinette's best friend, Asia Argento vamps as Madame DuBarry. Steve Coogan is a great Mercy. Marianne Faithful is seen as the Empress Marie Teresa and Danny Huston is Joseph, Marie Antoinette's brother.""Marie Antoinette"" is a great spectacle. It kept reminding this viewer of those large pictures in the Louvre by Jean-Louis David. Oh, and it case you hadn't noticed, Sofia Coppola clearly demonstrates she is a director to reckoned with.",Marie Antoinette
14,CinemaSerf,No wonder the peasants were revolting!,6,10 November 2020,"This is certainly a sumptuous and colourful interpretation of the life of the ill-fated Marie Antoinette from Sofia Coppola but I found the casting really let it down. Kirsten Dunst, in the title role, certainly captures the purported thoughtlessness and flightiness of her character, but offers little by way of any deeper exploration into her character, or that of her really oddly cast husband, the Dauphin/Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) and of their profligate indifference that ultimately led to their comeuppance. Though impressive on paper, the supporting cast - including Rip Torn in probably the most bizarre role of his career as Louis XV as well as early and completely unremarkable appearances from Tom Hardy and Jamie Dornan again do little to elevate this beyond an exceptionally well crafted, but poorly written costume drama that at times is almost a pantomime. It is certainly the most sanitised film rendition of a brutal revolution that I've ever seen. Great to look at, but at a shade over 2 hours - quite a slog to watch if you are looking for substance.",Marie Antoinette
15,dbborroughs,Life of the idle rich is idle,5,2 November 2006,"The life of Marie Antoinette in the French court. Abandoned by her husband Marie is left to her own devices and behaves as any young rich girl her age would, she shops and gossips and tries to fill her time entertainingly.Sure to win tons of end of year awards for its technical achievements this film is rather inert dramatically. I'm sure that there is something to the story but after the shot during the opening credits of Marie lounging on a couch while a servant serves her with a 1980's song about being young and rich playing in the background there really isn't anywhere to go. That one fleeting and stunning image says more in thirty seconds then the remaining two hours does.Beginning with Marie being sent to France to be married off the film instantly kills twenty minutes as Marie rides in the carriage to the new country. We watch for the better part of twenty minutes as she rides, changes and meets the in-laws. We then get the wedding (beautifully shot) and the wedding night, which is a real scream. After that Marie finds herself alone and we get some rather obvious montages set to a ""modern rock"" score. While I can admire say a sequence like where Marie shops to Bow Wow Wow's I Want Candy, I can also be frustrated by the fact that song has been used other times in exactly the same way. This film doesn't do anything new, or rather it does but pushes them to the background. The small bits where we see life in the court, and the ridiculous nature of it (ie. the wedding night, or allowing Marie to freeze as they determine who is the right person to hand her her clothes) are more interesting than everything else. Perhaps someone will take up the challenge and construct an interesting movie about that.As it stands now we have a beautiful movie, with occasional flashes of interesting material. Worth seeing if you're into opulent rich girl behavior, everyone else should wait for video.",Marie Antoinette
16,Bunuel1976,"MARIE ANTOINETTE (Sofia Coppola, 2006) **",5,10 July 2007,"Sofia Coppola, while evidently in possession of some directorial talent she inherited from her seemingly washed-out father Francis, has managed the unenviable feat of making progressively less interesting movies. Her latest venture was, in hindsight, unsurprisingly booed at its Cannes opening as, despite all the visual sumptuousness a lavish budget can afford – including Oscar-winning costume design and great locations – her film is a tedious misfire by the end of it. An eclectic, rather bizarre cast – including Rip Torn (as a lecherous Louis XV), Asia Argento (as his concubine, Madame Dubarry), Judy Davis (as a doting Countess), Danny Huston (as Marie Antoinette’s brother) and even Marianne Faithful (as her mother) – cannot fail to provide moments of interest but the young leads (Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman) are vacuous bores; I have watched the all-star 1938 Hollywood version only once but I don’t recall Marie Antoinette being the brainless pleasure-seeker pining for an heir she is depicted here. For what it’s worth, the utilization of a contemporary rock soundtrack took me by surprise at first but, when one gets used to it, works surprisingly well.",Marie Antoinette
17,writers_reign,Versailles Cake-walk,4,22 November 2007,"Sophia Coppola is clearly a disciple of the Baz Lurhman school of Sloppy Film-making in which the main purpose is to reinvent an actual historical period complete with real characters, some of whom have entered the history/reference books and impose upon it a juvenile ego which is blithely indifferent to facts and marches to the beat of a different drummer, preferably one immersed in Rock. Add a touch of nepotism - male lead Jason Schwartzman is her cousin - and in terms of self-centered insularity Coppola has hit one out of the park. There are some nice visuals but even those have a touch of fakery inasmuch as the existing furniture at Versailles was replaced with Set Designer Blue Plate Special so the best we can say is if you have absolutely no interest in French Culture/History and find nothing wrong with 21st century pop music informing 18th century France then chances are you'll have a ball.",Marie Antoinette
18,lastliberal,Royalty gone wild,7,9 March 2008,"Having had the privilege of seeing Versailles first hand, I was expecting a sumptuous feast and was not disappointed. Winning an Oscar for costumes, I cannot understand why it was not also a winner for art direction and makeup, but it did go up against Pan's Labyrinth.Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, it was an ambitious undertaking, and certainly to be criticized by historical purists, who think all movies should be documentaries if they dabble with facts. Just as book lovers expect all movies to be faithful renditions of their beloved tomes.I am sure Coppola played loose with the facts, but presented an engaging story of two young royals that were not prepared to lead. Whether spending time hunting or gambling, they were more interested in the pursuit of fun than the problems of France. At least they spent some of that money helping the American rebels throw off the English.Besides Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette, I certainly enjoyed Rip Torn as a randy Loius XV, who had a torrid affair with the lovely Comtesse du Barry (Asia Argento).",Marie Antoinette
19,Calicodreamin,Interesting cinematic style,7,29 July 2019,"The story of Marie Antoinette as told through quick snippets spanning her first introduction to France to her final night in Versailles. The movie certainly has an interesting / unique cinematography style. In that rarely are scenes longer than a few minutes and whole story lines aren't really played out. Instead it's glimpses into moments of Marie Antoinette's life as a French princess then later queen. The dialogue is very sparse, almost all the story telling is visual. All the music and language are modern, which makes it read as a revival (like that Romeo and Juliet with Leo).",Marie Antoinette
20,evanston_dad,A Piece of Candy,7,13 March 2007,"Those who want to learn the history of Marie Antoinette will not find it in Sofia Coppola's film.This movie raised more questions than it answered for me. I didn't know much of anything about this famous French monarch, other than that she was eventually beheaded (which is not shown in the film) and that Norma Shearer starred in a 1938 version of her story. I did a little bit of reading about Marie Antoinette after seeing Coppola's movie and decided that Coppola took much too frivolous an approach to the material. Many of the details about Marie Antoinette's life as first wife of the dauphin and then queen are present, but if you don't know her story before watching the film, they may slide right past you without notice, even some quite significant ones. Coppola doesn't provide an historical context in which to place the film's action; therefore, we understand that certain things are important without understanding why. Why, for example, do the French end up hating her and Louis XVI so much? What mistakes do they make as leaders that drives their country to such a desperate point? The film ends with the king and queen fleeing the palace of Versailles -- there's a heck of a lot of story left to tell after that event, but it's not recorded here. I suspect Coppola was trying to put us in the queen's place -- she was a young, immature girl who was thrust into a position for which she was not emotionally ready. In the film, politics bore her, and she would much rather buy clothes and gossip. The job of running a country remains a vague nuisance pushed into the background. But this point of view approach backfires. We don't learn enough about what's at stake to ever feel especially concerned about Marie Antoinette or what happens to her, and the character itself isn't vivid.So why am I ultimately recommending the film? Because it's lively, colorful and extremely well directed. It reminded me of Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"": there's no substance to the movie, but it's so meticulously detailed in its production design, and it so faithfully recreates the rituals of 18th Century France, that it's absolutely fascinating on those terms alone. I enjoyed the anachronisms Coppola brings to the film: Kirsten Dunst, playing the title role, and Jason Schwartzman, as Louis XVI, speak in a slangy American dialect that doesn't even attempt to convince us that either of them is European; in one scene, during a flashy montage showing Antoinette and her female cohorts enjoying the frivolity and excess for which she was so notorious, we get a glimpse of Converse sneakers discarded in the background; and most notably, most of the soundtrack consists of contemporary pop tunes that comment on the action, and if they frequently take the burden of telling the story away from Coppola and her actors, they're also a lot of fun.Ultimately, ""Marie Antoinette"" resembles one of the many gooey, decadent candies that the queen consumes throughout the film -- completely lacking in substance, but lovely to look at and perfectly suited to satisfy a craving for something sweet.Grade: A-",Marie Antoinette
21,ferguson-6,All the French Dogs you want,5,20 October 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sophie Coppola has two brilliant films to her credit already: ""Lost in Translation"" and ""The Virgin Suicides"". Beginning one's directing career with those two can only lead to unrealistic expectations. So, yes I will admit to a bit of anticipation for ""Marie Antoinette"", and yes I now feel truly disappointed.Ms. Coppola again shows her remarkable eye with a visual feast of sets, costumes, make-up and poses. What makes this one so tough to take is that she totally forgets to give us a story or make us care about anyone in the film. I will even use the word BORING. The slow pacing works beautifully at first as we are forced to endure the endless string of passionless nights and daytime distance that the two newlyweds go through. However, once Marie gets over that hurdle and decides to live her life, the film should have taken off with fun, frivolity and festiveness. Even the parties seem slow! Kirsten Dunst does an admirable job as the young queen who is so naive and alone and in pain. Watching the film leaves us with the feeling that much of the guts of the film were left on the editing room floor. Jason Schwartzman (so fine in ""Shopgirl"" and ""Rushmore"") is perfectly cast and he does a nice job of underplaying his character. The wonderful Judy Davis is downright frightening in her scenes with Dunst - is she wearing a neck prosthesis or are those really her neck ligaments? Marianne Faithful (still alive after the Jagger years), Shirley Henderson, Steve Coogan and Rip Torn are all fine in their roles, although Molly Shannon is totally out of place in Versailles.Ms. Coppola again shows her knack for perfect music selections for mood and scene, but it is just not enough to save this one. No way this disappointment will keep me from her next outing, but my expectations might be a bit lower for that one.",Marie Antoinette
22,anaconda-40658,Coppola Flashes It Up.,5,19 June 2015,"Marie Antoinette (2006): Dir: Sophia Coppola / Cast: Kirsten Dunst, Jason Schwartzman, Judy Davis, Rip Torn, Steve Coogan: Controversial story about the teenage French Queen given in marriage to King Louis XVI. Several things become apparent throughout her reign. First, she is too young to understand the corny and sometimes ridiculous traditions. Second, her lifestyle led to constant scandal. Third, her marriage was loveless and unfeeling, which resulted in pressure from higher officials. Sophia Coppola previously made the marvelous Lost in Translation, and here she has fun with some of the lifestyles. However the third act feels incomplete and she seems to pile too much information in at once before viewers can digest what has already taken place. Kirsten Dunst carries the film as Antoinette in her colourful fashion and the hole she is about to fall into. Flat performances by Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI in what seems to be miscasting, as well as Judy Davis and Rip Torn who can do better than this. Coppola makes great use of colour in her sets and locations but the screenplay falters in lunacy. Here is a film with such potential yet is seems to go in another direction with no real focus or aim in its marketing. Sets are colourful adding to the lifestyles and customs but the real issue is someone too young placed into a world too old to understand. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Marie Antoinette

It would have been better to show her life till the end for some balance and poignancy.The rock music score is totally wrong.

24,Wuchakk,"Luxurious, carefree life in the Palace of Versailles before the storm (the French Revolution)",8,1 January 2018,"RELEASED IN 2006 and written & directed by Sofia Coppola, ""Marie Antoinette "" chronicles France's iconic but doomed queen, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), from just prior to her betrothal & marriage to Louis XVI at 15 in 1770 to her reign as queen at 19, her eventual decline, and the close of her reign with the fall of the Palace of Versailles, located a few miles West of Paris.This is an opulent and beautifully stylized interpretation of the historical events combining period tunes with anachronistic modern music (new wave, post-punk and electronica), which successfully humanizes the historical figures and their world for a contemporary audience. The first two acts effectively show what life in Versailles was like for royalty & nobles in the 18th century; but the last act subtly conveys the looming upheaval of the brutal French Revolution, which was the consequence of foolish spending and blithe, luxuriant living without concern for the common people. THE FILM RUNS 2 hours 3 minutes and was shot in France with studio work done at Pinewood Studios, England. WRITER: Sofia based her script on Antonia Fraser's book Marie Antoinette: The Journey. BOX OFFICE: With a budget of $40 million, the film took in a little over $60 million worldwide. GRADE: B+/A-",Marie Antoinette
25,gradyharp,As Beautiful as a Fabrege Egg and as Empty,5,16 February 2007,"Sofia Coppola offers another look at history's infamous Marie Antoinette, the premise being that she was in life just a simple young Austrian girl delivered to France as a political queen candidate, who liked pretty things, loved children, flowers, clothes, shopping, and sweets, and lived a life oblivious to the political turmoil outside the confines of Versailles until it was too late. Coppola delivers her side of history with a maximum budget, endless sumptuous costumes, shoes, wigs, oft-changed costumed huge cast, top of the line creative cuisine and pastries, a nice little performance by Kirsten Dunst, an extended tour inside Versailles and two hours of minimal dialogue about rather inconsequential matters.Coppola does mix contemporary music with period music, an anachronism that is not additive but does allow us to see snippets of Rameau's 'Platee' (and a cut version of Susan Graham as Gluck's 'Orfeo' singing 'Che faro Euridice' in French translation on a beautiful stage with a sensuous nude model lying at her feet). And if Coppola's purpose is to demonstrate how the 'media', whether that be printed or verbal history, has painted an incorrect picture of a charming young child/lady who happened to be blissfully unaware of the changes of the day, she has succeeded. It just doesn't seem to be enough story for a two hour slick magazine spread on indulgences in France of the late 18th century.The cast is well chosen: Judy Davis exudes court etiquette as Comtesse de Noailles, Rip Torn is a fine Louis XV more interested in his consort du Barry as well imitated by Asia Argento, Steve Coogan is Steve Coogan as Ambassador Mercy, Rose Byrne keeps the story afloat as Duchesse de Polignac, and Jason Schwartzman makes us understand why the distracted Louis XVI capitalized the troubles of a clueless court during the time of Revolution.The endless costume changes are entertaining to the eye but about as repetitive as the too frequent boudoir lack of activity between Marie and Louis. This is one of those films where the Featurette on the DVD makes the evening worth tolerating; it is fresh, funny, informative, allows bonuses, and ultimately explains why the movie was made in the first place. As for the film itself, it is a long static song. Grady Harp",Marie Antoinette
26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Marie Antoinette (2006),8,9 June 2007,"Sofia Coppola takes on a historical character in Marie Antoinette, providing her own vision of the doomed Queen of France and the French Monarchy under the reign of Louis XVI, based upon the biography written by Antonia Fraser.Kirsten Dunst, whom we ever so often remember with red hair for her Mary Jane Watson roles in the Spider-Man series, plays the titular role, bringing forth girly innocence, frustration and strength as her character develops through the course of the movie. Sofia Coppola clearly made this movie focused on events from her point of view, covering major incidents and happenings in her life.I thought the first half of the movie was excellent, where Marie gets married to the Dauphin of France Louis XVI, a marriage of strategic importance to seal the Austrian and French alliance, but one which seems to be stuck in the ruts because of incompatibility. She likes theatre, he's into hunting. She's into fashion, and he's into locks and keys. Consummating their marriage is a problem, and remains a major obstacle and puts constant strain on Marie Antoinette, because without producing an heir to the throne, her position in the court is always precarious, not to mention, without influence to further advance Austrian interest.But don't forget, she's but a teenager, and Sofia Coppola never fails to remind us of that - the difficulty of a young one living within the constricting protocols of a monarchy. And not to mention under public scrutiny all the time. Although a period movie, Coppola managed to bring forth the issues faced into current time, since the themes and events explored are quite similar to the contemporary era. The bitching, the rumour mongering, and the superficial small talk of people of perceived importance are nothing new in this day and age, and Marie more often than not is the favourite subject for the tabloids.It's not all sympathetic to the character though, as her vices like gambling, drinking and rumoured dalliances with Count Fersen in her holiday home of Petit Trianon are played out, together with her rather callous attitude toward what was happening to the commonfolk. While politics is rarely touched upon, the portrayal of the King's handling of foreign policy for face rather than taking care of his subjects is probably one of the fundamental contributing factor to its downfall, and France is shown to be slowly bankrupted while sending aid to American for the revolutionaries to fight against the British, unaware of growing resentment in home soil.The second half felt more of a rush job, with Marie's spiral into unpopularity with her perceived extravagant decadence. It's a reminder of how someone's image can be greatly tainted by uncorrected, vicious rumours, and when the power of the people is at full force, you can't help but submit when all is lost. Some have questioned why the movie didn't pursue all the way until the final demise of Marie Antoinette, but frankly, looking at the film's treatment of the character, there's actually no need to, and all in all, quite a balanced presentation on how an historical character is brought to life on screen.With beautiful costumes, rich colours, and sets based within the actual Palace of the Versailles, it's a pity that this movie did not make it to our local screens, and I believe watching it on the big screen will make all the difference. For those who want to take a look at the much talked about easter egg in the movie, the Converse shoes are shown at the 55:48 mark.",Marie Antoinette
27,JamesHitchcock,The Girl Next Door as Queen,5,26 October 2006,"A word which has been much used, at least in the British press, to describe this film, is ""revisionist"", but that seems inappropriate. A revisionist version of history is one which seeks to challenge or overturn accepted viewpoints, but today the general view among historians is that Louis XVI was conscientious and well-meaning, although shy and awkward and not endowed with any great force of intellect or personality, and that Marie Antoinette, although frivolous and extravagant, was far from being the monster of popular legend. Indeed, it is generally agreed that she had some positive qualities- she was, for example, a loyal friend and a devoted mother to her children. That is precisely the picture of the Royal couple which the film portrays. Today, a truly ""revisionist"" film would be one which attempted to restore the old propagandist picture of Louis as a bloodthirsty tyrant and of Antoinette as a debauched bisexual nymphomaniac who heartlessly advised her starving subjects to eat cake.The film starts with the marriage of the fourteen year old princess to the French Dauphin as part of a diplomatic initiative to cement the alliance between France and her native Austria. It then follows her life at Versailles- her frustration with Court protocol, her quarrels with Louis XV's mistress Madame du Barry, the accession of her husband as King upon the death of his grandfather, her struggle to produce an heir and the eventual birth of her children. The film ends with the outbreak of the French Revolution, but does not depict the events leading up to Antoinette's death on the guillotine. (When the Royal couple drive off in a coach at the end of the film they are not, as some reviewers have assumed, going to their deaths- they are being taken to Paris where it is hoped they will reign as constitutional monarchs). The one controversial element is the assertion- not supported by all historians- that she had an adulterous affair with the Swedish Count Fersen.It seemed to me that the film missed a great opportunity. Had the Revolution never happened, the French would today doubtless regard Marie Antoinette in much the same way as the British regard her contemporary Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz - that is to say for most of the time they would not think of her at all, and when they did it would be as a name from a half-remembered history lesson, the consort of one of their country's duller kings. The only interest of Marie Antoinette for a modern audience is as the Queen who lost her life at the hands of the revolutionaries, and any biography of her, filmed or otherwise, is incomplete if it does not attempt to analyse why the Revolution broke out or why a section of the French population had come to detest their Royal family to such an extent that they were prepared to acquiesce in their execution. There are occasional references to food shortages, or to people's discontent at Royal extravagance and at involvement in the War of American Independence (highly unpopular in France), but these are never fully integrated into the story. The only time we see the ordinary people it is as an angry mob outside the gates of Versailles.Indeed, it sometimes seems as though Sofia Coppola pays lip-service to the Revolution in the interests of strict historical accuracy but otherwise treats it as an unwelcome interruption to the story she really wants to tell, which is the story of Marie Antoinette as the Princess Diana of the eighteenth century. Like Diana, Coppola's Antoinette is a young girl trapped in a loveless marriage to a man who cares more for his private interests- hunting and making locks- than for her. Like Diana, she is bored and frustrated by the routine and rigidity of life at Court. (The Bourbons seem to have been particularly stuffy even by the standards of eighteenth-century royalty). Like Diana, she is more spontaneous and outgoing than her emotionally reserved husband and the courtiers surrounding him. (She bursts into applause, something normally forbidden by protocol, at the opera). And, like Diana, she finds consolation in an affair with a handsome soldier, Fersen standing in for James Hewitt. The one thing lacking is a Camilla-figure, but Louis XVI was so notoriously sexless (it took him several years to consummate his marriage) that a royal mistress would not have rung true. Kirsten Dunst does not seem particularly regal, but that does not really matter as her cute charm fits in perfectly with Coppola's vision of the Queen of France as girl-next-door. (Diana, although an aristocrat by birth, was seen as the People's Princess, the girl-next-door as future Queen of Britain). Dunst's slimline figure also seems wrong for the famously voluptuous Antoinette, who was more Diana Dors than Diana Spencer.The best thing about the film was its visual recreation, in the best ""heritage cinema"" style, of the period; much was actually shot on location at Versailles. (The use of modern pop music on the soundtrack, however, was jarring).The 1760s and 1770s were a period of such riotous extravagance in interior decoration, in clothing and even in hair styles that any film set among the fashionable classes of this period cannot help but be visually sumptuous. (By the 1780s fashions had calmed down somewhat- the dresses Antoinette wears in the latter part of the film are considerably simpler and more elegant than those seen earlier). Good looks, however, are not enough to make a good film. ""Marie Antoinette"" is somewhat better than Sofia Coppola's previous effort, the overrated ""Lost in Translation, but it is a dull, slow-moving film, lacking either dramatic tension or insight into this of this period of French history. 5/10",Marie Antoinette
28,StevePulaski,Maybe better if was a bit more in-depth on The French Rev.,8,7 March 2011,"While Marie Antoinette is beautifully directed and acted, there is somewhat of an annoyance that goes through my mind as I watch it. It could be the fact I'm not into many period pieces, or just the fact that the film is a bit slow it doesn't matter. Marie Antoinette is a glorious look at the 17th century France, and how they reacted to a foreign queen leading the country.The film doesn't go into The French Revolution too much which is a shame. I could see a violent and gruesome film rise from those ashes. It's a shocker no one has made a French Rev. film in quite sometime. I'd like to see a $70 million film on bloody beatings, rage, and hatred for the government. We just got a taste of that in Egypt not too long ago.The plot focuses on Marie Antoinette (Dunst) as she moves into Versailles at the age of fourteen and becomes Queen of France five years later. The film is a pretty accurate description of her life, and that's about the extent of the plot.One of Marie's biggest problems is she came from Austria, and is a foreigner to the French community. She's treated unfairly and it's almost like she is the uncool girl at school trying desperately to fit in and be accepted by her peers. What she went through seemed tough, but by the end of her ruling when TFR gets into high gear it becomes more her and Louis' fault as she starts to bring the blame on herself.Kristen Dunst gives a beautiful performance her. She pretty much always looks her best in the film, and is a very attractive women throughout. The attention to detail on France, the costume design, the characters, and pretty much everything is pristine, and it does it's best to look like it was in the 17th century. It achieves at that goal.What Marie Antoinette really has going for it is it's ravishingly gorgeous costume design. I mentioned the attention to detail is pristine, but the costumes are just simply breathtaking. It's Oscar worthy material in the Art Direction field.Marie Antoinette was directed by Sofia Coppola, the daughter of the director Francis Ford Coppola. Sofia does a pretty nice job at adapting this story to film, but her film before this Lost in Translation, I found, to be more entertaining. Marie Antoinette achieves at being a well documented film on the life of Marie, but doesn't seem as good as it could've been. If maybe it started later in her life and went on into The French Rev. it could've been more respectable, but regardless, it's still a film with beautiful people and costumes. I can give it that.Starring: Kristen Dunst, Jason Schwartzman, Judy Davis, Rip Torn, and Rose Byrne. Directed by: Sofia Coppola.",Marie Antoinette
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Marie-Antoinette, the Paris Hilton of the 1700's",5,1 March 2007,"In high school in my history class, we had a little segment where we learned about Marie-Antoinette and what her life was like and why she was murdered. It's plain and simple in four little words ""Bored Little Rich Girl"", but I think deep down she wasn't a bad person, money probably changed her. I had no interest though in seeing Marie-Antoinette because I still have a very strong grudge against Sophia Coppola for ""Virgin Suicides"", but my mom rented the movie and said that it was really good and to give it a chance. While it was better than what I expected, it still didn't thrill me, I'll explain in moment.Based on Marie-Antoinette's life and how she came into extreme wealth and soon to become the queen of France, we learn the different side of what she was and how she was forced to leave Austria to marry a very hesitate prince who seems very scared about creating a baby with her. After people pressuring her to have a baby and saying her marriage has failed, they finally have a baby girl, but the king dies making her husband king and her queen of France and Marie definitely takes advantage of all the riches of a wealthy life. That is until the peasants are upset since they are starving and Marie simply responds ""Let them eat cake"".While it was a lot better than what I expected, I still had a few problems with the movie, first off, I think Sophia didn't have total respect for the story, because she could have made it more unique and enjoyable to watch. The music was very awkward and out of place, I know there are some movies that want to make it an up to date feel, but this time it just felt very strange for where it was supposed to take place. But still I have to say this is something that wasn't bad, just could have been better.5/10",Marie Antoinette

31,sddavis63,"""This Is Ridiculous!"" - ""This, Madam, Is Versailles!""",6,17 November 2012,"I want to say, first, that I'm impressed that this movie is based on a book by Antonia Fraser. Antonia Fraser is a royal historian of great note, so if - and I realize that, as with any movie, that's a very big ""IF"" - the movie really follows Fraser's work (which I unfortunately haven't read) then we're probably getting a fairly reasonable depiction of Marie Antoinette, and my impression is that, indeed, this is a reasonable taste of her life, up to the point at which Marie and King Louis are removed from Versailles and taken to Paris. The movie ends with their departure from Versailles; there's nothing of Louis' attempt to hold on to the throne by agreeing to become a constitutional monarch, the royal attempt at escape, or their trial and execution.I rather liked the take on Marie Antoinette that was offered. Kirsten Dunst did very well with the role - she even looks a bit like Marie Antoinette. I really liked her in the role, and I thought she captured Marie's basic identity. I've always thought of Marie Antoinette as a bit of a tragic figure - not callous and uncaring as she's often portrayed (largely because of the belief that, when confronted by the fact that the people were starving because they had no bread, she replied ""Qu'ils mangent de la brioche"" - ""let them eat cake"" - which there's no solid evidence of her ever having done) but rather simply oblivious to what was happening outside court simply as a result of her pampered upbringing, which wasn't her fault - it was just the reality of her birth and her life. Yes, she was spoiled and pampered and largely cut off from reality by living at court, but I don't think that made her uncaring about what the people were going through - I think it made her oblivious to it because it was so far out of her reality. The movie and Dunst captured that.The sets and costuming in this were quite well done, and in general the cast was solid. I admit that I was a bit taken aback when I saw that Rip Torn was in this (he plays King Louis XV, Marie's father in law.) Maybe - as Marie was oblivious to the plight of her people - I've been oblivious to what's happening with Rip, because I didn't even know he was still around. But - like everyone else - he was fine. Sophia Coppola directed this and did well with it for the most part. It's certainly not the fastest paced movie you'll ever see, but Coppola managed to keep me interested and she made a brilliant decision by contrasting two scenes at the Paris Opera House that portrayed the rising opposition to Marie among the French people. In the first, she attends the opera and begins to applaud when it's over, which the French royals weren't supposed to do. Taken aback at first, the audience eventually joins in with her applause enthusiastically. Later in the movie, the same scene happens - Marie in the Opera House applauding at the end of the opera - except that this time no one joins her. Instead, people stare at her with disapproval, perhaps even barely disguised contempt. Those two scenes captures the flow of the movie well.For all that I liked, the one thing that I didn't like - indeed, it irritated me throughout - was the decision to try to give this a modern feel by interspersing various modern elements (especially the repeated use of rock music as a musical score.) It didn't fit and it was little more than distracting for the most part. The movie (for me at least) made the sorry decision to open that way, which put me off right from the start. There's also a pair of high top converse shoes that appears briefly. Supposedly, Coppola used these devices to remind us of the youth of the main character. I just found it unnecessary and out of place. I did - unlike some - like the ending of the movie. It simply depicts Louis and Marie being driven away from Versailles. I didn't need the rest of the history that I mentioned above. The movie was already long enough, and in any event it was about why Marie was so out of touch with the reality of life in 18th century France. It succeeded in that, even if it was a bit slow moving at times, and even with that irritating and out of place music. (6/10)",Marie Antoinette
32,Buddy-51,understated historical drama,8,7 November 2006,"Perhaps unfairly, the name Marie Antoinette has become virtually synonymous with the upper class' indifference to the sufferings of the poor. Even all these centuries later, many people still believe that the much-maligned French queen actually uttered the words, ""Let them eat cake,"" when confronted with the news that her subjects were starving (the phrase actually comes from a play popular at the time). Writer/director Sofia Coppola's new film, ""Marie Antoinette,"" based on the book ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey"" by Antonia Fraser, seems determined to clear her name and change that perception.In this film, Marie Antoinette is seen as a sheltered, somewhat frivolous young girl unprepared for the role history was about to thrust upon her. The movie begins at the moment when the Archduchess of Austria, aged 14, has been promised in wedlock to France's Prince Louis XVI as part of a treaty between the two countries. She is quickly whisked away to her new nation and new role, becoming a virtual prisoner to the proscribed rites and regulations of court life at Versailles in the late 18th Century.In a wise move artistically (if not commercially), Coppola has seen fit to bleed the film of most of its potential hyperbole and melodrama, choosing instead to concentrate on the gossipy pettiness and mind-numbing rituals of royal life at that time. We see Marie completely stripped of any sense of personal privacy, as she endures the indignities of a virtual cast of thousands having a hand in her dressing herself in the morning and being constantly under the watchful eye of moral advisers on the lookout for any breach of etiquette or protocol deemed unbecoming of a queen. Coppola immerses us in all the finery and opulence of the glittery setting, while the drama ever so subtly plays itself out. Even though Marie clearly resents the restricted life she is forced to endure, she rarely whines or wallows in self-pity, choosing instead to accept her role with an uncomplaining, almost fatalistic, good grace. Even when her husband refuses for years to consummate their marriage, she remains generally sympathetic to him and understanding of his ""problem."" There are those who will find this movie slow-moving, stultifying, and boring because it doesn't go over-the-top by focusing on major moments of crisis or by overplaying the queen's famed cruelty or self-indulgence. She is, instead, seen as a woman neither actively engaged in the outside world nor entirely dismissive of it. Some have objected to the fact that the filmmakers have stacked the deck in her favor by showing us so little of what life was like for the suffering populace of the nation. But it is just that insularity that helps us to see how a woman with such an apparently good heart could have been so badly misunderstood by those in her own time and by generations that followed. At the end, when she and her family are being carted off to certain doom by a mob thirsting for rectification and vengeance, she seems genuinely bewildered, yet also strangely heroic in her stoicism and grace. Much of this is due to the tour de force performance by Kirsten Dunst, who never overstates the obvious but allows us to see the complex woman trapped beneath all the jewel-encrusted trappings of pampered French royalty. Marie may not display an interest in world affairs or the arcane machinations involved in running a nation, but she is shrewd enough to know how to maneuver her way through the often absurdly arbitrary power politics of court life.The movie has garnered perhaps its greatest notoriety for employing an anachronistic rock music soundtrack (a la ""A Knight's Tale""). For me, this worked fairly well (though I don't think it is indispensable to the film by any stretch), mainly because it brings a more contemporary sensibility to a film that might otherwise feel weighted down by period piece stuffiness. History-obsessed purists may object to the choice, but even they may find compensation in the relatively understated and historically accurate approach the screenplay has taken towards her life as a whole.""Marie Antoinette"" is, more than anything else, a study of repression, of what happens when human beings are locked into figurative gilded cages and then are expected to go about their daily lives as if anything really mattered. Seen in that light, this is a very sad, very poignant - though often quite funny - movie indeed.",Marie Antoinette
33,Robert_duder,"Mind boggingly boring! No historical epic, no action, and not worthy of 5 minutes",1,29 January 2008,"I love history, I love historical epics and I thought a new sharp update on the Marie Antoinette story would be terrific!! I couldn't have been more wrong. I'm blown away by the amount of people that could actually find anything even remotely interesting or entertaining about this movie but then I've been on the other side of that argument in various movies as well. To each their own but my own for this movie is that it was drop dead awful. I try to never turn a film off no matter how much I'm hating it and it was dreadfully brutal getting through this one and by the time it was half way through I was half watching it and half reading a book and I kept looking up from my book and thinking 'My God, is this still on?' The sheer fact that Sofia Coppola who directed and wrote this movie is Oscar nominated director and Oscar winning writer is sheer mind blowing. Although maybe it wasn't entirely her responsibility because there was simply one thing that made me not give this horrendous snooze fest a ZERO and that is the fact that its very, very pretty...but if this doesn't prove looks aren't everything than nothing does. The costumes are outstanding, enormous, larger than life and that is where it ends period.Now none of this blame will fall on its young star. Kirsten Dunst plays the lovely Marie Antoinette who comes from Austria to marry the French Dauphin. Dunst is very good, very spirited, cute, sexy even in some scenes and does carry the movie just fine considering it has no story, no action, no climax or anything else worthwhile. This was a disgrace to her talent. Jason Schwartzman barely has a pulse as the insatiably BORING Louis XVI. Rip Torn is a joke and barely noticeable as Louis XV and Judy Davis (an award worthy actress) is annoying and nagging as Dunst's mother. No one else is worth mentioning because everyone acts the same, there is different characters or stand out performances outside of Dunst's performance.When I originally saw trailers for this film I thought it was less historical or more of this hip retelling of the story complete with modern music which instead of being throughout the film is randomly thrown in there just to make things seem strange. They also would lead you to believe in the trailers that Antoinette is this wild child Queen who shakes everything up and she barely even shakes herself up. Everyone is simply dreadfully boring. Basically every idea you might have about this film from trailers is completely wrong. Other than the beautiful costume design and Dunst there is absolutely no reason to even look at this. You can see everything worth seeing in five minutes and save yourself the disaster of sitting through this. Dunst is sexualized in various costumes and situations to try and make it seem more interesting but it doesn't work. Oscar or no Oscar Coppola should be banned from movies for making this. 1/10",Marie Antoinette
34,richardchatten,The Queen of Versailles,7,4 November 2020,"The real Marie Antoinette, like Cleopatra or Joan of Arc (or for that matter Elizabeth II and Margaret Thatcher) never remotely resembles the original historical individual when portrayed onscreen; and pert little modern miss Kirsten Durnst is no more like the woman bitterly described by the French peasantry as ""the Austrian Woman"" than Norma Shearer was nearly seven decades earlier.Actually described in the film as ""looking like a piece of cake"" and, like the rest of this sumptuous production, looking good enough to eat, watching her sashay about Versailles in big hair and the pastal shades of her Oscar-winning wardrobe by Milena Canonero is agreeable enough at first. But at over two hours it does eventually drag.And I'm not the first to complain about the ending.",Marie Antoinette
35,dromasca,you cannot stay indifferent to this Marie Antoinette,6,24 July 2008,"For those who come to see this movie with the expectation of seeing some historical drama or biography, this is a very different and special experience. Sofia Coppola in 'Marie Antoinette' takes the pretext of the life of the famous and infamous last queen of France and makes out of it a drama about the solitude of a young girl in a strange environment. Acted superbly by Kirsten Dunst Coppola's Marie Antoinette looks at some instances like a teenager today with modern haircut, closer to Scarlett Johansson's character in 'Lost in Translation' than to the historical character. Is the experiment successful on all plans? Certainly not, as the film gets too much into the details of the life at the court, of the garments and chocolates and interior decoration, at the expense of the differentiation of the characters that surround Marie Antoinette. So much is the movie centered around her that it is hard to distinguish the other characters around. The usage of punk music has a strong effect at the start, plays well in the ball scene, but starts to fit well later and becomes too repetitive. What we get overall is an interesting and different movie, but not a perfect one.",Marie Antoinette
36,MLDinTN,eye candy without much plot,4,1 November 2007,"I really liked all the costumes, scenery, and makeup; however, the movie as a whole wasn't that entertaining. Also, it is a little weird watching a movie about the French when they all talk like Americans. The movie is about Maie Antoinette as a teenager. We see her movie to France, marry soon to be king Louie, and what her life was like right after marriage. I don't know how factual this is, but the film depicts the 2 newlyweds as ""cold"" in the bedroom. Not really anything is happening there. And Marie needs to have an heir to solidify her standing in France. She is humiliated when Louie's younger brother has a child before they do. It shows her gambling, partying and during this time the masses of France are living in poverty and starving. The very ending shows the angry mobs outside the palace and the ending shows the royal family being taken away and it ends like that. I didn't like that ending either. It was too abrupt.I didn't think any of the actors had any memorable roles. It was simply a blah type of movie.FINAL VERDICT: I think it is aimed toward teens, but they would find it boring. I wouldn't watch it again.",Marie Antoinette
37,tabuno,A Contemporary Vision of Marie,7,21 January 2019,"9 April 2007. Unfortunately, this stunning ""Lost in Translation"" version of Marie Antoinette suffers from a discordant musical soundtrack that while commendable, doesn't always sync with the feel of the visual components of the movie and the photography while appealing most of the time is sometimes distractively different to the point of feeling amateur. Overall though Sofia Coppola has successfully brought to the screen a visceral and delightful vision of contemporary update using music and an informal vibrant look behind the real personages of this era. There are brilliant scenes and performances that capture an authentic experience of real conversations, real feelings and the difficult transition between Austrian and French cultures.

38,filipemanuelneto,Great scenery and costumes... but a mediocre concept for a movie.,3,14 May 2016,"This film seeks to present the life of Queen Marie Antoinette of France from a sweet perspective, since the moment she arrives at the French court until the beginning of the Revolution. With direction and screenplay of Sofia Coppola, this movie features Kirsten Dunst as the French queen.When I saw this movie for the first time I loved it because of the scenarios (the Palace of Versailles is, definitely, one of the most beautiful and iconic in the world) and the historical accuracy of the costumes (this film won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and certainly deserved it). But even during this initial view, I don't like the way, very light and almost adolescent, as the film tells the story of this French queen, whose life was much less happy than was shown. In fact, when I was watching it a second time, and after the initial amazement, I understand that this film strips all drama of Marie Antoinette's, turning her in the baroque equivalent of a frivolous and spoiled teenager of our time. This was a total mistake and doesn't help to see her from a more human perspective (if that was Coppola's intention). The film focuses on the clothes, the gold, the luxury and the court flirtations, having the dramatic depth of a glass of champagne. Sofia Coppola ignored the history of the queen who wanted to present, ignored the reality of France at that time, ignored how to make a good movie... well, she ignored everything that should have never ignored. I will not even going to comment on the mediocrity of the soundtrack or that unfortunate scene of the All-Star shoes. Not worth talking about it. What this movie is good is the scenery and costumes. Just that, and that isn't enough to make it a good movie.",Marie Antoinette

My fellow citizens have annihilated Monarchy and if nobody deserves death, you understand that I don't really enjoy movies that focus about the Royals and that wrongly put them as icons! This one has in addition a special statute being directed by the daughter of one the biggest name in cinema history: so it's again about families, reproduction of blood, well everything that was condemned by my Revolution (and here, this famous historical quote is even erased). If I analyze her level forgetting her name, I would say that she doesn't seem really inspired: the movie is flat, not dynamic, as linear and repetitive as the court life and at the end, I don't see gripping moments The only thing that makes the movie alive is the vitality of Kirsten Dunst and for sure the real (or rebuilt) locations of Versailles. So the movie depicts really how golden this cage was.. Maybe the desire to be a mother is sincere but to be blind to the needs of the people while getting well stuffed everyday can't lead to respect and interest from this same people, yesterday, today or tomorrow",Marie Antoinette
40,digitalbeachbum,Junk,1,5 September 2021,"This is not what I expected. There is extremely limited historical fact in the movie. The use of modern songs really diminishes the movie. I didn't like the casting either. Kirsten Dunst isn't a 14 year old Marie Antoinette, she isn't a 33 year old version either. Jason Schwartzman doesn't have much to work with because the director Sofia Coppola didn't have a clue what she was doing. What exactly is this supposed to be anyway? Are you supposed to drop acid while watching this mess? How could anyone screw this up so badly?The only saving parts to the movie are the costume design, makeup and hairstyling and the cinematography. The rest of it is terrible. I don't understand how they can win Best Costume Design but use Converse sneakers in the movie?Even though I was repulsed by the opening song, I pushed on through to the 40 minute mark about the time they used Bow Wow Wow ""I Want Candy""??? Oh brother, what the hell?What bothers me is the contradiction between Coppola's response. First it was ""The real human behind the myth"" but then saying ""It is not a lesson in history"". Well which is it? If you are going to be presenting the real human behind the mythCoppola responded to the critics by explaining that she was interested in showing ""the real human being behind the myths...""My goal was to capture in the design the way in which I imagined the essence of Marie Antoinette's spirit...so the film's candy colors, its atmosphere and teenaged music all reflect and are meant to evoke how I saw that world from Marie Antoinette's perspective.""In several 2006 interviews, Coppola suggests that her highly stylized interpretation was intentionally very modern in order to humanize the historical figures involved. She admitted taking great artistic liberties with the source material, and said that the film does not focus simply on historical facts - ""It is not a lesson of history. It is an interpretation documented, but carried by my desire for covering the subject differently.""",Marie Antoinette
41,jzappa,"A Very Good, Oft-Misunderstood Act of Sympathy for Perhaps the 1st Victim of Antagonizing Celebrity Misrepresentation",7,14 September 2008,"Like Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation, this follow-up highlights the isolation of being a woman and bounded by a world that understands how to exploit you but not how to appreciate and understand you. It demonstrates Coppola once more capable of extracting interpretation from actresses who are hardly ever compelled to express it. Kristen Dunst uses an innocent passivity as the title character, as a 14-year-old Austrian princess who is basically bought and traded to the French court to connect with the naive and oblivious Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) to manufacture an heir. She has self-possession, composure and cheerfulness, and they are limited to a world that provides her no manner in which to gainfully convey them. So she clowns around and spoils herself, contained by a bubble of harsh and unyielding royalty's code of behavior. Greed and isolation can breed arrogance, ignorance and lack of empathy.I know what many who have yet to see it probably think, and this movie is not instructive and comprehensive regarding the real government of the era. That is for the reason that we are exclusively inside Marie's world. And it is enclosed within Versailles, which excludes all peripheral certainty. It is an independent structural land mass that shuts out affairs of state, realism, destitution and the general public.Schwartzman portrays a sexually unreceptive pout who would more willingly offer condolences than assume an operating position. Danny Huston is amusing as Marie's older brother, introduced from Austria to gently infer to young Louis one or two essential hints on the subject of a little thing called sex. Horndog Louis XV played aptly by Rip Torn in a hilarious casting choice, would without a doubt need no encouragement to have sex with anybody, as his mistress, a madame played by Asia Argento (another daughter of a famous director) instantly discerns.Coppola does something I like very much, which is making use of setting to characterize the existence and personality of the characters. Permitted undivided admission into Versailles, she illustrates a civilization neurotically committed to the pampering of Marie Antoinette. Coppola's film has been passed judgment upon by some for her application of a modern pop top-lathering, mainly the emo pop rock soundtrack, but also inconsistent dialogue, jarring infringement of characteristics of the modern world superimposed upon 17th century France. But no one in the movie lives in 17th century France. Several people in historical movies appear in some way conscious that they are living in the times of yore. Marie gives the impression of a modern-day liberal-minded teenage girl, which sure enough she is, and the up to date pop allusions tempt the audience to share her what-the-hell attitude with ours, or should I say let-them-eat-cake. Shakespeare mixed eras, too.All criticism I have gathered of this film's respectable enough but quickly faded reception could easily alter its breakable sparkle and relegate its dreamy and heartbreaking affection for the real Marie Antoinette to the rank of an informative depiction by misunderstanding its unconventionality. However, its falling off can be mostly attributed to the common marketing stupidity in that few theaters in fact showed the movie on the publicized release date. In the face of the fact that the trailer presented a release date that was inevitably assumed to be nationwide since it said nothing of limited release or select cities, the movie only went to big cities on its opening weekend and in select theaters at that. It abstracted almost a month for it to trickle down to the majority of local cinemas and by then too much time had gone by for an adequate turnout. Everyone knows Marie Antoinette was guillotined and we expect her gruesome death with an unpleasant interest. Coppola skillfully circumvents a decapitation, and stays away from overstuffed riotous mob scenes by using light, sound and a balcony to manage Marie's execution as a curtain call. As she was made by the aristocracy, for all intents and purposes, to take the part of a princess, she is naively loyal to her imposed function.It is not needed to know anything about Marie Antoinette to get pleasure from this movie. Some of what we think we know is mistaken, as she was perhaps the first victim of antagonizing celebrity misrepresentation and today's interpretation of history has a lot of its residue. As maintained by Coppola's rendering, she never said, ""Let them eat cake."" ""I would never say that,"" she defends angrily. What she says is not ""cake"" but ""custard."" But, in spite of what you would think, the more you know about her, the more you might realize, as Coppola's sideways approach alters the poise away from practicality and into an undertaking of compassion for a sensitive, free-spirited person imposed upon by things and people that deserts her natural need for individual freedom outside her high-society surroundings. Prior to being a queen, prior to being a hostage to fortune, Marie was a young girl coerced from her home, stripped naked, and scrutinized like a commodity. It is beyond belief with what lack of interest or concern for her feelings the court lords and ladies exploit her for its gratification and decadence, and from our reaction to this film and the inevitable thought of her death, we then perceive with a strong sense of injustice that in exterminating her they disposed of what little guilt of which they were capable.",Marie Antoinette
42,Chris Knipp,Such sad bonbons,8,22 September 2006,"Audacious, delicious, exaggerated and preposterous, Sofie Coppola's third film, Marie Antoinette, plunges into the life of the Austrian princess who became queen of France and was beheaded in the Revolution, following Antonia Fraser's recent biography in describing her as a frustrated, lonely, brave teenager who never ceased to be a child and achieved maturity just in time to die. The film is a grandiose, sometimes touching, sometimes indigestible mixture. Starting with Kirsten Dunst, a splendid actress, very touching in her openness (but does she know what it's like to become a queen?) and the sleek, stolid Jason Schwartzman, a slacker-seeker now turned teenage king. Shot largely at Versailles, it's lavish and authentic visually (or authentic-feeling; furniture and clothing had to be invented), but the film's French characters speak in English and American accents and the musical background is full of Eighties pop. Fruit of a girlish fantasy, it's a symphony of eye candy and real candy, bonbons and pinks and bright colors, a glorious superficial panorama that seeks to be a deep personal portrait of a tormented life. Perhaps 7.5/10 for screenplay, but the dazzle-factor counts for a lot.Ms. Coppola would have none of the sepia tones of historical ""Masterpiece Theater"" productions; but this isn't such a boldly original step as the film's promoters imply and the director herself acknowledges a debt to Kubrick's Barry Lynden (and used the latter's costume designer). Frears's brilliant 1988 Dangerous Liaisons comes to mind, similarly light and bright. It's also true that Marie's somewhat crude dialogue suffers by comparison with Christopher Hampton's sharp adaptation of Choderlos de Laclos. The talk in Marie is factual, or telegraphs information. The new film doesn't evoke the wit and sophistication of the eighteenth century. The story, so detailed at first, seems rushed more and more as it goes on. But still it leaves you with something. And that something may be Louis and Marie going to bed  and nothing happening, night after night. They didn't produce a child and maybe didn't even have real completed sex for the first seven years. One comes to feel sorry for Louis too: there's something helpless and sweet about Schwartzman that makes the seemingly odd casting eventually pay off. Coppola negotiates a narrow line between spectacle and intimate story. Some of the moments are bombastic, as when the father Louis XV (Rip Torn) or some chief of protocol stamps a staff on the floor, reams of Manohlo Blahnik shoes or pretty pastries flow by our eyes, we get a vast panorama of Versailles or a huge elephant in our face, or a blast of organ music knocks us out of our seats. There are many royal eating scenes, the couple facing forward with vast symmetrical arrangements of food in front of them with the courses loudly announced, as in Rossellini's La Prise du Pouvoir par Louis XIV. Unlike Rossellini, Coppola doesn't strive for an alienation effect but wants us to identify with the fourteen-year-old Austrian girl from the moment she has everything taken away from her, even her dog, and is dressed in French clothes to meet the Dauphin. We're not very aware of the passage of time  Coppola's movie tries too hard to avoid historical-film convention for that  but our heroine goes through some heavy changes. She drinks and takes drugs (what's in that pipe the women pass we don't know), she stays up all night, sneaks to Paris in disguise for a masked ball, squanders millions on landscaping (which merely embellished Le Nôtre's designs) and clothes and gambles and wolfs down so many sweets you wonder how he could get into those tight bodices. She gets heavily into the Pastoral shepherdess scene and then has an affair with a sexy Swedish count, Axel von Ferson, played by Jamie Dornan, a former Calvin Klein model with long limbs and dreamy eyes, right out of a soap opera, or the cover of a pulp romance. The way the movie shows it, this indiscretion was soon over; weren't there plenty more? Somehow there isn't time to show, with all the costumes and bonbons. This is where the movie most falls short: on a sense of events unfolding outside, or even inside; it's high on the emotions and the visuals, which never cease to be fun. Even when king and queen are driving away to be beheaded, Marie is looking out the window to admire the gardens. We get some court intrigue, notably conflict with Louis XV (Rip Torn)'s mistress Madame du Barry, played by Asia Argento as a vampire of a vamp. Ever present as a mean schoolmistress is the chief of etiquette, Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis), forever frowning and stretching her long thin neck. And Marie's female play pals are lovely and cool. Ultimately if all this elaborate stuff stands or falls with Kirsten Dunst, then it's at least okay, because Ms. Dunst has innocence and freshness and aloneness about her, and she's got the freshTeutonic looks Marie's Austrian background requires, and young as she is, she's got the energy and presence of an experienced actress. This isn't a great movie but it's a fabulous one. I dare costume-historical queens to stay away.The screenplay really only rates a 6 or a 7, but the dazzle-factor of the mise-en-scene is so great I'll be nice and award the film an 8.",Marie Antoinette
43,PWNYCNY,Superficial treatment of a major figure in history.,7,19 May 2014,"Kirsten Dunst looks wonderful as Marie Antoinette. However, the same adjective cannot be applied to the movie. The movie provides a sympathetic portrayal of the queen, but the attempt comes off as superficial and contrived. Although as a person Marie was essentially innocuous, it was the office into which she was placed that proved her undoing. The movie fails to drive home how she was perceived as a symbol of oppression and decadence. She was not loved. In fact, she was loathed and the target of unending gossip. Whether she deserved such shoddy treatment is debatable. But the movie gives cause to feel amazement at how such a shallow person could generate so much popular ill-will. She was neither brilliant, nor clever, nor had any special talents that set her apart. Yet, she became the center of a political storm, which guaranteed her place in history. This, however, the movie fails to develop as a central theme. That is, the movie fails to portray Marie in a broader historical context. Hence, the movie is flat, lacking in drama, and even becomes trite, which, given the momentous events that were happening in France, is really amazing. The movie provides few clues as to why the people are so angry at their queen, which is the critical factor in how Marie's life ended. The movie effectively depicts Marie's lack of preparation for the role to which she had been assigned, but then basically glosses over the ensuing years of her life. Marie became a symbol of scorn. This point the movie skirts. The movie also fails to convey the sense of tragedy associated with Marie's life. It could be argued that she was fated, a victim of circumstances. The movie does not explore that theme. Instead, what the movie offers is a glib and superficial dramatization of one of the major figures in European history, whose presence helped trigger a revolution that changed France and the world.",Marie Antoinette
44,JoeB131,A historical Bomb!,3,25 February 2007,"There is an old joke about bad casting in historical movies.

Well, if Kirstin Dunst's Marie Antoinette ever got the to Guilotine, I suspect the audience would have been ready to pull the string. I can only assume Sophia ""My Daddy is a big-time director and producer"" Coppola realized this, and didn't take the movie to that logical conclusion.It is possible to do good movies about this time period. Amadeus and The Madness of King George come immediately to mind. This is not one of those films.Let's start with the music. Yes, Music is usually a secondary consideration for movies like this, but this producer decided to score this movie with a contemporary rock score, which made absolutely no sense at all. Some of the music was truly awful. Why not use a period score for this movie? This was the Age of Mozart, after all, and they couldn't find good period music to score this film with? Second, here you have a movie which is about a pretty important period in history, and about people who were very key in that history, and they seem more like bystanders than participants.Instead, what we get is something that looks like ""E Channel, 18th Century Paris"", where inordinate amounts of time are shown as to what the nobility of Paris ate, wore, and the customs of the court. I felt full after the 20th pastry, thank you! Not enough bad things can be said about the casting, which included a horribly miscast Ms. Dunst, and Rip Torn as Louis XV.Just a mess of a movie.

45,st-shot,Let them watch frosting: Sophia Coppola's flashy tea party.,3,3 June 2008,"This embalmed piece of empty storytelling makes for one beautiful corpse with its Versailles locale, opulent set design and costuming and in the incapable hands of Sofia Coppola rigor mortis sets in fast.This latest re-telling of the fall of French Monarchy and the woman who helped bring it down is filled with sumptuous scenes of glorious costumes, colorfully lush decor and gluttonous excess by France's 18th century beautiful people. Coppola remains at a loss however to bring any substance to character or story. What she does she advances clumsily and with nothing much to say the striking imagery simply evaporates into fashion show and a caravan of pastry carts.Kirsten Dunst as teeny bopper Marie conveys beauty and little else. Dunst is not much of an actress and she is just as clueless here as she was in Coppola's other travesty, The Virgin Suicides. Jason Schwartzman is nearly invisible as Louis XVI. He is a cloying amalgam of a 10 year old and Hoffman's Ben Braddock. As a lady in waiting Judy Davis takes her repressed acting style to a new level. Rip Torn as Louis V gives the only acting performance the film offers, while the rest of the cast is required to do little else but display expressions of disdain and condescension and eat with their mouths open.In addition to her directionless direction Coppola employs a music score featuring Bow Wow Wow (ranting I Want Candy) and other au courants to personalize her vision with some ironic hipness. It comes across forced and uneven.Marie Antoinette is like a display wedding cake in a bakery shop window. It has an impressive frosted surface of color and design but underneath it remains hollow.",Marie Antoinette
46,MBunge,Coppola runs out of ideas pretty quickly with this thing,4,9 December 2010,"Do you remember that remake of Romeo and Juliet that starred Leonardo DeCaprio and Claire Danes? You know, the one where they fused The Bard with the look and sound of MTV (the one that used to play music videos and not inane reality shows about sub-literate white trash)? That's sort of what this film is like except instead of springing from the mind of Shakespeare, this version of history comes dribbling out of Sofia Coppola.Based fairly loosely (even by Hollywood standards) on the life of the ill fated and historically maligned Queen of France, Marie Antoinette starts out pretty good. Beginning with young Marie (Kirsten Dunst) being swept away from her Austrian home to wed the grandson of the French king, Coppola and Dunst combine to paint and engaging and sympathetic picture of girl stranded in an exotic and intimidating land with the weight of two kingdoms placed on her slender shoulders. Using remarkably little dialog, they let you feel what Marie might have felt as she was bound in matrimony to the sweetly sad and seemingly asexual lad who would become Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) and placed at the heart of the complex and bizarre protocol of the French royal court of the late 18th century.There's little attempt to portray either Marie or Louis with any historically accurate mannerisms and Dunst and Schwartzman bring a very modern sensibility to the roles. In their case, it helps you to appreciate these historical figures as real human beings. When Rip Torn and Asia Argento try to do the same thing as the French king and his mistress, the results are unfortunate. Modern pop songs are also splashed throughout the movie, sometimes to good effect and sometimes like a balpeen hammer to the forehead.However, after being very successful at introducing you to Marie and the strange new world she's thrown into, the movie starts to drag and then splinters apart. It's like Coppola had a very good understanding of what she wanted young Marie to be like and a firm grasp of how to tell the story of her early days at the royal court. But as Marie grew into her position as the future queen and became an established part of royal society, it's like Coppola didn't have the slightest clue what that Marie was like and had no idea what to do with that part of her life. The second half of the film is an exercise in Coppola throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks. In one scene, Marie is a spendthrift fashionista. In another, she's a naturalist with a bent for philosophy. In one moment, she's happily in love with her odd little Louis and in another, she's having an affair for nothing but selfish lust. Supporting characters are set up as being important to the story and then simply forgotten. And none of it is connected in any way to make any point. Without giving you anything to hold your interest, you're left just wanting the movie to hurry up and get to the ending that you know is coming.Aside from a minor implication that supporting the American Revolution helped bankrupt the French monarchy and spur the French Revolution, this movie never addresses any of the great and terrible problems that wracked France during the reign of Louis XVI and Marie. The people of France are shown only at the very end of the film and then as nothing but an undifferentiated mob. I don't think there's ever been a book, play or movie made about the time of the French Revolution that would teach you less about the subject than this thing.After a promising start, Marie Antoinette sputters and stumbles to an unsatisfying end. Dunst is unconditionally adorable but even her profound charms can't salvage this half-cooked casserole of a film.",Marie Antoinette
47,Chris_Docker,An original aesthetic - hats off to Coppola!,10,26 October 2006,"If we believe the feminist viewpoint of one of Alan Bennett's characters (from The History Boys), history is the story of men's inadequate responses told from the point of view of other men. So how would a woman's woman auteur, Sofia Coppola, approach a film about one of the most vibrant and controversial of women in French history? Not in a way that is to everyone's liking, that's for sure.Austrian Marie Antoinette was married off to Louis XVI of France, in part to ratify a treaty between the two countries. She lived with him until the Revolution did away with both of them. There is more than enough tabloid character, scandal and turning-points-in-history in her life to make a colourful epic, or sufficient salaciousness for a hearty romp; and while both of these might be stock-in-trade justifiable, the initial scenes suggest we are in for nothing of the sort.Bright pink opening credits catapult us into 1768 Austria with an intrusive girliness reminiscent of a retro pop-video. They soon give way to nice pastels (even the horses gallop through woods in soft focus) and a feminine intellectual assertiveness that somehow says this will be no re-telling of a man's take on history. The facts, while not exactly misrepresented, are definitely going to be subordinate to the artist's vision.For the talented Kirsten Dunst, it is the most challenging role of her career to date. As the leading actress she delivers Sofia Coppola's interiorised vision with charisma and remarkable aplomb. We see her taken into a foreign world and completely isolated (everything, her last shred of clothing and even her dog is taken from her, so that she has only that which is 'completely French'). We see her suffer the glare of publicity even around her marriage bed, and witness the guilt she feels at not becoming pregnant soon enough. We see her searching inside for something to cling to while surrounded vast opulence; and the requisite public persona can admit no unhappiness. British audiences may even see a reminder of Princess Diana, but the significant achievement is perhaps how we inevitably view the possibility of any woman-living-in-a-man's-world feeling for her condition and, through Antoinette's eyes, we also witness history enacted around her in a way almost distanced from her inner turmoil. Antoinette is envenomed at the openness with which a prostitute is allowed to flirt in court; yet at times she feels she herself is little more than a 'piece of meat' traded for politics and progeny. This queen-elect is bereft of privacy and not allowed to be herself, on top of which she doesn't even have a whore's tricks-of-the-trade to get her inexperienced man making babies inside her.Marie Antoinette soon withdraws to the countryside, getting in touch with nature, her artistic sensibilities, and the rearing of a child. This second phase of the movie allows a warmth and simple intimacy in the human condition that was lacking at the Palace of Versailles.Her young husband, meanwhile, continues his wargames, lending soldiers to the American Revolution even though the French peasants are starving. Through Dunst's humility before the things which her character doesn't understand, we glimpse both the true magnificence of the pre-revolution French court and the seeds of its destruction.With unparalleled access to the Palace of Versailles, Coppola has spared little to convey an authentic artistic vision; but it is an aesthetic which owes more to Warhol than Rembrandt. Pop art is employed almost throughout; from a masked ball overlaid with Siouxie and the Banshee's 'Hong Kong Garden' (""an old custom to sell your daughter""), to posters overlaid with slogans vilifying her supposed excesses; or the swift reintroduction of paintings from which successive infants disappear to indicate early deaths. There is no attempt to disguise accents  why bother? - Coppola's point goes beyond undemanding historical verisimilitude. At one point, Antoinette's outer happiness becomes real and she sweeps the crowd along, breaking with tradition to applaud an opera. In another scene, we see her on a balcony alone, the darkness of the room at her back. The camera pans back to show the vastness of the beautiful Palace around her, empty of all other signs of life. Here, she is like a captured bird in an over-gilded cage.No-one does rich-little-misunderstood-girl quite like Coppola . . .Building through two first acts of eye-candy superficiality, the coda comes as a slap in the face. Gone are pop music and Mozart - say hello, stark reality. It is not too difficult to find analogies to modern top-heavy nations, whether they be Iran or the USA. How many people have to starve before the boys at the top stop playing war and self-satisfaction? Is the vision of the artist (or even of a child and its mother) really a less viable view of the world? Marie Antoinette can be seen as a cutting feminist diatribe or simply the work of a director who views the universe, the established facts from which she culls only what she deems appropriate for the opus, and even the feelings of the nation in question, as nothing more than her artist's palette. There is a similarity to De Palma's Black Dahlia that thumbs its nose at what an audience expects and simply ploughs on with the ingenious lighting and idiosyncratic revelations; but Coppola's quirky, sugary and sympathetic tone may well upset traditionalists. Some people may just find it flippant. A film that relegates the French Revolution, incarceration and guillotines in favour of subtle emotional resonances and gender imbalances will make a lot of people ask if Sofia Coppola has simply missed the plot. But for someone who pits herself against a male-orientated view of the world, she acquits herself quite admirably - and not just with girlish charm. Marie Antoinette goes beyond its individual example in French history: it is the hope of a nation, hidden in that which is most despised.",Marie Antoinette
48,Fluke_Skywalker,"All style, no substance. But what style!",5,6 April 2015,"Like Royalty itself, Sofia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' is a beautiful but incredibly shallow film. With its anachronistic 80s New Wave soundtrack fueled montages (which I loved), it often feels like a Cameron Crowe or John Hughes movie.Kirsten Dunst is simply radiant as the title character, but the material is so wafer thin that there's not much for her to do except play dress-up and look stunning. Unfortunately her co-star Jason Schwartzman is woefully miscast as the young king of France. The rest of the cast--with soon to be stars like Tom Hardy and Jamie Dornan--do what they can with their two dimensional characters.'Marie Antoinette' is a terrible bit of history and a vapid piece of drama, but it sure is pretty to look at.",Marie Antoinette
49,MissSimonetta,Sensuous and offbeat character study,9,2 September 2015,"Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (2006) has had a mixed reception since its release almost a decade ago. Those expecting your typical, 100 percent historically accurate period drama/biopic will no doubt harbor a distaste for this movie. To be honest, MA is more of a character study than a biopic detailing the rise and fall of a queen.Coppola presents Marie Antoinette as she was when she came to the French court as a teenage bride-to-be: a culturally-alienated, flighty girl who finds solace in shopping and partying. It is a fascinating portrait of the woman and her world, a portrait that both criticizes and delights in the excess of the French elite. The whole picture is an exercise in sensual detail, reveling in silk dresses and decadent pastries and all the intricacies of 18th century European architecture, all done in candy colors and pastels.The 1980s soundtrack usually comes under fire for being anachronistic, but I thought it was inspired to link the excess of the 1980s with the indulgent French court. Kirsten Dunst's performance is also a little more 21st century than 18th at times, but it all comes down to humanizing the character, making the audience realize that Marie Antoinette was a real human being, not just some dusty, distant entity relegated to historical texts and sumptuous paintings.An underrated film and one of Coppola's finest. I think it will have a rich critical afterlife in the decades to come.",Marie Antoinette

After's she married, she discovers a world of hostilities and confidence. In a world, where people just judge each other without knowing the truth. She changes people around her and it's becomes a party between her friends.

51,EUyeshima,Another Misunderstood Monarch and a Dazzling Visual Recreation of 18th Century France,5,29 October 2006,"Director Sofia Coppola certainly takes an audacious look at the life of the legendary 18th century Queen of France who supposedly ""let them eat cake"" in this elaborately costumed 2006 film. At the same time, Coppola keeps the dramatic focus relatively small versus the expansive political backdrop of the story. The approach works to a point since the filmmaker has an obviously reflective handle on how a young girl can feel when thrown unexpectedly into the spotlight and then made mincemeat by her critics (think of her aborted acting career when 1990's ""The Godfather III"" was released).The downside is that the dramatic arc of the French monarch's life feels somewhat misshapen by this unique perspective since the film's first three-quarters meticulously follows Marie's youthful ascent to the throne and her wearying efforts to consummate her arranged marriage to Louis XVI. There are throwaway scenes of shopping sprees with her ladies-in-waiting and an underdeveloped illicit romance with Count Fersen, all of which would not look out of place in an episode of ""Sex and the City"". Once she conceives and delivers her first child, the movie starts to feel cursory about subsequent events with little of the historic context needed to make the climax resonate.For all the film's dramatic flaws, I have to say Kirsten Dunst is ideally cast in the title role. Starting her role as a 14-year old Austrian princess taken from her family, she captures not only the giggly vacuity but the sense of self-possession and decorum that makes her viable as a queen. A curiously cast Jason Schwartzman gained weight for the role of her bulbous, emotionally indifferent husband, Louis. He says relatively little but his natural awkwardness in period costume succeeds in making the king an ultimately sympathetic figure. Others come in and out of the story though with little resonance, even with proved scenery chewers like Judy Davis as the instructional Contesse de Noailles, Steve Coogan as the advice-giving Ambassador Mercy, Rip Torn as the libidinous Louis XV, and Asia Argento as his blatantly whorish mistress, Madame du Barry.What does work well are most of the visual elements - the use of real Versailles locales augmented by K.K. Barrett's luxuriant production design, Lance Acord's candy-colored cinematography, and Milena Canonero's resplendent costumes. The anachronistic use of 1980's-era new wave music, blended with the Baroque music true to the period and Jean-Benoît Dunckel and Nicolas Godin's original score, turns out to be a daring choice that works well toward Coppola's revisionist view of the queen. Yet for all the creativity on display, one is left to linger on the movie's unfulfilled possibilities of how the economic downturn and class disparities in 18th century France could be seen as a mirror for today. But that aspect obviously doesn't interest Coppola, who shows as she did in ""Lost in Translation"", a deep affinity for women caught out of place and the ways they handle their loneliness.",Marie Antoinette
52,TOMNEL,"One drawn out shot after another...it looks good, but just drags on and on.",5,23 September 2009,"Marie Antoinette has never been a sympathetic character in the history books, and it's always been said that she deserves what came to her for spending too much money and being arrogant. In this reinvisioning (or perhaps it's partially how it actually happened) Antoinette just becomes a relateable and somewhat likable character. Sofia Coppola decided to make this feel more modern by adding contemporary music, and this might make the queen more relateable. But instead, it just drags the movie out with long scenes of music and no dialogue. For a film that is in essence a character piece (as nothing else happens but mild character development), there just isn't enough dialogue to develop much at all.For the plot of this film, it's pretty much just the story of Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) and the story of her life. Her failed sex life with King Louis XVI and her shaking up of the role of the queen. It's a new take on the history lesson, but like an overly long history lecture, this grows very tiring.This film completely relies on aesthetic pleasures. The sights and cinematography are very pleasing to the eyes, and there are some beautiful shots. The music is overly plentiful and featured in every scene, but often times the music, though contemporary, is fitting. The problem is every scene uses this music. Five lines will be said and then the film breaks into music for several minutes. Some of these scenes can be chalked up to character development by pondering and looking at the world. They can be considered reflective scenes, but it's just an excuse to show their nice sets and play some music and write no dialogue.The performances are fine, though purposefully inaccurate. Dunst uses an American accent, as does Jason Schwartzman, and nobody seems to use a French accent at all. Not a mistake, just part of the reinvisioning.Overall, this movie is too long, and there's too much music, and despite some nice scenes, and great looks, this film literally has nothing else going for it.My rating: ** out of ****. 120 mins. PG-13 for sexuality.",Marie Antoinette

There is no action scenes in the film except for a mob scene at the palace at the end of film,before the family is arrested.If you do not know the actual events of this unfortunate pair, & what eventually happens, you will be lost.Even though there is some historical truth told, DO not use this as a history lesson unless you are in the third grade (7-8 years old).Its a pleasant film nicely acted, ( no award nominations though). No one performance stands out for mention.The sets, costumes etc. are nice to look at & do seem real. The main jarring note is the modern song score, it dilutes the value of the film, Hearing a modern type song by todays performers does not fit the 1780's period.If you want something light & frothy see this,its likable & at times humorous.This is the kind of film we used to say were----5 minute films----5 minutes after seeing it, you forget why you liked it..rating: *** (out of 4)-- 82 points (out of 100)__ IMDb 7 (out of 10)",Marie Antoinette
54,Enchorde,"Interesting and peculiar, but where is any real plot?",6,25 February 2007,"Recap: The life of Marie-Antoinette. Wed to the dauphin of France at a young age, only 14, she is sent away from all that she knows to the court at Versailles. She must fit in and strengthen the alliance between her old country Austria and her new country France. To really make sure of this she must conceive an heir to the throne, but it is hard when her husband is as warm and charming as an ice cube in the Arctic. Rumors start to circulate at court that she is frigid. To console herself she goes ""shopping"" and partying. This leads to her unpopularity with the people when food is hard to come by.Comments: This is a very interesting movie. Sophia Coppola is extremely skilled when it comes to building a beautiful set, spectacular sceneries. Her compositions and montages are beautiful and her movements of the camera point of view always an interesting choice enhancing the telling of the story. In short, this is a beautiful movie. What it lacks, and what Coppola is seemingly not so skilled in, is the plot. Sure, here she is a bit tied up by the actual historical events, but it suffers a little from the same as Lost in Translation did. Nothing happens. Where's the plot, where's the action? Long stretches of the movie become tedious.A small saving grace is the peculiar humor that exists and pops through from time to time. Some scenes are really funny, and lighten up the entire movie. Also a strong point is the choice and use of music. An interesting mix of historical correct and modern music. As a friend of mine put it, the modern music conveys the movies feelings much better than contemporary would. So true. It also creates a contrast that pulled me in as a viewer (it contributed to an idea to read this film as an American high-school movie).I like Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette. She fits the role quite well. I am a bit unsure of Jason Schwartzmann as Louis XVI. I'm not sure if he is stellar or awful. Louis XVI seems stricken with terror most of the time, as he is often very stiff and unexpressive. If this is intentional, which from circumstantial evidence from the movie is inclined to believe, it does fit with the characters portrayal, he is stellar. If it is not intentional, he is as responsive as a piece of wood. Also an honorary mention of Rip Torn as Louis XV.To conclude; I found it interesting, beautiful and intriguing, but need more plot, more action to go from like to love. And although they never showed it (the ending was quite good though) the did chop her pretty head off.Btw, I must also say; Go von Fersen! 6/10",Marie Antoinette
55,adamjohns-42575,Let me watch something else with cake!,2,24 July 2020,"Kirsten Dunst gives a great performance in this film, so it is a shame that the script and the general storyline do not give her a chance to really shine. Supported by the wrong actors in some very wrong roles, including my favourite Tom Hardy (Blink and you'll miss him) and Jason Schwartzman (Who the hell thought that was a good idea, maybe it was his cousin the director?) it comes across as comedic and not at all the chic, rock and roll, quirky, art film it was trying to be.It is too rock and roll to be taken as a normal biopic, too ordinary to be taken as rock and roll and there is too much comedy for it to be taken seriously, which is a shame, because executed properly, I could see a rocked out version of Marie really working. If you're going to modernise it, go all out.
Also, I did not like the mixture or French, British and American accents. It's set in France, be French! I'd rather read subtitles than hear such a weird medley of voices.I have to say that when I first watched it, I thought it was great and I loved the modern soundtrack and take on it. Perhaps I have aged badly or perhaps it is the film. One of its time maybe, but I'd be far more inclined to try and watch an old black and white version to get the facts at least, rather than this one, which shows a lot of nothing really. The actual interesting part of her life, where she is blamed for France's deficit is all kind of hurried up at the end, because the director used up far too much of the film making dramatic shots and pauses or montages of shoes.
It's a real disappointment to watch this again and feel so let down by it.",Marie Antoinette
56,triple8,surprisingly disappointing.,5,22 November 2007,"SPOILERS:I was really disappointed in this movie and I read some of the reviews and it appears I am not the only one. While I would not rate this a 1 or a 2, or even say it was bad or horrible, it WAS a major disappointment as well as one of the more baffling movies I have seen in awhile. At times it almost seems rather funnily disappointing, as if it was done deliberately. While that's obviously not the case,(who sets out to make a disappointing film ON PURPOSE?), I was left at the end not just disappointed but completely weirded out.Where to begin? Well.....first is the lack of storyline development. There were many aspects of the movie that were interesting but it seems like they were developed in a way as to make them as uninteresting as possible. I was actually very interested in the marriage of Marie Antoinette and thought that the performers' did a good job. But just when the story was at it's most interesting..after all the time spent(a lot) on this plot line..it is just done. And in a ""blink and you might miss it"" kind of way. It is beyond disappointing, it is really really annoying.Add to that, the lack of dialog. And what little dialog there is,can be quite mundane at times..and much of it is kind of muted. Asia Argento's character provides some brightness and drama until..HELLO!..She is written out of the movie very abruptly. In fact a lot that happen in this movie is abrupt. That is the perfect word to describe this movie. Whether it is writing various characters' out of the script, resolving long plot lines in the blink of an eye, or ending on an unusually rosy, Abrupt(yes-there's that word again) light, it seems Marie Antoinette is all things abrupt.Except of coarse, for the food. I must not forget to mention that as the long, drawn out(extremely drawn out) scenes of brightly colored food, delicious treats and people chewing, did seem in fact to be a major focus of the movie and if some of the important story lines and characters, were shown in half as much detail as the glowingly beautiful arrays of goodies this probably would have been a halfway decent movie. Alas that was not to be.Now for the good. I loved the photography. the brightly colored hues did not just pertain to the food but to the whole picture. If there had been some depth and substance to the film it really could have been great. The visual style was wonderful but very little other stuff was.I did however appreciate the use of music and though many don't like current music being used in a period piece, I sometimes do and just thought the song selections fit here.I do disagree however with people who did not think Dunst did a good job. I think she did. She is not one of my favorite actresses either. But she brought a sweetness and lovable mischievousness to the role and by the abrupt end, was able to have introduced an element of sober solemnity. I would rate her performance as one of the highlights of this movie.My vote ultimately is a 5 of 10. It isn't horrible but is sure a long way from being good and is a major disappointment.",Marie Antoinette
57,Galina_movie_fan,Pretty Boring in Pink or Lost in Versailles,3,24 July 2007,"Sophia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" (2006) is an embarrassing disaster - glamorous, colorful, shot inside and outside of French Versailles in its most lavish but disaster nevertheless. I don't know for whom the movie was made - perhaps, for Ms. Coppolla herself to add another chapter to her dreamy quiet slow moving films about bored and confused young girls. Her previous work, ""Lost in Translation"" was quite good even if not a timeless masterpiece as some critics and viewers tend to believe. Her latest film about a girl who happened to be born in 1755, a daughter and sister to the Austrian Emperors, the future wife and mother to French Kings, simply does not work. The film starts when Marie is 15 and she leaves her beloved Vienna to marry the future Luis XVI. She arrives to the most fashionable, glamorous, and corrupted European court where she would remain ""the foreigner"", ""The Austrian"". The film depicts Marie's life up until 1789 when the Great French Revolution starts with the storming of Bastille, the infamous Paris prison on July 14, 1789, and the King and Queen leave Versailles forever to meet their destiny. The film completely omits the final chapter of Marie Antoinette's life and never mentions the circumstances of her last five years. These five years were filled with the purest tragedy: death of her husband who was tried for treason, found guilty and executed on the guillotine, separation from her son who was taken from her and died in captivity when he was 12 years old. She herself was brought to trial where she was accused among the other things in sexual abuse of her son. To this horrible accusation, the former queen, ""the Widow Capet"" or simply ""Antoinette Capet"" replied with the genuine royal dignity, ""If I have not replied it is because Nature itself refuses to respond to such a charge laid against a mother..."" When I visited Paris several years ago, I went to see The Conciergerie Prison where Marie Antoinette was kept before her death and from where she was taken on the morning of October 16, 1793, ""forced into a tumbrel and paraded through the streets of Paris for over an hour before reaching the Place de la Révolution where the guillotine stood."" Spending short time in the Antoinette's prison cell let me learn about her tragic final days that Sofia Coppola chose not to include in her movie. I respect her decision to tell the story of the ill-fated last Queen of France as a bored and frustrated teenage girl with a sweet smile and charming dimples, whose equally young, shy and totally inexperienced husband was more interested in the history of locks and keys than in making love and children to her but by making Marie-Antoinette the central figure of the film and never taking her camera outside the palace, Coppolla limited her movie to the typical ""chick flick"" that happened to take place in Versailles.Marie-Antoinette as played by Kurstin Dunst is not very interesting person; she leads a boring life within the strict etiquette's rules of the Royal Palace, and all she wants - to have some fun. It is OK to make a movie about boring life of boring and bored insignificant people but it is not OK to never mention what actually was going on outside the palace where the real life was happening and the revolution was brewing way before Coppola chose to mention the shortage of bread for the commoners and storming of Bastille. The second half of the 18th Century was enormously interesting and eventful time in the history of France, Europe, and the World. It was the time when Mozart wrote his music, Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais had finished his three Figaro plays, and the most brilliant one, ""The Marriage of Figaro"" was banned by the King for its irreverent attitude towards the aristocracy from being performed. Outside the Palace's walls, very intelligent, free thinking angry young men from ""Third Estate"" (the ""Commons""), grew up, received good education, and became lawyers, physicians, journalists, and scientists. Influenced by philosophical and political ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the principles of Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité that they embraced in The Jacobin Club in Paris, they later would become leaders of the French Revolution that would destroy the old regime of the absolute monarchy but eventually turn into the Reign of Terror in which the passionate revolutionaries would perish along with the aristocrats. Among them, Mirabeau - a great orator and able statesman; Danton, a figure larger than life; Robespierre, known as ""incorruptible"", Jean Paul Marat, scientist and revolutionary. None of them have been ever mentioned in the movie. Even the notorious Affair of the diamond necklace that was historically significant as one of the events that led to the French populace's bitter disappointment with the monarchy and contributed to the growing hatred toward the Queen who had been nicknamed, ""Madam Deficit"", did not deserve a single remark in the movie about Marie Antoinette. Ironically, Sophia Coppola chose to finish her movie once Marie Antoinette grew up and became more interesting and mature. She stopped to be a bored and boring spoiled little girl, and the director lost the interest in her.I've read some articles that defend the film by saying that it is not a historic movie but ""the story of the silly teenager who embodied a corrupt, absolutist state in its terminal decadence"". These articles keep pointing to the visual beauty, production design, Oscar winning costumes, and nice cinematography. They are indeed lovely and the movie is an eye candy but Marie Antoinette as she was presented in the Sophia Coppola's movie can't herself hold this viewer's interest no matter how many pretty dresses with the elegant matching shoes she has changed and how many tiny delightful pastries she has eaten, and I am a huge fan of low cut dresses and those delicious pastries, believe me.",Marie Antoinette

Sophia wasted major portion of the movie in Marie Antoinette' unconsummated married life and it becomes tedious after 30mintues. Kirsten Dunst is good as Marie Antoinette I wouldn't say great as she didn't had much to do except wear huge clothes and dress up pretty. Jason Schwartzman is wrongly cast as French King. Not only he is that great of an actor but a King or then French that's little too much. Asia Argento relives her Mistress role of ""Une vieille maîtresse"". Jaime Dornan is a good looking lad and CK billboard's all over the world proves that. Overall, Marie Antoinette's great story is lost in Sophia Coppola's terrible screenplay and direction. Who knew that a woman directing a woman's life was ""Bad Idea"" all together?",Marie Antoinette
60,schappe1,Where's the rest of her?,6,28 April 2007,"This film is enjoyable enough for what it is: basically a character study of a misunderstood ""villianess"" of history. It makes you wonder who else isn't as bad as people said they were, and who wasn't so good, (Gore Vidal has made a career of this).But two huge things are missing: the French Revolution and Marie Antoinette's greatest moments. The revolution is simply something that happens to Marie Antoinette. It doesn't happen to France. We don't get to see any of the conditions which caused it. It's just represented by a mob at the end. I guess this is absent because Marie herself never saw it: we are seeing just what she saw. But who says a film has to maintain only one perspective? We hear of some of the mean things critics are saying about Marie and how what we now call a propaganda machine was trying to destroy her. But we see nothing of the propagandists and their motivations. We see nothing of their effect on a crowd of starving, frustrated people. Why not jump back and forth to contrast the Queen's life with the state of the nation? And, of course the entire period of her captivity and her attempts to save her family are removed from the story. The death of two children even before the revolution is reduced to one- in one scene. The fate of her youngest son who ""reigned"" after the death of his father is unmentioned.Versalles has a famous Hall of Mirrors. In this film, we are just looking into one of them. Where is the rest of the story?",Marie Antoinette

62,xredgarnetx,A failure,4,24 December 2007,"SPIDERMAN actress Kirsten Dunst plays Marie Antoinette. Director Sofia Coppola, who gave us THE VIRGIN SUICIDES with the same lead actress, presents Marie as a very young and very innocent women sold to foreign royalty and never given a chance to be herself. The result is a ""Let them eat cake"" lifestyle consisting of endless balls and lessons in silly etiquette. Plus the effort to procure an heir, only her husband (Jason Schwartzmann, of all people) is a gay man who spends a lot of time playing ""Hide the fox"" with his male buddies. Rip Torn plays the randy old French king, but isn't given much to do. The film unfortunately goes nowhere, and spends most of its long running time in the never-never world of the Palace at Versailles. It's all style and no substance. When you see Sofia Coppola's name attached to a film, you best be beware. She gave us LOST IN TRANSLATION, after all (I still shudder when I think of Bill Murray kissing Scarlett Jo at the end).",Marie Antoinette
63,mentalcritic,A step backwards...,4,9 May 2007,"In 2003, an enterprising filmmaker brought the world a human drama set in one of the most heavily-populated yet despairingly lonely places of the modern world. It was a success unexpected, giving its director a level of fame and interest that kept all eyes on her next effort. Of course, it did not hurt that this director just happened to be the daughter of one of Hollywood's most successful and well-regarded directors. So for her next project, Sofia decided to create a biopic of one of history's most controversial and maligned historical figures, Marie Antoinette, Queen of France and Navarre. French history is not a subject of interest to me, and my selection of this film was more a whim based on positive experience with Ms. Coppola's previous effort, Lost In Translation. So when I say that Marie Antionette circa 2006 is a real disappointment, I can only do so with a serious and heavy heart. I wanted to like this film, and there are even times when I do. But for a film that was ostensibly made with the goal of setting the record straight, it is disappointingly shallow.The film begins with the titular character being introduced to her husband-to-be, who just happens to be the Dauphin of France. As the Dauphin's consort, she is expected to produce a child with him with all haste, and much is made of the fact that this will strengthen the French-Austrian alliance. A problem arises when the Dauphin is unwilling or somehow unable to perform the required actions on his part to produce an heir. As Marie begins to receive the proportion of the blame that eighteenth century courts placed upon women that were not producing heirs, her influence with the court begins to weaken. I must admit, the device by which we are shown the two extremes of her popularity in France's court are quite novel. However, a problem arises as we notice increasingly during the running time that very little exists beneath the surface. We know so little about Antoinette during the opening reels, but we know almost nothing else by the time it ends. In effect, we are simply seeing people dance around in period costumes.Speaking of dancing around, numerous sequences are shown in which the cast and extras hunt, dance, or eat to the tune of post-punk songs that anyone who grew up during the 1980s will recognise at least a few of. Some of them are exceptionally well-chosen in light of the visuals that they accompany. Others, not so. Watching Marie descending stairs as The Cure's Plainsong plays in the background is a feast for the eyes and ears. The use of All Cats Are Grey over the ending credits, on the other hand, just seemed like a decision based on the need for a sound to fill the void. Not that it is a bad song, but considering the tone of the closing scene, there are a thousand songs from this era that would have done far more to build the appropriate mood. Antoinette's story is a sombre one, and an ostensibly painful transition in France's history. So It is unfortunate, but the music really does reduce the whole affair to the feeling of a music video. Sort of the opposite to what happened with Lost In Translation, in other words.The performances are also somewhat mixed. Kirsten Dunst is way out of her element as Marie Antoinette. She has portrayed individuals from the eighteenth century on previous occasions, and she has also demonstrated a talent uncommon among actors of her generation. So her performance in this mess probably is not her fault. I am also loathe to blame it upon Sofia's direction, as her prior two films were enthralling even if they took a couple of viewings to get into. However, Sofia's writing appears to have more of the fault than anything else. Some stories rely on sex scenes to keep the viewer interested. Some stories rely on violence to keep the viewer interested. Some stories rely on extremely peculiar characters to keep the viewer interested. I am still in a state of wonder as to exactly what the story is reliant upon, in fact. It seems to have no buildup or payoff. Perhaps Ms. Coppola wanted to write the ultimate 1980s music video, but that already exists in the form of a film called Repo Man.Another problem Marie Antoinette suffers from is that it drives in the stricter, lower limits of the Australian PG rating (honestly, the American system must be run by 100 year old men), and this severely impacts the story. One of the women seen farewelling Marie as she leaves in exile ended up with her head being paraded around for Marie's benefit, a fact that could have done much to put the story in its proper historical context. Much of the film is so perversely tame and restrained that one starts to wonder if anything is going to happen. It is just another example of how overly restrictive America's rating system really is. This is where the whole problem of the film derives. Ask any writer, director, or producer what the one unforgivable sin of telling a story is, especially where film-making is concerned, and they will always tell you the same thing. You can make a good film, you can make a bad film, you can even make an indifferent film. But heaven and the entire chorus of archangels will not help you if you make a boring film.Thus, I gave Marie Antoinette circa 2006 a four out of ten. Some of the music works, but that is about it.",Marie Antoinette
64,jaredmobarak,Let them eat cakeMarie Antoinette,5,27 October 2006,"Sofia Coppola has risen in Hollywood to A-list status after her magnificent debut, The Virgin Suicides, and the over-long, funny at times, critical darling Lost in Translation. Due to the enormous success of Translation, she was able to rework the production, with a bigger budget, on her passion project Marie Antoinette. While trying to stick to historical accuracies when able, she crafted a loose interpretation of the young Queen's life from leaving Austria for marriage until the fateful storming of the Bastille. Coppola's father had success with directing a period piece in his adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but I must say Sophia has outdone him on style. The scenery and costumes are straight out of Versailles circa the late 1700's and really are beautiful to behold. To counteract this look of the past, we are treated to a soundtrack of contemporary music: loud, hard-hitting rock nicely juxtaposed with the life of excess on screen. While it worked to great effect, it is a shame that it worked better as a way to keep me awake during the long and boring tale, which contained not a shred of plot. This was perhaps the most luscious film I've seen as far as the senses go; it's just too bad there was no substance behind it.If you have kept up with the hoopla surrounding its release at Cannes, you will know about the booing that the French people gave it upon completion. Then we had the obligatory retorts by its' creator and actors explaining how this was a vision of her life and not a history lesson. Unfortunately I can't give that statement credit due to the fact that the movie played like a history lesson. We have long takes of the royalty's activities, small vignettes of life cut together without any progression besides the passing of time. There is no struggle, there is no reason to care for these spoiled children as they play; we as an audience are voyeurs, looking through a window at the life of the Queen, not emotionally involved in anything happening. Now I thought Lost in Translation had a too thin a script and plot to warrant an Oscar nomination let alone the victory it achieved, Marie Antoinette, however, has even less. Coppola can write perfect dialogue for these people as they live their lives in the limelight and under archane rules and regulations, but dialogue is not enough. We need a story to be interested in, complete with problems and suspense where one can make a decision about what they hope will happen next. Instead we are given a reenactment of life, a history lesson written and then made alive.It is hard to really hate this film, though, as even though there was no story whatsoever to warrant a running time of two hours, the visuals and acting are superb. Kirsten Dunst is so calm and infectious to watch, that it seems she might have just been ad-libbing the entire time and saying what she herself would say in that situation. The comfort level is great and really adds to the believability of the character. Coppola's cousin Jason Schwartzman is brilliantly shy and unconfident as the young heir to the throne before his gradual evolution into a man with principles and a real love for his wife and children. Most of the other big names have small roles that they excel in; nothing too memorable, but nothing glaringly out of place. The radiant Rose Byrne is comically perpetually inebriated, Asia Argento has a nicely complex role that never is built upon to maybe spice the story up a little with, and Rip Torn, although his usual loud and obnoxious self, is rather subdued and effective. Credit is given to Steve Coogan, who is almost unrecognizable as straight man unlike previous comedic roles, and to Danny Huston, who leaves his mark on a part that lasts maybe five total minutes.Coppola has talentthere is no questionand at times here shows us some gorgeous moments. The composition of shots early on to show Antoinette's isolation are superb, a slow-motion action shot of a soldier on horseback at the end is exactly what's needed for the emotional resonance at that time, and a quick shot of Dunst in the fields at Versailles with a ladybug taking flight from her fingertip show a keen eye for detail. Another thing she has going for her is the use of music. Throughout all three of her movies, the soundtrack has been a great enhancer, here especially during the second half, right about when I Want Candy plays. I just feel she needs to work on her writing a bit more. Lost in Translation was a sprawling tale that could have used some fine-tuning to create interest in the characters rather than relying on Bill Murray's natural charisma, and with this film she desperately needed a script doctor to help her construct an interesting beginning to go with the magnificent final fifteen minutes. The end of this film is some of the best film-making I've seen all year, the emotions displayed by both Dunst and Schwartzman are heartfelt and real. To see the results of the evolution into honor and responsibility that they took is astonishing, as well as the pitch-perfect final frame. It is just a shame that the first two hours of the movie did nothing to show that process. I still hold out hope that Sophia will make the masterpiece that is buried inside her. Also, maybe her brother Roman, who was Assistant Director here, will recover the directing bug and finally film a sophomore effort to go along with, one of my favorite films, CQ. Hopefully after such a well-written and produced debut he won't lose his way like his sister seems to have thus far.",Marie Antoinette
65,sharky_55,The problem of leisure / What to do for pleasure,5,15 February 2017,"One of the few responsibilities of Queen Marie Antoinette sees her made to pose, abide by tradition and simper as she decorates war heroes with flowery laurels and allows them the unique privilege of bowing in her presence and giving tribute to their gracious rulers. Usually there's two ways to go about a period piece like this: you take it on with complete sincerity, you ask the actors to speak with the appropriate accent (which is never American), and maybe you win a few Oscars. Or you could attack the source itself and make a mockery of this posturing; history was never as genteel and refined as it is in the movies, so why pretend? The aforementioned scene is a perfect opportunity for the latter, given the frivolous nature of her role in these proceedings. Instead it's the setup for her later affair with the dashing Axel Fersen - they feel a connection at first glance, and later make googly eyes at each other over the table. It's like high school all over again. Marie Antoinette, Sofia Coppola posits, was not that much different than your average teenager of today, and has the immaturity and lack of self-awareness to match. She starts trends (clapping at the theatre) and then later is astounded that she's no longer 'in', her flash in the pan popularity a thing of the past. She brushes off the local gossip as if her status is impervious to its slander. Watching the film is like walking into a giant box of Ladurée macarons, with the pale pastel colours turned to eleven, and giants hands to give it a good shake. Certain sections wouldn't be out of place in a music video, with its giggly irony, bundled anachronisms and the rebellious streak of Bow Wow Wow and The Strokes. It's not just a phase.Simultaneously Coppola wants to draw out the existential angst of being imprisoned by the materialism of the royal position, but there's little desperation or awareness under the surface. Her life is portrayed as one of fanciful bliss, naivety and ignorance of the political and social turmoil that swept her country at the time. This premise of juvenile insularity and stylistic extravagance to match it might have worked as a short film, with some well-directed irony and a thunderclap of a denouement. But Coppola insists on drawing it out over two hours, in which the historical timeline ticks on but Dunst gains no extra wisdom or insight. Coppola tries to find cruel inhumanity beneath the lavish artifice; see the initial procedures Marie Antoinette undergoes, brutally 'stripped' of her Austrian roots, her femininity revoked, her role reduced to an asset instead of a woman. But observe how fragile the film's treatment of this process is, and how delicately the camera is sure to respect Dunst's no-nudity clause. Compare this to a film like The Scarlet Empress, where Marlene Dietrich's wide-eyed Sophia is groped and inspected like a package upon arrival in Moscow, only for her to later rise from the ashes and become a powerhouse. There's no phoenix rebirth here - Coppola's more concerned about Dunst losing her puppy instead of her identity and childhood. This is typical of much of Sofia Copppola's films, so intent on uncovering the humanity behind the rich and privileged that they gain tunnel vision and forget about everyone else, and forgo sympathy for their cause (given her past, it's a deeply personal concern). The film conveniently avoids elaborating on the rest of her life - the struggles of motherhood and losing her children young, her gradual push into the political court, urging her husband to take on the revolutionaries - because that would invalidate her little fantasy. Dunst is as good as this vision allows her, callow and casually American in a French court. Schwartzman has the same accent but is more intriguing as the young king thrust onto the throne and made to learn on the go. His timid, laconic performance is quietly subversive of the real Louis XVI: you can imagine God proclaiming divine right in one of Schwartzman's dreams, only for him to ask, ""Are you sure?""If Coppola was a little braver she might have gone for the jugular and shown her execution, utilise it as a violent counterpoint to Marie Antoinette's self-contained fantasy. But even delivering consequence the film is revising history, softening events, letting characters off the hook. Recall how every beat in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is staged to poke fun at the logic and sheen of his imagined historical epic (the unmade Napoleon), and then you will see how little self-awareness Marie Antoinette has in comparison. It positions itself as ironic, but in reality it is as shallow as its eponymous heroine.On the morning of the 5th of October 1789, an angry mob stormed the royal palace of Versailles, mounted two of the guards' heads on pikes, and gathered under the King's quarters. They called for justice, for bread, for the royal family to be placed under political arrest. The king comes out onto the balcony to attempt to bargain, and afterwards they call for the Queen. She answers their call, coming out with her eldest son Louis Joseph, but they want her alone - perhaps the sight of children threatened to satiate their bloodlust. So she bares the full fury of the mob alone, and in a remarkable and inexplicable performance, she calms them. Now they cry, ""Vive la Reine! Long live the queen!"" Now, isn't this infinitely more interesting than a giggly, infantile schoolgirl?",Marie Antoinette
66,MrGKB,Ms. Coppola has directed a few good movies...,4,27 March 2010,"...but ""Marie Antoinette"" is not one of them. It (obviously) took me a while to get around to this one; I'd picked up a copy of the DVD a few years back, but somehow it'd gotten shuffled to the bottom of my watch list. Unfortunately, it should have stayed there, and I'll be dumping this one from my collection at first opportunity.Crippled by Coppola's horrendously boring and trivial script, adapted from a novel of questionable merit, ""Marie Antoinette"" fails utterly to involve the viewer in the life of its titular lead. Oh, it presents that life, at least in its ""hi-skool lite"" historicity, but there's nary a drop of real substance to any of it. It's a costume drama with an emphasis on costume and little, if any, attention paid to drama.Worse, it's haphazardly cast. Kirsten ""Spider-Man"" Dunst looks nothing like the real Marie Antoinette and it doesn't help matters that she's obviously too old for the time span in which most of the film is set. Coppola's cousin, Jason ""I Heart Huckabees"" Schwartzman, is notably awful as Louis XVI, an empty cipher at best; nepotism and a faint resemblance to Andy Garcia are the only reasons I can imagine that got him the role. Notables like Judy ""Georgia"" Davis, Danny ""30 Days of Night"" Huston, Rip ""Men in Black"" Torn, and Shirley ""Trainspotting"" Henderson are mostly wasted in supporting roles of varying importance, and various ""names"" like Asia Argento, Molly Shannon, and a stunningly unrecognizable Marianne Faithful make appearances as well. It's all for naught, since Coppola's screenplay gives them so little substance to embody. It's almost chilling to recall that she won a best original screenplay Oscar for ""Lost in Translation."" In the intervening years, she most certainly lost something herself: the ability to tell an engaging story.Production values are ""Marie Antoinette""'s saving grace. Filmed on location at the sumptuous Versailles grounds and elsewhere, and minutely costumed, set designed, art directed, and coiffed and made up to within an inch of its life, prettily photographed, the only major production element I loathed was the soundtrack, an amalgam of period music and utterly out of place ""New Wave"" pop from the likes of Bow Wow Wow, the Cure, and Adam and the Ants. Sonic incongruity at its most egregious.Overall, a major disappointment, highlighted only by its attention to period detail, and Ms. Dunst's tail end. Completely ignorable.",Marie Antoinette
67,rockman182,Marie Antoinette (2006),7,17 June 2017,"Sofia Coppola is probably my favorite female director going today. Thematically her films are an excellent depiction of loneliness, isolation, and a longing to be. I'm super excited for The Beguiled and thought it would be nice to revisit some of her earlier work. I re-watched Somewhere and Lost in Translation recently and thought both were excellent. This is one I watched a while back and needed a fresh opinion on and honestly seemed like her most daring work so I was looking forward to seeing it once again.The film is about young Marie Antoinette archduchess of Austria, her marriage into French nobility and her time and demise as Queen of France. I've always been a fan of Kirsten Dunst, I think she's quite underrated as an actress (see Melancholia and S2 of Fargo). Her pairing with Sofia Coppola works really well; Coppola gets the best out of her regardless of whether this is an authentic representation of how Marie Antoinette was. Its wonderful to see the pressure that is put on Antoinette by others and how this leads to an untimely end for her reign.We get another Coppola film showing a very lonely female character. Marie has to keep up to the prim and proper standards of 1700 France and be ladylike despite just wanting to live and have fun. She seeks a relationship and connection with a partner, one of which does not come easily. She has no meaningful compatibility with her husband Louis XVI of France which really impinges on her happiness. Along with that the tiring task of the day to day expectation of being queen.I think Sofia Coppola really did well taking liberties on a historical drama. There is a presence of a humorous take and satirical approach to depicting the often ridiculous customs of the time. The set and costume design is superb proving that Coppola can handle a period piece even while putting an anachronistic spin on it (with the modern soundtrack). The modern soundtrack actually helped put an atmospheric touch on the film. Overall, its probably not the best of her work but its still a really strong effort and goes to show why we really shouldn't care about negative critical response.7.5/10",Marie Antoinette
68,fwomp,"All Pomp, No Circumstance",3,2 March 2007,"After Sofia Coppola's successful films THE VIRGIN SUICIDES and LOST IN TRANSLATION, many movie-goers awaited her next masterpiece with baited breath. Taking on the life of MARIE ANTOINETTE is no small feat, too. Here is someone who's short life and reign as Queen of France ended in head-tumbling fashion, but affected France's government for years to come.It is unfortunate that a few factors ruined this film, causing it to get booed at the Cannes Film Festival and leaving it with lackluster gains at the box office. But many who were displeased with this rendition of her life have rightly showed their displeasure. I'm not going to give you a history lesson, as I'm assuming most of you know about the life and times of Marie Antoinette. But I will give you some idea what to expect if you watch the film. First, expect to enjoy the great sets and costumes. Any gal who loves to go shoe shopping will probably drool over the number of scenes involving footwear (perhaps too many) and their excellent designs. Heading from the feet upward, the dresses, wigs, fans, and head-wear are also very nicely arranged and in accordance with the times. The film was shot on-location in Versailles, so no one should be able to complain about the authenticity of the sets. But from here the production takes a serious nosedive. The screenplay is riddled with boring and absent scenes (from Louis and Marie eating many silent breakfasts, to a complete lack of what was going on outside the palace walls). The end of Marie's life is run through in slipshod fashion, as if a race were on to finish the movie on schedule. Then, of course, there's the music. Incorporating modern day music with historical elements has been done before. The one that most comes to mind is A KNIGHT'S TALE. Although not the pinnacle of film success, A Knight's Tale had some catchy tunes that went along nicely with the story. But with Marie Antoinette, the connections are distant at best. Can you imagine songs from Bow Wow Wow and The Cure infusing a renaissance-style film? If you're like me, this is a bit hard to swallow. What happens in the end is we get a movie that is all pomp and no circumstance; visually appealing on almost every level but sorely lacking a decent script that would allow the acting to shine through. I'll give Kirsten Dunst a few claps of applause for her portrayal, as she made the best out of a pretty awful screenplay, but that's about it. A bit of a snoozer, I'm afraid.",Marie Antoinette

Did I miss something in history class? I thought rock started in the fifties. Nope. It's shot in lavish surroundings with lavish costumes. But it's deadly dull. We don't even get to hear Marie Antoinette hurl her defiant ""let them eat cake"" line (""cake"" was an idiom of the day for horse manure) or see her get the chop on the guillotine. I used to think history class was boring. It was knuckle biting excitement next to this plodding, pitiful, pointless portrayal of lumpen history.",Marie Antoinette
70,cultfilmfan,Marie Antoinette,8,28 October 2006,"Marie Antoinette is a unique telling of the story of the legendary French ruler. In the film Marie an Austrian girl is set to marry King Louis XVI in France after it is arranged by the parents. Marie is only 14 when they get married and still as a young woman she has a lot to get used to living in the palace and dealing with scandal, politics and what other people are expecting of her. The film is told in Marie's perspective and deals with her many years being a ruler and her marriage and the problems that later became of her and France. Marie Antoinette has good direction, a good screenplay, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration, good costume design and good hair and makeup. This movie is one of the most gorgeous looking films I have ever seen. Everything from the sets, makeup, costumes and more all look great and very much like the 1800's. It is a visually stunning looking film. The film also has good performances, direction and a very original and unique script that approaches the story in a very interesting screen. Behind the scenes of this movie the film is virtually perfect with everything down to the last detail looking perfect on screen and playing out very well. The film's writer/director Sofia Coppola makes the film interesting by adding some humour to it, giving it a good pace and even putting in some modern day music set to some of the scenes as well as classical music and it all works very well. I could see how a lot of directors would try and make this movie and it would end up a dry and boring period piece, but this film is anything but that. I also liked how the story was told in Marie's perspective and the film showed her as being a normal human being and showing her just like anyone else. Because of her age I think the film did her justice by showing that she was a little immature at times and did some things purely because of her age and that she wasn't really mature or ready enough to be in this sort of situation. I liked how the film portrayed her and didn't try to make her look perfect and wasn't afraid to showcase her difficulties and true self during this movie. Because the film looks great, is entertaining, original in the style it brings the story and because it is a well paced and well made film in every way I really enjoyed this film. That being said some of the things I liked about this film will not appeal to everyone and I'm sure historians will find enough that isn't truly accurate of the real Marie Antoinette and that may ruin the film for them. Still, I enjoyed it a lot and I think people like myself who didn't know a lot about the real Marie Antoinette in the first place may find enough to like in this film and appreciate it as I did. It definitely won't appeal to everyone, but for a more artistic crowd this movie will probably play for them pretty well. I would also like to note that I wasn't really big on Sofia Coppola's first two films The Virgin Suicides and Lost In Translation not because they were bad films, but because they just did little for me. This film did a lot for me and I see a lot of greatness in Sofia's direction which makes me almost want to re-watch the previous two films and makes me eager to see what else she will put out in the next couple of years.",Marie Antoinette
71,petra_ste,Let them eat cake,3,14 March 2008,"Although watching Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette is akin to enduring Chinese water torture, there are lessons to learn from it.First, if you make a biopic, it's wise NOT TO CUT OUT the most relevant events of that person's life. Examples: don't make a movie about Hitler which ends in 1939. Don't conclude a biography of Julius Caesar in 45 b.C. And don't film a Marie Antoinette biopic without showing her trial and execution.Second, if your protagonists elicit bored irritation from the audience, it's not a good thing. Personally, I have always regarded the French Revolution as a great event in human history, but I don't think Marie Antoinette (or her unfortunate husband) was the devil or deserved death. Still, after watching for two hours these parasites thrive in useless luxury, I positively wanted them to die. Movies like Marie Antoinette could probably turn even the staunchest monarchist into Robespierre.Third, I am beginning to think Kirsten Dunst isn't a very good actress (evidence: her little range, her one-note acting), but she is not drawing much attention to the fact thanks to her good looks and to some promising early performances.Fourth, expensive costumes and set design (the whole thing looks like a glorified Barbie house made with an unlimited budget), plus a slick collection of popular and monstrously anachronistic songs do NOT make a good or even a decent movie.Last, if you are the daughter of a powerful director and feel depressed because your life is a golden cage, you should seek professional advice rather than making a tedious, somewhat semi-autobiographical movie with an idealized protagonist with whom you identify.3/10",Marie Antoinette
72,Rogue-32,Let's party like it's 1769!,8,23 October 2006,"Sofia Coppola keeps giving us supremely original and daring films, created from her own uncompromised point of view and aesthetic. She did it with The Virgin Suicides and Lost In Translation, and she continues that tradition with Marie Antoinette, which is as personal as a costume-heavy period piece could possibly be.Here, she teams up once again with her Virgin Suicides leading lady, Kirsten Dunst, to create a sumptuous feast for the eyes. Even more impressive: between the magnificently-detailed sets, stunning costumes and its ravishingly beautiful star, Marie Antoinette manages to avoid all the clichés inherent in this kind of movie, by taking a very personal approach. The film focuses on the teenage title character and how she copes with her nearly unimaginable situation while managing to stay true to herself, in the purest ways, throughout. Coppola's Marie Antoinette is portrayed as a decent, loving individual who conducts herself with astounding restraint, considering her age and the events thrust upon her. It makes you imagine what her life must have been like, from the inside, and it's done in a subtle way, without ever being heavy-handed or overly dramatic.The only problem I had with the film is that the ending seemed unnecessarily abrupt.

Her voice is so annoying and not a queen's voice. Her activities of building fun gardens to play in was interesting. There is no power in this queen, and therefore the movie fails.

I'm not sure what the premise is here (a modern teenager transplanted into the French Court in the 18th Century?). Though the raucous contemporary music is clearly intentional, what does it add to the story? Kirsten Dunst isn't exactly miscast as Marie Antoinette; she is cast without observable rhyme or reason opposite Jason Schwartzman who likewise is dropped into his role as the Dauphin/King from a different planet. What is apparently intended as droll or funny is simply boring. The burlesque of court manners is as overdone as a piece of steak left too long on the broiler. There is absolutely no tension in the film as the French revolution begins and encroaches on the Palace and the life within it. Are we supposed to care about these people? They are more alive in the driest history book than in this movie! The only redeeming feature in this mess is the photography.",Marie Antoinette
75,johnstonjames,Delectable Entertainment Pastry. No Nutritional Value,6,24 March 2010,"Sofia Coppola's 'Lost in Translation' was one of the better, more adult movies of the recent decade. this wasn't. this was pretty much a film for teenage girls. not much wrong with that, but not a very insightful look at history.so Mary Ann is now one of histories good guys(or i should say girls). i find that a little dubious. i don't know if she was the cartoon villain she is sometimes made out to be, but i'm not sure she made enough worthwhile contributions to be thought of as a admirable person or any kind of role model. i don't know much about Ms.Antoinette(don't have the f--k'in time),but real history, while not necessarily vilifying the one dimensional broad, is pretty ambiguous about her.the movie is great eye candy however, and it makes one helluva good teen flick for girls. i really thought the scene where Coppola sneaked in a pair of contemporary urban sneakers with Marie's shoe collection was extremely funny. and it was cool to hear the sounds of Bow Wow Wow's Annabel wailing over the soundtrack. and the costume design was uniformly excellent.the film never quite lives up to it's initial opening scenes that show Marie as an innocent young kid, but heck, it had such a great supporting cast, Marianne Faithful(Mick Jagger's ex-flame),Jason Schwartzman,Asia Argento,Rip Torn,Steeve Coogan(who i love)and Molly Shannon,i couldn't help but be entertained. if you like cake(i don't especially)then enjoy.",Marie Antoinette

In what could have become another epic, costume-drama, Coppola creates an alternate chick-flick with gossip, bitchery, parties and shopping - and the sugar-rush flows as the movie keeps a loose time-frame. The dazzling on-location filming is greatly combined with the slang and rock music that crushes all the barriers this movie's already boxed in by. And although the last run seems a bit halting (as Marie Antoinette is attacked by the angry mobs), I think it was never Coppola's intention to make something to big out of this project - but the cinematic bravado of the first half is truly astonishing and finds Coppola in her truly right place, and creates a gorgeous movie with wit, intelligence and passion.",Marie Antoinette
78,oneloveall,"Interesting, sumptuous mistake tries to distract with large budget",5,10 February 2007,"At turns refreshingly innovative and pretentiously shallow, Marie Antoinette is a difficult film to gauge due to the unique angle Sofia Coppola employs for the period piece. While strangely hypnotic at times in it's blissful capturing of pleasure, the film often feels unfocused as well, dangerously teetering between artsy production and vanity project, rarely becoming anything more meaningful. Giving the notorious queen an updated relevance may bode well in creating some sort of historical context for an oblivious demographic of MTV teenage girls, but anyone mature enough to realize the difference between style and exploitation will find that many of the scenes feel repetitive, with the ravishing set design playing front and center to the stubbornly plotted events that relay (through some sort of obscure fact-based mythology) France's public enemy number one before, during and throughout her troubled reign. One must give Coppola some credit for at least attempting something quite unique though. In the film's greatest moments, where the fickle, care-free parties of the decadent royal family are breezily edited amidst the contrasting modern day indie soundtrack, there is a certain guilty pleasure and an articulation of fun that really hasn't been explored in the context of a historical film. However, it becomes increasingly apparent that the director used this premise merely to indulge her fondness for the exquisite lifestyle the queen was involved in, shunning a majority of context and depth in favor of the effervescence that dominates the tone here. The much talked about modern musical selections playing to century old antics, scored as they are, do capture a few select moments of glaring, and daring beauty (think of the brief use of the cure when they are walking down the steps), but too often only feels right in fleeting moments of the scene and awkward during the rest. Plagued by a few technical blunders and the distinct lack of authenticity in the performances (Kirsten Dunst does have some amazing moments- but no one is even trying to sound believable, as personified in the modern day, off-key ridiculousness of Jason Schwartzman's Louis XVI), the monumental set design does not really compliment most of the content here, no matter what Coppolla's misdirected though promising artistic ambitions thought they were achieving. As such, the movie does have some amazing moments that will be magnified depending on the size of your viewing screen, but by and large it plays out immaturely and insults the viewer with it's unfocused approach.",Marie Antoinette

80,FloatingOpera7,Coppola's Costume Drama Experiment,5,2 April 2011,"Marie Antoinette (2006): Starring Kirsten Dunst, Jason Schwartzman, Marianne Faithful, Rip Torn, Asia Argento, Judy Davis, Danny Huston, Molly Shannon, Shirley Henderson, Mary Nighy, Sebastian Armesto, Jamie Dornan, Steve Coogan. Directed by Sofia Coppola, screenplay by Sofia Coppola.Released in 2006, Coppola's Marie Antoinette is heavily flawed. Far from faithful to the historical reality of Marie Antoinette - her personality, her life and times - it's really more of an offbeat colorful costume comedy set in Versailles in the late 18th century. This should come as no surprise when you consider the number of comedic actors in leading roles - Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette, Jason Schwartzman as Louis the 16th, even Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson as Louis' aunts Sophie and Victoire. Adding to the mix is the very accomplished British actress Judy Davis as Comtesse DE Noailles, head supervisor of etiquette at the court of Versailles and Rip Torn as the old King Louis the 15th. This film isn't about the complete life of Marie Antoinette therefore it's not a biopic. The film's strongest focus is on Marie's difficult life at Versailles. Marie finds it challenging to please everyone and she turns heads with her inexperience and her continuous breaking of social customs and protocol. Marie's only role is to mother Louis the 16th's children, the heirs to the throne of France. For years, she is childless, owing to Louis' sexual dysfunction, upsetting the nation who consider her to be uninterested in her husband, in her people and caring only for parties, luxuries and an extravagant lifestyle of jewelry, gowns and pastries. When at last Marie gives birth and becomes Queen, her life becomes increasingly dull. She escapes the growing pressures at court and the disdain of her enemies by spending time at the fake country château of the Petit Trianon where she has established a small farm. She has a brief sexual affair with the Swedish Count Axel Von Fersen (Jamie Dornan), something which might not have occurred at all.This film omits the Revolution and we hear of it only from word of mouth. The film never loses the perspective of Marie Antoinette. Also missing is the very significant Affair of the Necklace incident involving the thief Jeanne Remy, the Cardinal DE Rohan and a diamond necklace. The scandal ruined the Queen's reputation and made her very unpopular and hated by the people. The film is unnecessarily long and very hollow, highlighting on the stereotypical aspects of Marie Antoinette's life, the parties, the fashions and the excesses; the very things that made her a hated figure by the French. Kirsten Dunst is woefully miscast and delivers an unsatisfying performance. Clearly historical drama is not suited to her abilities as an actress. She never delves into the character's inner suffering and psychology, never gives us enough for us to care and sympathize. She's wooden and never becomes Marie Antoinette, she's just being Kirsten Dunst, modern comedienne in dress up. Jason Schwartzman is worse with the minimalist dialog and lifeless persona. He doesn't do anything with his character. The superior performances are from Judy Davis as the Countess DE Noailles and Marianne Faithful as the Empress Maria Teresa, minor roles and appearing only briefly in early portions of the film. We would benefit from at least one other person's perspective because Marie's life was sheltered from reality and her geography was limited to Versailles. Looking at this movie, we don't truly understand why they hated her in Paris, nor see just how seriously her position as Queen was threatened. Perhaps the reason this film is terrible lies in the poor screenplay and bad writing. Coppola is better suited as director but not as writer. She might have done better by hiring a good writer. Her direction is generally good. The cinematography is excellent. There are beautiful vistas of the palace of Versailles and it's gardens, including also the Petit Trianon and the Queen's farm. The costumes may be over the top and far too colorful to be realistic and authentic but they are beautiful to look at. The cast and crew were allowed to film at the actual palace of Versailles. Only a few films have done this and it's good to know that it's not a fake set. This is a lovely movie visually but it's an insubstantial film with unimpressive writing. and acting. It also suffers from the fact that it wants to take itself seriously as a historical drama but it's far from it. On the plus side, Coppola did her homework and the details of Marie's frustration at Versailles is accurate. Everything is generally faithful to the real events of Marie's time in Versailles such as her correspondence with her mother Empress Maria Teresa and the visit by the concerned brother Josef. But in many ways, this film falls into the genre of experiment because Coppola lost track of the more personal tragedy and human side of Marie Antoinette. We never see her being a good mother and wife, both of which she truly was. Another downside is the modern music for the soundtrack. Although Coppola has a few excerpts of Baroque and late 18th century classical music as well as opera, she also varies it with modern pop which is unnecessary and freakishly anachronistic. Coppola seems to want us to relate to Marie with the heavy emphasis on modern attitudes by Kirsten's performance, but she fails miserably because it just doesn't suit a period film which should be restricted to the milieu and the attitudes of the people of that long ago period, which has no immediate connection with our modern society. This film could have been better if Coppola had opted to make a serious drama about the life and death of Marie Antoinette and the events of the French Revolution. Only the cinematography and lavish costumes are worth watching.",Marie Antoinette

82,bopdog,"Stupendous 'translation' of Marie's life and times for those of us alive today. Allows us to feel and experience what those folks felt and experienced, perhaps?",10,21 October 2006,"Sophia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' works on all levels. It is a brilliant and spectacular portrayal of a long-past time; yet it also has an immediacy, and intimacy, and a warmth that draws us in and seduces us. The realness of the human dimensions, and the warmth and truth of the movie was truly surprising to me. I expected a bit of a chick flick--- but despite the 2-1/2 hours length, I was engaged right through the ending credits.Part of the success goes to Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman, of course. And the brilliant supporting cast, such as Rip Torn, as King Louis the 15th. And the surprisingly apt Molly Shannon, as the bitchy and cavilling Versailles court snob. But surely a ton of the credit must also go to Coppola, for the insightful writing, and inspired directorial choices.I have seen some of the nay-sayers for this movie criticize it on an historical accuracy basis. Fair enough. Maybe this or that aspect of the life of Marie Antoinette was not displayed fully, or 'just right'. But these critics are missing the whole point of THIS movie. THIS movie is not a 'bio pic', nor a flat, factual 'visual aid' for a history classroom.Think about it for a minute--- how do you portray other times, or other countries and cultures than your own, and those of the likely audience? Some artistic translation is required. If we could go back in time and plant hidden video cameras in Versailles from 1768-1790 (or whatever it was), what would we have? I doubt very much that we would understand any of what was happening. Because the times have changed, and the values and mores and norms and expectations have changed, AND the manner of expression for each of those things has changed--- I don't think 'real time' video footage of a long distant past age would even be comprehensible to us. We need a way to portray the values (etc., as above) in current terms, terms that we can feel and understand NOW.For example--- I noticed a party scene, where Coppola had modern, cool, very So-Cal music playing as the background. One might think 'Hey! That's not the 18th century!', and they would be right, of course. But the party vibe that we, the actual audience in 2006 might feel NOW--- the exuberance, the color, the fast moving interpersonal interactions, the joy and the abandon of a true party goer, lost in the happy, wacky party atmosphere of the moment--- all of that must be evoked to us now. Modern party music is an appropriate way to convey it.I have seen so many movies with an historical aspect, showing parties, dancing, social interactions from previous centuries, using music and speech from the time. That has its place, too. But often, what we get is a remote, stilted, unapproachable and unaccessible museumy-looking piece that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to relate to at all.So we, the audience, might be said to be experiencing and feeling the same vibe the actual 1780 crowd felt and experienced. We just had to have a slightly different means of evoking those feelings within us.It is analogous to a movie about ancient Greece, or modern Mongolia, or even France (if one is not French)--- the movie, if intended for an English-speaking audience, will be spoken in English, because that's what the audience speaks. No one would say--- 'How dare the director not have the actors speaking in ancient Babylonian, or ancient Greek, or Mongolian'. No. Equally, we are not offended when English language movies are translated into other languages, so other folks in other countries can enjoy them too. It's simple. It's called communication.Sophia Coppola, and the stellar cast, did a stupendous job of translating what it might have FELT like for the young Dauphine and then queen in the 18th century for us here in the 21st century. Also, do note that the movie was able to accurately get would it also looked like--- the filming was done on location, at the Versailles Palace itself.So--- tremendous and spectacular job all-round!!! I gave this a 10 out of 10.",Marie Antoinette
83,Dan1863Sickles,Not Perfect -- But So Much Better Than I Expected!,8,4 November 2006,"I never thought this movie would move me the way it did. I'm against all forms of class privilege and aristocratic behavior, in any society at any time. I never liked Marie Antoinette or her world. This movie disturbed me because I thought it would be shallow and silly, but after an hour or so I really found myself liking and sympathizing with Marie Antoinette. I think the negativity that surrounds this movie comes from just that fact: people are forced to find Marie Antoinette inside themselves, and many lack the honesty to face the truth. This movie, which seems shallow and silly, is actually incredibly daring and demands a great deal from the viewer. It demands you live Marie Antoinette's life with her, and that you see her on her own terms.Of course, Kirsten Dunst is an astonishingly gifted actress. Her self confidence and naturalness are so compelling, no matter how unreal the moment she finds the true core of the emotions. What's striking is the way Sofia Coppola seems to know exactly what a genius Kirsten is, and seems to almost relish giving her the leeway to do things her way. It's almost like the movie is the director's love letter to her star, in that there are countless flattering shots of Kirsten Dunst at her most radiant. Yet the flattery is also aimed at her talent. Sofia pays Kirsten the supreme compliment of total trust. This Marie has not a trace of any accent, French or Austrian. Cate Blanchett wouldn't have done it this way. But Kirsten is different. It's like she won't waste your time with showing off her little gimmicks, because she's too eager to start feeling and reacting in her own way.When you watch the movie, you don't really hear Marie Antoinette say things, like ""I'm lonely"" or ""where do I belong?"" But somehow the stunning images of flowers, clothes, shoes, and the longing on Kirsten Dunst's face all come together in a pattern that draws you in deeper and deeper. By the time Marie is building her secret world in the country, with farm animals and flowers and intimate dinner parties with friends, you totally understand her. Far from being a coward who ran away from the real world, Marie Antoinette was a brave soul who did her best to find something real to care about.But it's not just Kirsten's movie. Jason Schwartzmann gives the most restrained, disciplined performance I have ever seen as the sad, timid, excruciatingly polite Louis XVI. Jason makes you ache for this poor young man, and yet as an actor he absolutely refuses to make any of the ""easy"" choices. He never shows easy lust, easy longing, easy likability. You are really forced to feel the terrible wall he has built around himself, and see how hard Marie had to work to get to know him. And you start to see how an ordinary, not very bright young man is forced to cope with the public role of king. You don't blame him for his behavior even when you see how it hurts Marie. He's doing the best he can, and by the end they really love each other, even if they have none of the usual ""star chemistry"" we expect to see in movies. What we get instead is almost anti-chemistry -- two people with no physical bond who make the best of things and grow as a result.One final comment: nearly all the negative reviews of this movie focus on the idea that Sofia Coppola doesn't show the peasant's point of view, that she doesn't feel their pain or acknowledge their anger. One admiring review here on IMDb even said that she has compassion for everyone except the peasants. But I would put it another way. I think the final sense you get is that she doesn't judge anyone, not even the peasants. They do what they have to do to survive. Just like Marie. And the viewer can feel deeply about both, or neither.For myself, when the film ended, and Marie said, ""I'm saying good-bye"" I felt like I had really learned something about compassion and loss, without forgetting what I knew when I came into the theater.Time will tell, but I think MARIE ANTOINETTE will be much more appreciated in the years to come than it was at the time of its initial release.",Marie Antoinette
84,rajdoctor,Marie Antoinette,4,9 March 2007,"Marie Antoinette Marie Antoinette is a true story of an Austrian princess married to a French prince, and Marie's growth from a young innocent girl to one who observes the new royal family cultural with curiosity and fun. How internal politics surrounding her evolves and changes her personality and brings her to grief, happiness and love comprise the rest of the story.The venture is different and unusual.The story line of Marie Antoinette  played very well by Kirsten Dunst - had the scope to be presented more dramatically, but the director Sofia Coppola is more interested to show the aesthetic side of royal life  by a series of photographic gourmet of dishes, dresses, and design etc. that she looses the purpose of telling an engrossing tale in movie's format. What it results in the audience is only intermittent level of interests with loads of boredom through catalogue photographic images of designs. People with a great aesthetical sense would love this movie and bear the breaks in story line. The musical score is contemporary and for me did not suit the mood and senses of 15th century Europe. But that is Director's prerogative to be courageous and at times outrageous in deciding to choose what they want to show their audiences.I liked the casting of the movie that matched the characterization.

85,WriterDave,More than a Trifle...,8,27 February 2007,"From its beguiling star Kirsten Dunst to the maddeningly beautiful locales to the visual sumptuousness and ""taste"" (you almost feel as if you could eat some of the scenery and clothes) of the costumes and art design, Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" is an entrancing and lavish period piece of the highest order.Many of the early scenes of the Austrian and French woodlands and the palatial splendor of Versailles are cloaked in an almost ""otherworldly"" austerity, evoking the spirit of Stanley Kubrick's ultimate costume-drama, ""Barry Lyndon."" Later, when our heroine finds some inner piece at the countryside estate she is given as a gift after the birth of her first child, Coppola immerses the viewer in the transcendent splendor of natural sounds and beautiful images that channels the fluid mise-en-scene composition of the best work of Terrence Malick. All of this is tied together by Coppola's now signature dreamily listless camera play that makes her unlike any other director working today.In the lead role, Kristen Dunst is mesmerizing. She's always been a better actress than she's been given credit for. She's only previously been allowed to really stretch her acting muscle when she took on the role of Marion Davies in the excellent ""Cat's Meow"" and as the emotionally unstable teen in the misguided ""Crazy/Beautiful."" Here, without much dialouge, and present in just about every scene, she speaks volumes with her eyes and body language. Coppola only briefly channeled into Dunst's innate talents in ""The Virgin Suicides"" and wonderfully fulfills the promise of a fruitful director/actor collaboration that those with a keen eye could divine from their first experiment together.Of course, those who measure a biopic by its historical accuracies will cry blasphemy at some of the treatment here, most notably the use of new-wave pop music in equal measure with a classical score. Also, the drama of the French Revolution is glossed over spare for the final ten minutes, almost as it it were a side-note in history. The vapidness and decadence of the French Court is Coppola's focus, as is the alienation of a people from their government, family members from each other, and most importantly a young woman from herself. Though this classic theme of alienation (which permeates many of the great films from Coppola's father's contemporaries) seems to be treated here with a softer touch that on the surface paints it as a trifle...the haunting closing scenes of Dunst leaving Versailles behind forever are not without their emotional resonance.If Coppola delivers us a big hit with her next project, or not too far thereafter...then I suspect in about ten or fifteen years, ""Marie Antoinette"" will be looked upon far more fondly than it has been thus far. Rightfully its costume design took home an Oscar. If the movie gods smile down upon us, Coppola will have a long fruitful career, and this film will surely be more than just a foot note of her early days.",Marie Antoinette
86,Antagonisten,Surprisingly good,7,1 January 2007,"I must admit the subject-matter of this movie didn't interest me much. The only really interesting historical facet for me was how the film-makers handled the love-affair with Axel Von Fersen, whom i wrote an essay about in a distant past. Anyway, the attraction for me was undoubtedly Sofia Coppola, mostly since ""Lost in Translation"" proved to be such a magical experience.What i expected from this movie was something infinitely lighter. A minor and pleasant distraction. A beautiful little film with wonderful costumes, nice visuals and fair acting. Actually the movie surpassed my expectations. While it was not a masterpiece or a movie i'm likely to remember on my deathbed, it was still a lot more entertaining than i imagined it would be. The actors all do a fine job, Jason Schwartzmann surprising me the most as Louis XVI, and the visuals are wonderful. So the movie delivered where i thought it would. The bonus was the fact that the story was more engaging than i expected. The beautiful and frail Marie Antoinette feels like a real person and i actually cared about what happened to her. Sure in retrospect it might be difficult to feel any true sympathy for someone like her, someone who lives in extraordinary luxury while the masses starve. But it's hard not to see her as somewhat a victim of circumstance. A person placed in a time and place she doesn't fully understand, and who tries to make the best of it.Marie Antoinette is sure to please those mostly interested in the beautiful surface. There is definitely enough of that since this is a beautiful-looking movie. It also has a very nice soundtrack to match the visuals, a mix between modern music and more period-like pieces. Surprisingly though there was also more to like beneath the surface, which made this movie that much more enjoyable. Worth watching! 7/10",Marie Antoinette
87,diane-34,An exceedingly valuable view into 18th century French royalty.,9,18 January 2007,"I was absorbed from the first scenes of this wonderful and valuable film. The cinematography of the horses and carriages while Marie was traveling to France from Austria to meet her French betrothed set the mood for the remainder of the film. Perhaps I am making too much of it but I felt I was looking at a particularly good home-movie rather than a big-time Hollywood costume drama. I realize that it is impossible even with the best of intentions to historically create a costume drama from centuries of hindsight but Coppola, at least to me, carried it off superbly.Diane had read a biography of Marie and everything in the movie was accurate to that biography. I would suggest that any student of royalty in this period or any other should examine this film to see just how weird royal life was. As I said the journey from Austria to France seemed to be a metaphor for the drama that unfolded at Versailles when Marie becomes the French prince's bride. As someone always interested in history, I was fascinated be the peeks provided by Coppola into the daily life of someone caught in this royal merry-go-round.The scene where Marie gives birth to the heir is fascinating. I guess if you want to make sure that there can be no baby switching and that the heir to the throne is really the heir to the throne, then you have twenty or more people standing around watching the birth--not just a doctor and accompanying nurse. I was struck throughout the movie about the public nature of being royal; seemingly everything you do was accompanied by people watching your every move. I guess for these reasons I will never forget this movie because I have never seen scenes like the ones Coppola wrote and directed.I would urge anyone who has any curiosity about just how royalty actually worked, to make every effort to see this wonderful film.",Marie Antoinette

What puzzeles me is how the films director and writer came to put rock and roll in the movie as well as a love ballad from this time in history. First off Kirstin Dunst was miscast in the roll, as well as a bland performance by Jason Schwartzman. This is one of the few times that I could not wait for the movie to end and it seemed an eternity. My advise is to pass this one by and go see something that is worth while.

The film is actually a picture postcard of 18th century Versailles, nothing more...The main problem with this movie is that it never gets us involved, there is no plot, nothing we can actually come to care for. Nothing ever really happens during the over 2 hours the movie goes on for.While watching the movie, I basically found myself all the time waiting for it to start... The relationship between the two main characters is a mystery, an analysis is never attempted, and the viewer is therefore left stranded, not caring about what happens next. In other, I found Coppola's choice of music obnoxious, absolutely unfit for the movie. Last but not least, the ending is to say the least, ridiculous!

92,Flagrant-Baronessa,A wonderful lesson in anachronism,8,9 December 2006,"""That wasn't realistic"" an older man spat to his company as soon as the credits of the film began rolling. His friends all agreed, if only to humour him. He went on to say that the love affair between Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) and Count Fersen (Jamie Dornan) ""had never happened"", and that the ending was ridiculous, amongst other things. My friend and I just looked at each other and shook our heads. Perhaps Coppola's latest is not a film for everyone  but it should at least serve as a wonderful diversion from bitter realism.Although it claims no historical biography tag, the film does document significant parts of the Austrian-princess-turned-Queen-of-France's life, such as leaving her family and beloved dog (the cutest creature I have ever seen, bar none) at home, stripped bare of all things Austrian and thrust into the cold court at Versailles to ""cement the alliance"". It even includes the notorious phrase ""Let them eat cake"" some years later and concludes with Marie and Louis siting stiffly at their grand dinner table, fingering pastries and sipping champagne, while the people revolt with pitchforks outside of the castle. Altogether, Marie Antoinette spans some ten or fifteen years of its titular protagonist's life  but mostly zooms in on the fun stuff.When Marie finds the court cold and uptight and her husband unresponsive, she indulges in lavish shopping, gambling, pastries and parties in which smoking a pipe is the same as smoking pot. There is an endless charade of shoes, wigs, cakes, opera, flowers, stylists, affairs, coy smiles and gossiping to pop music  a chick-flick plugged right into the infamous court of Versailles and wrapped in fancy costume, creating the perfect juxtaposition. The decadent décor channels Gatsby, if anything, and the sheer golden scope of the spectacle sends shivers down your spine. Coppola offers us an invite to soak up the atmosphere, and we take it unflinchingly. There is so much windowdressing to the core of the film that it becomes its core. Soon Marie Antoinette loses itself in its own luxurious world, which is no misstep on Coppola's part, but an apt analogy as it is exactly what the protagonist does. Sweet materialism...Kirsten Dunst is lovely as the Queen of France, handling the demanding role superbly with appropriate dramatic weight. Marie is only a teenager when she first arrives, after all, and Dunst effortlessly portrays that demographic. With her rosy cheeks, warm smile and childlike idealism she starts hugging the stiff pansies in wigs who recoil awkwardly, which gives us a taste of her innocent likability in the film. Luckily, she retains this bubbly attitude throughout. When Louis (Jason Schwartzman) finally warms up to and approaches her in bed, I felt an almost unreasonable happiness for Mariefor the both them in fact. If you scour the Versailles scene I'm sure more fine performances will present themselves but mostly it is quite barren and the only one who truly jumps out and grabs you at first glance in the film is Rose Byrne as Marie's wild friend and countess, providing for the comic delight.Aside from setting, Marie Antoinette's goldmine is perhaps its music score. From calm acoustic, rock, pop, classical to techno, I enjoyed the brave scoring to each scene immensely and when Coppola blasted The Strokes to Kirsten Dunst running in the lonely halls of the court, she completely won me over. I am in fact pressed to find something tangibly wrong with the film, aside from the strangelty abrupt ending. If anything else, it occasionally drags and individual scenes are not always in-tune  but these are minor shortcomings and do not really detract from the overall experience  especially not when I kept smiling throughout.8 out of 10",Marie Antoinette
93,socrates99,This is the first female directed movie I truly admire,9,10 April 2007,"I'd heard that there had been complaints about the music! What a travesty! The music is INGENIOUSLY chosen, and it more than just enhances the drama, it elevates and energizes it. It's up there with the cinematography, and the costumes, and the screenplay, for that matter, as sure signs of Sofia Coppola's undeniable skill and artistry. And both the leads, Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman respond superbly to her direction. Kirsten has made Marie a sympathetic figure in a way only she could have. There can be no doubt, she stimulates attention and understanding more effectively than any other actress of her caliber, I think. She displays physical weakness while wielding an almost inexplicable but irresistible power. And Jason, in what I would think was an undesirable role, gives a memorable and affecting performance, despite the king's historic limitations.As a guy who likes Quentin Tarantino's movies, I still find women directors interesting. But ever since Jane Campion's ""The Piano"" and ""Sweetie"", I had to conclude that women were just not as skillful as the great male directors. This movie is not a visualization and exploration of the historical facts, but it is a truly excellent example of art that took a level of character and maturity to produce that I was beginning to think I'd never see in a woman director. You should see this movie not for its history, but for its seductive vision and cinematic power. Good for you, Sofia! I look forward to your next project.",Marie Antoinette
94,diac228,"A brutal disaster of bad writing, bad directing, and bad editing, Marie fails to entertain or even keep one's interest from the first minute on",2,30 October 2006,"What happens when you mix a famous actress with a relatively unknown cast? What happens when you mix eighteenth century history with modern elements? What happens when a director screws up the entire film? You get Marie Antoinette. Directed quite dryly by Sopia Coppola, Marie is nothing more than eye candy; a slew of visuals but absolutely no content to back it up. The boredom associated with this two-hour snoozefest can be traced back to the writing which has no dialogue, the director which gives no direction, and well, that is about it. With little material to work with, Dunst and the others couldn't work their acting chops; that is, unless, it takes talent to stare at the camera and eat for several moments.Marie Antoinette is about the female-turned-queen whose antics were totally unfit for a woman of such high power, and also her wild life led to getting the blame when the country was short on money, and would eventually lead to her unexpected downfall. Along the way, she has trouble getting along with her destined husband, who unexpectedly becomes king. Both of them were expected to have a child right after marriage, but obvious conflicts in personality prevented this from happening for a very long time. From the very beginning, you see Marie getting ready to head to France to live a new life, and basically the film takes you through her entire life at the throne.Where this film goes wrong, does not happen with the acting or the casting. Kirsten Dunst is one of the main reasons why the Spider-Man movies easily have the best acting in any superhero movie franchise out there, by far. Her bubbly, cute, and charming appearance is then defaced by danger and conflict, revealing a confused, upset, bitter, and soft-shelled Mary Jane. In here, Dunst has absolutely nothing to work with. She has to talk a little (not even with an accent, director's decision), eat a lot, and look at the camera; that is it. With the content presented, Dunst does a good job, but she should have been given more, she should have had a chance to prove herself as an actress. But, Coppola didn't focus on acting at all. If that were the case, then the other people would actually sound French, then the other people would actually talk with emotion attached. The acting was not the problem here.Poorly written, poorly constructed, poorly edited, and poorly directed; all the major flaws of Marie Antoinette. It takes more than an hour for Marie and her husband, Louis XVI, to have any sort of romantic connection, but then it takes less than ten minutes for four years and three children to pass by. The pacing is practically awful, its too slow most of the time and then way too fast when it doesn't need to be. Repetitive shots of Marie waking up in the morning and repetitive shots of Marie and Louis eating in front of their servants doesn't exactly help the pacing either.Where is the dialogue? People can actually watch the first half hour with their ears covered and not actually have to miss important tidbits of conversation. More or less, it's because there is about one or two conversations in the entire first act! What seems to be the focus is the costumes, the scenery, the landscape surrounding the lifeless cast of characters with nothing to say. But, then we have modern music being blasted amongst the fancy and sophisticated cinematography.The reason for modern things being added to eighteenth century France? No idea. It's not proving a point, it doesn't enhance the experience, and it really doesn't help the movie in the least bit. With many things featured in the movie that at the time the film is taking place doesn't even exist yet (special fireworks, champagne bottles). With the direction being a mess, the viewer has absolutely no idea as to whether or not we are supposed to sympathize with Marie. On one hand, she looks like she's heartbroken; yet on several moments she is seen partying, having fun, and then cheating on her husband.On another moment, it looks as if she is being unfairly blamed for the economic troubles of France. Yet there is much more footage of her spending too much money and not enough footage of the French leaders discussing the American Revolution, the actual reason behind the demise in economic status in the grief-stricken country. Coopla can find a good shot of flowers, but for the life in her cannot figure out where to go with this motion picture. Then, like Marie's life, the movie ends abruptly, in a most awkward and frustrating manner.Bottom Line: This is a royal mess. With no dialogue, lack of direction, lack of decent editing, too much running time, and no willingness to make this movie even remotely resembling the time period, Marie Antoinette is bad enough to make historians throw up watching it, and it's bad enough to make even the most awake of viewers fall asleep. It must have been a lot more fun filming it than watching it. Dunst and the acting cast is not to blame, everyone else is. While classical/modern mixing is a tough genre (done well by ""A Knight's Tale"") Coppola had it wrong from the get go, to the very end.",Marie Antoinette
95,samkan,Eye of the Beholden,9,11 November 2006,"This movie is hauntingly good. Sophia Coppola might become (or is) one of our finest film directors.The viewer must accept that the movie is viewed exclusively, STRICTLY, through the eyes and mind of Antoinette. Some reviewers seem disappointed, cheated, etc., because the movie did not cover the broader scope of France, the Revolution, or even the debauchery and treachery of the Versaille society. Rather, it takes a young woman of some intelligence and moral character, places her in extraordinary circumstances and then watches her react. That the results are not sordid, surprising or particularly dramatic is not the fault of the main character but rather the product of her integrity and strength. So instead of a woman who becomes a catty society bitch we have a woman who actively serves the society she joins, enjoying if not overtly recognizing the indulgence the role requires. Instead of becoming a scheming, devious wife she works at and develops a warm, if not entirely faithful, relationship with her arranged and incompetent spouse. Instead of becoming alienated from her upbringing she retains and exercises her maternal and familial roles. Marie can be forgiven if she is neither extraordinary nor controversial, despite being placed in a situation where both such attributes could be (and were) assigned by default.The strength of the film relies on how Marie's point of view is presented. The first forty minutes of the movie has extremely limited dialogue, none of which does very much at all to explain or move a plot line. Rather, we see opulence and splendor. If you find yourself, as I did, overwhelmed and then drawn into the decadence by this mere visual display then, well, that's exactly what happened to Miss Antoinette. Less is more. Hardly a half hour and maybe a dozen lines, we start to feel for Marie, or at least appreciate the boundaries into which she is boxed. The viewer starts to pull for her. But its a fixed game. We know the bottom line and want to tell our heroine but cannot. I had hoped before I saw this movie that we'd get a depiction of the rabble in Paris as well as some period shots of the city; i.e., to match the excellent costume of Versaille. We do not. We do not because Marie never saw such either. Our eyes are not opened because hers are never opened. But in no respect does the film milk the poor little rich girl sentiment. Conversely, a viewer leaves this movie with remorse of what may have been a more full and complete life.",Marie Antoinette
96,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,three is not the charm,5,17 March 2007,"Nepotism is alive and well in Hollywood, however Sofia Coppola proved her film-making talents tenfold with her first two films. She captured the pain of youth and the dark undertones of coming of age with a fresh eye in ""The Virgin Suicides"", and then she offered a highly original twist to a simple story about two lost souls wandering far from home in ""Lost in Translation"". Had ""Marie Antoinette"" been her feature film debut, perhaps her career would be written off as the result of the aforementioned nepotism gone awry, thanks to her father the legendary Francis Ford Coppola.""Marie Antoinette"" is an outlandish period piece starring the charming star of ""Virgin Suicides"", Kirsten Dunst, as the main character. The film is an interesting take on the eighteenth century tale of French royalty during a controversial transition. Unlike the usual stuffy period film in the Merchant-Ivory (""The Remains of the Day"") tradition, Coppola's flick is bright, brash, and bursting at the seams with new wave music, modern ideals, and decidedly American accents. The juxtaposition is fascinating, as second wave feminist attitudes creep over gorgeous period visuals, but the frustrating and slow moving plot line grows tiresome and the well-intentioned attempt to perk up revisionist history for the younger generations, or whatever the point was, is mostly lost.",Marie Antoinette
97,LCShackley,The guillotine was invented for films like this,3,13 May 2008,"This is the kind of film you're allowed to make if your last name is Coppola. If your name is say, Smith or Jones, the studio would laugh in your face. Roger Ebert, whose judgment I usually respect, gave MARIE ANTOINETTE four stars. Maybe he was entranced by the C-name, too.What a misbegotten mess this is! Here was a chance for a truly talented screenwriter to create an exciting, funny, dramatic script about one of the most tragic eras in history. Instead, we get Coppola's Cliff-notes version of French history, accompanied by an anachronistic soundtrack that keeps reminding the viewer that an immature hack is behind this ""entertainment."" And the casting! Dunst has a face like a pancake (crepe?) and about as much emotional range. Schwartzmann looks nothing like Louis XVI and is more boring than Louis possibly could have been. And what are we to think about seeing Rip Torn, Molly Shannon, and Steve Coogan in fairly significant parts? Why not Adam Sandler or David Spade? I'm sure they'd look good in powdered wigs, too.People who hate historical dramas love this film because this is the kind of glitzy sugar-coating they wish ALL history books and films had. It's all about CLOTHES! And SHOES! And HAIR! And BOYS! And...oh yes, occasionally we hear about an invasion, or peasants revolting. But then back to the CLOTHES! I give this movie 3 out of 10 for: 1. The costumes. As long as it's a movie about clothes, they might as well be great-looking, and they are. The large crowd scenes are visually overwhelming.2. The sense of court protocol. We do get a glimpse of how fanatical the courtiers were about rank, etiquette, and procedure. Scenes in the queen's bedroom or the dinner table are excruciatingly rule-bound, which does give us a glimpse into Marie's attitude.3. The locations. Interiors and exteriors are breathtaking. Imagine being given free rein to film all over Versailles. Let's hope this movie doesn't sour the French government on allowing a REAL filmmaker to try this again sometime with better results.",Marie Antoinette

99,nobbytatoes,Sofia likes her cake,8,15 February 2007,"Let them eat cake. Maybe a cake that the masses will not enjoy, but Sofia Coppola likes to have her cake and eat it also. Marie Antoinette strictly not a film that falls back on historical facts to drive its narrative, Coppola focuses on the woman Antoinette and the illustrious aristocracy of 18th century Versailles, a place of set behavior and formality of crass and asinine levels to Antoinette.Marie Antoinette, of Austrian descent is betrothed to French dauphin Louis XVI, to create ties between the two countries. Marie is naive and embodies and eagerness frowned upon. Her cheer doesn't run with the occupants of Versailles, who's currency is scandal and gossip; which Marie finds herself in the center of, when her and Louis fail to consummate their marriage for some time and unfulfilling the wishes to produce an heir. Marie though is a lady of leisure, filling the void made from her unromantic marriage and isolation being an outsider.Marie Antoinette is a change for Coppola. Not a drastic one, her deep exploration of loneliness and isolation which has been the main point of focus her last two films; Lost in Translation and The Virgin Suicides, leans off the heavy emotions for Marie Antoinette, while still incorporating her slow burn, gentle exhale, visual eye and simplistic approach are all in tact. Simplistic may not have been in the vocabulary on costumes, production design and mountains of sweets and cakes. Eye candy galore, with lush and rich design; costumes designed beautifully by Milena Canonero and production design by K.K. Barrett is exquisite. Coppola still explores personal isolation, conveying this and so much with little verbal interaction. The quietness speaks so loudly, with Coppola adding wry humour of the whispered gossip and simplistic moments. More conceptual than historical accurate, Coppola mixes in a contemporary soundtrack to pin point procession; Gang of Four's Natural's Not in It encapsulates the entire film during the opening credits.Teaming up again, Kirsten Dunst is perfect as Antoinette. Portraying Marie's exterior naivety, hidden strengths and strong loneliness, being an outsider in a foreign country. Dead pan not Jason Schwartzman strongest strength, though still manages an awkward Louis XVI. Steve Coogan and Judy Davis are wonderful in the supporting roles as Ambassador Mercy and Comtesse de Noailles. Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson grasp the wry humour perfectly as the gossiping Aunt Victoire and Aunt Sophie.Marie Antoinette may come off as a vanity project, and lack a resonance and poignancy as the softly spoken Lost in Translation or the emotionally haunting The Virgin Suicides, though to all the cakes, Sofia Coppola has made a sweet little treat in Marie Antoinette.",Marie Antoinette
100,alainenglish,"Contemporary, touching and bizarre (major spoilers)",9,5 March 2007,"Renting this movie out on DVD, I had very little idea when I sat down to watch it as to who Marie Antoinette was. I was vaguely aware that she was the French monarch whose reign preceded the French revolution, inflamed by a remark she supposedly made about her people starving through lack of bread ""let them eat cake"". She was guillotined eventually after the revolution. This was all I knew going as I sat down to watch it.The movie certainly stimulated interest in me to know more about the French queen, who the film does its best to portray sympathetically. In this, it largely succeeds and I found myself drawn towards Marie Antoinette and I found her story to be enlightening and in the end very moving.Played by Kirsten Dunst, Marie Antoinette is an Austrian aristocrat's daughter, who is coerced as part of a family connection to be wife to the Dauphin (Jason Schwartzmann), son of King Louis XV of France. As part of the conditions of the marriage, she is required to produce with the Dauphin an heir to the French throne. But attempting this with the sexually passive and uninterested Dauphin, combined with the mindless intrigues and rituals at the French court at the palace Versailles, only serve to alienate Marie from the rest of the world around her...The famed lavish excesses of Marie's lifestyle are here depicted as a logical reaction by her to the stifling gilded prison in which she finds herself, to really move or expresses herself freely. Preoccupied with trying to do this, as well as produce an heir, means Marie does not fully acquaint herself with the political and economic realities of her country until it is far, far too late. In fact the world outside the luxurious environs of French royalty is barely depicted or even referred to. There is ironic reference to French support for the American revolution being one of the things that fuels France's own. Only at the end of the movie, when the revolution reaches Versailles, does reality crash into Marie's self-absorbed world, which literally falls down around her ears. All of this, to me, was entirely logical. Cutting away to events other than what is happening with Marie could have undermined audience sympathy with her.Though keeping her American accent, Kirsten Dunst does a commendable job as Marie. Dunst is one of a number of young Hollywood actresses (among them Natalie Portman, Anna Paquin and ""Hard Candy""s Ellen Page) who pick their projects depending on their relevance and theme. In this, the role of Marie Antoinette is a step in the right direction for Dunst. Jason Schwartzmann is believable as her clueless husband and Steve Coogan is on fine form as Marie's guide and conscience. I would maybe have liked to have seen more of Rip Torn's King Louis XV, to draw a starker contrast between him and his son. As it is, I don't think we see enough of him.Shot in and around Versailles itself, the attention to period detail (the clothes, shoes and food) is meticulous and the presence of a contemporary soundtrack really makes it come alive.A very brave and ambitious project ably pulled off.",Marie Antoinette
101,CelluloidRehab,Let them eat Coppola cake.,6,22 February 2007,"Marie Antoinette is one of those historical figures that has been mostly misunderstood and in which her ""legend"" has preceded the facts. What is interesting, is that which she is most remembered for (the ""let them eat cake"" statement) cannot be historically linked to anything she had uttered. What is even more interesting is her response to what was attributed to her. In summary, she simply stated that the people of France help to maintain the royal family's well being despite the population's misfortunes and that she would work harder to make their lives happier as well. After Sophia's Lost in Translation, I was expecting a lot. This movie has some moments, yet falls quite short of expectations. The fault lies partly in the movie and partly in the subject matter.Marie Antoinette was born an Austrian Archduchess. At the age of 15 she was married to the overweight and virginal-soon-to-become Louis XVI of France. Marie was an outsider at the court of Versailles and was treated this way throughout most of her life. The rampant gossiping, along with the rumors of a ""cold bedroom"" and no heir lead to even more gossiping (lets also not forget the Affair of the Necklace). Madame du Barry (Louis XV's common-born mistress - Asia Argento) did not make life any easier for Marie, in light of Marie's dislike for associating with someone she felt was beneath her. In her youth, she spent and acted frivolously as she apparently did not know or understand the concept of money. After the birth of her children, Marie became much less extravagant and completely devoted to her children. It is in the latter years that Marie Antoinette showed her truer character.The movie tries very hard to convey Marie's childhood innocence and sheltered lifestyle. She is shown as a bit ordinary and unschooled in the ways of Versailles and France. This is partially successful. As the movie stands, the first hour and half are a tribute to Bacchus and the hedonistic lifestyle. The production value of the movie is really high. The costumes, jewelry, wigs and locations are amazing. Are we being shown this as a contrast? Even the choice of music is appropriate to this. The 80's music reminds me of the yuppie lifestyle and mirrors much of Marie's youth. This depiction of the young Marie is the foremost cause of failure of the the primary goal : To depict Marie Antoinette in a more favorable light. This is of course, unless we are given an unabashed look at her. It is hard not to judge, however. Youth and ignorance cannot be an excuse for every deed. She was born into having everything. It is hard to sympathizes with someone who has everything and squanders it callously. Some would say that she was only 15 years old. Unfortunately, a 15 year old in the 21th century cannot be compared with a 15 year old from 200+ years ago.The predominant focus of the movie and it's major flaw, is the reliance on showing Marie's youth. It is not in her youth that her saving grace can be found, but rather in her maturation as a mother and monarch. Unfortunately, only the last 20 minutes of the movie focuses on this and is so rushed as to seem unfinished. If this movie wanted to truly show the character of Marie, it should have focused on the 4 years from the fall of the Bastille to her execution. During this time, she showed her character in the face of an angry and blood-lusting mob. Instead we are left with a miss-paced, long, stylized, summer-like nostalgic romp though the 18th century. It's nice, but I wouldn't want to live there.",Marie Antoinette
102,valis1949,I Want Candy,8,20 April 2009,"Energetic', 'Bright', and 'Lively' are adjectives which best describe Sofia Coppola's film, MARIE ANTOIENETTE. Many historical films are pedantic in that they seem to labor in an attempt to accentuate the difference between a certain historical period and how it contrasts the present. This film is very impressionistic in that Marie's perspective is almost that of a modern teenage girl. She is portrayed as a kind hearted soul who is thrust into an arranged marriage designed only to strengthen relations between two super-powers. Her personal feelings are not even addressed, and much to her dismay, the marriage is not consummated for over seven years. Her attempts to adapt are rebuffed, so she employs the flamboyant and eccentric court life of Versailles as a distraction. The political drama and intrigue of the French monarchy is infused with the whimsy of youth as Marie tries to find her place. The screen is drenched in pastels and scenes sprout inexplicably like an MTV video while the soundtrack blasts the songs of 1980's New Romantics. This music, although wildly out of historical context, embraces the spirit of a young girl who is trying to have the best possible time in troubling circumstances. Whether or not this is an historical accurate picture of the real Marie Antoinette (which is really beside the point), Sofia Coppola's characterization beautifully encapsulates the lightheartedness of a young female in a daunting situation.",Marie Antoinette

104,yris2002,supreme Kirsten Dunst,9,7 October 2009,"This is the latest movie by Sophia Coppola and the first I saw, instilling in me the will to see the two previous ones. Needless to say, the protagonists in all three movies, are women, young women, living in an always definite environment, a hostile environment, being it the royal Palace of Versailles or a metropolis of today (Lost in translation), or a common American suburb in the 70's (The virgin suicides). The young girls are always alone, feel entrapped, oppressed and not understood by the nearest ones. This is evident also in Marie Antoinette, where we are not asked to take historical facts into account, the movie scores on history and politics, they do not matter, we are asked to enter the world of an adolescent, to feel empathy with a girl who was purchased at the age of 14 to become a queen, to be a wife, to bear an heir, never allowing her to be a teenager. And we are able to do this in such a natural way: in an exterior world made of feasts, banquets, cakes, colourful dresses, we can perceive, besides Marie's fun and lust, her deep solitude and suffering. Kirsten Dunst is simply perfect: her naturally attractive and powerful mixture of innocence and yearning for experience, of joy and sadness, emerging from a single glimpse of her eye, make her interpretation supreme. Much negative criticism had been spread around this bio-pic: use of punk-rock music as inappropriate, anachronistic dresses since dyed in colours that could not be achieved at those times, a general boring tone which too brashly disregards history. I totally disagree: that kind of music helps underline the modernity and actuality of feelings which always affect being an adolescent, the overcoloured and over elaborated dresses (wonderful, to say the least), represent a very effective means to contrast the exterior pomp with the inner suffering of the heroine, and the overall tone, disregarding politics and historical facts, is obviously searched for, in order to focus attention on the real protagonist: Marie as a young French girl.",Marie Antoinette
105,eshwarmail,"Stylish and extravagant like the protagonist, but it barely holds the ground with such little substance",6,10 May 2016,"Sofia Coppola endured brickbats and razzies with her debut stint in 'The Godfather III' only to come out stronger as a director with a unique aesthetic. Apart from her trademark visuals and over the top soundtracks, she has a knack and penchant for presenting loneliness and people in out of place situations that hasn't been bettered before, especially my personal favorite 'Somewhere'.'Marie Antoinette' is an extravagant venture just as its protagonist, expectedly following a box-office and critical success - 'Lost in Translation'. With no compromises in the costumes, the background locales, the rich interiors or the talented cast, Coppola is armed to present her stylish vision to narrate the story of an equally if not more stylish Austrian-born French Queen Marie Antoinette, aptly casted and brilliantly portrayed by Kirsten Dunst.The story starts with Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) being shipped off to France for an engagement with Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman) who is a heir to the throne and eventually becomes Louis XVI. Being a stranger in a faraway land, Marie initially struggles to get accustomed to the traditions, pressure to conceive and being looked as an enemy/spy by some subjects due to on-going tensions between France and Austria. Once settled and with growing number of acquaintances, she embraces the fashion and party scene of Versailles and gets carried away with it. Her public display of extravagance and the diminishing coffers makes her a soft target by the hungry public during the midst of the French Revolution.Where Coppola succeeded in visual presentation of style and extravagance, she failed miserably in conveying the biography as it should have been. Intentionally or not, the major political events of Marie Antoinette has been conveniently replaced with more party scenes and display of elegant costumes which after a point gets repetitive in a biography especially. Since the story deals with the majority of Marie's lifespan and not just a segment in her life, it was important for Coppola to have included more of her protagonist's political choices into the narrative. Another interesting observation is that the movie never shows common public until the final revolution occurs, which is intelligent - as it makes the audience realize even harder by suddenly seeing soiled hungry people after repetitive partying and costumes and richness.Kirsten Dunst has fit the role like a glove exuding confidence, charisma and mischievousness necessary for the role and her presence is a major factor into making this movie watchable. Jason Schwartzman has a limited screen-time but does a decent job as the shy confused introvert. There are a number of other actors whose roles are partially developed like that of Duchesse de Polignac by Rose Byrne or Count Axel Fersen by Jamie Dornan and they seem to come and go without making any impact. Coppola is famous for her soundtracks and it was very bold even for her to come up with a contemporary soundtrack for an early modern period drama, but it does sound good with its slick editing and presentation. There are many movies with style over substance, Coppola (after Tarantino) seems to have made it her own with necessary skill-set and creativity to execute it to perfectness.Stylish and extravagant like the protagonist, but it barely holds the ground with such little substance.",Marie Antoinette

1. The set and costume design is incredibly beautiful, amazingly designed and utterly hypnotic.
2. The comedy is perfectly timed, risible, but never overwhelming.

4. Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette) and Jason Schwartzman (Louis XVI) deliver brilliant performances.
5. The colour palette is mesmerising with its' rich and luscious colouring that reinforces the extravagant wealth and luxury of the monarchy, especially when compared to the dulling colour that occurs in response to death and revolution.Cons:
1. The alt-rock soundtrack feels wholly distracting and nonsensical.
2. The death of Louis XV (Rip Torn) falls flat as he's barely in the film which means he's not fleshed out that well.
3. The second act begins to drag and drift which makes it difficult for you to pay attention.
4. There are far too many side characters with separate sub-plots, and as a result, very few of them are actually developed and compelling.",Marie Antoinette
107,davidtraversa-1,Sex (less?) on a Huge Bed.,8,9 January 2012,"I just now saw this 6 years old film. It still looks very nice. Gorgeous paintings of that famous (infamous?) Versailles period in every frame, just before the French Revoution terminated all that in a blood bath (Guillotine for everyone, including later for most of the revolutionaries that dethroned Marie Antoinette's King husband, herself, family and friends).I read some of the reviews and many of them are such a scream that I couldn't stop laughing. For example, they say that this movie was an experiment by Sofia Coppola where she compares contemporary adolescent Angst with an adolescent Queen from Versailles and that the contemporary music clarifies that concept making the union between Marie Antoinette's eighteen century and our present next door troubled teenager perfectly clear for any informed person... (shame on you if you didn't get this previous information).That's nice.Pity that Coppola didn't incorporate her thesis in a less cryptic message, since her movie is a perfectly conventional period piece (contemporary music alone won't make ANY connexion as a Time Machine subterfuge).Another thing: The clothes were absolutely breathtaking (each scene Marie Antoinette is seen with another outfit, and what an outfit!!!) ""This thing? --she will say-- I just found this thing in the closet""... (no, I'm kidding, she has never said that).The food shots run into the thousands and the Home Economist/s that prepare them must have had a ball, because their resources were obviously tremendous.And watching these darlings stuffing their faces with all that food piling up or toppling down from silver/gold trays placed all over, and apparently eating non stop from morning to next morning (they seemed to live entirely for pleasure and never slept) one wonders how could they hold all that volume of food in their incredible 18 inches waistlines... (I know, they were corseted to death, but corsets can go only that far..., the rest has to burst out in some other unexpected places...).And then we have the issue of authenticity: It's notorious the lack of personal hygiene as close to us as the beginning of the XXth Century, same with laundering (then done by hand by laborious washer women) so, how come they wore (in the film) those fabulous SPOTLESS garments, many of the gorgeous fabrics machine embroidered (?) wrinkle free (?), hems impeccable (they didn't walk only on polished multicolored marble floors, because again, we know through historical research that these aristocrats would squat down on the marble stairs and do all their bodily needs there (neither toilet paper nor bidets were available then as incredible as it seems now to anybody living in a civilized country) so they would get up and continue walking and talking as if nothing happened and obviously without ever looking back (the train of their dresses took care of that).According to very serious historians, the smells in Palace where nothing comparable to Chanel #5... and that, next to unwashed armpits (not mentioning more alarming body creases...), terrible dental conditions --diseased gums and teeth-- will make us say, as W.C. Fields stated on his tombstone: ""I Rather Be in Philadelphia"".Should a period movie disregard these facts as too crude for our contemporary sense of prudery and give us just colorful Fashion Plates to delight our senses or should they instruct us in the true facts of life as it was lived then?British designers for period wardrobe --and hairstyles, make up, etc.-- in the movies, are the best for period authenticity right now, they make a great deal of research to produce the most authentic garments and general ambiance.I think this ""Authentic versus Bogus period thing"" is a question opened for debate. ""Marie Antoinette"" is a visually glorious movie and quite entertaining if you only want a Reader's Digest Summary of that particular French period in their history, and very-very pretty shots.",Marie Antoinette
108,jonathanruano,Marie Antoinette (2006) -- Review,1,15 March 2009,"Usually, I can watch a movie to the end. But in the case of Marie Antoinette, I failed miserably in the attempt. If ""Marie Antoinette"" is not the dullest movie in existence, then the directors who have come up with worse should be utterly ashamed of themselves.I don't care if a movie, like Marie Antoinette, is not historically accurate. What I do care about is when it does not give us anything of interest to hang on to. Kirsten Dunst's Marie Antoinette comes across as a ditsy teenager, which may entertain some people, but frankly I met so many ditsy teenage girls in my time that I can do without seeing a film about one. Jason Schwartzmann makes a terrible Louis XVI, because all we see is a clueless king. The real Louis XVI was more interesting and complex than the one in the film. He was a product of his own age. He tried to solve the financial crises of his own reign by appointing one minister after the other. But these ministers failed, because they faced outdated Feudal structures, like the provincial parlements and the office-holders, which thwarted any attempt to reform the tax system; reforms that could have generated more revenue and helped solve the financial crises. Rip Torn, who is best doing comic roles, is miscast as Louis XV, a king who in reality is far more complex and far more interesting than Sophia Coppola makes him out to be.But unfortunately the problems don't end there. The different accents (which results from the film director picking an all-star cast and allowing them to speak in their own accents) clash. The excerpts with rock n'roll make the film an awkward experience. It is almost as though film director Sophia Coppola (who also wrote the screenplay) wanted to create a period piece and a contemporary piece at the same time. But since the 18th century was obviously a very different from the 21st century, the result is a jumbled film with fits and starts. What Ms. Coppola should have done was to make 18th century France understandable to her audience -- just as her father Francis Ford Coppola made the secret underworld of the Mafia understandable to his viewers. But that takes a special talent, which I am not sure Ms. Coppola has.It does not help that the film lacks a real plot. First, we wonder whether the wedding between Marie and Louis XVI will succeed -- we wonder, but we don't care, because neither character establishes a connection with us. After the answer to that question is given, we see a disjointed plot with gambling scenes, Marie playing with her children and Louis XVI doing some state business. Finally, the French Revolution sends everything crashing down. But again who cares? The reason why the plot does not work is not simply because it is disjointed and we do not care about the characters, but rather because the events that come to pass on film are not given any meaning. Ms. Coppola could solve that problem in many ways. Perhaps, she could even portray France as it was in the 18th century. A France locked into the Feudal age, in spite of the monarch's pretensions for being absolute. A France that had a hodge-podge of different laws for different provinces and even different towns, resulting in a legal system that was so unequal, so confusing and so unfair that the revolutionaries made a single law code for the whole of France one of their key demands. But these issues are not discussed. Louis XVI's approach to these problems was glossed over. And we do not really understand why the idyllic world at Versailles suddenly came crashing down.Obviously a lot of money was spent on the sets and costumes, but it seems to be such a waste considering what Sophia Coppola finally came up with. I rarely bring environmental issues into a movie review. But if you are going to pollute the planet and wreck the delicate balance that exists between human beings and nature, then at least don't come up with trash like Marie Antoinette. Indeed if Hollywood did not make bad films, they would be doing the environment a big favor.",Marie Antoinette
109,Jay_Exiomo,Hollow sweetness,5,1 November 2006,"Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" is, to some extent, the equivalent of having a plateful of fancy cake for the entrée. It's delectable up to a point, and then it's gastronomically exhausting and you're left craving for the real meal following an induced sugar rush.Based from Antonia Fraser's biographical account of the French Queen, the film follows Austrian princess Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), who at 14 is sent to France to marry the dauphin Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). Detached from those around her and confused by her situation, Marie soon is thrust into a world of scandals, including one with King Louis XV's (Rip Torn) mistress, Madame du Barry (Asia Argento). Upon the king's death, her husband ascends to the throne and she soon goes on a shopping spree, subsequently becoming France's leading fashion icon, while the rest of the country is left to complain of this royal overindulgence. And rumors just grow more rampant. Like why she and King Louis XVI can't have a child, and her alleged affair with Count Axel von Fersen (Jamie Dornan).""Marie Antoinette"" works well as a visual feast as it employs authentic subset of the Versailles environment fortified by the deluxe production design and glazed cinematography. Another intriguing aspect of the movie is its anachronistic soundtrack that blends 80s New Wave with Baroque music. It's a far-out approach to a period piece that might have turned off a whole lot and could have played a major part for the boos.Still the non-conformist style of film-making works as the film plays out as less than a history lesson or a social commentary than a testament of the director's apparent attraction to confused female characters thrown into isolation. The main problem of this film, though, is that ironically, while Coppola tries so hard to put the main character in a subjective light, the exposition leaves much to be desired emotionally. After the first hour, the movie drags and becomes hasty with less historical discourse. Ultimately, the film becomes anticlimactic.Nevertheless, Dunst perfectly captures both her title character's inanity and restraint. Likewise, Schwartzman achieves in providing an introverted awkwardness to the inert King Louis XVI. And in a cast dominated by underused characters, few barely stand out, like Argento, Torn, and Steve Coogan as th Austrian diplomat Count Mercy d'Argenteau.""Marie Antoinette"" had the potentials of a great film if the main character had just been fully realized underneath the sweetness of it all. An occasional cake indulgence sounds good but too much of it just isn't enough.",Marie Antoinette
110,tccandler,Sofia Coppola gets the quiet moments right...,10,20 October 2006,"This isn't your mother's period-piece...I fell head over heels for this playful film within the first fifteen minutes. ""Marie-Antoinette"" follows in the tradition of Coppola's earlier efforts, delicately balancing femininity and loneliness in a world that feels awkward and shallow. If you adored the sensibilities of the 2003 masterpiece, ""Lost in Translation"", this film will strike many familiar notes.There are certain scenes in certain films that make you aware you are in the presence of greatness. I had that feeling when ""Amelie"" skipped stones on the canal. I had that feeling when Lucius and Ivy spoke quietly on the porch in ""The Village"". I had that feeling when Elizabeth Bennett spun on her swing in ""Pride & Prejudice"". I had that feeling when Bill Murray told us that, ""For relaxing times... Make it Suntory time!""In this film, I knew I was watching something special when Antoine is making her way from Austria to France to meet her fiancé, the Dauphin -- heir to the French throne. In any typical period piece, the journey would have been brief, showing us her departure, a scenic middle shot to pass the time, and her arrival. However, in ""Marie-Antoinette"", we are transported into her world. We are invited to share her quiet times. This journey reveals her youth and the boredom, nervousness and excitement that comes along with it.She arrives at the border to complete the transfer, as if she were a legal document. She is asked to strip and to bid adieu to her family, friends and pets. She is inspected and remade into the Dauphine of France, wholly unprepared for what lays ahead.Director, Sofia Coppola, is so attune to the complexities of young womanhood. Every film she has done explores the subject with such depth and care. I am not sure there has ever been a director, an overwhelmingly male occupation over the years, who has been able to capture those feelings on film with such clarity and wistfulness.Kirsten Dunst has never been one of my favorites. I have found her to be a charming and capable actress up to this point, but she has never blown me away. That is no longer true. Her portrayal is simultaneously exuberant and restrained, spontaneous and thoughtful, grateful and disappointed, blissful and tinged with regret.She plays the role with the freedom of a child -- and let's face it, Marie-Antoinette is exactly that. That she partakes in extravagant parties, shopping sprees, gambling entertainment & decadent feasts is only to be expected. She is a teenager trying to have fun in a stuffy world of structure and tradition, which she clearly describes as ""ridiculous"". ""But that, my dear"", replies one of her assistants, ""is Versailles.""She is also pressured with trying to provide France an heir to the throne -- a task she finds difficult with such an aloof Dauphin (Schwartzman), who is more interested in hunting and key-making than in her porcelain assets.Everything about this film focuses on her insulated world, which stifles her natural energy, and her attempts to make it bearable -- perhaps even, dare she say it, a little fun.What Coppola does so masterfully here is to style this story in such a way, with lavish visuals and a mélange of music, that it feels like a ""young"" film. She blends music of the time with contemporary tunes. She is unencumbered by the formal nature usually assigned to period pieces, shifting from the formality of Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" to the patience of Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" to the free-flowing movement of Robert Altman's and Paul Thomas Anderson's steadicam. She doesn't demand uniformity with dialogue or accents. She allows the film to take on a life of its own, making it one of the most original efforts in recent memory.Coppola uses melancholic bands like New Order, films as varied as ""Amadeus"" and ""Badlands"", and designers like Vivienne Westwood to influence every single frame of this movie. It truly is a unique vision. This extremely talented director has already established her own look and feel. I am sure I would recognize one of her movies without knowing in advance -- and there only a handful of directors who can evoke that compliment.Throughout this film, there is a haunting thread of inevitability. We all know Marie-Antoinette's fate and the film glides to a delicate final act which avoids the predictable and gratuitous ending that some other filmmakers would have provided. Instead, we solemnly watch the final few days, as the angry civilian mob descends upon Versailles to revolt against the monarchy. We observe the farewells to friends. We are handed one final elegant meal, with a sympathetic touch of the hand... and a sorrowful goodbye from a carriage heading to the gallows.I am so grateful to have found another film like this. I am equally grateful to have another director whose films I will eagerly anticipate above all others. ""Marie-Antoinette"" is assured a place near the top of my 2006 list. It is another quiet masterpiece for those of us who don't need our ""cake"" handed to us on a plate.© Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",Marie Antoinette
111,darkdementress,Good,6,22 October 2019,"First let me say this movie has one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard and because of that a few scenes were really not great. I feel like the director was going for a teen coming of age story which is not what this should of been. The eating candy montage was especially corny and annoying.Besides those follies the movie was fun, light hearted and Kirsten Dunst did a great job. I'm not sure how close to history it was but the story was entertaining to watch. Also the costume and set people did an amazing job. Better then average. 6/10",Marie Antoinette
112,ldavis-2,Off With Their Heads!,2,2 April 2007,"While it's true that Maria Theresa instructed her daughter to be nice to Madame du Barry, the real reason isn't made clear. Madame had supreme influence over Louis XV, and - after helping bring about Choiseul's downfall - she seriously threatened the Franco-Austrian alliance. I don't know which was funnier: Mercy-Argenteau telling Marie to make nice with Madame or him getting cheesed because she didn't read the brief on Poland! And why is Marie being told to make nice when Louis's guests openly diss Madame at dinner?Marie and Fersen were not lovers (despite rumors at the time), and it is outrageous to insinuate that he fathered Louis-Joseph. Who knows if the real Fersen actually strutted around the battlefield like Napoleon (the funniest thing in the movie), but any sympathy I had for Marie I lost when Coppola had her put out for this Swedish meatball!Coppola has Marie smoking weed and at least two guests snorting coke! Although that would explain A LOT, there is no proof that she or anyone else in her posse got blasted on anything stronger than champagne and bonbons!France backed America for one reason: to stick it to her arch-enemy, England. I assume Coppola insinuates that we caused the Bourbons' downfall to please the Bush-haters, but to no avail: the Bush-haters at Cannes booed Francis's little girl right out of the theater!Coppola blew a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Who wouldn't kill to film at Versailles? But it could have been shot on a sound stage for all I knew. 50% mess, 50% acid-trip, she doesn't even try to weave the music in so that it jibes with what we're seeing! Some critics have opined that she was trying to convey Marie's state of mind. That would have worked had Marie been played by an actual actress. Instead, we get Dunst, whom, I'm convinced, was born zonked. Schwartzman is downright laughable as Louis XVI. Thirty seconds of these twits, and you understand why there was a Revolution! Dare I say it, Marie-Antoinette deserves better.",Marie Antoinette
113,Ziya90,My queen is Sofia Coppola,8,3 January 2010,"Of course for the people who are obsessed with historical inaccuracies, Marie Antoinette is a so so movie. I seriously get bored of this, for every war movie almost and also historical movies, people say historically inaccurate! This is disturbing to me, because the thing they missed is the movie itself, cinema! Sofia Coppola made a movie that includes no cliché and besides unconventional a bit which most people don't like. It costs her, some critics and audiences criticize her movie very harshly, did not appreciate. As for me, Lost in Translation was a very good movie, but Marie Antoinette is her best work. After Lost in Translation, I thought that she was a very good director, but after Marie Antoniette, I think that even if she is not a master, she is a great director. The Other Boleyn Girl. The Duchess. Why such movies have been appreciated? Because they met the expectations of many people that I can call mass audience. Unfaithfulness, cheating, forbidden love, betrayal. All the clichés and material which get people's, especially women's interest. Every time the same story, love triangles, a heavy story telling, everyone falls in love with each other, a man loves a woman and another woman loves this man or a man loves a woman, but later she falls in love with another man, like a boring and vicious cycle. Returning to Marie Antoinette, Kirsten Dunst is the best choice for this role and I applaud her for her extemporary acting. This character is also an anti cliché figure. Marie Antoinette is not like the women in The Sex and The City, so she does not always think of sex or shopping, shopping or sex. She is not like typical college girls, she is not fickle, she is not giddy, she is different from the girls in Tarantino's Death Proof who send and take messages night and day and always prate about their doings and men. Therefore, I loved this character. Marie Antoinette looks like a girl who tries to benefit from the boons of the palace and enjoy. Another revolutionary point is the relationship between Antoinette and her husband. In the wedding night, we get that her husband is impotent, gay or does not love her at all, even hates her. He delays her almost every night (and this makes The Sex and The City fans angry) All these shows that besides a great director, she is a great script writer. As for direction, story telling and cinematography, since Barry Lyndon, there had not been such a mesmerizing and beautiful film. The scene which we see various candles, cakes and chocolates were elegant, the scene that Antoinette and her friends watch the rising of the sun, the opera scene, the phaeton scene which we hear a pop song and the scenes take place in the animal garden are my favorites, mesmerizing, but the other parts of the film are not different too. I know why its rating is extremely low, remember, ''historically inaccurate'' people.",Marie Antoinette
114,jemps918,Director Sofia Coppola turns voyeur in her version of the infamous,7,4 November 2006,"Director Sofia Coppola turns voyeur in her version of the infamous Marie Antoinette. It reads straight out of a Wikipedia entry on the subject (the script is actually based on Antonia Fraser's book) but doesn't aim to educate; rather, it affords a glimpse of the young queen's human side, showing how she lived, which seemed to explain how she couldn't possibly have maliciously intended to ruin France.Kirsten Dunst was a good choice to play the teen queen; she was able to credibly transcend from a 15-year old to a more mature woman. She earnestly played her character, and endured the punishing, intimate shots of intense close-ups and disturbingly quiet scenes. Jason Schwartzman was also adequate in playing the role of Marie Antoinette's similarly young and inept king.The visuals are stunningly rich, with establishing shots straight out of Victorian paintings. The lush clothes, furniture, landscapes and light all delightfully intertwine into what is believably accurate and painfully shallow. For this, Coppola was able to successfully replicate the period better than other grayer, more formal period films. She patiently shot inordinately long scenes that allowed the audience to empathize with the awkward quiet and idleness of the time.Coppola's storytelling is disconcertingly quieter; reliant on the atmosphere, not on conversations. The creative choice of juxtaposing moody new wave music from the 1980s (supplied by Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure, etc.) surprisingly fit the illustrative sequences. Even the acting took a back seat to fit the tableau, effectively showing that Marie Antoinette is not the central character after all, but a mere cog of French society. For this, Marie Antoinette, according to Coppola's candy flick, cannot be faulted, having only desperately and dutifully played her part.",Marie Antoinette
115,ozjeppe,Some different teenage angst! Touching and original.,6,27 November 2006,"Original, touching and surprisingly humorous account of the famed and ill-fated young Queen of France; definitely with some new touches, such as a rock-pop soundtrack... Out of place? Wrong way to do it? Well, if director Sofia Coppola hadn't made it this way, she probably would've been accused of yet another stale period & costume- piece with nothing new added. Well, this IS new! And needless to say, it's visually gorgeous and nicely acted. I must admit that at first, I was annoyed by the limited narrative perspective of her life. I felt trapped. Then it hit me: the claustrophobic feel is due to the fact that it has to be. This is Antoinettes POV all along- Versailles is a prison, set as a farce of etiquette codes, and her marriage is a lifetime sentence, that says: get pregnant or be gone! Some different teenage angst...6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",Marie Antoinette
116,moutonbear25,This cake sucks.,6,22 October 2006,"MARIE ANTOINETTE Written and Directed by Sofia CoppolaIt is very quiet. Austrian Archduchess, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), aged 15, has just been betrothed to Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman), the future king on France. Throughout the long trip from Austria to France, there is an odd expression on everyone's face. It's as if the air itself is uncomfortable. As the French court awaits Marie Antoinette's arrival, they putter around amidst the leaves and talk amongst themselves about nothing at all. They all seem to be thinking something to themselves. Judging from the same puzzled expressions on the moviegoers' faces at the screening of Sofia Coppola's MARIE ANTOINETTE I attended, I think they might be thinking how strange the entire scenario seems. Everything feels a little bit slow, a little too quiet and mostly out of place. It is too early to give up on the film at this point. After all, this is Coppola's follow-up to the haunting, offbeat LOST IN TRANSLATION. We are in good hands. This uneasiness must be in step with what Marie Antoinette is going through. Once she finds her footing, I'm sure she will break out of her shell and show these French folk how to live freely and the film will follow. Well, Marie Antoinette, the person, gets the hang of it but sadly, MARIE ANTOINETTE, the movie, never does. It remains hollow and aimless, leaving me wondering how Coppola could have been happy with it.Coppola took a decidedly different and brave approach to chronicling the woman who became the queen of France at age 19. She cast American actors in French roles and did not have them speak French or even with an accent. She boosts the soundtrack with 80's new wave music instead of music of the period. The choices are meant to highlight the lonely plight of Marie Antoinette, to show that her emotional journey is timeless. Only Dunst shows hardly any emotion in the title role so there is nothing to take away. She can handle isolated and she can party with the best of them but she doesn't show any turmoil or inner-conflict. It doesn't help that Coppola's script features naturalistic dialogue either. People rattle on about nonsense and gossip but rarely ever say anything of note to each other. Perhaps this is what Coppola had intended to show but meaningless conversation needs to give insight into a character's mind at the very least. Here, all the minds are empty.If it weren't for the fashion and the food (and the fortune that must have been spent on making everything look so lavish), there would be nothing at all to focus on. For such famous historical figures, very little actually seems to happen to them. For what seems like half the movie, the entire plot focuses on how Louis won't have sex with Marie Antoinette. It is certainly a pressing matter as an heir has to be produced in order to validate their marriage. If it is not consummated, it may even be annulled. When the ""great work"" was finally done, Marie Antoinette is elated but there is no explanation as to why it was so difficult to begin with nor does it seem like it became any more frequent afterwards. Her brother had a chat with the future king and that supposedly did the trick. There is no mention as to what that chat was about so your guess is as good as mine as to what finally turned him on. Historically, Marie Antoinette became the scapegoat for France's increasing deficit. Whereas the majority of France's money had been sunk into the 7 Years' War and aiding the Americans in their struggle for independence from England, the masses pointed their fingers at Marie Antoinette's frivolous spending. She went from an adored queen to being chased from her palace. The build that led to that change must have been tumultuous but Coppola leaves history at the door while very little happens inside. By the time the mob shows up to drive her and the king out, it feels more like a device than a moment in time.I can see why the French booed at Cannes. MARIE ANTOINETTE is a calculated project that was troubled since its conception (Coppola abandoned it during the script writing process to create LOST IN TRANSLATION because she wasn't sure how to make it work). The deliberate disregard for historical accuracy may have been valiant to start but finished feeling labored. Coppola's previous works relied on emotion more so than dialogue to get under the skin of the viewer. Their success announced great promise for MARIE ANTOINETTE but Coppola lost her edge somewhere amongst the hundreds of pairs of Minolo Blahniks custom made for the film. A lesser director would not have taken such an ambitious approach to this story. A lesser director would have made a film far worse than this one. May MARIE ANTOINETTE be but a misstep along the path of a brilliant career.",Marie Antoinette

And overall, I was both pleasantly surprised, but also... not surprised at all.The casting was one good surprise. I happen to like Dunst as an actress, but was unsure how she'd be as France's infamous queen... yet she pulled off incredibly well!! In fact, I think everyone was cast perfectly in this movie.However, after the movie was done... I kind of forgot about it. It didn't impact me aside from the sheer feast for the eyes.

Well, damn the critics, I was blown away by the magnificent costumes, sets and dramatic approach to this period of French history. Yes, hearing American accents in certain scenes I found to be rather obnoxious, but over all, I thought MARIE ANTIONETTE was a delight to the eye, and to the ear, with music which added to the drama of the story. So, Sofia, ""you go girl!"" The cast was very good, but in Kristen Dunst, she was just amazing in how she grew from a shy,timid Austrian Princess, into a mother of such beautiful children. What MARIE ANTIONETTE accomplishes is to show on such a lavish screen a portrait of Royalty that brought to the surface the shallowness and vapidness of their existence.

119,Rathko,Incompetent and Xenophobic Travesty of a Movie,2,23 October 2006,"Coppola's signature style  minimalist character development, superficial musings on life without any plot or drama  is here revealed for what it truly is; the clumsy attempts of a scion of Hollywood royalty to disguise her obvious lack of any discernible talent. 'Virgin Suicides', the impossibly over-rated 'Lost in Translation', and now 'Marie Antoinette', provide audiences with a damning trilogy of the very worst of film industry nepotism. Can any of us truly believe for a moment longer than this fiasco of a movie would ever have been made were it not for father Francis' power, or that his presence as Executive Producer, alongside her brother Roman's as Second Unit Director, and cousin Schwartzman's non-performance as Louis XVI, doesn't mark it out as the nepotistic family affair that it truly is?'Marie Antoinette' is a monumentally bad movie. There is no real plot, no narrative worthy of the term, no story beyond a few events casually strung together. There is no drama, no tension, no motivation given to any character. The entire movie consists of vacuous individuals wandering around beautiful and uninhabited locations doing absolutely nothing. Just as 'Lost in Translation' was little more than a tedious montage of Coppola's Tokyo vacation videos, so 'Marie Antoinette' amounts to little more than footage of friends playing dress up in old buildings. And to make matters worse, they play dress up in inaccurate clothing in buildings that would not be built for another 100 years!Devoid of any historical or political content, we see none of the political machinations of Antoinette and the various aristocratic power players in court. We see nothing of Louis's agonized indecision over the steady forward march of democratic reform. We see nothing of the chaotic bustling city that was the Palace of Versailles, the troop maneuvers or constant petitioning that foreshadowed the march of the Parisian fishwives. We see, and feel, nothing of the woman Marie Antoinette or her plight. Just as Coppola invites us in 'Lost in Translation' to laugh at the Japanese and Japanese culture, at the funny accent and oh-so-amusing cultural idiosyncrasies, here she invites us (repeatedly) to laugh at the hilarious sight of men wearing make-up and wigs. Her complete disregard of history goes way beyond a filmmakers desire to update a compelling story and reveals a deep-seated contempt for history, tradition, and foreign cultures.But such contempt can hardly come as a surprise when Coppola's movies are invariably auto-biographical. They tell the stories of bored little rich girls who desperately want to be taken seriously while ordering room service and buying new shoes. I sincerely hope that every critic that has heaped praise on this talentless fraud of a writer/director, and everyone who voted for her Oscar win, is suitably ashamed, for this Empress has finally been revealed to truly have no clothes.",Marie Antoinette
120,lotekguy-1,plenty for the eyes; not much for the head or heart,3,22 October 2006,"Kirsten Dunst stars as one of history's most infamous aristocrats in a splendid-looking, tediously dull account of her life from the arranged marriage to France's heir apparent (Jason Schwartzman. Really. No kidding. Him), through their ascent to the throne and the start of La Revolution.The script presents Marie rather sympathetically. Leaving her Austrian home behind to forge an alliance by marrying another teenager is purely a matter of duty. Louis, poised to become #XVI, is a complete nerd, and possibly gay. Her mission is to do whatever it takes to bear a child, since the union, and its vital political benefits, isn't a done-deal until a royal baby pops out. Heavy pressure.Director Sofia Coppola was obviously granted a budget for costumes and sets more lavish than the palace's legendary excesses. Too bad no one had the clout to shift a few of those dollars or euros to the writing fund. She gets sole screenplay credit, and therefore deserves the blame. The cast (notably including Rip Torn's raunchy Louis XV and Judy Davis) and premise were in place for a witty, racy view of the players and their fate. Versailles was cleverly dissed a few years ago in ""Ridicule"". Had they opted for more dramatic psychological tension, Willem Dafoe's ""The Night and the Moment"" would have served as a model. At the very least, they could have tweaked the nudity and debauchery up to R-rating levels for some cheap thrills. The only novelty is showing the absurd formalities and protocols in every mundane daily function; for Marie, simply rising from her bed in the morning entailed a rigidly-orchestrated ceremony - a far cry from being satisfied with ""Folger's in your cup"" as the bests part of waking up.Coppola tantalizes with anachronistic rock tunes over the credits and again later in the film, but to no avail. That gimmick worked delightfully in ""A Knight's Tale"", when the action and tongue-in-cheek story meshed with the music (who didn't go nuts along with that medieval jousting crowd getting pumped for the battle by ""We will, we will rock you!!""). But Coppola, perhaps seduced by the opportunity to shoot her film at Versailles, chose to dote on shoes, clothes, jewelry, furnishings and pastries - essentially all the pomp of Marie's circumstance - like one of those voyeuristic TV tours of rich and famous folks' homes, with few laughs, less drama, and diminishing reasons to care about the heads beneath the wigs. After its theatrical run, it should air on one of the home-shopping programs, rather than the premium movie channels.I won't say whether they show Marie's last gasp on the guillotine; but many in the audience will have found their own heads nodding off long before the film reaches that point.

Sofia Coppola's follow-up to ""The Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation"" bears her trademark again: The exact examination of human feelings through often tiny aspects of one's personality. Underlay this with great modern melancholy pop classics and you have a mixture of high class. The first half of this movie is so great again, I absolutely loved it. And although nothing really changes after the first half it drags on a little bit too long in the end. The film doesn't tell a big story, but nevertheless a great one. This is definitely a movie where the fault for the bad reviews (at least for the very bad) lies in wrong expectations. I've never liked Kirsten Dunst better in a movie, she was absolutely amazing. Sofia Coppola has a sixth sense for transforming feelings into on-screen pictures, this makes her one of my favourite directors. There are not many directors where a lesser film is as interesting, fresh and good as ""Marie Antoinette"". I can't wait for her next project.",Marie Antoinette
122,ReganRebecca,A comedy of excess,8,26 September 2008,"Marie Antoinette is most famous for her extravagant excess and her tragic demise, but in her biopic of the last French queen Sophia Coppola makes the interesting choice of focusing only on her years at Versailles, a period which spans roughly 15 years, from 15 to 30. The story is a familiar one to anyone who has ever watched (or read) a female-focused story about a European royal. A rich woman is sold off through marriage to a cold/unkind/unfaithful/un-relatable equally wealthy royal and she spends the rest of the movie tragically flitting around the extravagant scenery, looking ravishing while bemoaning the fact that she can buy everything but her husbands love. What makes Marie Antoinette rather unique in the royal biopic tradition is that Coppola decides to bypass most of the melodrama in order to celebrate the up-beat, witty, teen-queen who charmed France and handled her royal problems with grace and dignity. I've never been a fan of Kirsten Dunst, but her sunny disposition and little girl looks are perfect here. She is at once graceful and naïve, over-spending but at the same time dutiful and eager to please. Dunst's comic timing in this movie is impeccable. When she is forced to speak to Madame du Barry, she nails the casually bored voice that demonstrates the ridiculousness of the situation and her reluctance to be a part of it. She is also careful to portray Marie Antoinette as innocent and ignorant rather then out and out stupid. In one particularly cute scene the queen declares that she would like to have large trees planted all along a walk-way. When she is reminded that money in the royal coffers is tight, she generously decides to go with the ""little trees"" rather then spend all that money on the larger ones. I must admit I was also extremely skeptical when I heard that Coppola had cast her cousin, Jason Schwartzman, as Marie Antoinette's husband but he too handles his (mostly silent) role perfectly. He is the quiet, shy, foil to Dunst's sunny queen, the dweeb to her cheerleader. Coppola plays up the differences between them for comedic effect, and it works well. You can imagine that if Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI were average teenagers in modern day France, they wouldn't even talk to each other, and yet because of the age they live in and their political positions they are forced into a bizarre, yet friendly, marriage. The ensemble is incredibly tight, with cameos by many accomplished actors. Judy Davis steals every scene she's in, Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson (random side note: Shirley Henderson is hilarious AND brilliant. Someone needs to give her a leading role.) play the two bitchy tantes to perfection, Asia Argento is slimy and seductive as the trashy Madame du Berry, Rose Byrne is sumptuous as the saucy Duchess du Polignac and on and on. The movie itself works best in its first half. The painfully funny inability of Louis XVI to consummate his marriage provides the plot for the first half of the movie. As Marie Antoinette learns the ridiculous rules of the French court and makes room for her own traditions she is constantly kept grounded by the fact that her husband refuses to bed her and that she has yet to provide any heirs to the throne. Coppola lovingly flits from the church, to the dining hall, to the bedroom giving us a feel for the whirlwind of monotony that becomes Marie Antoinette's life. Like many directors, she is fascinated by the golden cage imprisoning her heroine and yet unlike so many directors she openly invites her audience to laugh at the excesses and childish naïveté of her characters. When Marie Antoinette's brother drops by for a visit he is the one who must explain the act of sex to young Louis by using a key and lock metaphor, hilarious since the only thing Louis seems to show any interest in are locks and keys. Sadly, once the marriage is consummated and the longed for dauphins and dauphines arrive any narrative thread is dropped and the movie instead becomes a series of cobbled together vignettes. Marie Antoinette takes a lover, loses said lover, has some children, and then loses some children. Not that the vignettes are not beautiful and effective, only that the treatment of Antoinette's twenties seems hurried compared to the fun, easy-going pace of her teens. In one of the touching final scenes of the movie, Louis and Marie Antoinette eat an opulent dinner together as they have done since their first meeting and marriage. As in their first dinner there are many ridiculous rules and protocols to be observed but the difference between that first meal and this one are striking. With most of the royal court forced into exile there is no one but the servants there to observe them. Rather than an orchestra to provide them music to accompany their meal there is the unceasing angry chanting of a mob. But Marie Antoinette, looking at her husband the same way she did at their first meal together, many years ago, reaches across the table in order to hold his hand and provide him with comfort. They know the years of indolence and extravagance which made their teen years a never-ending party are over. And yet, together, they are still willing to stay at Versailles now that the party is over; to try and rule and to face the consequences of their ignorance. Coppola seems to be taking a bit of a breather between films in order to take care of her new baby but I hope she returns to the camera and soon. I'm not a huge fan of the Virgin Suicides, but her work on Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette show that she's a director with a vision and a message, and I can't wait to see what she does next.",Marie Antoinette
123,masterjk2,Vapid Versailles,1,27 November 2007,"This was, without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Boring would be a compliment. And the ""music"" if you want to call it that, really distracted from what little thought there was behind this stinker. Having music of the 20th/21st century blaring at us part of the time was jarring. Why not Buicks pulling up to cart the royals away... TV in the bathroom... Disneyland on the grounds. Utterly stupid. When a sound track is effective, I can really be entranced by it. When it's this bad, I just want to scream. The acting was for stick people. The dialogue idiotic. The fountain pools had more depth. Nice costumes and they should be. That's where there was the only sign of life. It cost $40M to make and grossed 16M... lucky to get it. Truly dreadful!",Marie Antoinette
124,teh_mode,"Every bit as shallow and superficial as its protagonist, Marie Antoinette is like a great big chocolate cake: Lacking nutrition, but oooh so gorgeous!",7,25 October 2006,"Don't just ""Let them eat cake"", let them bathe in it, with diamond bracelets all aglow, amidst a flowery bed of sumptuous 18th Century dresses and gorgeous green countryside. Perhaps this would be the message in Sofia Coppola's latest, and most ambitious, project to date, had it even the glimmer of true substance, amid the confectionery of chocolate and delightful outfits. Kirsten Dunst is Marie Antoinette, the Austrian aristocrat who is sent to France to wed the King's son Louis XVI (Schwartzman). Only fourteen, she is thrust into an all too unfamiliar technique of behaving like a royal, and living in the expectations of a nation.Whilst Coppola has not made a film devoid of emotional depth, the only true reason to enjoy this period epic is to engulf oneself into the self-indulgence of our heroine. She eats, sleeps, parties and buys her way to death, and although we are meant to believe the modern perspective of Marie Antoinette being misunderstood, and exaggerated in terms of self-consumption, the film is too superficial to effect you emotionally. Only briefly do we see Marie express herself beyond stuffing her face with poultry and champagne. But when a film looks as great as this does, are we to care that it lacks depth? Only the GCSE History students need to worry.Whilst the cast possesses competent performances from its leads, the standout acting belongs to Asia Argento, as a former French Harlot, now the royal plaything of Louis XV (Torn), and Rose Byrne, as the wine guzzling Duchesse de Polignac, socialite and friend of Marie. But even they can't compete with the film's real star  the delicious milieu. Marie Antoinette is a sumptuous delight to look at. Forget the story or the characters  the array of pale-faced aristocrats, in delightful corsets, indulging themselves with cakes, confectionery, meat and wine is done with such irresistible style that it almost makes up for the protracted running time. Marie Antoinette is not exactly food for thought, but dresses itself gorgeously enough to leave you satisfied. And it has a rock soundtrack to boot.",Marie Antoinette
125,wjfickling,I prefer the 1938 version,7,9 November 2007,"The praise lavished on this film by some critics mystifies me. There is no reason (other than enriching a studio's coffers) to do a new version of a well-known historic episode unless the new version adds something new and previously unknown. This film decidedly does not. It obviously attempts to attract a younger audience with its annoying use of rock music on the soundtrack and its inclusion of a pair of modern sneakers amid a pile of period shoes. Things like this worked for Baz Luhrmann in ""Moulin Rouge,"" but they don't work here. The 1938 film of the same name is much better, if only because the great Robert Morley is perfectly cast as Louis XVI, capturing perfectly his dunciness and overall arrested development. Here that part is woodenly played by a clueless Jason Schwartzman, looking like a young Stanley Tucci. Altogether, this film is a bore and a wasted effort. Oh well, at least I enjoyed looking at brief glimpses of Kirsten's bare butt (if it was really hers and not that of a body double).",Marie Antoinette
126,tonstant viewer,Excellent except for ONE BIG MISTAKE,8,19 February 2007,"I loved most things about this film.BUT...In the ""Making Of"" short on the DVD, we here the director praising music videos by Adam Ant, because of the stylization. Throughout this film, after endless expenditures of time and effort put in to make authenticity, we are subjected to wholly anachronistic rock music.Rock music is the music of rebellion. We love it because our parents hate it. There is nothing particularly rebellious about Marie Antoinette. Moving from the main palace into the Petit Trianon doesn't really count. She is generally dutiful and obedient, right up to her decapitation.If there are points of contact between her and today's audience, the music does not convince, it merely disrupts.Music videos are not an advance on feature films. They are incoherent, opportunistic fragments designed to sell CDs. Directors use them as audition pieces to move up to features. Music videos use the images of history as neat bits of art direction, nothing more. Why would this director choose to go backwards in finding her inspiration? Fortunately, the folks at American Zoetrope are prone to revisiting their films and re-editing them. Perhaps in a few years, Ms. Coppola will come back to this film and re-score it.",Marie Antoinette
127,marissas75,Immerses you in Marie's world,8,26 December 2006,"""Marie Antoinette"" takes you into two places the movies have never been before: the sumptuous halls of Versailles, and the thoughts and feelings of the notorious French queen. It treats its heroine with great sympathy, even her gambling parties and playacting at being a shepherdess. Marie's (Kirsten Dunst) shopping and trendsetting aren't sheer frivolities, but ways for her to distract herself from the strictures of court life and her despair that her husband, the none-too-majestic Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) shows no interest in her. The movie's centerpiece pastel-shoes-and-pastries montage, set to the song ""I Want Candy,"" comes right after she reaches her lowest depth of misery that other court ladies are having babies while she remains a virgin.There's a lot of talk about how Marie must produce children to cement a political alliance between France and Austria; other than that, the movie is quite apolitical. It doesn't concern itself with the causes of the French Revolution, and a few scenes of Louis debating whether to aid the American Revolution feel tacked-on. But interestingly, this apolitical quality makes the climactic scene of an angry peasant mob storming Versailles very effective. The shock you feel at seeing the mob is the same as Marie's shock, because the whole movie has been limited to Marie's perspective, the hermetically sealed world of the court. Some have criticized the against-type casting (e.g. Schwartzman, Rip Torn, and Molly Shannon as French royalty), but it points out the human side of these aristocratic figures, making them feel more contemporary and individualized. Every actor uses his or her natural accent, be it British, American, or French, which adds to the unpretentious feeling. Besides, the emphasis here is not on speech, but on mood and image. What little dialogue there is mostly consists of gossipy whispers, lectures to Marie about her royal duties, or casual, seemingly improvised conversations.Dunst is especially good in the early scenes, successfully playing a character much younger than her actual age. She really seems like a spontaneous, uncomplicated 15-year-old girl, which is important for the movie to be effective. This ""Marie Antoinette"" wants you to think about the natural versus the artificial: how the rigid Versailles etiquette stifles Marie's and Louis' natural instincts, how Marie's desire to immerse herself in artifice (shoes, clothes) is actually natural or understandable, why she is happiest on her faux farm, etc. Dunst's performance, which goes from sweet naiveté to stubborn frivolity to a growing maturity, matches the movie's rhythms.With its dainty pastel color scheme, rock soundtrack, female protagonist who seems like an ordinary young girl instead of a remote aristocrat, and focus on visuals and emotion rather than plot and dialogue, ""Marie Antoinette"" is not a typical historical bio-drama. Though not as affecting as the intimate ""Lost in Translation,"" it does cause you to sympathize with the young queen. Aesthetically pleasing and apolitical, it's the sort of movie that Marie Antoinette's favorite portraitist, Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, would have made if she were a filmmaker instead of a painter.",Marie Antoinette
128,MovieZoo,Marie Antoinette - pop-art pleasure for minimal measure,5,27 October 2006,"I went to this movie knowing I was going to hear some non-period music so I expected a sort of long-play music video. From the trailer, I also expected some beautiful visuals  nice color of clothing and such.You get a taste of what it must have been like by being dragged along on a slow ride in a carriage. Look out the window, get some sleep, play a game, look out the window, get some sleep. Wow, that was interesting. Great if you want to be reminded that not every generation had fast cars, planes or trains. Who would have guessed? OK, enough of the sarcasm. You will need to be ready for a slow pace. Enjoy the nuances in color, music and clothing. Accept this movie for what it is, pop-art. It is not much more than that and, unfortunately, not great pop-art.I feel there has to be strength in relationships. Normally I would think Coppola would want the same since she did such a great job of it in Lost In Translation. I think the difference between the two movies is, it was easy to relate to someone in LIT but MA was lacking in that area. I could not relate to anyone. Matter of fact, I didn't want to relate to anyone.Don't worry about history beyond grade-school levels, it doesn't matter. I think if Coppola wanted to stick to a history lesson, she would have been making a movie that does not fit her style. So, I am proud of her for sticking to her own style, but she really needed to give us more than a stylized, long-playing music video. Marie may have truly been a very interesting person, but it was not finalized in the movie. She looked interesting, she began to get more interesting, but like her husband, I lost interest.I hate to say this was not worth the money, because it really started off with some very appealing ideas, but before it was all over for Marie, it was all over for the movie-goer. It definitely is NOT over for Kirsten Dunst. She is a beautiful actress and pulls off playing a 15 year old beautifully as well as a 30+ mother. But not even Kirsten can save Marie.",Marie Antoinette
129,stumpmee77,Coppola's History Epic Crappola.,1,8 September 2008,"How about SOME historical accuracy, dearie? If this film had been limited to those portions possessing Marie Antoinette's character & events in her life, the repetitive sequences reduce to 2 occurrences, its time length would be 45 minutes max. At the length and the material Coppola bestows, it would be tragic showing this to students saying it provides a better understanding of the French Revolution. Heck no it doesn't! What was she & the scriptwriters of this rubbish thinking??? Sofia's warping history is inexcusable as all she had to do was access the Internet or open a book about her subject for longer than a second.The largest chunk of historical accuracy takes place prior to her meeting her husband. Beyond thatOther than those time-gulping levees, more significant events in her life & aspects of her character crops up here & there, more often than not their durations so fleeting, this French Revolution aficionado was outraged. Just ONE scene she's mocking older peopleDauphine & Queen, she antagonized Versallies' old guard with this behavior. A brief scene she attends a masked ball. Instead after the soon grating levee, I'm treated to overly long sequences of gambling, shopping, gulping down pastries--& where did Coppola learn Marie Antoinette ate that much food & Poligiac (sp) snorted coke? Perhaps the coke snorter was Lamballe; really couldn't distinguish one from the other. All this divinely packaged fluff Sofia throws in is at the expense of the feather-brained, tragic queen's true story. Having primary filming done at the real Versallies does not an authentic Marie Antoinette film make. The Dauphine vs. Du Barry portion arrives suddenly & in the wrong portion of her time-lineIt's one of Marie Antoinette's first slip-ups after marrying Louis. Lambelle & Poligac (sp) are cameos. There's a scene lasting two minute tops mentioning those pamphlets running down her reputation--The fluff over those scandal stirring hand-outs that were a major contributor in pulling down the monarchy. There's 2 long scenes of Louis discussing the American Revolution with advisers but its never emphasized the cost the Monarchy paid for offering aid to the Americans. 4 me, this 2006 version's worst deviation IS Louis XVICould NOT get past the manner Coppola packages him. Throughout the film there's no powdered wig, remains tanned & relatively club med trimWhat in the name of God??? There's not the slightest effort taken to align his appearance with 18th century paintings or coins. The bulky actor playing Fersen or the one playing her brother given make up to appear youthful would make slightly better choices.Kirsten Dunst in the title role is goodbut enjoying her acting is sidelined by the gross historical inaccuracies and even grosser soundtrack. Only modern song I liked is ""I Love Candy."" Modern Marie Antoinette's soundtrack puts me in mind of a Knight's Tale. BTW, Knight's Tale appeals to me now as that's obviously a satire.Compared 1938's Shearer vehicle, 2006's tackling the Diamond necklace affair is horrendously minuscule. The earlier film's changing of Rohan from a priest reflects how priests were held in higher regard in the 1930sbut it's also the major change the earlier movie makes in detailing that turning point in Marie Antoinette' fortunes. New film, hm, recall 3 short scenes but don't recall the lines uttered by anyone in their being lackluster. From what is publicly known of her relations with Fersen, Marie Antoinette 2006's treatment was nothing less than jaw-dropping improbable. She would not risk everything sleeping with the man as debates would arise over the legitimacy of her children. A great mother, Marie Antoinette would not endure seeing her children harmed.The approaching revolution, like the Du Barry incident, is treated with little substance. The disgruntled peasants at last show up to storm Versallies. Where were the poor heretofore in this junk? But for all the inaccurate Louis, the protracted levee, the lavishness trappings is that incomplete,silly ending! Okay Sofia, you don't want to go into Marie's sufferings but... There should have been an epilogue prior to the credits detailing what happened to her. And some one tell me why else Sofia stopped the movie where she did other than running over movie's budget due to paying rent to film in Versailles, clothes, cake",Marie Antoinette
130,georgioskarpouzas,poor rich girl,7,19 March 2007,"I have just watched this movie on DVD because it has not opened in my native Greece. The most astounding thing was that the DVD did not contain French even as a subtitle language!-it was not a pirated version, it was a very respectable legal commercial version. That a movie could be made about the French Queen without the French language- except very few words spoken by the servants- is remarkable and surely the sign of a cultural change of major proportions. As for the movie it is based on Antonia Frazer's biography and therefore is a sympathetic version to the Queen. It overstretches her innocence and lack of knowledge of French court protocol, as if the Hapsburg court was a place that people acted as spontaneously as in a discotheque. The stress on her gambling proclivity is historically attested as well as the libellous accussations that the gutter press invented against her and her entourage. The motherly figure of Marie-Therese is well presented while Louis 15 is presented as lecherous, who he was, while the portrayal of his mistress Madame Du Barry stresses too much her vulgarity and presents her as a prostitute while she was from solid bourgeois background as the former and more famous mistress of the same king, Madame Pompadour.The clichés abound, as the queen as Sheperdess. I found the scenes while she walks alone in the stairs of the gardens of Versailles very impressive visually. The politics of the movie stresses court diplomacy and ignores popular movement. The people are non-existent in this movie except in very minor and negative portrayals. I think this is in line with the book where the leading personalities are stretched and the historical role of the Parisian people is downplayed. It is a very conservative film truly. Nevertheless I generally liked it because of the very fine evocation of the costumes and scenery of the world of the super-privileged of the 18th century. I wonder if todays privileged will find role-models in this movie. I even had a moment of empathy when the Queen and her entourage where playing this game when one has a name of a person, animal etc on his forehead and through questions to the rest tries to discover it- I have played this game with friends of mine in the past- therefore I have something in common with the late French Queen! I am not deeply aware of the criticism the movie received in general although I am aware it was not very well received. It is not bad and surely it is more accurate as history compared to the 300 for example.",Marie Antoinette

I think this film deserves 5.5 star.At the beginning it seems that this is going to be an interesting movie, but as the minutes pass it diminish a lot. Kirsten Dunst is OK as Marie Antoinette, well in general the performances are good. The movie looks great it seems like we are seeing real people of that era. what I didn't like was that the character of Louis XVI was played like a caricature. I think it would have been much better if it would have lasted just 100 minutes instead of 123, because it has many boring moments and its pace is too slow. I would have liked to see more of the characters of Comtesse du Barry. and Comtesse de Noailles which I found interesting and funny. In this film we see Marie Antoinette since her arrival to France to marry Louis XVI, her life like the queen of France until her exit from palace with her family because of the french revolution.This movie is recommended only for women.

132,Shaolin_Apu,Bringing on some rock'n roll into Versailles,8,16 November 2006,"In addition to Kirsten Dunst you get an awesome spectacle of 18th century luxury. Coppola really tries everything to kill boredom that is often found laying for ambush in movies with full of pomp. Thanks a lot to Kirsten Dunst the film also manages to avoid that most usual boredom sins this type of movies tend to be all too prone of.Adding modern songs to a film that is entirely about history might give a wrong impression for some unprepared viewers, but at least it helps you to remember that this is not going to be an ordinary experience. The modern rock music might be in this context even rebellious choice even if it seems that rock has only found an extant convention it has not rebelled against yet. Coppola has found also for Kirsten some historical curiosities that the Austrian Princess is allowed to joke a bit about. It is possible that Coppola embellishes Marie Antoinette too much, but a good decision anyway is the choice to debunk the famous 'cake' myth.Coppola has directed a piece that will keep young people at theaters, thanks to Kirsten's beauty and his seductive smile that suits perfectly for an controversial character like Marie Antoinette. Knowing about history makes the film somewhat easier to watch as it helps you to figure out the necessary event frame. Some French is also added into dialogue but you anyway can't escape the fact that in Hollywood spectacles the only allowed language will always be English.",Marie Antoinette

The theater was almost empty--what does that say. The first clue that this was a rotten drag was when we first see Marie (Dunst) as a girl supposed to be 15--and 15, she does not look. So ridiculous was her entrance with highlights in her blond hair---mind you, highlights...now did they have highlights back then. I was not too keen on the casting and what was most incredibly and so extremely disturbing was the rock music--rock music in a seemingly period piece. You, the viewer, the audience, get only a fraction of the character that was Marie Antoinette. We do witness some maturity and growth, but then, slam, slap--the movie ends. I was stunned as were the few, very few, sitting with me in the rather empty theater.

There are costumes - and shoes, oh, yes, shoes! - so sumptuous you may pass out. There are some very fine actors involved, and there is excellent art direction. But there is, sadly, no movie. No movie at all. What there is, is a solid 90 minutes of waiting to see if MA's marriage gets consummated, and even this is a tiresome, completely not erotic affair. That's about it. Oh - Dunst really does play the role like a Valley girl, all the way, which I hear was meant to 'modernize' the subject for young audiences. It's an adolescent contrivance in a pointless film, and what burns me up the most is this kind of budget spent on a laughably inept script, in the hands of a director better suited to MTV.

136,vitachiel,Forgettable,4,1 December 2008,"Decadent and shallow portrait of a decadent and shallow life(style). Almost no depth is provided here. This movie presents a show of all the pleasantries and luscious food and elaborated dresses of the French court during Marie Antoinette's time, which is all right but not all the way through without any background study or character delving. Although Dunst is good in her role, she doesn't have anything solid to work with. It is impossible to portray someone as a self-indulgent nitwit, a caring wife/mother, a lonely woman and a rebel queen all at the same time during the time span of a regular movie, so at the end we are left with a feeling of confusion and emptiness and we still don't know anything of our heroine.Another big flaw is the cast. The French court is made up of British, American, and some English-with-a-French-accent-speaking people, which is rather confusing. Also quite awkward listening to a high-placed French court official who speaks about the need to stay friends with the Americans while he himself is speaking with an innate American tongue.Focussing is very important, especially when you have to look at something with a wide range of perspectives. This movie tries to do it all and so it fails.One word of praise: Bow Wow Wow, best music choice ever!",Marie Antoinette
137,sinncross,Dim lust...,6,22 March 2007,"History has created many faces that will forever ordain the fabrics of time, be them famous or infamous. Such figures are popular themes for biographic movies, and while these figures were famed, their film portrayals do not always do them justice.Most people, regardless of whether they took History as a subject or not, know from the beginning some information on Marie Antoinette and her eventual downfall with the French revolution: Marie (Kirsten Dunst), Austrian born, leaves her country of birth to marry the prince of France; she would eventually become queen when the prince was crowned King Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). Marie was known as a queen who lived an exuberant life and was labeled as being insensitive towards the people of France.While a biography of sorts, Marie Antoinette is flawed with some historic inaccuracy, but for those who know little about Marie, or have forgotten, these inaccuracies will come as merely grains of dust which can be brushed away. As a whole, the film is effective with its storytelling, but there are certain issues that hinder the process.While setting off with a good start, Marie Antoinette continues in rather slow and mundane fashion. There is a certain mellowness in the atmosphere that never ever picks up pace, even when Marie begins living life to it's fullest; this is especially a problem when the slow pacing can be seen as metaphoric of Marie's lackluster life.On the acting side, we are presented with genuinely decent acting. None of the characters portray their respective characters poorly, granted some actresses need only be fickle with their character, and this proves a strong point of the film. The various actors and actresses do not bring about award winning performances but what they do bring forth, is a sense of ease.The film itself is a feast for the eyes. Sofia Coppola does an amazing job with her cinematography which not only helps us identify with the characters but also highlights the grandeur of the costume design and the royal splendidness of French architecture. However there is a stint in the movie which seems out of place in terms of camera facilitation, and it is very noticeable. Luckily Coppola finishes the film on a very artistic note, and it is easily one of the best scenes in the entirety of the film.Another very striking aspect of the movie is the inclusion of contemporary music. While there are the usual classical melodies associated with historically based films, the modernised tunes are wonderfully added to create new life within the context of the story. With this, one is able to relate various events within the story to modern day society, and this becomes a strong talking point of the film. However, the popular music becomes unnecessarily used in some scenes and ultimately a strength of the film, becomes its weakness.Rarely scattered throughout the film are various clippings of Marie being dressed and, while not fully visible, breast nudity can be seen. The film also plays on the low key love life Marie has with Louis and her eventual falling into an affair.Marie Antoinette is a lovely film to gaze upon with the costume design and the imagery of the majestic buildings of aristocrat France. Even the acting is good, but tit all falls apart throughout the course of this somewhat historically incorrect film. The slow pacing is nagging and the overuse of modern music makes Marie Antoinette more a bother then a style.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---",Marie Antoinette

The acting is wooden and it seems uniformly so and it appears likely to have been the intention of the director. The whole effect is a bit nightmarish (eyes wide something or other?) but whatever was intended,what one should do is get the Norma Shearer version (not perfect history but a fine film) and say 10 times -- nepotism is a bad idea in film-making just as it tends to be everywhere else.",Marie Antoinette
139,pefrss,Lost it,1,31 January 2013,"When this movie was in the theaters I did not see it. The reviews I read were too bad to spend several dollars on it. And that was a difficult decision for me because I like historical films and I liked ""Lost in Translation"" very much. Recently I fished the movie out of a bargain bin for one dollar and watched it at home. Well, I tried to watch it. After the second levee I switched to the special features and watched Father Coppola tell us that he advised his daughter to treat this film like a big Marie Antoinette party where everybody is invited to show up in costumes. That may explain some of it. But I do not like to watch parties. Especially one where everybody but me is high on marijuana and is completely self-absorbed and I am left out. I suffered through some parties in Hollywood which were exactly like this.Obviously Sophia Coppola, the costume designer and the pastry chef went gaga and spent most of the forty million production costs on costumes and cakes. So there was no money left for script, acting, actors, music or anything which usually makes a movie. And as the one who watches the movie they did not let me eat cake nor wear costumes. I also read that this movie was planned before ""Lost in Translation"" was made and only because Sophia had difficulties figuring it out, she wrote and made Lost in Translation first. I really hope that Lost in Translation was not a one hit wonder. It seems nearly unconceivable that this director can turn out such a sensitive movie like Lost in Translation and then directs a complete and utterly piece of fluff like this one.Only because of all her connections in Hollywood she got an Oscar for costumes, because otherwise there is no justification for it, there must be a movie attached to the costumes, there wasn't. And what about that Jewish Dauphin?, only reading through the comments here I learned that she is related to him. If I would not have seen Lost in Translation I would have dismissed the whole thing as daddy bought his daughter a forty million toy. Now I wait and see what she will do next.",Marie Antoinette
140,arturmachado-29588,Long modern pop music video with XVIII century imagery,3,25 August 2017,"Biographical drama written and directed by Sofia Coppola. Unfortunately this film teaches nothing and what we have here is nothing more than a farce and an insult to Marie Antoinette. With all the social circumstances of the time that shaped the world, we see none of that nor the public consequences of the queen's behavior, just a teenager always living in whoopee boredom and luxury of Versailles, accomplished in such a way that nothing happens, although admittedly the colorful extravagant scenarios and costumes are the only redeeming factor in this long modern pop music video with images of the XVIII century. Sofia Coppola has to be the worst filmmaker/writer ever: even Ed Wood could do better.",Marie Antoinette
141,muons,A better storytelling is still in the waiting,4,30 April 2018,"This movie seems about setting the records straight for one of the most misunderstood historical characters. It starts well with Antoinette's girlhood and her introduction to the French court as the Austrian bride. But then it drags on about her vanities, bitter marriage, her addiction to gambling and lavish lifestyle by completely missing the point that she lived at a time which makes up one of the most interesting historical turning points of the mankind. Only at the end of the movie, the revolution is depicted with an angry mob carrying pitchforks and sickles in a perfunctory manner. Indeed, her last years in the dungeon after her arrest are completely ignored, which could be a much more interesting subject than her superfluously narrated court life.Add to that, the pop soundtrack in the first half sounds too cheesy and turns a potentially historical gem into a chick-flick. The only positive side is the superb acting by Kirsten Dunst, who almost single-handedly saves the movie from a complete train wreck. Ironically, this also emphasizes the fact that she was alone in the leading role with a very obscure portrayal of her husband.",Marie Antoinette
142,DJRMewzique,Yet another example as to why Sofia should never direct again.,1,4 March 2007,"In preparation for the Academy Awards, I made a list of all the nominated films I had not yet seen in order of importance and availability. As Marie-Antoinette was only nominated in one category, for Best Costume Design, it was low on the list, but, unfortunately, I had time to get it.122 minutes of my life I will never get back again.This has got to be one of the most useless films I have seen in a very long time. I mean, it has no historical value, no educative value, the acting is terrible, the dialogue was absolutely horrifying How Coppola even got this film made is beyond me, as the film company and producers should be completely embarrassed this actually made it onto celluloid.Kirsten Dunst, generally a pretty good actress, plays the title character with such blandness and without showing even a glimpse of her acting ability. Paris Hilton could have played the part. At least it might have been funny. I mean, the woman was Austrian and played by Dunst with no accent? Coppola did this on purpose, but that trick worked brilliantly in a grandiose film like Amadeus. Here, it just came across as ridiculous. Jason Schwartzman rendered the character of Louis XIV insignificant. There is not a trace of why this film was made to be found. What was the purpose of showing scene after scene of Marie dressing and undressing and not getting her husband to have sex with her for ages? The film doesn't even get to the infamous beheading of the French queen. In short, it taught me nothing beyond what a bad filmmaker Coppola is.Granted, the music in the film is exceptional and the costumes were absolutely extraordinary.it did go on to win the Oscar it was nominated for. However, the fact this film is now related to the Academy Awards in any respect is a complete joke. Coppola should go back to just being her father's daughter and avoid ever making anyone go through such an excruciating experience as watching this completely useless mess was.",Marie Antoinette
143,joncha,Falls short in many ways,5,12 October 2018,"This was a colorful, opulent depiction of the court of Louis XV and Louis XVI and helps to answer the question ""Who was Marie Antionette?"" However, it falls short in revealing much about the woman beyond the superficial, which may have in fact been the essence of her personality. The film also fails to depict any indication of the unrest that led to the Revolution, so if one was totally ignorant of historical facts it might seem like the plot had a lot of holes and left many questions unanswered. The use of modern music instead of 18th century music did nothing to enhance the quality of the story.",Marie Antoinette
144,Ryu_Darkwood,Sex and the city....renaissance style!,9,24 December 2007,"Marie Antoinette was doomed to go into history as a shallow little goat, that had to pay the price for being dumb and ignorant. This movie gives us another perspective. We see a self-aware girl - being restricted by inhumane expectations from her family - that is using her own sexuality to give way to some personal freedoms. By making her into the post-sex and the city heroine from our time, Coppola made this historical figure into a lively and identifiable woman. One that most women can relate to. At the end we see how she is matured enough to make a choice that'd cost her her life, but made her into a respectable person, and certainly not into the goat we all read in our history books she was.This movie looks visually stunning with the beautiful images of Versailles. Kirsten Dunst is a terrific Marie Antoinette, as the natural looking but still very beautiful actress she is. I adored the scenes in which we see how a naked Dunst is surrounded by gossiping maids, showing how vulnerable this woman was to her environment.",Marie Antoinette

It works best when approached as a sumptuous, very long music video. The editors do a fabulous job of saturating the eyes with gorgeous colors and shapes while mixing an almost unbroken soundtrack of '80s Goth and New Wave hits along with opera and incidental music. The successful mixing of these elements is the only saving grace of this otherwise historically inaccurate and ultimately dull film.While the insane pressure of ""getting an heir"" is adequately explored, the rest of Marie Antoinette's life is left relatively untouched. We get glimpses of set pieces in her country house or on the stage, but none of it is put into any context. By film's end, anyone without an intimate history of her tragic end will be left relatively cold.Buy the soundtrack. Skip the film.",Marie Antoinette
146,sdave7596,This film is what it is....,6,14 July 2010,"I just happened to catch this version of ""Marie Antointette,"" made in 2006, on the Sundance Channel one evening. Being a fan of Sofia Coppola (""Virgin Suicides"" ""Lost in Translation"") I got engrossed in it. Kirsten Dunst plays the ill-fated queen, and she seems to look the part both in age and femininity. The period costumes are great, and Dunst wears them well, along with the occasional outrageous hairstyles. That is about as far as it goes: Dunst's performance is completely lacking in any substance, and I did not believe I was viewing a queen from another century, just a modern-day actress playing make believe. Everyone knows the basic story: teen-ager Marie marries Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman, an odd casting choice). Louis seems to have little interest in Marie sexually -- today we would likely say he is gay, but probably at that time he was just considered socially awkward, although he does seem to cavort with a lot of pretty male friends. Anyway, they do eventually manage to have kids. Marie seems to find an outlet from her somewhat cold and distant husband in an odd assortment of friends, all as materialistic as she. She also has an affair, etc. In looking at this film, the obvious comparison to the 1938 version of ""Marie Antoinette"" with Norma Shearer and Robert Morley has to be made. While certainly the older film is superior in many ways -- although one has to consider its historical accuracy not 100%, but better than this one. And while Shearer was certainly a superior actress to Dunst, she was also way too old for the part. The original film also dragged out the imprisonment and death of Marie Antointette way too long; this one just shows Marie -- who sticks by her husband all the way through the overthrow -- riding off to face certain death. Mercifully, we are spared the gory details. This film is what it is: a showpiece for great costumes, breath-taking scenery, and a soundtrack that is clearly aimed at the under-30 crowd. I liked it, but I didn't take it seriously.",Marie Antoinette
147,tonyhic,Astoundingly Uneventful,3,31 October 2008,"This comment can't contain any spoilers because there's nothing to spoil in the entire movie. What happens? An Austrian girl goes to France, gets married, has a couple of kids, dances, sleeps, wakes up, gets dressed, eats, drinks, giggles a bit.It seems that Coppola has deliberately gone out of her way to take something as fascinating and monumental as the French Revolution and make it as dull and insignificant as possible.On the plus side, the scenery and costumes were pretty. I also liked the music. Therefore, I'll allocate one star for the visual impact of the lovely frocks and palaces, and two stars for the quirky pop music. To that I'll add absolutely nothing for the plot. I'm not bloodthirsty, but in a film set during the revolution, I want to see at least a couple of angry peasants and a few of the nobility getting what they deserve. It was very disappointing.",Marie Antoinette
148,shhimundercoverdamnit,Marie Antoinette (2006),6,11 February 2008,"A hugely visually breathtaking movie. Everything from its costume to its locations: the film is absolutely brilliant. However, that is pretty much all this film has going for it. As a whole film, the lack of any specific plot and specifically a conclusion is incredibly bothering. It is also, way too long. One thing the film will make you do is eat. It is filed with tons of champaigne and food.Reteaming with Kirsten Dunst, the star of her moody debut feature ?The Virgin Suicides,? Sofia Coppola depicts Marie?s struggles in the early years and the events leading to her downfall.However, this is also part of the film's problem. Dunst's delivery of her lines is quite, annoying to say the least. In contrast, I felt that Jason Schwartzman actually delivered a pretty decent performance as Louis XVI: a very shy and awkward person. Dunst's performance also seemed to be stuck in some kind of drug induced coma, as well.In fact, much of the cast seems this way. Some of them even sound bored and are just not interesting at all. Others like Rip Torn are in some ways actors in their own film, acting in their own way. Poor Steve Coogan vanishes for scenes as a time. I really can't blame them when the supposed lead actor's performance just isn't up to par. Of course there are a few notable performances in the film. For instance, Rose Byrne is simply brilliant as the incredibly naughty, yet adorable Duchesse de Polignac. In just one simple scene, Byrne manages to somehow add some spark to a film badly in need of one. She also manages to steal the entire film and when I saw the film in the theatres her lines got the most laughs.",Marie Antoinette

But like a little pink bunny, it keeps going on and on and on. I kept expecting Marie to shake things up. At one point she kind of does by clapping at an opera when you are not supposed to. Everyone does to. OK Change. I kept waiting and waiting. Yet nothing more happens. I'm sure it was realistic, but come on. You don't make movies about boring people! Don't make a movie about me unless you plan to dramatize the hell out of it. Then when you've sat and watched and watched and watched these rich snooty people go on and on you think ""OK the payoff is the revolution. We get to see these heads roll"". Sorry Charilie.

152,pookey56,she looks like a child....,9,14 November 2006,"i've had several weeks to reflect on this film, and it has left a very good taste in my mouth. I was surprised by Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of the doomed queen, yet really another victim of isolation and privilege. I believe it is the most well rounded performance of her career, and i loved her in this role. my thought is that Quentin Tarantino has had some influence with Sophia Coppola's already impressive resume of films. Marie Antoinette has a lyrical, whimsical ambiance, with beautiful cinematography and great costumes and dress. Jason Schwartzman's Louis XVI was great; and i watched for the marvelous Marianne Faithful too, but i found her unrecognizable and under- used. Judy Davis is ALWAYS good and i make a point of seeing her films. I appreciated that there was no big build up to the fate of the last king and queen of France, a departure from the other films about them. i was unlucky to be sitting in front of people loudly proclaiming that they had no idea about what happened to her, nor anything about French and global politics at the time. Their assessment of the film was, that it was too slow. It wasn't for me. I wanted more. I can understand some of the criticisms aimed at this film but i truly enjoyed it. Marie-Antoinette reminded me of other doomed queens, such as Queen Jane, who were women, and children both. Ms Coppola skips the reign of terror, the mass be-headings, and the desperation of the times, and opts for a film filled with naivety and isolation, lack of choice and family. i liked this approach, and i'd watch the film again. a beautiful, under-rated film which somehow manages to blend a sense of fun and innocence leading towards the gruesome result which history records. (schwartzman bears an uncanny resemblance to the portraits of the ill-fated Louis..) Special kudos to the costume team as well, who captured 1700's France with immaculate detail.",Marie Antoinette
153,middleburg,"Visually stunning, surprisingly touching, and Cool with a capital C!",10,15 March 2007,"This movie is the very essence of cool. Who in the world could make a two hour film that captures the incredible historical complexities of the French Revolution and the political intrigues of the court of Louis XVI? The reason that ""The Queen"" works so well is that it focuses on that one week in the life of modern day Britain and the court of Elizabeth II. Truths are stated, complexities described, and the audience gets a real insight into the historical times and the personal stories being told. Try to portray years and years of British history, and the subject would be unwieldy and issues skirted over. Sophia Coppola goes for it, describing years and years in the life of an even more complex time. But she doesn't just do a historical survey. Leave that for the detailed books and college courses. For that is what it takes to come to terms with one of the greatest upheavals in history. Instead, she gives us an Impressionistic fable (worthy of being hung in the Louvre). Visually this is one of the most stunning films I have ever seen. I have visited Versailles twice. It was spectacular and beautiful - but this is probably the first time in my experience where a movie is just as good (maybe even better!) than the real thing! Somehow it is MUCH more fun seeing Versailles with the people in their period costumes rather than with hundreds and hundreds of tourists. I predict that Sophia Coppola is going to become one of the great, even legendary film makers. She takes audacious risks. And she takes them successfully! I've seen the movie now twice. The first time, the juxtaposition of modern dialog and expressions with the 18th century milieu, and the modern music with the late Baroque/Classical was jarring. But before I knew it I was totally seduced by the wildness of these juxtapositions. The moment when I became absolutely knocked out by this film, was Marie Antoinette's first walk through the palace, with the endless bowing, and the children with their bouquet's looking like miniature Marie Antoinettes, and that vaguely Oriental music playing in the background. This was an exotic world - fascinating, dreamlike, and seductive.The result of all this craziness and wildness is a movie which is simply unforgettable. I find myself thinking back on those scenes - and I want to revisit this great Impressionistic canvas of a movie. Hedonistic - of course. But Versailles, in all its hedonism lives on, and will always live on. The movie could have become simply a guilty pleasure, or just a cool, hip statement - but it actually goes beyond that - it actually becomes touching, as we feel the ultimate pain of those baffled royals much in the way we were all sorry for the poor rich princess in ""Roman Holiday"", or our own poor rich princess Diana. Total thanks for these surprisingly strong feelings comes from an extraordinary performance by Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette. There isn't a frame of the movie that she appears in, in which her facial expressions don't speak volumes and volumes - expressions of joy, innocence, wisdom, callousness, and ultimately humanity.I give this movie a 10. Some will say the film is quirky, but I also predict that it will live on as one of the most fascinating films of recent years.",Marie Antoinette
154,Denno1972,A brave retelling of the Marie Antoinette story,7,21 December 2020,"This is a brave retelling of the Marie Antoinette story, complete with American accents and an 80s soundtrack. The look of this movie is astounding. Wonderful scenery, cinematography and amazing costumes. It starts very well, detailing the absurdity of life in the palace with a deft touch and a great deal of satire. It then develops and we get a sense of tragedy on the young queen and you really feel for the predicament this young person has been put into. So far so good, however for me he movie takes a downturn in the second half. The fast paced but empty telling of the queens descent into partying and adultery is well told but far too long and repetitive. Overall it's an effective, mostly successful and certainly different telling of this story. Oh, and the score is beautiful but the 80s music? It didn't work for me and I found it distracting.",Marie Antoinette
155,DLewis,Removing a Story from its Historic Context Only Partly Successful,4,21 November 2012,"Yesterday, saw Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" which is an 'old' picture already to many, but not to me -- I've never seen it. I didn't think Kirsten Dunst was bad; didn't think she was great either, but at least she looked the part. If you go back to the many portraits of Madame défécit, Dunst's appearance was more or less dead on. I thought Jason Schwartzman's Louis XVI was a little too good-looking, and I don't think either of them really captured the pair as ""flesh and blood"" characters, but Dunst at least tried; I'll give her that. About the film as a film, I liked the ambition of it, and found the set dressing and costume very fine, with plenty of accuracy and attention to detail. Wish I could say the same about the music. The choices of period music were good, and I am glad that the living musicians involved were paid for this project; I like all of that stuff, and it appears Sofia Coppola and I share the same tastes in pop music generally. But folks in the 18th century simply did not rock out to The Cure or Siouxsie and the Banshees. I see reviews where people ""I'm so glad that they didn't use the usual boring classical music"" and I wonder ""What's wrong with you?"" but I guess that's what happens when you take music appreciation out of elementary school education. Period music simply isn't a disposable element in this story that you can replace with music that you think follows the action better, unless that music is of a neutral character. I think Coppola, however, may have found some common ground between the way the 18th century nobility behaved and the conduct of well-heeled Hollywood types, which may have been an initial attraction to this story. Certainly she was not interested in following the fate of Marie Antoinette and her family, despite its intensely dramatic appeal, touching on it only briefly. In drawing this parallel, she assumes that the landed gentry of that time employed similar kind of amorality to the folks living high on the hog in the Hollywood hills and Malibu. This is not so; morality itself had everything to do with this Catholic King and Queen, including their marriage. As this isn't touched upon at all, what remains is only empty ceremony in regard to that.Taking on an expensive project, and making something that falls short of the mark owing to conceptual deficiencies, establishes that Sofia Coppola's apple hasn't fallen far from the tree. But that's a good, strong tree; one might wonder what Coppola could do with the same budget and a more modest project where there aren't so many balls to keep up in the air.",Marie Antoinette
156,ian1000,Looks wonderful but looks are skin deep,5,15 November 2007,"As a fan of historic films I looked forward to this re-telling of a well known story. I hoped that I would not be disappointed by glaring historical errors and having just re-watched ""The Madness Of King George"" hoped that Coppola's film would be as engrossing and well executed.Well, the film looked awesome. The sets, costumes, and camera-work are a credit to all concerned.The main problems with the movie are a lack of depth. The story of the tragic Austrian is invariably connected to the famous revolution which caused her death (we don't see that, either) yet we witness little of the revolution save for an angry mob at the palace bearing torches.The other main problem is that Dunst simply cannot carry the role. She delivered her lines with all the dignity of a cheerleader or burger bar waitress.When watching the movie I thought of the Doctor Who episode (set earlier in the eighteenth century) and how a British actress such as Sophia Myles would have been so much more suited to the part.Overall, quite enjoyable but could have been so much more.As entertaining as the film is a trawl through the IMDb comments - the ""plants"" are a more blatant than usual.",Marie Antoinette
157,jkbonner1,Marie Antoinettenot an airhead but not insightful either,7,9 November 2006,"Marie Antoinette was fifteen when she married Louis Auguste, dauphin of France. At the death of Louis XV (1774) she became Queen of all France at the age of nineteen. She has generally borne a bad rep, mostly undeserved. Supposedly when told that the Paris mob demanded bread, she is said to have replied nonchalantly ""Let them eat cake."" The movie makes the point, which is assuredly accurate, that this story was a complete fabrication by one of Marie Antoinette's many enemies. As a foreigner and of Austrian birth (a traditional enemy of France), it is well known that she was often a convenient scapegoat for the discontent and restlessness of the French people, particularly as the political situation preceding the revolution deteriorated.The film accurately depicts the intricate and rigid court protocol surrounding Louis' and Marie Antoinette's daily rituals, beginning when they awoke and unceasing throughout the day until they went to bed. It also delves into the glitter and intrigues of the court of Versailles and the wasted lives of the courtiers. One inaccuracy: the film implies that Louis suffered from premature ejaculation, thus preventing him from producing a child with Marie Antoinette. It seems more likely that he suffered from phimosis, a condition that can afflict an uncircumcised male, making an erection very painful. Although not known for certain, apparently this was the case. Once an operation was performed to correct the condition, Louis performed fine. It might be pointed out that unlike his great-grandfather, Louis XIV, and his grandfather, Louis XV, Louis XVI was a loving husband and father and had no mistresses.We are often told that as humans we can create our own history. This is only partly true. Many individuals often find themselves overwhelmed by events not of their own choosing that are totally beyond their control, thus negating the idea that we create our own history. We can however choose how to behave even when events are overpowering. Both Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were loving parents who were swept up by the vagaries of history and destroyed by processes and events beyond their control. Unfortunately the film stops short of showing us Louis' and Marie Antoinette's final days and their courage in facing the Paris mob and their untimely deaths by the guillotine. All we are allowed to experience in the film is the vague premonition by Marie Antoinette that yielding to the demands of the Paris mob to leave Versailles and take up residence in the Tuileries in Paris sealed their fate.Ultimately Marie Antoinette was a victim of history. Only one of her four children (all by Louis XVI) survived into the nineteenth century. Although not an unfeeling monster as she has often been depicted, she wasn't especially prescient either regarding what was happening in France at the time. A much more interesting movie might have focused on someone more insightful of the events that were unfolding.",Marie Antoinette
158,IRateFilms,A French Story for Americans,6,23 October 2006,"Marie Antoinette,was nominated this year for a Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. In all reality, this was a ridiculous and laughable attempt at ""Americanizing"" the French aristocracy. Starring the crisp Kirsten Dunst, and questionably casted Jason Schwartzman, Marie Antoinette portrays aristocracy and the french revolution as somewhat of a hip music video. Fortunately, Sofia Coppola lends very competent directing, by creating fascinating cinematography to save the film from total disillusionment. Lack of accents diminishes the painstaking role of authenticity, not withstanding the casting of Texas drawled Rip Torn as King Louis XV. Just think, I actually waited in line four hours to view this film at this year's Cannes Film Festival, to be disappointed. How disconcerting is that?? Coppola does manage to evoke the feeling of the 18th century way of life for royalty in Versailles. Living in huge palaces with gilded furniture, being waited on hand and foot, and never really worrying about anything was life in Versailles. Gossip, gambling, drinking and coke were also some of the other, more sinful indulgent pleasures the people of Versailles used to escape their miserable lives. Being married to the young Louis XV, Marie Antoinette is a fourteen year old virgin, pushed into this marriage to better the Franco-Austrian relations at the time. Coppola does invigorate the sense of loneliness and alienation Antoinette endured during her stay in France, due to both her naiveness and the fact that she was Austrian. Becoming the queen of France only 5 years later, Marie Antoinette drives herself further away, as she begins to cater deeper to the royal French treatment, it took so long to become accustomed to in the first place.Lavished with beautiful set design, exuberant costumes and exotic pastries this failure as a film will be sure to gather up Oscars in those categories, bereft of any other substance. I do have to admit that had Coppola taken herself less seriously in this attempt, the film would have been more enjoyable. Baz Lurman knew what he was doing in his modern rendition of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, never taking himself too seriously. Maybe Papa Bear Francis Ford never had that DVD lying around the shelves at home. Those looking for an accurate historical depiction of Marie Antoinette look elsewhere, but those looking for an evening of eye candy and Strokes music blaring as Kirsten Dunst dances in a field of lilies, look nowhere else.",Marie Antoinette

If I watch a movie based on a historical event, I want to see the key points of the story unfolded.

Sets! It just doesn't get any better than the costumes and sets on this new Marie Antoinette movie. Hair styles were wonderful. Much of the movie appears to be filmed at Versailles and the gardens.The bad: (2006) Poor casting. I was disappointed to see Louis XVI with a five o'clock shadow at the age of 15. Both Marie and Louis did not portray the parts of a 14 and 15 year old very well. They both looked much to old. Parts of the movie were to drawn out and let my mind wonder away from the film.I anticipated not liking the music score in this new movie but was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked it and that it did not take anything away from the film.After watching both the old and the new Marie Antoinette, I prefer the older version much more, although the story line is almost identical.

Thanks to the brilliant and underrated interpretation of Kirsten Dunst, I lived over again the anxiety, the frustration, the hope, the unbridled fun, the resignation, the dreamed and denied love for an handsome Swedishman.

162,thomasgulch,worst soundtrack in modern history,1,25 February 2007,"Strong visuals, good acting luscious scenery and with out a doubt the absolute worst soundtrack in the history of modern days movies. The snippets of modern 'rock'(?) set against these beautiful French vistas set up such a cognitive dissonance, it literally astounded me. The music has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, scenery or events. I thought they might play something by the cure during the royal downfall. I guess a father's indulgence shows no boundaries - poor Francis ford. I have to assume that in Lost in Translation - Bill Murray and Scarlett are such good actors they improvised their way to comprehensibility. If they had a rational person do the soundtrack over again, the movie would be passable.",Marie Antoinette
163,Sweet_Ophelia,Phenomenal,8,12 March 2007,"Marie Antoinette was just 14 when she arrived at Versailles and married Louis XVI. She reached infamy for bankrupting France and became the most famous victim of the French Revolution, beheaded at the age of 37. Marie Antoinette led a most notorious and lavish life, forever in the spotlight; criticized for her spending on extravagant dresses and hair-pieces, not consummating her marriage to Louis for seven years and consequently not producing a male heir until the age of 24. Versailles was always ablaze with rumors ranging from talk about Antoinette's male conquests to the idea that she was an Austrian spy  and then there were the malicious tall-tales produced by the revolutionaries outside of Versailles, 'let them eat cake'. Marie Antoinette is one of the most fabulously interesting historic characters to have ever walked on this earth  so it is no wonder that her story transcends time and should be told by one of America's newest young writing and directing talents, Sofia Coppola.First and foremost it should be understood that Coppola has not made an historically accurate film. She never had any intention of doing so. The accents are haphazard  Kirsten Dunst's American accent for Marie, Judy Davis's faux French for Comtesse de Noailles, Steve Coogan's Manchester twang as Ambassador Mercy.... furthermore certain parts of Marie's life are omitted, such as the affair of the necklace or the death of her two youngest children not long before the revolution forced her out of Versailles. And there are many more discrepancies both major and minor that critics and historians were up in arms about when this film was released in 2006. Sofia Coppola did not make a biopic of Marie Antoinette, she merely tried to relate a modern audience to a French queen living a lavish and fantastic though fleeting life in the 17th century, and surprisingly, Coppola achieves this. Marie Antoinette lived a life that today is incomprehensible. It was a life of debauchery and duty, of ritual and mindlessness, tradition and revolution. Sofia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' does not relish telling the story of the French revolution; there is a scene in which Louis (Jason Schwartzman) agrees to send funds to America upon the advice of his ministers, and Marie makes a comment to her friends about the nonsense the papers are printing, in particular reference to a comment she supposedly made of 'let them eat cake'. At the end of the film we do see the angry mob that marched on Versailles and forced Marie and Louis to leave for Paris, but otherwise the politics are left out. The film is about Marie  the complete overhaul of her life from Austria to France, her trying to fit into a foreign court and having to become accustomed to the standing customs and protocols of Versailles. A scene in which Marie has to get dressed by the ladies of her court according to which woman has the most prestigious title is fantastic, as is the monotony of dining with the king and so forth. It is this mundaneness that Sofia captures so well  translating for a modern audience what this 17th century queen's life would have been like, not the grandiose aspects, but rather the day-to-day routines. And then there is the interesting story of the pressure put upon Marie by her mother and the French people to consummate her marriage and produce an heir  a queen's duty translated to a modern audience in very simple terms, that Marie is not living up to her duties as a wife. By far the best thing about Coppola's movie is the costumes and set. Special permission was given to film at Versailles (even in the hall of mirrors which is under construction until late 2007!) and Milena Canonero won the Oscar for best costume design. The dresses are a visual delight, and the shoes designed by Manolo Blahnik are to die for! If for no other reason, watch Marie Antoinette to take in the visual splendor of it all. The 80's-inspired soundtrack is also surprisingly charming, it flows throughout the film and is oddly befitting of the lavish lifestyle portrayed. Perhaps the weak link of the film is Kirsten Dunst. She had to play Marie from her arrival in Versailles at the age of 14 until her departure from Versailles at the age of 34. It was a hard task, which Dunst does not really succeed in representing on film. Though I am only choosing Dunst as the weak-link at a stretch, for the sake of criticism. To be honest I loved everything about this film  and I really cant understand why the critics hated it so much. I love the off-beat style in which Coppola decided to tell this period drama, with bright costumes, an 80's soundtrack and a focus on the mundane and routine in Marie-Antoinette's life. From the reviews that I read, most critics wanted more of a political context about one of the French Revolution's most fascinating players, but I like the route Coppola took in communicating a story about a teenager who become a queen at the worst possible time of upheaval. Brilliant.",Marie Antoinette
164,Austin_Powers-1,Eat cake!,5,26 August 2007,"The picturing of a historical person can be difficult, depending on which angle the director is choosing. In this picturing of the French villain queen, Marie Antoinette, the director Sofia Coppola has chosen Antoinette's point of view, which indeed is an exciting project. During the entire movie, Marie Antoinette is described as a fragile and immature victim of the alliance between Austria and France. The movie focuses on colors, big dresses, shoes, shallow luxury and CAKE! The problem with the movie is the lack of a developing story; it is all about the clothes and colors, which is a shame, because there is a huge potential for showing a great story, which is not present a single time during the entire movie. Kirsten Dunst shines as Marie Antoinette, and gives a performance which indirectly gives us a true insight of a hollow life in luxury.So, to get the most out of the movie, you'll have to have read the book ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey"", which the film is based on, or at least know the more detailed story of Marie Antoinette (which I did), and not only the world known (vicious) rumors about her.",Marie Antoinette
165,pandabat,Art Imitates Marie Antoinette's Life - Vacant and Meaningless,3,14 November 2006,"For all intents and purposes, this is a fashion show that has been turned into a movie. Yes, the costumes are sumptuous, and yes, the palatial backdrops are majestic, but somewhere along the way it was forgotten that movies should have a story of some sort or enough heart and soul to make up for the lack of same. For me, this effort had neither.It begins well enough with the Austrian princess being sent to France for an arranged marriage to cement the newly formed allegiance between France and Austria. Her youthful exuberance combined with exasperation and bewilderment at the ways of the French court provide some levity, as indeed does the awkwardness of her fledging relationship with Louis August, who is portrayed as a young man who lacks confidence with members of the opposite sex. At least that is what we must assume and this is where the movie begins to falter, for it does not go on to make a character of Louis nor do so of any other player. All except Marie Antoinette are paper thin types, two-dimensional entities appearing on-screen for a time to say some words but add little else. We do not know why Louis is so distant or if, following the birth of the couple's first child, he remains a truly distant husband or really resembles a lukewarm lover. Schwartzmann is truly wasted in this role.That said, it is only after the first child's birth that we see that the movie may change direction. There are beautiful and lovingly shot scenes where we see Marie Antoinette blossom in motherhood and experience a blissful return to nature from the indulgent excesses of the court. This too however must pass and when we return to the court with the protagonist, we also return to her boring, empty life there. The director might have been trying to get some of this across but I doubt that most of the movie was meant to feel that way. Dunst's portrayal of the character comes across as a girlish person prone to inner thinking and whimsical consumption. This may be true, I do not know, but it leaves us with little view inside the only character in the movie.It's not all terrible there are some good shots, some comedic moments and towards the end of the movie, there is a nice touch where part of the story is told through the changing of a painting, which I found clever. It is not enough though and as the revolution in France is beginning, the movie is coming to an end. The revolution does hint that the movie may end with some drama. Alas it does not and it more peters out than anything else. I felt cheated of my time. If you love fancy dresses then maybe there's enough here to keep you ooh-ing and aah-ing but if, like myself, that is not enough to keep you interested then I suggest ""Dangerous Liasons"" as a great movie covering a similar period within France.",Marie Antoinette
166,AndrewPhillips,disappointing,5,23 October 2006,"There are some really good things about this film. It is beautifully shot, the costumes are outstanding and the music used one the whole works well.I was really looking forward to this film, a modern approach to the period drama was intriguing, alas there was so little substance to it that the good things ended up amounting for very little. The most disappointing thing for me was the lack of seeing the whole picture. I can see where the director was coming from, showing us the isolation of the queen and therefore her inability to see what was happening in the country, but we should have seen it, it would have given us more to think about.The dialogue was poor and too many images of nothing. Nothing really happened, I found myself getting bored. The one point that really made me laugh though, and I'm sure it was not meant to was when Marie was riding in a coach and they started playing the song ""fools rush in"", it was so out of place as to be really funny.It is such a shame there is some real talent involved in the picture and it lets them all down.",Marie Antoinette
167,binaryg,"I Thought I'd Like It and...Ta Dah! I Did! Not Only That, I Love It!!!",10,11 November 2006,"Having trashed two of the three movies Sofia Coppola has directed (I didn't see Lick the Star, yuck!) what made me think I'd enjoy Marie Antoinette? I'm old and worse yet, a male. Certainly not the demographic Marie Antoinette is aimed at, so I found when I ventured out to my local Cineplex to check out Ms. Coppola's 4th go at directing. I figured to use the theater as my personal screening-room on a Friday at noon. Oops! It was a school holiday and I entered one of the smaller of the 14 ""theaters"" into a crowd of a dozen or so chatting high school girls. I had mistakenly arrived 20 minutes early so I had an opportunity to eavesdrop on their discussion concerning the ethics paper they were required to write and what they were considering giving up for a week as required by their class. These must have been students at the nearby parochial high school. What public high school has ethic courses? They seemed a perfect audience for a film on Marie Antoinette. The theater continued to fill as film time approached. It filled to approximately ¾ capacity and I was, as best as I could determine, the only male person of my gender.So why did I think I'd enjoy a film by a director whose films seemed directed by a person with a spoiled child's view of the world? Well, what I'd read about Marie Antoinette resonated close enough with Moulin Rouge, Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge which blew me away. ""Lavish imagery and a daring soundtrack set this film apart from most period dramas; in fact, style complete takes precedence over plot and character development in Coppola's vision of the doomed queen"" should sound familiar to Moulin Rouge fans.Well, as soon as the black and shocking pink credits showed up to the sound of The Gang of Four's ""Natural's Not In It"" I knew I was in the right place. Kirsten Dunst was, in my opinion, a perfect choice. She's beautiful but not too beautiful. She has an aura of mischievousness which worked from start to finish. Ms. Dunst, at the young age of 24 or so, already has a long career in Hollywood. And she was only one of many. From Marianne Faithful, to Judy Davis, to Rip Torn, to Jason Schwartzman, to Asia Argento, to many others perfectly cast. For me, the film never dragged or bogged down. The sets were beautiful. (What can you say about Versailles and the French countryside?) The food was reminiscent to me of Wayne Thiebaud paintings, but more colorful. The costumes, the music, added to the sense of decadence I think the film aimed for. Yet Marie Antoinette's character never seemed decadent. Ms. Dunst's openness and delight in all presented to her, came across. Despite her loss of freedom and the difficulty in eventually becoming the Queen of France she was able to ""Party On!"" What made the film, for me, exceptional, was how Sofia Coppola was able to make both Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI living, breathing, human beings, rather than grotesqueries. I was moved several times by their connection or lack of the same. There is a lot to see, hear and experience in Marie Antoinette. It is an accomplished and stimulating cinematic experience. I shall view it as much as I am able. This film has prompted me to review both The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation. The world is certainly in need of feminine perspective and Sofia Coppola has made a statement that she has the potential to be a very Great talent.Pardon my verbosity.",Marie Antoinette
168,goldgreen,History brought alive,8,17 August 2007,"A brilliant way to explain the history of this era to those who would not normally pick up a history book. Coppola may not have gone for absolute historical accuracy, but who really knows exactly what it was like back then? Coppola creates a character that we can relate to. Whether that is accurate or not is not the point. Once we sympathise with Marie-Antoinette then we can enter her world and start to imagine what it might have been like in Versailles in the 1700s. Yes it would have been good to have seen what life was like for the peasants in France then, but that would be a different story. On an entirely different note, loved the fact that Coppola puts all those great neglected post-punk records from 1978-81 onto the big screen where they belonged all along.",Marie Antoinette

Sure, I thought to myself, I must cut a period picture a bit of slack...these are long and drawn out by nature. But in its 2 long hours, never once does this film pick up an inch of momentum. Though director Sofia Coppola may have simply been trying to show the monotony of Marie's life, frankly, that doesn't translate to the screen. Watch Marie being dressed! Watch Marie at the Opera! Watch Marie select shoes, fans, and pastries to the teenybopper tune of ""I Want Candy""!But, oh the shoes! Oh, the fans! This may just be the most beautifully designed and shot movie ever. It has a sumptuous, stylized look about it that just barely kept me awake. But, as Marie learned during her tragic final years of her reign, you can't get by on beauty alone.",Marie Antoinette
171,SanFernandoCurt,Still life,7,10 September 2010,"What a beautiful woman Kirsten Dunst has become. In this movie, which is little more than a series of beautiful pictures digesting a world long swept away, she is in her element. In fact, she IS the centerpiece element.But pretty pictures do not a memorable movie make. I've never seen cinema so lifeless, so utterly devoid of any kind of drama - and yet so watchable. Somehow, I stayed with it, even though superficial knowledge of history precludes all suspense as to how it will end. We follow the last French royal family languidly gliding through their lives of endless amusement and idle chatter, getting drunk and high at garden picnics in dreamy twilight, cavorting in bonnets, picking flowers and looking like they'd just stepped out of a Gainsborough painting.Maybe that's Coppolla's intention: To show the utter vacuousness of the French court and European aristocracy in general. This is to what rule by God's imprimatur had devolved. The era of strong monarchs like Henry, Elizabeth and Philip of Spain was over. Europe's kingdoms had become... successful. Rich. They'd bumped off all competition. The Mongol threat was ancient fable, Islam was now second-rate, and the age of worldwide empire had begun. But in its prosperity, Europe had become complicated, its economic and political underpinnings wildly sophisticated and enmeshed. Power passed to ministers who specialized in these difficult affairs; royalty was pushed to the background, to estates and sloth.Coppolla's handling of these superfluous dandies is revolutionary in one respect: She doesn't portray them as selfish monsters, or greedy imbeciles, as our tiresome, Lefty/progressive catechism would have them. They're sympathetically handled as clueless and near-infantile. The coming conflagration, and the Terror, they can neither foresee nor understand.The cast is superb, with the exception of Jason Schwartzmann as Louis. Why does this colorless and apparently talentless air-burner have a career? (He is a Coppolla relative.) The inclusion of rock-music interludes is merely jarring and obvious, but in some selections, the sour decadence of '80s pop is a perfect fit. Coppolla's sense of stunning imagery must be genetic; throwaway scenes turn gripping, as when a rider gallops down a pathway, his dress boots tied backwards to his saddle.Perversely, this ""Marie"" made me appreciate Norma Shearer's over-the-top version even more. As emotional and melodramatic as it is, it's historically accurate (there really was a Swedish diplomat lover, although whether he looked like Tyrone Power is unclear). It's a vibrant counterpoint to this beautiful, but detached ""Marie"".",Marie Antoinette
172,Camelot_2000,The Luxurious Though Troubled Life Of A Queen,3,15 November 2020,"The plushy extravagant life of a French Queen is perfectly depicted here with a perfect historical depiction of how life was at the Palace of Versailles back in the 18th Century. It all looked lavish, but uncomfortable at the same time. I mean, there was no room for privacy when Marie woke up every morning and had a line of servants waiting to serve , wash and get her dressed in those humungous gowns she was required to wear.Her ""arranged marriage"" to King Louis XV was a troubled one indeed and one that lacked love and intimacy. It was more of a ""formal union"" based on the protocols of the monarchist system of the day. It was all about ""duty"" and nothing more which obviously left this troubled Queen pining for the care and compassion she was clearly without.This is a lavish depiction of Marie Antoinette, but should have strongly focused instead on her ordeal during the French Revolution. There was a lot of potent drama there during that time and I'm disappointed that it was only vaguely addressed in this version.All we see here is her palace life of privileges and woes and not what she endured as a prisoner during the revolution. She was clearly a misunderstood historical figure who had her reputation tarnished by the revolutionaries who falsely accused her of telling the starving peasants of France to ""eat cake"" instead of their cries for bread, among other things.She was a misunderstood woman who met a tragic demise under a brutal system that used the guillotine as a solution to everything. She had been caught in a marriage she didn't enjoy and also had to deal with the vengeful fury of the ""mob"" once the monarchy lost power and anyone in the nobility was sentence to death.It was a tragic and interesting life that this last Queen of France had. I just wish this film version had addressed more about what she endured instead of the pomp and riches she lived as a French King's wife. There was more potential here, but this film missed that.",Marie Antoinette
173,jcnsoflorida,Pretty Missundaztood,7,22 March 2007,"There are valid reasons for panning this movie, but one should at least give director Sofia Coppola credit for essentially creating the film she intended to. This is a highly skewed biopic, but Coppola made choices, which we don't have to agree with, of course, but they were hers to make. The film ends quite a bit before MA's beheading, and it is an understatement to say it is not much interested in politics. One might detect a bit of directorial slackness going on here (personally, gliding over the issue of her children's paternity was a bit much for me), but Coppola clearly knew what she was doing and not doing. One of the things she seems bent on exploring is how much she can get away with. It turns out, quite a bit. While that may seem like a rather immature stance, it is artistically defensible. She is mainly interested in sound and vision, and this film pleases the senses in fascinating ways. I think the soundtrack is sublime. Will we ever get an undisputed masterpiece from Sofia Coppola? We might get a great film, but I would not expect everyone to like it.",Marie Antoinette
174,Snoopymichele,Child Bride of Versailles,8,23 February 2007,"SPOILERS BELOW I admit, I went into watching this movie (I rented it) expecting not to like it. Guess what? I loved it. I thought it was visually stunning, the performances were amazing, and even the 1980's music worked. I admit, it was a bit jarring at first to see Marie and her friends dancing to Siouxsie and The Banshees ""Hong Kong Garden,"" at a masked ball, but it honestly works. The ever amazing Sofia Coppolla takes a huge gamble and in my opinion comes out a winner with this movie. It's daring, sexy and utterly charming.Kirsten Dunst is enchanting as Marie, Jason Schwartzman is adorably awkward as Louis XVI, and their characters' inability to sexually connect until he becomes king had me laughing out loud. When Marie finds her groove in the boudiour, she really comes to life and the character becomes far more interesting. She is a passionate woman who won't be denied, and having children adds to her happiness and secures her place (or so she thinks) on the throne, especially after the birth of the Dauphin.The scenery was gorgeous, the cinematography stunning, and it's just a delicious guilty pleasure.

176,polar24,A chocolate box of tastes,7,4 January 2007,"If you wanted to learn about the French Revolution, one way might be to stroll down to your local library, rent out a few archaic textbooks and maybe a BBC video documentary. No doubt you will acquire a great deal of knowledge, facts, and figures.However sometimes you long for being there in the late 18century renaissance; in France, dancing and lounging among Kings and Queens, indulging in the royal and decadent lifestyle. Marie Antoinette offers that eclectic alternative. Far from the fact, however staying within reach of the truth, Sofia Coppola has crafted a chocolate box of luscious exuberant tastes that look to good enough to eat. However in this film, it's the eyes and ears that do all the tasting.Based on the book by accomplished historian Antonia Fraser (who also helped oversee the making of the film), Coppola has crafted not so much a retelling of Marie Antoinette's life (or even death) but a slice of paradise during her time as the Queen. Not knowing anything about the Revolution, I decided to ""educate"" myself on the Cliff's notes of the story. Fraser's story and subsequent documentary was fascinating, at the same time being illuminating. Surprisingly, Fraser who had a large input on the formulation of the film allows Coppola to indulge a fairytale with fancy sweets, dresses and rock music. The effect is a film that is stunning to look at, contains a thin thread of plot but is still entirely believable in context.Copola's script is economically sparse. There are long moments without dialogue; most of it is gossip and a form of recitative in between the scenes. The film relies on real stars - the direction, costumes, and art decoration - to tell the story. It covers the period in Marie Antoinette's life during which she inherits the crown, marries the king and attempts to conceive an heir to the throne.Marie Antoinette played by Kisrten Dunst captures the essence of a young princess, enjoying life at her prime - a most active and beautiful woman. Her soft and vibrant portrayal is well complemented by the pale lighting and ethereal colours of the palace. She plays with aptitude each scene of loss with as much honesty and pathos as she gives her dances and balls a joie-de-vivre. The supporting cast is an amalgamation of actors from different generations and countries - the result is a medley of American, English and French accents. While it sounds anachronistic, it is also refreshing in it's diversity. The bit players are all worth their salt from Judy Davis' staunch allegiance to Rose Byrne's vibrant festivity and the Ambassador Mercy's honest forthrightness. With a smashing pop soundtrack and exuberant visuals, the film will most likely please the young adult female demographic. This theme of female youth is highlighted throughout the film. Several scenes are dedicated to trying on pairs after pairs of shoes and fashioning hairstyles several feet high all while indulging on pastries that deserve to be in an art gallery. Despite not being of the target audience, I still was able to be swept away by the tremendous artistry of the costumes, decor, dresses and shoes; the exuberant hairstyles and clothing.Considering the young female subject of the film, it makes at lot of sense to guide the film in this direction. If it were a modern day retelling, the story might fashion itself as girl inherits money, goes shopping after which she is recovered; finds boy, gets married and starts family. Therefore, it is a surprising change of pace when we are treating to lengthy almost silent dreamlike scenes of Marie-Antoinette drifting through the palace, dozing in the gardens, and strolling through the Petit Trianon.Art decorators Pierre Duboisberranger and Anne Seibeldeserve, and Costume designer Milena Canonero deserve much credit for their contributions in the film which scream attention, almost outclassing everything else in the frame. Filmed entirely on location in France and in the Versailles palace, they make full use of the gardens and the surrounding environments. They have created an palette of pastels and creams in a rich fantasy world.Also deserving a mention is the cinematographer Lance Acord. He served as cinematographer on Coppola's previous film (Lost In Translation) and also for director Spike Jonze, and has made the most of the decadent architecture and fabrics of 18th century France.Like it's subject Marie-Antoinette is an attractive piece, alluring in it's extravagance and bewitching in visage. It's effect on you is not unlike the glazed pastries that Marie-Antoinette consumes during the film - gorgeous to look at, however not much but air inside.Coppola has exquisitely constructed an dreamlike piece on the of eve the French Revolution so that we might have our own Petit Trianon for a few hours.",Marie Antoinette
177,Solipsisticblog,"""Marie"" dazzles",9,1 November 2006,"Here's a movie that's going to anger more than a few audiences. Some will find it boring, uneventful, vapid. (These were the same complaints leveled against director's ""Lost in Translation."") Others will be angered at the anachronistic use of 80's new wave and modern garage rock. Still others, like the French at Cannes where the film premiered, will be angered that the film doesn't take an overtly critical view of Marie Antoinette's hedonism, funded by the taxpayers, and apparent callousness to the plight of her starving subjects.I think these critics are missing the point. Director Sofia Coppola who is a master of mood and malaise presents us with a clueless Versailles court and defunct monarchy. Vapidity is their birthright. Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is pretty clueless concerning the walls outside of Versailles. She is tended to, doted upon, constantly gossiped about, and given no higher charge than to produce a male heir with her disinterested, simple spouse Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzmann). She is insulated and given little to do. But she is young, vivacious, and needs an outlet for her energy. Coppola expertly captures Marie's boredom through long stretches of dreamy wandering--see ""Lost in Translation""--and by depicting the grind of her courtly responsibilities.When Marie lets loose in the film's second act she does so to the tune of Siouxsie and the Banshees. To those who bristle at the score, I should remind them that the Dion-influenced score of ""Titanic"" wasn't exactly authentic to the period, either. The music works well as an emotional cue. To a contemporary audience, ""Hong Kong Garden"" simply evokes a certain response not captured by chamber music.The film benefits immensely from being filmed at Versailles. When the camera looks out across the grounds, Versailles appears completely isolated from the outside world. You have no sense of the angry, volatile nearby city. The costuming of the film is also fantastic. The clash of modern rock with 18th century custom and costume is bracing and inspired. (If you look closely during the shoe fitting montage, you'll see a Converse All-Star on the floor.) The opening sequence where Dunst shoots the audience a come hither look is immediately followed by the punk rock inspired credit sequence to the tune of Gang of Four's ""Natural's Not in It."" These moments get the movie off to a rousing start and will probably either fill you with dread or with anticipatory glee.The cast is eclectic and accomplished. Danny Huston, Judy Davis, Rip Torn, Asia Argento, and Steve Coogan all deliver fine performances. SNL fans will be happy to see Molly Shannon as a gossipy courtier. Schwartzmann continues to show a growing range as the ineffectual Louis. The film belongs to Dunst, though, who both elicits sympathy and anger as we observe the obtuseness that leads to her demise.A fantastic film that will divide audiences. Go see it.",Marie Antoinette
178,lolipop_big,Not good,4,7 October 2020,It was so boring and not good. The end was stupid. It makes you think that These girls had no brains and nothing to do out of boredom. Apparently it was like that....,Marie Antoinette
179,paul_tremblay,"Intentions are there, the result is awkward...",4,9 July 2012,"It is hard to figure out what went wrong with Marie Antoinette (the movie and the character...) We may fathom Coppola's intentions, barely distinct in the final rendition. For instance, Kirsten Dunst's interpretation and acting are, at first sight, awful, deprived of any professionalism and devoid of any meaning. The 80s and 90s music is so out of place it makes you giggle (or weep, depending). Then you think what maybe, just maybe, the director had in mind: draw a sharp distinction between the context (18th century Versailles) and Marie Antoinette's state of mind; the formal décor, the classical comportment, the very serious consequences of one's actions (or inactions) stand out against the music. Her acting, for instance, appears out of place in a costume drama, more compatible with a high school comedy (or Mary Jane). However it does clash once put in opposition to almost every other actors/actresses in the movie and I can't help think it is intentional. She is the young innocent, the gamine still, who just wants to have fun but is slowly starting to grasp the seriousness of her situation. How does it come out? Not very well. We can sense the intention but the results are very much lacking, if my perception is correct. The rhythm and tension so present in Lost in Translation are completely missing here. It is a film that does not know where to go, desperately searching for itself; so are we, asking ""where are they going with this scene, with this sequence, with this soundtrack?... The gap between the music and the setting, by the way, is much more bothersome than revealing and only an intellectual effort as opposed to an emotional epiphany provides the viewer with some clues as to the objectives of the filmmaker. Yes we understand that the setting (American accents, modern music, etc) is supposed to make Marie Antoinette contemporary to us, to make her the everyday girl trapped in a political marriage (saw the Converse All Star sneaker? The point is made). Yes we understand that women are blamed for everything, going from the sexual to the economy to the political realms (we kind of got it after the first 500 times it was implied). The scheme is more or less successful when it comes to detach Marie Antoinette from her environment, be it the political milieu that she completely fails to grasp or the French peasantry whose anger is brewing outside Versailles (and whose silhouettes we barely see by the end of the narrative. Still why some speak with a distinctive French accent, other with a British or Australian inflection, a couple with an American drawl, go figure. Some of the shifts in the film are quite unexplained, dramatically speaking. Marie Antoinette's relationship with Madame Du Barry first is depicted as detrimental to the Dauphine but suddenly shifts to Du Barry yearning for Marie Antoinette's attention, which is odd. The abrupt hatred of the noblesse towards her (at the opera) leaves the viewer in want of some Cliff Notes, in spite of the lengthy and seemingly irrelevant preceding two hours. Of course we were treated to ""The Queens is overspending"" voice-overs and other accusations and, yes, we understand that compared to the enormous expense related to sending armies overseas her antics are nothing (and she is blamed for France's financial debacle, got it, got it), but the shift is quite hasty in visual and dramatic terms. There is a historical explanation to this, but it is totally omitted in the film, hence breaking the rhythm and the plot to pieces (or what was left of it) It is one of the world's saddest ironies that French monarchy's contribution to the American Revolution partially and ultimately fed the movement that shove it in the dustbin of history. It is also implied here, but you have to make it up as opposed to feel it. At the end, Coppola's Marie Antoinette is, as a movie or character, quite ""insignifiant.""",Marie Antoinette

The thought of seeing another actor attempting the stilted period lingo and mello-drama gives me a headache, BUT Miss Coppola has undone my pain with this fresh take on the period drama, with her lovely and off-beat MARIE-ANTOINETTE. Usually you watch the piece from afar, thinking, ""Wow, life sure was hard back then,"" but you never really can relate to the characters, but Coppola breaks tradition in a completely refreshing way, so that you can really understand these characters. She uses modern day music (not like the horrible A KNIGHT'S TALE did) and hand held camera work. Her style is much more free and alive. She takes her time with the material so that we get a feel for time period and all of the free time they had. The acting is first rate, other than a mis-cast Rip Torn who's a little too over-the-top. If you've enjoyed her other movies (THE VIRGIN SUICIDES & LOST IN TRANSLATION), then you are sure to enjoy this film. But if you are looking for another stilted period drama with forced accents and dead camera work then rent THE PARTRIOT or VANITY FAIR. I really enjoyed MARIE-ANTIONETTE, though I'm not sure how historically accurate it is, it's a fine film. Some have criticized Coppola for making a French subject so American, but that is not the point, she has created an accessible historical biopic, that people of MARIE-ANTIONETTE's age could enjoy and relate to.",Marie Antoinette

I should not have tenderness for those two young persons who were not fit for governance but had to embrace the role. I am reluctant to this. But I do have. I guess it's Sofia Coppola's talent striking again. The story is still though too far from me for this film to become my favourite Sofia Coppola. So I will remember ""Marie-Antoinette"" as ""just"" an aesthetic orgasm. A cinematographic sweet: leaves you a nice taste but does not fulfil your emotional needs nor feed your mind.

That kind of solipsism is historical denial, and we do not applaud untruth. The real M.A. was not so enigmatic after all. Quite self-aware, never that powerful, certainly not the semi-impaired cupcake of Ms. Coppola's vision. Nothing, nothing! of three concurrent wars bankrupting a nation, the corruption of the Estates General, the Affair of the Necklace. And most importantly -- nothing of the rancid Duc d'Orleans, royal court cousin, chiefly responsible for M.A.'s rise in society, the overshadowing of Pompadour, duBarry, etc. It was Orlean who undermined the throne, spread pornographic images of the real M.A., fostered revolution and then hoped to inherit from a disgraced Louis a grateful nation returning to his version of monarchy.

Antoinette was an intriguing enigma from a pivotal event in history.

Queen Elizabeth the first. Even the Dambusters. They were all very young. I find the sign of a good film is that I want to know more. Recently I watched a DVD of Charlie Wilson's War, and immediately afterwards got on to Wikipedia. It was the same here. I wanted to know more. A thoroughly enjoyable film. The acting is excellent and believable. Rip Torn asking about Marie Antoinette's ""bosom"". I could almost imagine the Duke of Edinburgh asking about Diana's tits.",Marie Antoinette

There really isn't anything to learn from this ""visual lard"", as another reviewer aptly put. It did remind me of a bad wedding cake, all fancy icing designs, but tasting like sugar and lard. Sophia Coppola may have good taste in music, but her directing style has no substance. Also, while I liked most of the 80's tunes she used in the movie, they seemed jarringly out of place in this fluffy period piece. This was supposed to be about Marie Antionette and her life, which was mainly defined by the French Revolution and the fact that she was beheaded! Why was it fluffy and trite?Sophia portrays Marie as an innocent valley girl socialite, complete with little dog accessory and penchant for partying and attaining ugly shoes! At the same time, we are supposed to sympathize with her, even though she never seems to care about anybody but herself. I was actually looking forward to seeing her get beheaded. They didn't even show anything! The utter cop-out of an ending just showed her and her socially retarded husband riding away like they were leaving on a holiday, to use a British term! There was one brief scene of the peasants shouting gibberish while Antionette goes out on the balcony and does some stupid bow for some unfathomable reason. The crowd, when shown for a brief few seconds, looked like a bunch of people going to the Renaissance Fair of something! They looked nothing like starving, mad-as-hell poor French people! That was ridiculous.The casting seemed strange as well. Poor Kirsten Dunst seemed completely out of her element. She didn't even attempt an Austrian accent! Also, when she is shown undressing, she looked dangerously underweight! It wasn't sexy! What is it about female actresses and their refusal to eat normally? Rip Torn looks bizarre here in French garb, and Molly Shannon and Jason Shwartzman seems completely miscast as well. There really was no depth to French culture shown here as well. It seemed as if virtually no research was put into this. Overall, this movie just had nothing in it I liked.",Marie Antoinette

189,catuus,Very porlly conceived and executed.,1,21 August 2009,"""Marie Antoinette"" is the name of a film made in 1938 by the great W.S. Van Dyke (Director), the wonderful Norma Shearer (Marie Antoinette), the brilliant Robert Morley (Louis XVI), the talented Tyrone Power, the inimitable John Barrymore, the imposing Joseph Schildkraut, and others whose names will be forever enshrined in film history for this and other grand achievements.""Marie Antoinette"" is also the name of a film made in 2006 by the uncoordinated Sofia Coppola (Director), the ditzy Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette), the ineffectual Jason Schwarzman (Louis XVI), the unfortunate Rip Torn (who must nave been duped, bribed, or blackmailed), and others who will spend much of their later careers trying to live down the fiasco.This review is of course about the latter. I can understand why some reviewers actually like the thing. It's a pretty puff piece, a big fluffball of empty calories – cinematic junk food. In this case, it's not super-salty potato chips, but packing peanuts soaked the dregs of a deep-fat fryer. It's hard to resist this sort of toothsome slop – else most of the fast-food traps would be out of business.The story of Marie Antoinette is a sad one, and in the end she suffered the fate that most members of her class richly deserved. This story needs to be told with empathy and dignity. In this film there is some feeble attempt at the former, but absolutely none of the latter.The banality of the script is almost iconic, leaping like a starved carnivore from cliché to cliché. Amazingly, the script touches effectively on the point that ""Let them eat cake"" (literally, ""brioche"") may not have said by Marie Antoinette at all. In fact the script does a fair job of avoiding historical howlers.We can at least say that the script gets the acting it deserves – as Dorothy Parker once said of Katharine Hepburn, no less – running ""the gamut of emotions from A to B"". The most important problem with the script is where it stops.The connection of Marie Antoinette with the great French Revolution is fundamental. In this film, the Revolution takes place with scarcely any intimation that it's brewing. But the Revolution begins on schedule anyway, but is barely under way when the film ends. Marie Antoinette's life in the first years of the Revolution, and her execution particularly, may as well not have happened so far as this film is concerned. This is even more lame than (for instance) ending the story of Cinderella at the point when she arrives home after running away from the ball. (Of course, I'll bet you that most of any modern audience will sit there gaping, saying to themselves, ""I wonder what happened to her after that"". Such is the state of modern education.) Indubitably, the lamest part of this ""Marie Antoinette"" is the musical (if you can call it that) score. It's not merely lame, it's tawdry and terminally stupid. When it's not insipid musak, it's rock. Now, rock music is incapable of any real emotional content whatsoever. It's OK for car chases, fist fights, shoot-outs, tractor pulls, monster trucks, unbridled raunchiness, and other events of more than usual empty mindlessness. It's totally unsuitable for any film that aspires to some degree of quality. The quantity of this stuff is a good indicator of the depths to which the film sinks.There is a little decent music in the film, every note of it composed during the period of Marie Antoinette's life or before. Even there, the film's penchant for cheap shots shines (if that's the word) through. Recall the several little episodes when Marie Antoinette is awakened and dressed in the morning. The music is Vivaldi's Concerto for Diverse Instruments. Where have we heard that before? Remember ""All That Jazz""? This is the music that plays during Roy Scheider's wake-up ritual. ""Marie Antoinette"" uses some good music to good purpose and even then it's just a cheap rip-off of another film.I suppose it can be said that ""Marie Antoinette"" has its good points. The sets and costumes are very bright, cheery, and not inaccurate. On the other hand, the genuine tawdriness of late 18th-Century French fashion serves admirably to set off the equally genuine tawdriness of the film. The same may be said for the complete absence of Voltaire as a character. After all, why bring out philosophy when you can trot out titillating assertions that Marie Antoinette was a slut.",Marie Antoinette
190,SandeepLoyalka,Hollow...but gorgeous!,6,23 January 2007,"The story of Marie Antoinette is a well documented one.We know that she ascended the throne of France as a very young teenager,led a luxurious but vacuous life as empress,and was eventually a victim of the French revolution.Director Sofia Coppola presents this rich - but ultimately empty - existence in her absolutely gorgeously mounted film.The problem lies in the fact that she takes too long to relate this tale.The ennui of life at the French palaces was probably all too real,but to be shown on film,it needs to be presented in an entertaining manner.It is here that Coppola fails.The film appears to be merely a montage of sequences depicting the repetitiveness and weariness of life in the royal halls and galleries of the French monarchy.While Kirsten Dunst in the eponymous role and Jason Schwartzman as her husband,King Louis XVI,are undoubtedly good,the film often gets cumbersome.On the flip side,however,is the stunning location filming,the remarkable art-direction and the absolutely sumptuous costume-design.In fact,I will have to concede that this is perhaps the best looking film I have ever seen! The much debated modern musical score does jar occasionally but is certainly not as much of a hindrance as I had anticipated it to be.Coppola is certainly a thinking director who seems to have inherited her legendary father's genes,but I really hope she picks scripts with a little more meat on them.",Marie Antoinette

192,afdiazr,"Strongly visual and dramatic piece of cake (historical spoilers, folks)",7,9 February 2007,"Kirsten Dunst is a lovable Marie Antoinette. Her face expression when they take away her dog will set the tone for her ways throughout this film by Sofia Coppola. This is a girls' candy world, and as those sort of worlds are, it is not without sadness and despair. I totally agree with Roger Ebert on this one (I do most of the times): the fact that we know her true fate is only the fatal frame to this bloodless visual feast. Marie is surrounded by strict manners and rituals, is forced to give birth in front of a superficial crowd, is taken away from her family at 14, is given the power of monarchy. ¡She was a teenager, for God's sake! Though there's no tragedy in Coppola's film, you can feel the eerie atmosphere of the pompuous against a doomed political time. Modern music sounds so fresh in this kind of movie. It reminded me of Jesus Christ Superstar, where the anachronic was just a way of tying our world with the past. It serves as a link between what we think we know of that time, and the way we feel emotions today. Marie Antoinette is so beautifully crafted, you almost taste every cherry and dessert. You are living inside this impressive palace, and witness her fragility through Dunst's persona. It is a film about emotions, not facts. And it works so much. It's one of those films you experience, not watch.",Marie Antoinette
193,baseballfanjm,Certainly a divisive movie. I thought it was stunning and touching.,10,28 October 2006,"Odds are you will either greatly enjoy this film, or leave the theater wondering what the hell the point was. I fall firmly into the first category.This movie isn't a glorification of superficiality; it's the story of a woman who was taken as a young girl and forced into a society that had no place for depth or feeling, especially for a woman. Thus, she escapes by throwing herself into frivolity. Sofia Coppola does a fantastic job capturing the meandering, shallow, every-day-is-the-same feeling that must have dominated the aristocracy of the time. No, this movie doesn't concern itself with the politics of the day, nor does it blame Marie for not involving herself. This movie may seem at times to be a sequence of pictures, but the point is that that was what life was like for these people; a constant sequence of material possessions and sweet pastries. And Marie was caught in the middle of it all, without an outlet for her feelings, and unable to know any better. A fantastic movie, and one of the best of the year.",Marie Antoinette
194,francescof86,"""Marie Antoinette""",10,5 December 2010,"There is such a misconception about the so-called ""flop"" of ""Marie Antoinette"". Although the movie divided critics ,the major critic reviews were favourable if not very good or even enthusiastic. I am among the enthusiastic ones. First because I know very well the story of M.A. and how it is difficult to interpret her story without being too biased when assessing her role in the French Revolution. What Coppola did was to portray a sympathetic private portrait of a young girl forced to be queen without any help by her mother, husband or courtesans. Coppola brilliantly succeeds in evoking the real situation of that 14 year-old girl, who was asked to master hard and soft politics without any skill or natural inclination (aside from her ingrained frivolity). Broad French poltics is left out as we are in the personal world of M.A. and the overall causes of the revolution are not the object of the movie. I appreciate very much that Coppola didn't want to film the revolution period because if you want to understand the point of view of M.A. you have to forget that she was later executed by the revolutionaries. Coppola is more interested in examining the girl, the woman ( rather than the distant Queen of the French people ) and her personal feelings towards her entire situation in her golden cage. Besides, we have to remember that this is a movie, not an historical account of the major events that brought to the end of the ancien regime. The movie is loosely based by the book of Antonia Fraser. M.A. personal responsibility in undermining the prestige of the monarchy are not considered because the director aims at humanising the much maligned Queen who was later portrayed as a real monster of depravity. I believe that Coppola is a very outstanding director and made a very original movie that doesn't display itself as a fake, contrived retelling where the characters act like they perfectly know they live in a different century and in an affected way. They are genuine. Plus, as the Goncourt brothers, Zweig, Castelot, Bertiere, and of course, Fraser describe, M.A. showed to be far ahead in terms of lifestyle, tastes, weaknesses, and the desire to break free despite being required to represent the monarchy from her waking moment until her retiring to sleep. Kirsten Dunst was simply perfect and, in my opinion, deserved more recognition than what she had ( considering how actresses who portrayed royal persons in far too inaccurate historical movies got way too prizes ). She gave a very honest performance and was fantastic as the naive, spoiled, sensitive, frivolous and unaware young Queen. But this is only one of the many sides of that woman. Coppola didn't show us the other aspects of the Queen because she has other purpose which is humanizing the despised and misunderstood Queen of France. There is no political side, no faults and or personal disadvantages. It's the private side that only few people knew and not her public side that was easily misunderstood by the unknowledgeable collectivity and unfortunately misrepresented by the same Queen. The supporting cast is appropriate as well. To me the movie was very snubbed by the Academy since I believe that it should have been nominated for best director and best actress. The movie was never meant to be an in-depth biography. It could not be a substitute for a book. Coppola portrayed the elements of M.A. story that fit to her trilogy of films ( ""Lost in translation"" and ""The virgin suicides""). But I think that the main problem is that some viewers simply don't like Coppola style and choices. I liked the mix of modern and typical music as a soundtrack to the feelings of M.A. A very underrated, great movie's director. My vote is 10/10.",Marie Antoinette
195,jeffreyjets,Very well done except...,8,29 July 2007,"Almost all aspects of Marie were pitch perfect. Directing, acting, political backdrop, costumes, sets designs and photography were spot on. The only problem, which to me is a major problem is the choice of the pervasive cheesy 80's pop music. I think the choice was made, because the music itself is viewed as superficial and plastic, which for a 14 year old queen would be a fairly representation. As for me, I do not appreciate the aspects of this music so it was completely annoying and out of place to me. Perhaps, a better technique would have been to play the popular cheesy 80's pop music in the instruments of the time period. That would have made the artful statement much more arty and effective, not to mention much less repulsive. The only other drawback is that the story stop right when historically Marie Antoinette got a stronger backbone. That would have made for a very interesting character transformation. Good as is, but could have been much more enjoyable. I should also state that Kirsten Dunst is one of my favorites, so I am a little biased since I enjoy seeing her on screen.",Marie Antoinette

197,arsenick,A nice tale but not a biography,6,3 September 2007,"As a Frenchman, I was really delighted to watch a movie about Marie-Antoinette, coming from outer-Atlantic. We cut her head off, but I notice that she is always fascinating people from the oldest republics in the world: USA and France. The movie is well colored, costumes are marvelous, using rock and roll music is also a good idea. The actors are not bad, especially Mary-Jane Watson in the main part, as Sofia Coppola elected to see Marie -Antoinette as a lost teenager, unadapted to a so much exposed and sumptuous court. What Coppola uses to say is that she was 14 when she came in France. OK, she is right. But to be 14 in the XVIIIth century was very different from now. The ""teenagers"" was not a concept in itself. At that time, people was either children or adult. And adulthood was earlier than now. Children from the mob used to work very early, and the others were educated to become rulers very soon. Marie-Antoinette was raised to be a princess or a queen, even if protocol at the Austrian court was loser than at the French one. Furthermore, she was not a teenager any more when she became queen, as she was 18. It was the age of maturity at that time. So, she had no excuse for being immature, what she was not any more. That is the only bad thing about this movie. It doesn't say a word about the greatest about: her treachery. She betrayed France by choosing to be Austrian before being queen of France and sent valuable information to her brother (Emperor of Austria) through the Austrian ambassador first, and then through her lover Axel Fersen. Another grief could be her bad advices to her husband who truly loved her (which was quite unusual) and trusted her in politics. One of the explanations of the failure of the monarchy could have been the court system and the Chinese wall between the rulers and the people, but not the age of the Queen. The movie ends at the most interesting period of French history: the beginning of the revolution.However, this movie is amusing if you do not imagine that it was reality.",Marie Antoinette
198,lossowitz,A new candlelight,5,12 July 2009,"A historic movie can be made with four intentions: to tell an exciting story, to teach history, to analyze the present by referring to the past or to shed a new light on history as it is told: deconstructing myths.After watching Marie Antoinette is tend to believe that Sofia Coppola's intention was the latter, with the third intention as a side effect.The movie clearly enters the discussion about the historic Marie Antoinette, who is, especially in France, seen as a reckless and spoilt half-spy, interfering with politics and who was executed rightfully after the French revolution. That last event is not even shown, but the director expects the viewer to know the end, as it is with more ""things one knows about Marie Antoinette"". It is even made explicit when the role itself refers to her most famous remark: ""Let them eat cake!"" ""I never said that!"" states Kirsten Dunst.But what exactly is this new light that Coppola wishes to shine on the subject? It never becomes clear, maybe because the script is torn between staying true to history and showing a woman's coming of age.It could have been a girl thrown into the cruel protocol of a highly organized court. But Marie Antoinette, though subjected to awful habits, never really suffers. The problem with getting pregnant from a almost impotent king troubles her and her mother, but before it becomes a life-threatening burden, history breaks in and a child is born.To be laughed at by the rest of the court is never sketched as intolerable or the reason for her to take flight into sugar rushes, a make believe rural village or into the arms of a passing Swedish officer. She just does as all the others do at this court of leisure and endless parties.By use of music Coppola tries to link that lifestyle to the lifestyles of the party people of today: the young and rich attending to their hairstyles, clothes, where to be with whom without one thought for the real problems of the world.But even that analogy is never stretched to its limits: Marie Antoinette takes an interest in arts, reads Rousseau and genuinely enjoys the eggs and the milk in her life like farm resort.So what do we end up with? A movie that never seems to know what it wants to tell: it is not history, it is only chunks of it. It's not a parallel with the present. It is not a real light on Marie Anoinette, maybe just a candlelight. And what the greatest miss is: it's not an exciting story.Kirsten Dunst can be adorable. Some scenes are clearly charmingly improvised. And Jason Schwartzman is as dorky as Jamie Dornan is hunky. But if that is all, it is not enough.",Marie Antoinette
199,robbieclaravall,"Style, style, and style.",4,28 July 2017,"Bedazzled by an array of chatoyant gowns and prismatic production value, Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette never gets past its stylish frames. The color pink is heavily used in its luster; a traditional symbol of reign and Dunst's autonomous lust, but these kaleidoscopic images rapidly putrefy in the hands of a shoddy plot and weak characterization.The plot is a museum of ravishing shots; the dialogue is very minimal, and the portrait of Marie Antoinette's ill fate never reaches its pinnacle as her character is nothing more than a beautiful figure in a ravishing dress. The problems she faces are more so caused by her capricious nature, and the film doesn't establish a profound statement about her mingled entanglement in life's promiscuous pleasures; thus, empathy for the character is difficult to obtain. This applies the same for the rest of the cast; the acting will do, but they never just get interesting. This may be the result of the lack of a proper screenplay, but as exquisite as the film looks, this is as bland as it gets. The last 15 minutes are handled better (as dire consequences are met), but as a whole, this biopic was quite forgettable.A supposed narrative about the intricate chain of thoughtless decisions leading to the fall of Versailles turns into a game of frocks and garments. The cinematography and production are indeed beautiful, but as far as substance goes, this doesn't reach its maximum potential. I can see the themes of regal expectations and irresponsible teenagers not blending well, but the representation of the characters in a clunky plot make this film a snoozy and uninteresting watch.",Marie Antoinette
200,stiff5,Beautiful..,8,22 October 2006,"This is such a wonderful artistic film. Sofia Coppola nails it down and succeeds. This is a great film that shows you Marie Antoinette from her own view. Not from the people in Versaille. From the start you can feel her pain and her longing to escape and just be a regular girl. Being a Queen isn't a walk in the park as portrayed many times. She was young and too young to reign... and as said in the film "" God guide us and protect us, we are too young to reign"" and this is said by Jason Shwartzman. The acting is phenomenal! Kirsten Dunst was perfect for the role and Jason Shwartzman was great also. I loved the movie but I gave this a 8 out of 10 because, even though i love Sofia's view and direction, the story has elements where it's confusing and at times you don't know why something is happening. I know this movie just directs on Marie Antoinette but at times i'd liked to know what was going on. But overall I enjoyed it immensely!! Go and see it!!!!",Marie Antoinette

This is less of a teleplay than people are used to where themes and characterization are hammered home with a sledge. In fact, this is one movie where costumes have a thematic value. The constraint of corsets and elaborate dress parallel Marie's personal restrictedness. When she becomes queen, she has simpler, more comfortable clothes made for her which she wears in a place where she and her friends can be free of regulations of life at court, where she is as stifled in some ways as a convict in prison stripes. As in music or painting much is conveyed here without words. This movie is so visual in fact you should see it on a theater screen rather than wait for the DVD.",Marie Antoinette
202,harborrat28,Sofia's Hamptons Rerun,4,28 February 2007,"Although perhaps deserving some applause for the costumes and settings, most everything else about this movie was pretty dreadful. It reminded me strongly of an ugly out-of-body experience in the shoe department of Saks: I was surrounded by a pack of wealthy, privileged Upper East Side (OK-New York) women examining $800 shoes and talking about them as if they were very, very important. I activated my red Converse hi-tops and got out of there.Thus, when the blond (Mid-western?) Marie/Kirsten Dunst said ""Oh Wow"" in response to the presentation of an over-abundance of beautiful fabrics and shoes and a ballet of pastries (as ""I Want Candy"" played in the background), I had a flashback to Saks. I realized that the problem with the movie was that Sofia had created a Versailles that corresponded to life in the richest regions of the late 20th century Hamptons in which she came of age. The American accents were the worst and the choice of Jason Schwartman as a catatonic or special needs Louis the 16th was really a disaster. The acting, as a result of directorial inadequacies or, worse, intent, was pretty abysmal in the context. Enabled by her family fame and money, Sofia Coppola has once again, as in Lost in Translation, brought us another boring memorial to her spoiled rich-girl life.Luckily, the movie was beautiful to look at. I enjoyed, in the main, the rock/pop background music (there were a couple of places where it got out-of-hand) and liked the occasional camp, whether intentional or accidental.Comes the revolution, I've got my scythe. And I have an excuse for being in the shoe department at Saks.",Marie Antoinette
203,love_for_nails,Really disappointing!!,5,17 November 2012,"Being a period pieces fan, I wanted to see a movie that could combine drama, with comedy and all the old-fashioned traditions. Then I saw Marie Antoinette here, on a list with ""GREAT"" period pieces. Oscar won, famous actors and actresses's (Kirsten Dust, Judy Davis, etc.), a good metascore review, I said to myself ""wow, this seems like a must watch"". I saw it like 30 minutes ago, and I feel for the first time that I wasted 2 hours. I learned about the controverted history of Marie Antoinette and I usually enjoy historical-based movies, but this...this is just a stupid joke. Seriously? Childish parties, weak plot line, only pink dresses and cake's and strawberry's. What can I learn from here about Marie Antoinette? Absolutely nothing!! Sure the acting was fine and all, but the actors can't do anything for themselves! They need a good plot line, a story, something that could make the public tick! What on earth was this?! And I thought that The Turist was bad. Comparing the movies again, The Turist could gain an 8 now from me. They just made fun of all the history! The France history, Marie Antoinette's history, everything. It was not funny, there were hard times back then. I know they wanted to focus on her other side, a more childish, innocent side, but they failed to impress. At least in my point of view.And I recently read here a post that said that this is a masterpiece, and that even someone re-watched three times or so... I wanted to stop it at the half of its running, but my mother made me not to, because she hoped for a better evolution. Didn't happened. And when someone intervened there and said that it was weak, someone trashed the guy, for not interfering because it's ""a girl"" post. Well I'm a girl and I found it awful. I like parties, but this movie is beyond ridiculous. Ridiculos is a big word for this movie.And the soundtrack...please. It scratched my ears.I'm not a grumpy person, on the contrary I enjoy every bit about this life whether it's funny or not, but this movie really doesn't capture anything. Nor the teenage theme, nor the history theme (or whatever), nor anything. Poorly directed, poorly written, very good acting. That why it receives an 5 from me, because the actors had no fault.I don't recommend for those seeking history, but only for those animal party lovers.5\10",Marie Antoinette
204,xander34,Marie's gorgeous to behold,7,6 November 2006,"Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette takes a vivid look into the lavish life of the controversial queen. Shot on location in Versailles, the film, along with The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation is stated to be part of a trilogy of the director's movies concerning women feeling alone.Plot has never been Coppola's strong suit, but should a minimalist approach work in a biopic? To an extent, it does. The film does not cover Marie Antoinette's entire life, but just the years she spent in Versailles. The film's main conflict resides in the necessity of Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) to produce an heir with Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). This is a meager plot to sustain a two-hour long movie, but Marie Antoinette really isn't about the trials and tribulations of France and extraneous character arcs, but about Marie's own personal feelings of being an outsider while living in Versailles.The film successfully conveys her yearning for excitement beyond the confines of the royal court. Dunst gives an honest, respectable performance while Schwartzman gives a surprisingly excellent turn playing against type as the bloated, shy Louis XVI. However, the style and visual beauty of the film outweigh any of the performances. Costume designer, Milena Canonero, who has been producing magnificent work since the '70s in films such as Barry Lyndon and Chariots of Fire, creates a visual feast.Coppola's direction is spot on. Her style shines through with the usage of pink, blue tints and modern music. The music, including songs by New Order, The Cure, Bow Wow Wow and The Strokes, helps a historical film connect with a contemporary audience. By using modern music, one could actually feel the rush Marie felt when sneaking out to a masquerade party. Another device utilized by Coppola was having the actors speak in their own accents, instead of struggling to sound French or Austrian. Where Coppola missed the mark, however, was in the writing. Her decision to sidestep the ultimate fate of Marie Antoinette could have been a great idea, but the ending of the film felt abrupt and incomplete. Coming straight off an Oscar win for her brilliant previous script, Lost in Translation, Coppola's screenplay for Marie Antoinette is disappointing.Even without a perfect script, Coppola finds ways to create character and story without an utterance of dialogue. The simple switch of a portrait shows the death of a child, and the queen becomes aware of her fall in popularity when she applauds at an opera, but no one else joins in. Marie Antoinette had the possibility of being an outstanding film if it had been a reel shorter, but it was still a pleasure to watch.",Marie Antoinette
205,wulfstan,ABSOLUTELY GHASTLY... ever wonder why mezzo-giorno Italians put plastic seat covers over gold lame upholstery?,1,24 September 2008,Well this will answer your question This is creme fraiche and caviar topping on a pizza.Sofia Coppola has connections. Unfortunately she also has a lousy education.So we see a classic milquetoast Jew playing Louis XVI as Woody Allen(frankly I find Robert Morley more dynamic) enduring painfully his Austrian wife's courage.Lousy music... Bathos on top of pathos combined with terrible rock. poor Kirsten Dunst had to go into rehab after this... I totally sympathize. What an appalling waste of money and effort.You have to have flunked 3rd grade to get to the end of this.But of course the gang that control entertainment showered it with awards! It is all about them and has little to do with history. They deserve 7 days in a locked room with a looped Barry Lyndon.,Marie Antoinette
206,satterwh,Fails on So Many Levels,3,21 March 2008,"First, I want to say that I really like historical dramas. This leads me to a bias, however. A good historical drama needs the feel of the period it represents.Marie Antoinette completely fails at this. Costumes were good, but there was no real feel of the excesses of the French court that led to its downfall. The score was - in my opinion - an unmitigated disaster. It didn't know what it was trying to be. Ranging from anachronistically modern to occasional strains that *MIGHT* have been intended for a past period, it detracted rather than enhanced the experience.Ms. Dunst is a good actress - but she wasn't allowed to show it here. She looked like she was sleep-walking through the film.Not surprisingly, it took great liberties with history. Certainly not unusual in such a piece, but the inaccuracies seemed to be based in an attempt to show Louix XVI in a poor light. The sad part is that he *WAS* a poor king. It would have been better to properly portray him.I give it a 3 out of 10.",Marie Antoinette
207,director1616,Sofia Coppola's Independent Style,7,7 November 2006,"The 2006 version of ""Marie Antoinette"" is one of the most beautiful movies to watch that has been put on screen in quite some time. But I say that in reference to the costumes, set design, and art direction. The term 'eye candy' that has been used by some of the critics and moviegoers alike is very appropriate for this film. Worldwide, there seems to be an even split among those who loved the film and those who loathed it.I saw the film for what it was: a director's independent and different vision of a real-life character whose story everyone already knows. We know what the ending for the real Marie Antoinette was. I believe that Sofia Coppola should be highly complimented for her style in telling this version of the Archduchess of Austria & Queen of France.That's not to say this film is without its problems. Though a big deal was made of Coppola's use of rock music during some scenes, it wasn't as 'horrible' as the French critics made it out to be. As a independent director myself, it is my belief that Coppola could have done a better job matching the music with the scenes with which she used them. The timing choices were a little jarring. And there aren't enough technical reasons in the world to excuse some of the obvious technical 'oversights'. I understand why half the people who saw this film had a problem with it - which is the lack of this film being story driven. The 1938 version of ""Marie Antoinette"" (starring the great Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power) is much more story-driven. If I had directed this movie, I probably would have gone deeper in the mind of Kirsten Dunst's 'Marie Antoinette'. There could have been more done visually to explain why the people of France hated Marie Antoinette in the end.Having said that, I would give my right arm to be able to have access to Versailles in France. Sofia Coppola helped make the cinematography lush and gorgeous by agreeing to the pastel colors used for costumes and sets. The real 'behind-the-scenes' stars are Costume Designer Milena Canonero and Set Decorator Veronique Melery - each deserving of an Oscar nomination, at the very least.Kirsten Dunst did well as 'Marie Antoinette'. Marianne Fathfull will probably never get the recognition she deserves for her performance as the Austrian Empress, Maria Theresa. Though her scenes were short, she played the imperial Austrian icon perfectly.I liked ""Marie Antoinette"", and tend to side with critics like Roger Ebert of his assessment of the film. But as historical films go, this movie is not without its critics (some of it very justified). But I praise Sofia Coppola for being courageous enough to try something different.",Marie Antoinette
208,whistlestop,"Beautiful and quirky, not just a chick flick!",8,25 August 2008,"Just watched it again( with my husband - his first time) and we loved it. He missed the (in)famous Converse shoes so I rewound for him, but they don't matter anyway, they're just there as a symbol of her ""teenager-ness"" (is there such an awkward word? Never mind, you know what I mean!). I love the way Marie Antoinette is portrayed in this film, a young girl thrown into a strange place, with the huge weight of expectation laid on her, yet still managing to retain her feisty character. Versailles is gorgeous as always, when I visited it (before seeing this film) and saw the sumptuousness of decoration I was blown away, you can see how the extravagance would have angered the starving peasants but it's so beautiful! This is a story of two children, too young to be married, too young to rule a country but getting on with it as best they can. The courtship they should have enjoyed was conducted after their marriage rather than before, that's why it took so long for them to become lovers, along with their youth and inexperience. The young Queen is shown to have more depth of feeling than she's usually credited with, as well as her famous love of beautiful things and extravagant spending.",Marie Antoinette
209,cnewf,Gidget Goes to Versailles,4,26 May 2006,"and when she gets there, she gets bored, gossips, reads Rousseau, and has beach-blanket pot parties in Amadeus outfits. I did like the music, there is one inspired masked ball and a good ""watch the sun rise"" scene - the strength of this film is its connection to high school culture, seen through the eyes of a sweet, utterly conventional and finally boring teenage girl, projected from the California suburbs onto 18th century France. This is obviously also the film's weakness: this movie is a beautiful, expensive still life that knows nothing at all about French history, Europe, the Revolution, the Bourbons, how the ancien regime worked, how incompetent wars and not Marie Antoinette's Imelda-Marcos-like shoe fetish ran up the debt, about the conflict in North America with England and Spain, about how leading members of French government actually had brains - the films displays a nitwit, decadent, wig-loving, golden-furniture France as though seen by a France-hater in the Bush administration. As my brother pointed out, the movie also blew the subject of a potentially great movie, which is Marie Antoinette's inspired, sometimes brilliant defense of herself at her later trial. Trying to learn about what happened to the French court from this film is like trying to learn about American corporate culture by watching J.R Ewing's 30 second business deals at the Cattlemen's Club on Dallas. Well sure, politics wasn't the subject of the movie, but why is the ""chick stuff"" buried in diamonds and champagne? That makes these women seem way less tough and intelligent than they actually were in the bloody contact sport of French court politics. As an American watching this in Paris I was struck by the film's lack of historical, political, and cultural sophistication, in which Dunst is in every single frame and it's all one gigantic royal slumber party until the peasants show up in an illiterate wordless mass baying for bread and blood and shaking their satanic harvesting tools. Ouch: The film makes the most sense as a weird allegory of Hollywood inbreeding.",Marie Antoinette
210,julioecolon,A Royal Flush (of Embarrassments),6,20 October 2006,"There is much that is commendable in this film. For starters, I should mention Kirsten Dunst, who delivers an inspired performance in the role of the newly betrothed Dauphine and eventual Queen of France. The costumes, the scenes at Versailles, the attention paid to the strict protocol observed at every significant interval in the lives of the royals, all of these things help buoy this film above sheer mediocrity. The very best moment of the film occurs when the Dauphine, in a political move, deigns to speak to Mme. du Barry, the Louis XV's upstart, simpering harlot. It is a beautifully delivered, capital moment for Miss Dunst. But there are major problems with this film, as well. I found the American accents jarring and risible, for example. While fake French or Austrian accents might not have been the best solution, they certainly would have had the advantage of preventing actors who play characters of so weighty a history from sounding like they've just been shopping at the mall. I thought the soundtrack, a hodge-podge of mediocre pop music that no one will be listening to for very long, an ill-conceived idea that speaks more to Miss Coppola's (perhaps imperious) determination to do things her way than to the making of choices that best befit a period piece. Finally, the second half of the film is largely devoted to Marie Antoinette's decline into hedonism. We are made witness to a frolicking slapdash of parties and endless champagne and pastoral make-believe in muslin and gauze, to which we become mere spectators and during which we lose our connection to the Queen. Viewers interested in learning more about Marie Antoinette's sartorial excesses should read Caroline Weber's ""Queen of Fashion: What Marie Antoinette Wore to the Revolution.""",Marie Antoinette
211,chrissyafrica,"surface beauty, but that's it",4,23 October 2006,"Sofia Coppola certainly has style and an eye for sensual beauty. Kirsten Dunst is an ideal prop for Coppola's images. However, don't go looking to this film for anything deeper than a classy MTV video in corsets and hip padding. Like her supremely better Lost in Translation, Coppola employs deep silences, sparse conversation, and long close ups--unfortunately here it falls flat. Where Lost in Translation was a touching portrayal of love and loneliness, Maria Antoinette is every girl's daydream of being a princess. Jason Schwartzman seemed an odd choice, however he turns in a fantastic portrayal of Louis--quirky and a tad homely, his struggles are very sympathetic.",Marie Antoinette

My wife and I actually pressed the ""mute"" button each time another awful rock song came, so we could at least enjoy the scenery.There are also some problems with the editing.Next time, Sofia, use proper music, or better: do not use it at all.

215,michaelmunkvold,Putting day-glo lipstick on a pig,4,14 January 2017,"Historical costume dramas suck. With a few exceptions (""Amadeus"", ""Elizabeth"") they're stuffy, pompous and boring. That's why I had such high hopes for ""Marie Antoinette"", Sofia Coppola's punk rock take on the doomed French queen's reign. It sounded like such a great idea: French aristocrats kicking it to Siouxsie and the Cure! Day-glo royal wigs! Rock'n'roll, French Revolution-style!But when I saw it, my high hopes were crushed. ""Marie Antoinette"" has all the affectations of rock'n'roll, but none of the energy and passion. It's just a stuffy, pompous and boring historical costume drama, with Manic Panic hair and a decent soundtrack.In 1770, Marie (Kirsten Dunst) is married off to Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) to create an alliance between France and Prussia. She feels lost and alone in her new kingdom, where she is disliked by the Royal Court and ignored by her manchild husband. She numbs her unhappiness with extravagant parties and expensive toys, which take a toll on the French economy and anger the starving peasantry, ultimately setting the stage for a bloody uprising.And yes, she listens to cool bands and dyes her hair. But there the fun ends; the majority of this movie is spent watching Marie lounging around the palace and having lackluster affairs with people who look just as bored as she does. The characters are given little to do but stand there, look pretty, and go through the motions of a flat, boring story. My God, this movie is dull, and all the hair dye and mix tape soundtracks in the world doesn't make a damn bit of difference.As the title character, Kirsten Dunst has an air of sweetness and charm, but it's stifled by a one-dimensional character. We want to like her, but the script never gives us the chance - we never meet the person behind the crown, because there doesn't seem to be one. She's a Barbie doll, pretty but plastic, with nothing beneath her shiny surface.The supporting cast goes to waste, as well. Schwartzman seems bored with the only part in the film more underwritten than Dunst's; as Her Majesty's chief advisor, the gifted comedian Steve Coogan has maybe 10 lines, none of them funny; and Rip Torn (as the young king's father, Louis XV) looks flustered, as if he doesn't know what he's doing there. Watching the film, I could relate.To call ""Marie Antoinette"" a failed experiment gives it too much credit: the word ""experiment"" implies that someone took a risk in trying something new. This movie just trudges through the motions of being a boring historical picture, with the occasional stream of neon and a Blondie or Gang of Four song in the background. That's not experimentation; that's putting Day-Glo lipstick on a pig.",Marie Antoinette

I did enjoy watching it as it was fun, even though the second part gets a little boring. However, what was the point in renting the palace of Versailles since the movie completely ignores Histoy ? Marie-Antoinette is shown as a bubble-head who spends her time thinking about where she will go out, when in reality she was politically-aware, supporting conservatism and divine royalty, which was all she had ever known. Also why show her confronting the crowd of commoners since the movie never says a word about French history and people's sufferings at the time ? I don't see the point. I spent a pleasant time watching the movie but I had forgotten it entirely the following day.",Marie Antoinette
217,Ndirsch11,'Marie Antoinette' a Pleasant Surprise,8,1 November 2006,"Part chick flick, period piece, and historical drama, Sofia Coppola's latest film, 'Marie Antoinette', avoids easy labeling. Although flawed, the film succeeds as an engrossing account of the rise and fall of one of history's most derided and iconic figures. With a strong cast, lavish production values, and an unusual soundtrack, 'Marie Antoinette' is completely one of a kind.Marie Antoinette, who became queen of pre-revolutionary France at the young age of 19, gained notoriety for her outrageous spending habits, eccentric behavior, and wild partying. This life of decadence occurred amidst a national crisis in which the people of France lived in poverty and on the brink of starvation. Marie Antoinette's famous ""let them eat cake"" comment, more or less summed up the general attitude of the upper class: proclaim ignorance in the face of injustice.It's important to note that the film avoids going into much detail concerning the French Revolution of 1789. Those looking for an accurate and all-encompassing historical account of that event had better look elsewhere. That's not what this film is about. Instead, director Sofia Coppola decides to center the film around Marie Antoinette's personal life. The film is told primarily from her perspective and tries to see things through her eyes.Kirsten Dunst stars as the ill-fated queen, whom we meet at the beginning of the film at the age of 15. Marie Antoinette is on her way to the Palace of Versailles where she is to spend the rest of her life married to a man she hardly knows. Audience sympathy is built around Marie Antoinette's unfair situation. Not only does she have no say in her marriage (pre-arranged, of course), but also the only responsibility she is expected to live up to is to get pregnant and, thereby, produce an heir to the throne. The situation is complicated when her husband, the future King Louis XVI, seems unwilling to consummate the marriage. Louis, played by Jason Schwartzman, is portrayed as being completely passive to the point of absurdity. He's so soft-spoken and dim-witted that we can't help but feel sorry for Marie Antoinette.One of things that I liked about the film is that it's high on the charm factor. Director Sofia Coppola, for instance, infuses the film's soundtrack with modern rock music that ordinarily would seem out of place in a historical film. Somehow, it works and doesn't distract from the story. Also, the film's personality matches that of Marie Antoinette, herself: lighthearted, over-the-top, and eccentric. This helps in creating an intimate atmosphere, in which a long dead historical figure feels a little bit more relatable and accessible to a modern-day audience.The film has received mixed reviews and got a combination of boos and applause when it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. It's certainly not a movie for everyone. One of the film's problems is that it's lacking in any real substance. By the end of the film, it was unclear to me what the director was intending to say. The movie is obviously taking a sympathetic approach to Marie Antoinette and tries to portray her as a victim of snobby high society. But beyond this, the film offers very little analysis. Also, by avoiding the events surrounding the French Revolution, the film comes across as rather shallow. After all, no one would really remember or care about Marie Antoinette if it weren't for the Revolution.The film is also noteworthy for being the first movie production allowed access to the Palace of Versailles. By shooting on location, 'Marie Antoinette' feels completely convincing and authentic. With beautiful sets and great cinematography, the film is almost worth seeing just for the production values alone.Sofia Coppola, director of the critically acclaimed 'Lost in Translation', has succeeded in creating a compelling interpretation of a historical figure. 'Marie Antoinette' is a pleasant surprise in an otherwise dull year for movies.",Marie Antoinette
218,raraavis-2,Strictly for the drive-in crowd,2,23 July 2008,"The clothes and settings are very good. And that's about it. Most of the characters don't look French, but clearly Anglo-Saxon, particularly in the way they move. The sound track is awful, with the modern tunes destroying any hope of losing yourself in the movie. I suppose that was considered ""cute"" or ""cutting edge"" by the director, but the result is a total sense of disbelief in the spectator.In general, boring and pretentious. The fact that it got one or two Oscars (not sure and could not be bothered to check) confirms how bad it is, Oscars being in general the kiss of death. Could be OK to watch with the sound turned off since, as I said at the beginning, it IS visually appealing.Am sure it'll do well in the drive-in circuit, if any drive-ins still exist.",Marie Antoinette
219,waterwalker,French Court a la Hollywood,7,2 January 2007,"Sofia Coppola has produced another interesting and enjoyable offering, though her best effort for me remains ""Lost in Translation"" Marie-Antoinette displays her usual masterly creation of atmosphere--a world so artificial it is difficult to be convinced of its reality. Yet don't we see such a reality every day around us, in Hollywood? In the end I think Coppola suggests that the public's image of Marie Antoinette and the disjunction between their image of her and the real person is just as great as that of actors who achieve fame in Hollywood and become grist for the rumour mill.If you like movies with lots of action, Coppola is not the director for you. If you're drawn to thoughtful movies that rely more on the creation of atmosphere and development of character, you will enjoy this movie.",Marie Antoinette
220,Pasky,"Could have been great, but...",7,23 May 2006,"I've just seen Marie-Antoinette at a sneak preview in Amsterdam. I had heard and read so much about this film that my expectations were probably too high. Hence my disappointment. What a strange mixture! Kirsten Dunst is excellent, and Jason Schwartzman too (as Louis XVI), but what a pity for the rest of the crew: this mixture of accents (American, English, French, fake French...) doesn't help. Coppola tried to give a modern twist to M-A's story (with Rock'n Roll music and Dogma-style filming), but I found certain things quite... surprising, like the masked ball at the Garnier Opera, which was only built in 1874, 80 years after M-A's tragic death... But I thought: Why not? Let's be open-minded... Actually, my main problem was not with this aspect of the film, but more with the fact that it lacks rhythm, and that it's much too long (almost 2 hours!). And there are huge gaps on the historical level, which Coppola tried to fill up with paintings (like the death of one of her children, who's erased from a painting). Could have been 'funny', but alas!... it isn't. But let's stop complaining for a moment. I gave this film a 7 because I still think that some moments are of pure magic, like the part about nature, when M-A seems to find peace in her little 'farm' next to Versailles. In those moments, I had the feeling of seeing Lux Lisbon from The Virgin Suicides (also played by Kristen Dunst...) evolving in a sort of timeless parallel world. Pure beauty! In those moments, I thought: What a queen!",Marie Antoinette
221,lescamer,An original film,9,5 October 2006,"Clearly, Sofia has inherited Francis's talent. Like her father, she is very good at making us identify even in a period film and character study. But I'm not here to compare Sofia with Francis. I saw it in Nantes before it came out in the US and I think that for a French audience it must be very annoying to have a French figure told in a very American way. It is more about an American girl than an Austrian girl: The way Marie simply lives in her rich world and parties with friends without wondering one second if the outside world is as lucky as she is. Clearly, Sofia Coppola identifies with Marie: Like her, she is the daughter of a king, she has always had everything she wanted, etc. What I love about this film is tat it is the ultimate biography: The film may take place in the 18th century instead of the 20th and 21th, she may be Austrian instead of American, she may be the daughter of the king of Austria instead of the king of American cinema, her name may be Marie instead of Sofia, but it is very much a collision between the two. Sofia Coppola even deforms history a little to make it more clear that it is Sofia's story and not Marie's. She even goes as far as to make us listen to her own favorite music which Marie could never possibly have heard. In a way, Sofia has the same basic talents as her father- elegance, character study, character identification, a floating story- but where her father is very Italian and manly, she is very American and girly.",Marie Antoinette
222,grandisdavid,Absolute Crap with capital C,1,27 May 2006,"My poor fellow American friends! I would have loved to see a great movie about this captivating part of french history, unfortunately, the taste of the director, who I suspect, succeeded in the career thanks to her last name, is absolutely grotesque, ludicrous and so far from the historical truth. It is one thing to try to make art movies with random subjects of modern life, but it becomes extremely more hazardous with historical movies. In that case, the director must seek counsel from a major historian (and no need for a french one, I'm sure Harvard, Princeton or Yale are full of amazing teachers more than willing to help!). So, this could be fun if it was a parody, or a teenage movie, or even a cinema version of Saved By The Bell, but we are legitimately waiting for something more convincing or more accurate considering the topic. We are very far from the taste of, let's say, Kubrick in Barry Lyndon, and I see no genius in her direction, so what is the point to waste time watching this? Last of all, the rock soundtrack on 18th century french history is less than a poor choice, it is idiotic. Please, if you still really want to see it, don't watch this movie in order to learn more about Louis XVIth and Marie-Antoinette, you have unfortunately no other choice than to read a good book about it as no movie has treated the subject really convincingly.",Marie Antoinette
223,einezcrespo,Pretty sets. Not much else.,6,19 July 2007,"I had high hopes for this one since I love reading biographies. Granted that not everything is accurate nor can be fit into a movie we can only make do with what is presented in this case an overlong rock and roll video that has pretty sets and costumes. Marie Antionette came off a little slow and boring though life in the French Court and it's protocols were very amusing to quote MA in the dressing scene ""This is ridiculous."" Sofia Coppola could've have focused a little more on MA's loneliness in a lousy marriage and the court intrigues and a little less on the extravagant shopping sprees. What is surprising is the infamous Necklace Affair wasn't even included since most modern historians agree MA was innocent from that scandal. Acting wise Kirsten Dunst pulled off a difficult job of playing a childlike queen upfront but a woman who suffered humiliation behind the scenes however it is Rose Byrne who stole the show (along with the sets, costumes and the yummy cakes) as the Duchesse de Polignac a role she plays with believable aplomb. Asia Argento looked a little old for Madame Du Barry and Mary Nighy is nice as the Princesse Lamballe, another unfortunate victim of the Revolution. Jason Shwartzman plays a rather stiff Louis XVI while Jamie Dorman is hot as Count Axel Fersen. Everyone else like Judy Davis, Shirley Henderson and Molly Shannon had nothing to do but gossip and look silly. Marianne Faithful floored me with her regal Maria Therese.

225,Jed from Toronto,Bourbons A-go-go,5,28 January 2012,"This film should have been SO MUCH better, what with the lavish costumes and scenery (which truly rate a 10)and the obviously huge budget available. I don't know what idiot decided that rockabilly went along with the aristocratic indulgences of the 1780s, but someone should have rolled up a script and rapped him/her sharply on the nose. The music is jarring and would be considered badly sang/performed in a film of any genre. I found myself muting many scenes because of the horrid score. The acting is not below par, it's the script that often fails the actors. It does however show, accurately I think, the detachment of the royals and other assorted nobility from the lives of the ordinary folk who would eventually rise up and have all their heads on a pike. It is worth a watch for those who are interested in the remarkable costuming of the period, and the careless decadence of those who were arrayed in such garments while their nation literally starved.",Marie Antoinette
226,Spaceham,Sophia Coppola murders cinema.,1,28 October 2006,"Watching this, all I could think about was imagining Francis Ford Coppola handing his daughter a credit card and saying ""Honey, you can either go to the mall for new shoes, or make a movie. Your pick, sweetheart."" Fortunately for the audience, Sophia chose both, as evidenced by the fantastic shoes in this movie. The only thing missing is a plot, character development, decent dialogue, and any sense of pacing.This film more or less follows the typical structure of every Sophia Coppola movie:1. Throw away any structure whatsoever. 2. Show a girl sitting and thinking about stuff. 3. Cut to a fast, poppy montage. 4. Show the girl crying. 5. Show the girl giggling like an idiot. 6. Show the girl crying some more. 7. Cut to a slower, more ""lyrical"" montage. 8. Show the girl looking kind of sad, but not too sad. 9. Cut to black with no resolution at all, which is okay since there's nothing to resolve.The ""stylized"" and ""edgy"" addition of a hip New Wave soundtrack did nothing but make the movie look like a Falco music video with a ridiculously inflated budget. And with a running time clocking in at an excruciating 123 minutes, Coppola manages to tell us nothing about Marie Antoinette. It's impossible to feel anything for anyone, simply because nobody ever does anything.I could go on for hours, but I'll sum it up as this: It's as if Coppola took the script from ""Clueless"", took out all the jokes, and then tacked on that little revolution thing at the end so that, you know, a significant event would occur in the film.If you insist upon putting yourself through this, if even for morbid curiosity, then at least wait until it comes out on video. Or be prepared to tangle with the theater management for your money back.I hate this movie.",Marie Antoinette
227,MartinPh,"Overlong, boring and inaccurate",3,4 June 2006,"Watching this movie, I was repeatedly reminded of the fifties ""Sisi"" trilogy starring Romy Schneider. Only, that had a plot. Here, all you get are the endless sweet-colored pictures, the occasional pomp&circumstance scenes, and the idealized, soft-focus versions of the real characters. And then all of a sudden (yet, still at least half an hour too late) it's all over, exactly at the point where the action, i.e., the Revolution starts. Okay, so Sofia Coppola was not aiming for a historically correct depiction of Marie-Antoinettes life. She must have realized that historical accuracy was not an option in a film that has Louis XVI's Parisians dancing in the foyer of an opera house that wasn't built for another 100 years. The question is, what WAS she aiming for? I must confess that I have no idea. Unless she was trying to convey to the viewer the boredom of the Queen's life. That worked - I was magnificently bored. The repetitive scenes of M-A's gambling, drinking and dressing are very colorful, but you fill up on them pretty quickly. The attempts at sketching a historical context are so perfunctory that I can't think why they bothered at all. And the much discussed use of pop music in the score is utterly random, a mere gimmick without any deeper meaning. There are no characters to identify with. Most of the cast never rises above caricature, with the gay hairdresser as the absolute nadir. Unbelievable that somebody still has the guts... Louis XV is not far behind, the acting verging on the amateurish. Dunst, too, has hardly more to offer than vague smiles, dimpled cheeks and perambulations in dazzling rooms; it is not like there is a script full of brilliant dialog that offers major acting opportunities. Instead, there's another box of shoes, another glass of champagne, another party. It's the cinematic variant of muzak. Anything positive? Well, one thing that is spot-on is the way the film shows how the lives of M-A and Louis were lived in public, and the often ridiculous and/or embarrassing consequences of this. Also, Coppola at least had the decency to grant M-A that she never actually said ""let them eat cake"". But it would have been so much nicer to see such accuracy embedded in a film that takes its subject seriously overall, and not merely uses it as an excuse to indulge visual sweet-tooths.",Marie Antoinette
228,Jacques-Kinnaer,Better than I expected,6,26 December 2010,"Although this movie tries to go through 19 years in the lives of Louix XVI and Marie Antoinette (from their wedding in 1770 to their departure of Versailles in 1789) in a rather fast pace, I was quite surprised that it does attempt to dismiss at least some of the often repeated image of Marie Antoinette as an empty-headed, frivolous and unfaithful queen. The hostility she met when she first arrived in Versailles and which would culminate in pamphlets accusing her of the most ridiculous things are hinted at, though they could and should have been elaborated a bit more. As with most movies based on some historic event or character, there are bound to be loads of inaccuracies. Two that I did not find mentioned in the ""Goofs"" section are: - Marie Antoinette was born on November 2nd 1755. Louis XV passed away in May 1774, when Marie Antoinette was 18 and a half, going on 19; yet in the movie, she is congratulated for her 18th birthday after Louis XV's death. - One would expect a sunrise on November 3rd in 1774 to be quite chilly of not very cold; not the type of weather where one would sit in the grass next to a pond to watch a sunrise. But all in all, despite the fast pace and lack of some details, despite the elaboration of the often suggested but never proved affair between Marie Antoinette and count Fersen, this movie did better than I expected. Perhaps the great performances and of course the wonderful surroundings and costumes have helped my appreciation.",Marie Antoinette
229,synkronized-1,total eye-candy!,10,2 December 2006,"Sofia Coppola steps over the classic borders of history movies. And what she does is fabulous. She's made it new, colorful, funny, honest and rich. Coppola approaches the movie characters from their point of view. Like all her previous movies (Lick the Star, The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation) the main character(s) are in a young age. In this movie (and in history of course as well), Marie Antoinette is only 15 years old when she marries Louis XVI. And what I like that Coppola does, is that she lets her characters to do things that normal teenagers, normal 15 year old would do. They do a bit stupid things that of course would not be appropriate to royals in everyone's eyes, but Coppola makes them honest. I mean why on earth everyone thinks that real Marie Antoinette didn't do such things when she was 15 and a bit older. I like that the classic and boring way (stiff, motionless faces and ALWAYS so polite and civilized) of impersonating royals has finally broken. Coppola's movies always have really nice sceneries and sometimes camera angles as well. They are so simple, but yet so impressive. And this movie has a lot of color - beautiful costumes, colorful food, colorful people etc. Sofia Coppola's movies have excellent music choice. And so does this one. Acting is wonderful as well. Kirsten Dunst plays the role of Marie Antoinette extremely well. She's sweet, smiley and cheerful. Great actress! And Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI gives his character a mystery touch, a bit weird touch as his character suppose to be at first when we don't yet understand why his like that. Great actor as well! I can't understand why the critics slammed the movie? The only thing worth of complaining is the ending. It moves slowly, yet fast, but without any big connections between the scenes, only a blank black card. Sort of like Return of the King ending. But it's understandable as well - there were just too much material. The ending part was the part where the happy and cheerful young people's life ended, it was the part where everything went suddenly sad and they finally had to start living the life of adult royals. And after all - Sofia Coppola concentrated her movie on the young life of the royals and only gave us a sneak preview of the adults. So probably someone else some day has to make the boring and old classical story of the adulthood and ending days of Marie Antoinette! 10/10",Marie Antoinette
230,msmith-56,waste of money,1,22 October 2006,"""Clueless meets Barry Lyndon"" with neither the wit of Alicia Silverstone nor the cinematography of Stanley Kubric.Marie Antoinette is an unsuccessful mix of contemporary music, plain language, amateurish cinematic directing, and very poor editing. While well photographed and properly acted, the combination of painfully long shots and banal dialogue made for a two hour movie that seemed to run four hours. Some scenes such as the carriage ride to France, shots of Versailles, and many of Kristin reminded me of watching paint dry. Other shots looked like home movies with pans that went nowhere and added nothing to the narrative. If this had been an Indy film, it may have been excusable as a good first effort. However, this was a major release with minor efforts in many key areas  a waste of money both in the studio and at the box office.Lastly, the movie kept all the visceral aspects of the French Revolution far from the audience just at the French government kept it from the royal couple. Unfortunately, it did not translate into viewer empathy for either Ms. Dunst, who was hardly convincing as a 14-year old, or Mr. Schwartzman, a clear candidate for the role of Nero in a G-rated remake of Caligula.Sofia needs to take some more lessons from her dad in the art of making a major release.",Marie Antoinette
231,ShannonTriumphant,Combination of exquisite period detail with New Wave music...?,9,13 November 2008,"I was so conflicted about this aspect of the film--Coppola's combining of the apparently well-researched costumes (except for the hair toward the end and at Petit Trianon--the giant wigs were NOT that popular in what was pointed out, the time of Mozart!) and frolicking in palace halls and meadows, among other places.I love New Order and The Cure...well probably at least as much as Sofia, but it jarred here. Maybe I'm just the fuddy-duddy type who wants to see my costume dramas with the appropriate music (which she did well in the coronation scenes), and leave the techno-pop to films like ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Wedding Singer"" (both of which I adore!).They made much of Mozart yet we heard only a little. You would think that, as one who who had MET the young composer, and whose brother loved his music, Marie would have wanted more. She probably DID...but Sofia had other, radical ideas.I say, save them for the sequel to ""Lost in Translation"" (another fave), in which Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannsen once again cross paths in some far flung, bizarre corner of the world, as did Sigourney Weaver and Mel Gibson in ""The Year of Living Dangerously"".Don't mistake me; I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but not the way I enjoyed, say, ""Emma"" or ""A Room With A View"". It was far more as a sometimes student of the Enlightenment, a person mildly interested in the French Revolution, but above all, someone who insists that the director and production designers ""GET IT RIGHT""! If I'm not mistaken, in the famous, ""I Want Candy"" Shoe scene (now utterly ruined by promos by the god-awful ""Starter Wife""--UGH!--I could swear I saw a pair of lace-up, high-top Chuck Taylors? Am I imagining things? To be sure, I'm shocked that Sting didn't show up with Sid Vicious in tow. If they HAD...I'd forgive all! They CAN do it if they want to. Here's the proof: In the famous ""I Love You/I know"" scene in ""The Empire StrikesBack"" (before Han and the carbonite)...my kid noticed, at age FOUR, that in one shot, Han Solo wears a black vest and in the other,it's gone.

232,KittyGrimm,Good for nothing but insomnia!,2,13 July 2007,"From the first ten minutes of Marie Antoinette (lost talent Kirsten Dunst) traveling to her palace, the next wandering around her new palace once she arrives, the next getting married and the next of her coronation, I knew that this was going to be a slow and uninteresting ride. I can't say much about the plot because there is none and I can't say much for the acting because there isn't much that's impressive to me. What I find the most outrageous is the fact that it was made into a chick-flick when the French Revolution was actually a very dire time in history. I'll give the film an applaud (though not a very enthusiastic or loud one) for completely stunning artistry, but sadly just looking at something pretty is not enough. The film, to me seemed like an old horse: pretty, but goes nowhere. Needless to say, my money and time was wasted on this film due to the fact that it was not at all reliable to history and was too long for it's own good. As much as I love visionary films, they do have to have a plot to them and Marie Antoinette had none. At least it was good for one thing: a cure for insomnia.",Marie Antoinette

The movie is just a dumbfest! Sofia tells a story about absolutely nothing! She opted to disregard any historical or cultural reference of the time that may actually be relevant to our current lives! The movie is all about mood, and costums, It doesn't try to achieve anything,and it doesn't really try to entertain either! I read somewhere that before the movie started principal photography, Francis Ford actually told Sofia to go out there and make the movie she wanted to make!It became so tedious and painful to watch that after awhile I started to look forward to the beaheading of the young queen and maybe with a little luck the French too would get the head of Sofia Coppola and the producers of this travesty! (WHishfull thinking I guess) It just sounds to me like daddys little girl from pot smoking mtv generation is pissing Hollywood's money away and missing in the process a great opportunity to educate people around the world about important historical events that may or may not have helped shape the world we live in today! Kirstin Dunst is terrific as the tittle character in spite of Sofia Coppola's shortcomings. The movie is a great music video at best!Thats probably what she should stick with!

Marie Antionette and Lois were speaking in out and out American accents! It just seemed a bit odd, either have everybody adopting accents or nobody adopting accents, but to mix it up just seems a bit odd.saying that it was still an entertaining film in my opinion, the costumes were nothing short of breathtaking and despite the foolishness of Marie Antionettes actions, you do end up feeling sorry for her toward the end.You'll enjoy this film providing you don't take it to seriously",Marie Antoinette
235,carmi47-1,"Lush Budget, yes; History, no way",3,15 May 2015,"Few women have been so poorly served by historians or film makers as Marie Antoinette. Marie's life has become a clothes peg on which successive biographers & directors hang what they please. The 1942 Norma Shearer film misrepresents Marie as a high-minded queen, nobly dedicated to the subjects who showed their appreciation by killing her. (Based on a biography by Stefan Zweig, the film could not address Zweig's explicitly sexual theory for Louis XVI's failure to consummate his marriage for 7 years.) The 1956 French film ""Marie Antoinette,"" with Michele Morgan, lacks analysis or explanation for what happens. ""L'Autrichenne,"" with Ute Lemper, re-enacts the queen's trial; the dialog, from the trial records, is of scant interest. The best film to date is ""Farewell, My Queen,"" a dramatization of events at Versailles in the days after the fall of the Bastille in July 1789. The ease with which Marie's attention wandered is made obvious, & the undereducated queen's failure to grasp what was happening around her offers the real explanation for the blundering that led her to the scaffold in 1793.Sofia Coppola's films have been noted for a lack of character development & a preferential focus on atmosphere. ""Marie Antoinette"" bears out that observation in spades. Whatever chances to deal with the evolution of Marie's character after the Revolution's outbreak vanished with Coppola's decision to end the film with the royal family's departure from Versailles in October 1789. It is the one general truth shared by all historians that Marie achieved nobility of character only in the last months of her life, after Louis XVI's death in January 1793 and before her death 10 months later. Coppola evades precisely that period of Marie's life, and shows us only the whipped-cream years at Versailles. It isn't at all clear what we're supposed to take from this treatment. Marie, played with a limp if sweet rag-doll complacency by a nearly expressionless Kirsten Dunst, is sent aged 14 to marry the doltish heir to the French throne. This would never have happened had not Marie's older sister, destined for the King of Naples, died of smallpox. Their mother, Empress Maria Theresa, had to advance her 2 youngest daughters, the elder of whom went to Naples. Marie, the youngest, was moved to the square of the Habsburg chessboard originally meant for the new Queen of Naples, and went to Versailles. It was never foreseen that she would marry the future King of France, so she had been left uneducated for her lot in life.From a court that placed less value on formality than did Versailles, Marie disliked Versailles from the get-go. Formality is represented by the Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis, in an effective if overdone performance), who presides over the daily ordeal whereby Marie has to dress, from the skin out, before courtiers. Dunst manages to convey the real Marie's irritation at this duty but, eager as ever to obey as her mother told her to do, goes with the program. She eats in public with her husband, and properly attends the delivery of her sister-in-law, though it causes her anguish since she herself has not yet had a child.Coppola's hold on facts is slim. The sister-in-law who has that baby was the Comtesse d'Artois, but the film makes her the Comtesse de Provence, who was childless. We see 2 of Louis XVI's spinster aunts, Victoire and Sophie, but there were 3--the eldest, Adelaide, was the dominant one, & the real troublemaker who set Marie against Louis XV's mistress, du Barry. Marie had 4 live born children,of whom 2 died before the Revolution; we get 3 here, and only 1 dies.The acting is largely bland if not lackluster, seemingly in keeping with Dunst's blankly smiling efforts to be charming. Marie is largely controlled, or directed, by more assertive types, particularly Madame de Polignac. Much of what we see Marie do in this film shows her trying to meet others' expectations, not her own wishes; were it not for her brother Emperor Joseph's visit to Versailles in 1777, during which he lectured Marie and Louis XVI on the lack of activity in the royal bed, she probably never would have had a child. Coppola is evidently trying for humor by staging Joseph's lecture to Louis at Versailles' zoo, where a bull elephant gives a good imitation of the male human anatomy as Joseph explains how things are supposed to work. The image is too obvious and heavy-handed to work. The same is true of sequences showing ladies of Versailles learning to snort snuff (standing in for a substance snorted today), or passing around a tobacco pipe (standing in for something smoked today that is often passed around). This silliness reaches a climax with the notorious shot of Converse high-tops glimpsed during a sequence in which Marie and her friends sort through a selection of new clothing, asking ""Can we get this in pink?""Coppola was evidently trying to make Marie accessible, or relevant, by implying that she was like a modern teenager, obsessed with new clothes and hairstyles and experimenting with ""snuff"" and ""pipe tobacco."" Hogwash. There can be no valid comparison between an 18th-century princess and a teenager today. To begin with, today's teenage girls are, we hope, more concerned with ways to avoid pregnancy. In Marie's milieu, young girls were traded among kingdoms to serve as wombs, and throughout this film we see Marie constantly badgered to produce a male heir for her husband. At least Coppola didn't try to work smart phones or MP3s into this film.The one redeeming point is that Copolla was allowed to film extensively in the palace of Versailles, at the Petit Trianon and its adjacent village, so we have some sense of how Marie lived there. But that was only a part of this tragic woman's life, which is ill served by Coppola's essentially meaningless presentation.",Marie Antoinette
236,sofiastahl-72122,Sofia and Lance Acord make something beautiful together,10,20 March 2017,"This movie might upset people who dig in to this movie of historical intentions but that is not what you should look for when you watch this beautifully shot movie. Lance Acord who has worked with Coppola on her debut short ""Lick the star"" (1998) and her Oscar winning ""Lost in translation"" (2004) make a beautiful movie together. The costumes, the scenery, the light, the photography - wonderful, mesmerizing. This film is more like visionary poetry than historical. When you watch a Sofia Coppola movie you should now her thin dialogue because she wants the pictures to tell you a story than words. I can't praise this movie enough it's so wonderful and I like how she had silent scenes where you her the sound of nature instead of music and I also like how she used modern music instead of classical music of Antoniettes time which gave the movie a very nice, atmospheric edge to it. Visual poetry is what this movie is all about!",Marie Antoinette
237,fruitbat319,so many shoes!...but considerably less story,5,18 February 2007,"Director Sofia Coppola certainly didn't scrimp on the visuals in this movie. The costumes and the settings are sumptuous, and, being secretly a girl who loves fancy fluffy dresses and dainty shoes and all that crap, I was definitely taken with the decadence of this film. It's a great movie for getting tipsy and eating cake with the girlfriends, but I'm afraid as far as the actual story goes, there is something lacking.While careful attention was indeed applied to the visual aspect of the film, most notably in a ""fantasy"" scene, where Marie Antoinette, in the black lipstick of an evil queen, utters the notorious ""Let them eat cake"" line, and in some of the scenery at her country home, not as much attention was paid to the structure of the story. The movie centers on Marie's adjustment to her new home in a foreign country, and her naivety, the latter causing her to spend lavishly while her new subjects starve. The main problem, however, is that Coppola assumes you already know the story of the French Revolution and the final fates of the royal family--none of which is shown in the film. The angry mob that confronts the royal family at Versailles comes seemingly out of nowhere. More attention to the country's affairs would have helped the plot seem more complete.Marie's innocence to the poverty and civil unrest is also somewhat dubious. You'd think she'd have SOME idea of what was going on around her, even if she maybe wasn't completely on top of things. It's ultimately a movie about a girl who just wanted to have fun, a feature-length excuse for indulgence, and Marie is shown as the epitome of the poor little rich girl.",Marie Antoinette
238,two-cents,Bad casting ruined what could have been an interesting film,3,17 October 2006,"This movie could have achieved treating Marie Antoinette as a tragic figure in history had the casting been better. Marie Antoinette was 14 years old when she was cold heartedly shipped off to France, but Kirstin Dunst-already in her 20's, trying to project the inner feelings of a 14 year old just wasn't credible. Franco Zefferelli made film history when he cast two 14 year olds as Romeo & Juliet. They gave what felt like the authentic aura of their youth. Kirstin Dunst, a veteran actress since she was a child, absolutely did not project that innocence or youthfulness, or loneliness particular to adolescents. Hence, from the get-go, Marie A. is not a terribly sympathetic character. And as the movie progresses, and Marie Antoinette's situation of being sheltered, spoiled, bored, sexually rejected, etc. she is still not a sympathetic character, because we don't feel the character of a child scarred early in life. (by being taken from her home to a foreign culture, etc) Jason Schwarzman was also a terrible choice for Louis XVI. He was simply too goofy, and his sexuality made no sense as it was portrayed in the movie. Overall, a better cast of actors (and better performances) could have saved this movie, as there was a slow moving plot, but if the characters are not believable, then the movie is lost.",Marie Antoinette

I am not surprised it was booed in Cannes, since it's patently American.That said, it was generally fun to watch and marie antoinette's story was credible.",Marie Antoinette

241,jaijaijai73,Self indulgently inept to the point of self parody,1,28 December 2006,"One of the worst movies of all time. What the hell was Coppola thinking? Her artistic license should be suspended, if not revoked...So about the film- It's a disaster. From the black credits which metaphorically convey the total absence of virtue to be found in this turkey to the anticlimactic ending (Spoiler: we don't get to see Marie Antoinette put to death, which by the first hour was all I had to look forward to) this thing reeks. Hmm... A period piece in which the sets and costumes look sort of versailles-ish, (including Versailles itself) but the mannerisms, plot, and dialogue (not to mention the atrocious mix of bizarre accents) all seem strangely disjointed in time, space... and meaning. Hmm. There's a sort of New Wave soundtrack and title fonts, apropos of nothing. Hmm. Manolo Blahnik shoes. Hmm. And for all you reviewers who said this film is ""beautiful""- You probably think that a cheap grocery store wedding cake is delicious, too. This film is the visual equivalent of that cheap, overly-frosted and -decorated cake: yes, there are plenty of sugary pastel details, but that doesn't make for quality, in film or pastry. And the performances- Dunst is alright until she moves or, worse yet, speaks. Her finest work is clearly in the tent towards the beginning of the film, during her transition from Austria to France... She does convey the idea that Antoinette was vapid, and if that's what she was shooting for, she succeeds. Schwartzman looks anesthetized through the whole thing, mumbling his few lines with a stunned flatness befitting the dullness of the overall piece, but doing nothing to immerse the viewer in whatever the film was supposed to be about. What's the opposite of chemistry? That's what Dunst and Schwartzman have on screen together. Rip Torn adds a bit of leering lechery, but can't do much to help this floundering flick. The sparkling brilliance and danger of the real Versailles is absent entirely, along with any other vestige of historical reality, intelligence or wit. This movie might have been interesting if it had been more of a serious period piece or if it had been a surrealistic punk rock romp through an alternate universe of Versailles as dreamed by a dumb, spoiled little American girl, which Coppola, Dunst, et al, might actually have been able to pull off. Instead, it's an awkward, deadly dull and bloated exercise in pure pointless self indulgence in a way that even Versailles itself never was. It simply doesn't work at all. Technically, it's crap, from the awful cinematography to the wretched editing (many obvious and glaring errors- boom mikes, continuity, etc) all driven by the seeming absence of a script or anything to move the plot (such as it is) along. The awful fake ""sunset""- what _was_ up with that? All the scenes seem to take four times longer than they need to, which makes it all the more painful. This film takes an interesting historical character who lived at an amazingly dynamic time in history, and manages to render person, place, and time deadly dull. It was shot at Versailles, yet plays on screen as flat and claustrophobic rather than opulent and expansive. Politically, we are asked to identify with the symbol of a failed, corrupt monarchy, basically because she's cute and nonthreatening. Which brings up the one interesting point about this shipwreck: Perhaps in its flatulent excess, this ""film"" somehow heralds a coming artistic revolution. After this, perhaps the peasants will storm the gates of the major studios, screaming for real creative bread. Or maybe we'll all just post on YouTube and quit wasting our money on studio garbage like this. Perhaps Sophia Coppola, and Kirsten Dunst along with her, will become the new Maries Antoinette of a new revolution in film and in art. Vive la revolution!",Marie Antoinette

Aside from the wonderful Versailles background and the lavish costumes, there is absolutely nothing interesting about this movie. The dialog is insipid, the shots repetitive and overly long, and the acting - particularly that of Kirsten Dunst and Molly Shannon - was so uninspired as to be considered bad. Nothing in the movie seemed authentically French, as the court of Versailles seemed simply to be composed of a group of gossipy Americans with bad table manners and too much idle time. There was so little historical context that the gravity of the situation (Marie Antoinette not producing an heir) was not apparent and the lack of conjugal relations between Louis and his wife, instead, seemed laughable. In short, the French would not act this way, eat this way, talk this way and it is easy to see why this movie was so poorly received in France and at the Cannes film festival.",Marie Antoinette

244,Judith333,Missed Opportunity for Creating an Interesting Satire,3,19 July 2010,"I think if Coppola had been conscious of making a satire of modern, vapid, bored Hollywood royalty, then this could have been a great film, almost a Buñuelian effort. But as it is, her inability to judge her characters, or to comment on their lifestyle and politics, makes this not only a bad film, but an offensive film. Her comment in an interview sums up her attitude: ""I was reading Antonia Fraser's biography, and I found out that Marie Antoinette was just a lonely, misunderstood teenager when she came to Versailles!"" To recognize the parallel between her own life and Marie Antoinette's is interesting. To fail to draw any conclusions about what that life means is a failure of imagination and intelligence. All I could really get from it was that it's fun to live in a palace and to have pretty cakes and clothes. Such a premise could actually make for an interesting art film that flouts history, but it doesn't work on this level, partly because it was made as a straight historical biography rather than as a personal art piece.",Marie Antoinette

The trailer shows Marie living the life of royalty. Lather, rinse, repeat. Everyday is the same. They eat. They play. They Gossip. They suck! OK. I get it after 15-20 minutes of that. But like a little pink bunny, it keeps going on and on and on. I kept expecting Marie to shake things up. At one point she kind of does by clapping at an opera when you are not supposed to. Everyone does to. OK Change. I kept waiting and waiting. Yet nothing more happens. I'm sure it was realistic, but come on. You don't make movies about boring people! Don't make a movie about me unless you plan to dramatize the hell out of it. Then when you've sat and watched and watched and watched these rich snooty people go on and on you think ""OK the payoff is the revolution. We get to see these heads roll"". Sorry Charilie. That might have saved the movie. Instead we get to only see the boring parts of her life. Then it ends. UGH!",Marie Antoinette

247,jim_gill,Let's gloss over the important bits of the actual story...,3,19 October 2017,"With a backdrop of the French Revolution, this film had the potential to be something great. It was not. Although FAIRLY accurate, for the most part, I can't help but wonder how Sofia Coppola managed to make this film ramble on for over two hours and never touch on the politics that lead to the Bourbon downfall. No mention of Antionette passing military secrets to the Austrians; no mention of their coversion to a constitutional monarchy or their house arrest in Paris. no mention of their attempted escape to Austria or their capture. No mention of their trial and eventual execution; or the allegations of incest - all of these things could have been used to make the film so much more poignant but it was clearly made by someone who just thought it was 'romantic', so glossed over the most important parts of the story - in favour of showing some dappy bint going to parties and getting her hair done. Also, considering the time and money they'd obviously spent making this, you'd have thought they'd have used an appropriate soundtrack too. No, they decided that contemporary pop/rock music best represented revolutionary France... really? Such a good opportunity wasted.",Marie Antoinette
248,DVLefferts,An affecting portrait of an 18th century Paris Hilton,10,28 October 2006,"We all know the story: Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI. Social brat, rich, politically unaware, spoiled little girl. I'd thought this movie would offer some new revelations into Antoinette's life, but, for the most part, it didn't. Which is to compliment the movie. What the movie does succeed in doing is pulling sympathy out of the viewer. We come to know Antoinette as pure and rather innocent, guilted by the very people in government for not being aware of France's misery that had sheltered her away from it in the first place.The very last shot of the movie epitomized this tragedy, and also the tragedy of the end of monarchic France. (Those who have seen the film won't be able to forget this shot.) It is a still shot of the chandelier of Antoinette's bedroom, on the floor, shattered. I don't have time or room here to explain all of the things this shattered chandelier means. But it sums up a lot: France's ruined glory, Antoinette's ruined innocence, the end of the king and queen, the end of their parties and misters and mistresses, the end of it all. It is a heart-wrenching, Ishiguro-esquire ending. And it makes the movie, despite the film's errors of cinematography and context development, very worth-seeing.",Marie Antoinette
249,rosie_smash,Pointless,2,20 October 2006,"So, I tried to go into this film with an open mind. I was already biased against it because I really didn't like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for MA was terrifyingly bad. However, it was getting good reviews and I saw a clip on Jon Stewart that made me think it might not be that bad. Well, the clip was good, but that was about it. So, let us go through piece by piece and say why this film just did not work.Acting: Terrible. Awful. With the exception of Steve Coogan and Rose Byrne all the acting was dreadful. I quite like Kirsten Dunst, but she just couldn't make me care at all for her character. Jason Schwartzman - who I have also liked in other films was a complete mess. I am still trying to figure out how he was trying to play the king. Was he a confused teenager or did he have some kind of mental disorder? Yeesh.Also, the accents were very jarring. Sometimes it can work when all the characters have accents that they are not supposed to have. Coppola said that Amadeus was an inspiration for her. That film worked despite all the historical inaccuracies because it had a good script . . . which leads us to . . .Script: Ummm, was there one? If there was, it was about 5 pages long. And it was there to serve as a bit of narrative to let the audience know that things were bad in MA's marriage. There must have been about 5 letters from her mother telling her that she had to have an heir. This was pointless after the first letter and was maybe supposed to raise tension . . . except it just got really repetitive and annoying. The person with the most lines was probably Steve Coogan, and his lines were mostly exposition. ""Oh, Your Majesty, you might not want to buy another pair of shoes because the people have no food and are starting to turn against you."" Very poorly written, wooden dialogue, except for some scenes that seemed as though the actors were just ad-libbing, which would make sense considering the script was so bad.Plotting in general: This film basically serves as a 2 hour advertisement for the Shopping Network, and a travelogue for France. The opulence is well filmed, you leave with images of the dresses etc. in your mind, and to give Coppola credit, she does beautiful scenery shots, but in the end, all you have witnessed is 2 hours of vapid shallow self-indulgence that really does no justice to the social setting. Without showing the audience the conditions that the poor lived in, we don't care that MA lives in luxury. It just looks neat. I guess that's what it boils down to: You just don't care. The funny thing is, the person I saw this with knew nothing about that time in history, and she was all excited because Coppola kept insisting that it was not going to be a history lesson, but rather really accessible for ""young people"" - don't even get me started on how insulting that is to said ""young people"" - but I had to explain practically everything to her after the film because the politics and social aspect are given so little time that if you didn't have any idea of the history you would be completely lost and - again - not care. I don't care about anachronisms and I'm not a purist - like I said, I liked Amadeus a lot - but with a film in a historical setting more than 10 minutes explanation is required for some people. The only thing that did bother me was the implication that the American Revolution inspired the French Revolution, when it was the other way around. That's just historically important.So, I guess that's it. 2 hours of characters you don't care about doing things that are in no way put into any context to make them appear wrong . . . so you don't care. What a waste of a great historical story, usually good actors, and honestly, cinema in general.",Marie Antoinette

The fact that Judy Davis, my favorite living actress, is in it helped. But what a waste.I guess Judy needs to work like everyone else, and this is the kind of high profile project that keeps her profile high among the Tinseltown movers and shakers who won't be honest with Sofia Coppola about what a turkey she's made.All the PR guff about the costumes and the production design made on a limited budget.

252,jkindeep,Much ado about nothing.. The soft porn of french history,4,29 October 2006,"I happened to be in Paris, and I was in Versilles on the same day I saw the movie. It was full of French poured into my mind. Also a friend I was in the cinema together was a french intellectual who very much in love with his own cultural majestic standards. So I went to see the movie with full of enthusiasm.I never seen any of Sofia's film before, I haven't seen the 'Lost in translation' as I was little skeptical about her portrayal of Japanese culture from European oriented view. no objection, also I assume that she is very much into the crash between two culture, so the theme is a continuum from her previous movies.It has the same elements, Marie is came from Austria to France, her provocative characters are crashed into the very cold and cynical French tradition, the isolated being as shown in the 'Lost in translation'. She was hatred and chewed by public in a very wrongful matter. So here comes justice from Sofia, she set Marie as an eccentric, artistic frontier who as an obviously misunderstood individual.The movie follow the style of Baz Luhmna's Romio and Juliette, modern adaptation of old history, there were modern soundtrack rather than classics, also the dialogs are quite modern,humorous, cheeky and fierce.It is soft porn, nothing really a new in the movie, colors are vibrant, music is funky, camera rolls fast but what's new in the movie is what's lack in the movie. More like a teenage movie version of French history. Remember, how 'Queen Margot' was a magnificent movie with full of emotional and inter-wined turmoil of the history and individual? The film might be 'enjoyable' as pop song, but you won't be listening again in years later. Its not a must see movie, but if you are light-hearted, and sick of watching serious history channel, then go for it. Also a bonus, they not speak French, they speak English. If That's what you after, go for the French porn with a touch of American soda pop.",Marie Antoinette

255,thehellhole,"Fluff, puff and a lot of hot air",3,4 November 2006,"Compared to Sofia Coppolas previous efforts, this film is a disaster of historical proportions. It's not a totally bad movie but it lacks depth and heart. At times it feels like an unwanted child, because it didn't turn out the way everybody imagined.Marie Antoinette has little plot, but unlike the magical Lost in Translation, it creates VERY LITTLE EMOTION. And that's a major flaw. LIT was packed with emotion and you cared about the characters, in Marie Antoinette the people are very shallow. The performances are OK, but nobody gets a chance to shine. The direction by Sofia Coppola creates no contrasts, no real drama, no dialog and no great acting moments. It's like entering a beautiful room, sitting on a beautiful chair and staring at the wall for a couple of minutes.There are a handful of really good sequences like a ladybug flying away or the scene with the elephant in the park, but the rest is a waste of time and money. And that's a darn shame, because it could have been good.This movie has no real concept. It's meant to be punky and fresh but it isn't. It's not consequent enough. Neither is the film dreamy like the Virgin Suicides. Showing the sunlight breaking through the trees and people rolling in the grass or falling into bed is not very surprising if you use these tricks in every movie.The use of 70ies and 80ies rock music in this biopic is OK, too, but it delivers not the same emotional impact like the songs in LIT or the dreamy soundtrack in Virgin Suicides.I watched this movie on opening day, the theater was only half-full and the people that sat around me reacted negatively when the film ended. It just didn't work. I had a lot of info beforehand, so the situation was not surprising to me at all but I have to admit that three questions popped in my mind after leaving the theater: Who the hell directed Lost in Translation? Is Sofia Coppola a fraud? Why is there so much nepotism?Just think about LIT with different leads, like David Hasselhoff and Paris Hilton for example. Would the story stand the test of time? I give three stars for Marie Antoinette: One star for Milena Canonero, who will win another Oscar for her costumes. The second star for the brave decision to use modern music. The third star for the location, the Palace of Versailles.",Marie Antoinette

Note: Used to.I watched this with my best friend, and we were hysterical at parts... not because the movie actually has any comedy, but because of the stupid things that happened. Like when, I think the second night they're in bed, and she starts hugging Louis and he just pats her hand... we couldn't get over that.It also seems historically lacking... I mean they didn't show anything about how Marie-Antoinette and Louis XIV did the decapitation and stuff, and that's supposedly what they're famous for.Also... I had a hard time believing 24-year-old Kirsten Dunst was a 14-year-old...And the scene when she supposedly breaks down... we wear hysterical from the falseness of it...So yeah, I didn't really like this movie...

258,ginger_the_Wolf,One of the best films of the year.,9,20 October 2006,"Significantly better than I expected, this is not the best film of the year but still one of my favourites. Beautifully shot, it captures the futility of the Versailles court. However, it doesn't lampoon Antoinette herself, and I would say Dunst and her portrayal represent more than just the Queen of France, but a reflection of a generation of women lost in a world of glamour and disappointment. A revisionist portrayal of Marie Antoinette's life from the time of her arrival in France, until her arrest during the French revolution.In all honesty, I didn't much enjoy Lost in Translation, and not having seen The Virgin Suicides I suddenly see what people appreciate in her direction. She humanizes and exposes Marie Antoinette in all her mystery, as one of the most notorious historical figures of perhaps all times. Right from the beginning we realize she is under constant watch and scrutiny. The innocent young teenager who arrives in France is shunned and critised for everything she does or doesn't do. In one scene, where she is being dressed Antoinette stands there naked as the ridiculous rules of the court make for a few uncomfortable minutes where the responsibility shifts from person to person to dress her as someone of higher rank continually enters the room. There is no privacy for her, and the subject of her sex life or lack thereof is openly discussed among all members of the court. She walks down the hall and hears these fragmented conversations about her inadequacy although behind closed doors we know it's not her fault. Marie Antoinette is never even afforded friendship, those she associates with talk behind her back just like the rest and call her ""that Austrian girl"". Not equipped to deal with this, Antoinette turns to escapism and excess. I honestly really felt incredible sympathy for her throughout the entire film. She was lost in a world she wasn't ready for, but when she was forced to be strong she was. This has to be Dunst's best performance, I was incredibly surprised. She goes from child, to outcast, to escapist, to mother and it ends with her as a real Queen. All these changes are felt more through her performance than anything else, after becoming a mother we feel this incredible change in her demeanor and attitude, and the final tumultuous act this new determination and dedication as a failed monarch.Coppola effectively captures Marie Antoinette's existence and especially her loneliness with her skillful direction. There is so much distance between herself and the world of the court and the world around her. There are many shots of her in these enormous rooms or corridors all alone, or separated from the group. She's framed and trapped by doorways, and there is at least in the first half an almost constant overlay of dialog and criticism that floats around as the backdrop for almost every scene. It's easy to not even notice most of it as it is so constant. Versailles itself is so excessive, surreal, and large it's a world on it's own. It's like it's own isolated country that doesn't need the outside world, it lives by it's own rules (90% of them ridiculous formality), we see why the monarchy was able to get caught up with themselves while forgetting the plights of the people. Sound and image are tied up with the defining of this film and what it stands for.The use of modern music is heavily critised, but I think I have to agree with Ebert on this one, he says it best: ""Coppola has been criticized in some circles for her use of a contemporary pop overlay -- hit songs, incongruous dialog, jarring intrusions of the Now upon the Then. But no one ever lives as Then; it is always Now. Many characters in historical films seem somehow aware that they are living in the past. Marie seems to think she is a teenager living in the present, which of course she is -- and the contemporary pop references invite the audience to share her present with ours. Forman's ""Amadeus"" had a little of that, with its purple wigs."" Okay... I wasn't able to explain properly why I think this film is so good. To me, it captures as much Marie Antoinette as it does ""the female existence"", if such a thing can be defined. I think this film's worth will be appreciated over time, at least by members of my own generation whose life of futility, loneliness and boredom is reflected so perfectly on the screen. Maturity and meaning will come, but it's not there yet. This film is also stunningly beautiful, the costumes, makeup, cinematography is amazing.",Marie Antoinette
259,Hertsmere,Utterly Useless,1,20 October 2006,"Words fail me in how to describe the sheer charabanc banality of this movie.For the historically minded, Marie Antoinette played a pivotal role in stirring up anti-monarchical sentiment in France mainly because of her frivolity, arrogance, disregard for court etiquette and protocol. Her inability to produce an heir was caused by the non-consummation of the marriage for the first seven years of her wedded life. These points are brought out in the film, in such an anodyne way, that the viewer is not aware of their importance other than that of Marie Antoinette's failure to produce a baby turned the French people against her.Coppola obviously views Marie Antoinette as a feminist icon and wants to make the statement that women should not be regarded as baby producing machines.The real life Marie Antoinette sought solace and comfort from her unconsummated and loveless marriage by taking both male and female lovers. There is not a hint of her sexual frustration in the film. These scenes should have been shot and included in the film so as not to titillate the audience but to illustrate how Marie Antoinette's crass behaviour succeeded in scandalising and alienating, not just the French Court, but also the French people. All that is shown in the film is just one adulterous affair with a Swedish nobleman. Coppola misses the opportunity to show that Marie Antoinette grew to love her husband during the course of their marriage and that she matured considerably, as a woman, after she became a mother.Coppola entirely neglects to show the emotional and psychological development of Marie Antoinette. In the film, Coppola's Marie Antoinette is as much a teen brat at the end of the film as she was at the beginning though Coppola does give Marie Antoinette, at the end of the film, the pathos to predict that she is saying goodbye to her home and the sad, foreboding realisation that she will never return.Coppola has whitewashed the life of Marie Antoinette to suit her own prejudices. Nothing is allowed to detract from the image of Marie Antoinette as the troubled teen set upon by an unsympathetic Court. The more one watches the film, the more one realises that Coppola had projected the character of Princess Diana into the script when she set about writing her character of Marie Antoinette. No one should ever be surprised if Coppola does, indeed, make a film on the life of Princess Diana, in the future.What is not brought out is the historical context, Marie Antoinette playing at being a shepherdess with scented sheep while French peasants toiled and endured under the worst droughts of the 18th Century. There is no scene to show that the luxury of French Court life was paid for by millions of poverty stricken French peasants.This film could best be entitled - ""Scenes from a Life of Indolence"" since what is shown, is so inconsequential and trite, such as Marie Antoinette in the bath, in bed with her clock loving husband, enduring the embarrassment of court gossip at not being pregnant.Yet Marie Antoinette, played by the punkish Kirsten Dunst, remains a remote, cold figure. The viewer does not warm to her. She is simply not likable. The viewer simply does have anything to care enough about her. Sofia Coppola, the writer and director of this execrable piece, lists as her credits, or rather, to her shame, that she wrote the script. Kirsten Dunst scarcely, says sentences of more than a dozen words. The film is notable for its lack of conversation, instead, the viewer is supposed to be satisfied with scene after scene of pretty settings.Coppola has committed the cardinal Hollywood sin of believing that special effects will make up for plot, or indeed, dialogue. Coppola, being a Hollywood princess, undoubtedly, felt an affinity for the doomed French Queen and sought to make her ""relevant"" to a modern teen audience. She attempts to do this by playing modern American pop songs in 18th Century French settings. Never mind the lapses in historical veracity, viewers find, for instance, that Marie Antoinette spoke with an American accent, or even good taste,the aim is to show Marie Antoinette as a misunderstood teen who rebelled against the constrictions of court life.The film is structurally weak, being episodic, in character, of scenes from the life of Marie Antoinette with no connection to contemporary French events. There is no attempt to explore why the French people hated her so much. How on Earth did Coppola ever think that she could make a film about Marie Antoinette and ignore critical events such as the Affair of the Necklace ? - an event that destroyed Marie Antoinette's credibility with the French people - and yet, Coppola achieves it. It is like making a film about President Nixon and not mentioning Watergate.Having filled the film with pap, Coppola suddenly finds that she has no time left to show the crucial events of Marie Antoinette's life - the Revolution, the flight to Varennes, the deposition of the monarchy, the execution of her husband and her own trial and execution.The film is utterly useless to anyone who wishes to learn anything about Marie Antoinette's life.No wonder Coppola fled when the audience at the Cannes Film Festival booed at the premiere of the film.This film is a disgrace.The viewer is urged to watch instead Van Dyke's superb 1938 production of ""Marie Antoinette"", starring the incomparable Norma Shearer, for a thrilling account of Marie Antoinette's life and Shyer's 2001 production of ""The Affair of the Necklace"", starring Hilary Swank, for a dramatic account of the event that was to lead to the downfall of Marie Antoinette, as well as Scola's 1982 production of ""La Nuit de Varennes"", starring Harvey Keitel, for an absorbing account of the flight to Varennes.Avoid Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" like the plague.",Marie Antoinette

Total disgust. The plot slows down to show the ennui of the palace life and probably distorts it as well.

261,jackboot,"Across the board, an abject, dismal failure. Stinker.",1,19 August 2010,"I read some remarks by Sofia Copola, regarding Marie Antoinette and her impetus for wanting to make this film. Finally got around to seeing it. Oy, what a stinker.""My biggest fear was making a 'Masterpiece Theatre' kind of movie. I didn't want to make a dry, historical period movie with the distant, cold tableau of shots. It was very important to me to tell the story in my own way. In the same way as I wanted LOST IN TRANSLATION to feel like you had just spent a couple of hours in Tokyo, I wanted this film to let the audience feel what it might be like to be in Versailles during that time and to really get lost in that world."" In this one stated goal of Ms. Copola's, I never had a ghost of a chance to feel like was anywhere near that world, the world of Versailles at that time. I was prevented from any possibility of entering that deliciously inviting world by a production that missed the mark in just about every possible way.The gawd-awful contemporary popular rock music really makes it hard to feel anything relating to the 18c period. The songs were all VERY recognizable songs that commanded my attention, relegating the visual component of the film into a music video. Composers of film scores throughout the ages, and up to the present, use the very powerful tool of music to guide the audience's feelings and emotional response to the images on film. Ms. Copola has subjugated her role as director to making servile accompaniments to workmanlike rock music.The costumes and hair were looking awfully shoddy. I mean to say that they looked nice, but they came nowhere near what is depicted of Marie Antoinette and other ladies of the court of Versailles in paintings and even other films. The high water mark for costumes, certainly for 18c French Royalty will have to remain with the 1938 version of Marie Antoinette, directed by Woody Van Dyke.The casting was disappointing. If this film is supposed to ape the populist appeal of The Knight's Tale, then, it should be a lite enough effort with a young enough cast and a cursory and superficial gesture at costuming and settings to satisfy the 12 - 18 year old demographic whom will flock to this picture. Kirsten Dunst just does not look like anything other than a vivacious teenager. Marie Antoinette became queen at age nineteen, but she continued to sit as queen until her untimely death, just before her thirty-eighth birthday. Jason Schwartzman as a French noble who would be king? That's a stretch that is too hard to fathom.The script was the final insult with dialogue written as though it were excerpted from any garden variety contemporary sit-com, with bad grammar, extremely casual and dumbed-down lexicon and sarcastic wisecracking. There was no hope for my being able to suspend disbelief even for a moment and buying into Sofia Copola's jejune effort at making a historical biopic with that kind of bad writing.This film is a complete failure, but if it piques the imagination of young people enough to inspire them to learn a little more about the history of this time period and some of the principal characters in the story (which is FASCINATING! it's well worth the time and energy!!), then, it's not a completely wasted effort. But, as a film to be judged upon its own merits, this lame outing clearly demonstrates why contemporary American cinema is to be largely dismissed as garbage. See the 1938 version of Marie Antoinette starring Norma Shearer, it too is flawed, but it will at least give you a more realistic depiction of life then and there.",Marie Antoinette

Marianne Faithful gave a good performance as Maria Theresa and Asia Argento was also great as the slutty Madame DuBarry. I could go on for hours about how much I loved this movie.

263,jazzontherocks,A ball full of royalty fun,9,10 January 2007,"For a film that revolves around a well-known figure in historical records, Marie Antoinette does deliver a sense of uniqueness. Now we've read a large number of negative critics surrounding Sofia Coppola's newest project on the media, including the fact that it flopped in its Cannes premiere. I thought it was going to be just another biography film. But as a die-hard moviegoer, I never let any review drag me away from seeing a film. So I did give this movie a go when it was screened in the cinema as part of the 8th Jakarta International Film Festival. Guess what? It was stylistically done that it became a personal favorite! So everyone knew about the youngest queen in the history of France who drowned herself in a world of luxurious living and who later committed a crime of treason, which then led to her execution and the downfall of Versailles. This is a re-telling of her life story with a refreshing take. While many critics are not satisfied with the dense plot of the film, I think I understand Coppola's vision. Yes, the movie may not be the best one of 2006. It lacks historical and political perspectives, which are crucial elements that provide strong background information about that era. Yet I believe it wasn't what the director intended to do. All she wanted was to show the main character from a personal point of view, which is why the Antoinette portrayed in the film resembles a typical young woman who enjoys what life has offered her and sometimes she loses track in its complexities, leading her into the world of gambling, drinking and affairs which are incontrollable. This makes her more humane and close enough to real life.While there's more to be told after Louis XVI, Marie and their children left the house, I guess this is for the message to be clearly conveyed: that you can lose everything you possess if you can't take control of them. In addition, the reason is probably to show the story from a lighter side while getting rid of the darker thematic elements.It may seem silly to historians who demand a serious, accurate depiction of the main character. But accuracy is way beyond the filmmakers' mind while making the movie, and what's left is a unique interpretation of Antoinette. Combined with Kirsten Dunst's all-out performance, a series of rocking 80's music and vintage props, what could possibly go wrong? It's actually an interesting cross-over.Yes, this is like an over-the-top French biographical film with a Hollywood twist. Weak screenplay? A lot of people said so. But sometimes we forget there's more to a movie besides the story. Pay attention to the brilliant, colorful cinematography, music video-like angles and fancy costumes. What you get is a total gem and a ball full of royalty fun. Oops! Don't forget the yummy cakes, too.",Marie Antoinette
264,songbirdn,Let them eat cake!,8,19 April 2012,"I am absolutely obsessed with this film. Sofia Coppola brilliantly captures Marie Antoinette's true spirit: not as an evil queen, but as a naive and young ruler that doesn't fully know the circumstance her people are in outside the walls of Versailles.Critics seem to have either loved or hated the film, but before you listen to those snubbing the biopic because it ""didn't capture the dark reality of the French Revolution"" or ""Kirsten Dunst was too nice when playing Antoinette"", keep in mind that these are people that really need to study up on their history.First of all, Marie Antoinette never actually said ""let them eat cake"". In Rousseau's book, Confessions, he writes: ""Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: 'Let them eat brioche.'"" But this was written years before Antoinette even arrived in France. I think that Kirsten Dunst really captured Antoinette's sweet, care-free, bohemian spirit, and she was perfectly cast in the role.Second, this film is NOT about the French Revolution. It's about the life of Marie Antoinette. Was the revolution dark, bloody, and horrific? Absolutely. But Antoinette was never exposed to the harsh world of the rebellion until the very end of her life. This is essentially the entire point of the film-to show that Antoinette was not evil, just misunderstood. She wasn't really aware of the poverty in France and when critics say that the film was too fluffy and not dark enough, they should know that that's exactly what her life was like. With that said, this film was also amazing not just because of the great script but for several other reasons:1) The acting was perfect. As an actress, I found the honesty in each actor's performance to be real and thoughtful, and Dunst truly ""ruled"" as the title role. Other favorites of mine include Rose Byrne, who played the Duchesse de Polignac, the silly, outgoing, and often tipsy friend of Antoinette. She was funny and charming. I also enjoyed the performance of Jamie Dornan as Count Axel Fersen, Marie Antoinette's love interest. Overall, the casting was great.2) DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THOSE COSTUMES. One word=gorgeous. Go to Google Images and you'll know what I mean.3) The music was flawless. I loved that Coppola chose to include not only Baroque pieces but also songs from post-punk, New Wave bands from the 80's, as well as some indie thrown in for good measure. My favorite songs in the movie include ""Natural's Not In It"" by Gang of Four, ""What Ever Happened?"" by The Strokes, and ""Kings of the Wild Frontier"" by Adam and the Ants. The only critique I have for the film is that the romance between Marie Antoinette and Count Fersen should have had a bigger part in the film than it did. I would have loved to see more of them together. In addition, the pregnancy conflict (I don't want to write any spoilers so I won't go in depth about this) shouldn't be as long as it was.Other than that, this movie is a must-see. I've seen it at least 10 times and I'll probably be seeing it more. Enjoy!",Marie Antoinette
265,mr-bricoleur,"a misunderstood and wonderful film, notable for far more than its gorgeous imagery",9,18 February 2007,"I think this movie has been sadly misunderstood by many. The story here is told through understatement and silences, much like lost in translation, and those who need the action to be explained through dialog will not enjoy this. Although it is simply a gorgeous movie, this is not the only reason to watch. Another criticism is historical inaccuracy. Although the film is an adaptation of a recent biography of M-A, offering a different take on her character, the real point is the way Coppola uses contemporary pop culture to produce a certain kind of subjective feel. When she shows a dance party she plays New Order which gives a contemporary audience the wild feeling of a dance party that no amount of cinematographic cleverness could convey if the music were accurate period. She uses American style speech to keep us within the characters and focusing on their human qualities. The movie does not focus on politics, nor on the realities outside the palace, and this is not its point. It is a portrait of a foreign teenage girl thrown into the center of one of the most powerful courts in the world, and it is told from her perspective, with all of the inaccuracies and misunderstandings that would naturally produce.Towards the end the pacing does seem to drag oddly, given the mastery of the first 1.5 hours...and there were some gaps in terms of other characters that could have been more developed (especially her friends in the court)...but overall this is a wonderful film, far better than how it was received. M-A is a real, complex, and sympathetic character, trapped in a world that she does not truly fit. Even her famous extravagances make sense here as her only outlet for expression.",Marie Antoinette
266,maryfabuk,Disapppointing.,3,31 March 2008,"Possibly one of the worst films I've seen this year. Unless you have read about Marie Antoinette before seeing this film, there is very little chance you'll know what's going on. All the major events in Marie Antoinette's life were either left out altogether or skimmed over with a slight reference, apart from the revolution obviously. The plot centred mainly on her love for shoes, food and clothes, although the one thing they did get right was the difficulty in consummating the marriage. The actors also made no effort to disguise their American accents, even though the film was set in France and the main characters were all supposed to be French or Austrian, which basically made the film more like a Sunday afternoon mini drama rather than a real cinema-type film. I didn't get a sense of the revolution either, as the main reference to this is Marie Antoinette being seen on a balcony by the 'mob'. It seemed as though one minute she was loved by the people and the next she was hated, with no real explanation as to why. The ending was also very disappointing and I was surprised to see the credits rolling when they did. All in all, I'd give this a miss if you haven't yet seen it.",Marie Antoinette
267,cgriff-3,Directing is NOT genetic!,1,4 January 2008,"Sophia Coppola is further proof Hollywood's fascination with nepotism must end! Sure, she got lucky with Lost in Translation, but really, what did she possibly have to direct with a talent like Bill Murray?Here, she has much younger and inexperienced talent (including her horribly wooden cousin, Jason Schwartzman). A competent director might have gotten better performances, but might have cast his own family with similar results...And the music supervision? Was this an Amy Heckerling flick or a period piece set in 18th Century France? Was Adam Ant on Louis XVIII's iPod? I'm glad the studio lost money on this turd! Maybe they'll leave film making to those with experience, talent, and education, not simply famous names.To whom do I speak about getting my 123 minutes returned?",Marie Antoinette
268,Robston,A long long movie,4,7 November 2006,"Marie Antoinette looks lovely, the music is nostalgic (if you remember the 80's) and the performances from the actors are fine. So why doesn't the movie work? Sofia Coppola takes us into the closeted world of Versailles where people gossip, eat fine food, wear lots of nice clothes and are generally oblivious to any national political activity. And that's about it. If Coppola's intention was to make us feel as if we were in Versailles i.e the routine, the royal protocols, the slow pace of life, then she succeeded. But it makes for a very dull movie indeed. How many times can you show Marie Antoinette choose a new pair of shoes, or a new dress, or the number of times she failed to get her husband interested in making babies! At one point I thought the film was going to last as long as it took Marie Antoinette to conceive her first child (7 years into her marriage). Then in the space of ten minutes the revolution is here and the film is over, no epilogue, no exploration of her time in jail, no head losing.If the purpose of Coppola's film was to show how insulated the people staying at Versailles were, and Marie Antoinette in particular, then she has achieved this. Unfortunately the slow pace of the film coupled with the lack of any emotional involvement with the characters means you will be shouting Vive la Revolution after only an hour.",Marie Antoinette

270,edouard_monpetit,Right on the money at the expense of the audience,7,28 November 2006,"My first reaction after watching Marie Antoinette ... shallow, empty, and annoying. There is little plot or character development. Scenes are meshed together like an extended music video. The music is redundant and inappropriate (we will come back to it later). Obviously intended for the MTV audience, Marie-Atoinette really tried my patience.However, I can argue that Sofia Coppola was right on the money with that. Marie-Antoinette is most likely to be a 18th century rich party-girl, with all the fixings and cake. Her life was likely to revolve around gossips, shopping, and keeping the royal bloodline. Her life prior to the Revolution was likely to be shielded from the rest of France. On those points, I think the film hits the spot.On top of that, Kirsten Dunst was suited for the role. The lack of dialogue (again, probably true in those days, not much dialogue aside from gossip and the superficial) was made up for with her expressions. The character may appear shallow, Dunst captured every emotional nuance without uttering a word.But in the mean time, Coppola somehow didn't think that the audience would catch that. So she made the most annoying decision. She used ""modern"" music to express M-A's inner thoughts. The film was already very fine without music at all. The introduction of the music made it simply unbearable to watch. This approach was somewhat successful in Knight's Tale (remember the medieval ""We will Rock You""?) because the Ledger/Battney duo were never meant to be taken seriously. Marie-Antoinette was branded as serious drama, and was treated so. The idea just backfired.Finally, after watching Godfather III, I had a feeling that Sofia Coppola was playing herself. Afterall, she accepted the role in very short notice. Without committing libel, I believe this film about Marie Antoinette is a reflection of her personality. I just hope that Sofia didn't have the Strokes playing in her head when she was with Spike Jonze.",Marie Antoinette
271,lindfilm-1,An excellent parallel between THEN and NOW.,9,30 December 2006,"'Marie Antoinette' is an amazing accomplishment. It combines visual splendour with a surprisingly economic screenplay. It is CINEMATIC, in the sense that it is not dialogue driven. The images say it all from the wide canvas of grandeur to intimate moments. The film commences with a clear statement via the modern music track. This is not another conventional period piece film about THEN. This is about NOW. This is about a girl with a well meaning character and a fondness for gentle tactile things (like her pet) caught up in a non-tactile cynical world of politics, like a lamb to the slaughter. The rest is history. My point is that the film depicts any one of us living in a time of wealth and self-indulgence and designer labels, while three-quarters of the world are 'have-nots'. It is a surprisingly stylish and non-sensational film (by American standards), focusing on the cocoon life style of any privileged person who postpones the realities awaiting us, coming at our door from the 'have-nots', through no fault of our own, except through our denial of the reality outside our cocoon. Congrats to all involved, especially Kirsten Dunst who held the picture, and the uncompromising quality from the Production Design and Wardrobe departments. I ignored the awkward mix of accents, and applaud the casting of minor characters and extras who conveyed jaded vipers a la francaise.",Marie Antoinette

Audrey Tautou would have been the obvious choice for the lead role. And since when did the French speak English with a Brit accent? Of course, the dialog was so bad, who cares? Now for the ugly: the plot was inane (Marie was NOT a sympathetic character in real life), the acting mediocre, and, really, this movie was a waste of celluloid. Please god, tell these Americans to STOP making bad period-piece films!

273,t.franco,"Good movie, better than I expected. From a MA loyal admirer",8,14 March 2007,"Marie Antoinette (MA) is one of my favorite characters in world history. I have read practically all the biographies and have watched the very few movies made about this tragic Queen. I had not many expectations when I purchased this DVD since I thought it was going to be full of historical errors (like the 1938 movie) and silly clichés as always happens in most US-made movies. But to my surprise, I became engaged with it right from the very beginning. I think Kirsten did a nice and decent job although I wasn't too impressed by the role played by Jason as Louis XVI. I loved the music, the visuals and the auditory elements. Sophie showed us just a small part of MA's life and character, but I liked what I saw. Of course I would have loved to see this movie covering MA during the French revolution; for instance, covering events such as the flight to Varennes, her imprisonment in the Temple Tower and later, in the Consiergerie, and her famous trial and tragic end in the scaffold. Her role in those events was what made MA a legend and immortal, not the frivolous life the movie portrayed. But the movie was good I must say and I would see it again. I gave it a 8.",Marie Antoinette

Many actors on set were frustrated and feeling sick to their stomachs. Bill Murray improves every line in the film and Sofia walks home with an Oscar as best writer. Now she believes in her self so much that out comes this smug effort of self-indulgence. In this one Dunst is as always nothing special and Jason Schwartzman (another son of) should focus on his diet and stay out of films. Even with the giant budget that allowed her to hire top folks in their field. (Again to make the film for her), this film is still too long, too dull, poorly acted and worst of all smug.

A lot of other Coppolas mentioned in the credits...The acting seemed somewhat cartoonish and one dimensional and there seemed to be little character development - Marie and the Dauphin seemed to be doing different things that they were at the beginning of the film but there was little sense that they had changed as people.I don't think I would recommend this film to any of my friends.But I'm happy to watch ""Lost in Translation"" any time!!!

276,janiharp-1,A Very Modern Adaptation of Marie Antoinette,10,1 December 2007,"Marie Antoinette is a historical film based upon the novel and life of the Austrian Queen of France, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), wife of King Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). The young Austrian leaves her home, her family, all her belongings and even her little pug dog. Her mother, the Austrian Duchess Maria Theresa (Marianne Faithful), tells the young Marie Antoinette, ""you may have all the French dogs you want."" Arriving in Paris, Marie Antoinette is escorted to Versailles where she is married and a new life begins. ""Nothing happened,"" King Louis XV (Rip Torn), is informed after their wedding night. After what seemed like a long time, nothing ever happens between the young couple. They are finally attended by a French Doctor. The young Louis has no desire for his beautiful bride. He is impotent. ""He has spent too much time with the stable hand."" It was said. King Louis XV, lies on his death bed and cries. ""I know what I must do."" After much coaxing from the Austrian mother, ""your life in Versailles is not secure until an heir is produced."" The marriage is consummated and three babies are born. I found the film to be disturbing--the guillotine is enough to disturb anyone. Marie Antoinette is blamed for the opulent lifestyle and waste of the French Royalty. At the end, Marie Antoinette sends away all of her mistresses as the revolution has begun. With a bang upon her bedroom door, the officer enters and states to the maids remaining, ""tell the Queen Mother, we can not secure her."" The Queen and King Louis XVI, leave in their carriage.

277,cyanopicacyana,How to ruin a movie with the soundtrack,7,5 July 2008,"As soon as the film started I was immediately shocked by the rock music in the introduction... but OK, I thought it might be to give a dubious message about the time of the movie. But then it continued throughout the whole movie... I'm not against using modern music for historical movies, but not when it is clashes so obviously with the movie ambiance. The worst I saw of the type was Charlie Chaplin's silent movie ""The Gold Rush"", where they put a Polka as a background music for a sad moment in the movie!! OK... here it doesn't go as bad as that, but still is annoying.And it is a pity because the movie is really very interesting and worth seeing.

278,Nycfilmguy84,An Underrated Performance,7,9 November 2006,"Kirsten Dunst's performance is underrated. Her best performance in years.Marie Antoinette is the non-classical, pop culture period costume drama. The risky decision by Coppola to omit the two big historical scenes from the film. If you keep in mind that she consistently makes the film non-classical. In a classical period piece you will see: 1) the storming of Versailles and 2) Queen Marie Antoinette's beheading.While a majority of critics did not like Marie Antoinette I refuse to be too harsh with it. It is neither: one of the 10 best films of the year or one of the worst. A good performance by Dunst, unlike anything in the genre that came before. The poor box office for Marie Antoinette eliminates any serious Oscar contention (if it deserves it or not).A shoo-in for: Costume Design and Art Direction Possible Nominations: Makeup, Cinematography",Marie Antoinette

Here we have yet again a movie with potential but rendered ridiculous from the very title screen. Abhorrence. When will the world learn that fat and water doesn't mix.

Her marriage is awkward, and after the two soon find themselves ruling.It is possible this is the best picture of the year. It was the most beautifully written, most expertly modernized, and the most fantastically directed film I have seen in recent times. Antoinette was like a rockstar, uncaring of the peoples' view of her and almost tragically uncareful. It was stunning. After seeing it, there is nothing but fireworks, large hair, beautiful costumes, and absolutely sensational set design. It was stylized to a point where it was no longer a film about Marie Antoinette. It was a film about the royal lifestyle, a satire on how royalty was a modern day kind of celebrity.I was moved by this film. I have never been so stunned by Kirsten Dunst (except perhaps in Interview with the Vampire). She held her role almost swimmingly. It was one of my favorite performances of the year. Equally fabulous acting was contributed by Jason Schwartzmen.The directing was perfection. It was definitely part of the stylization. The last film that opened my eyes to a way of stunning directing was the marvel American Beauty. Indefinitely, this was the most finely directed film of the year.The writing is phenomenal. Sofia Coppala has always had a way with words, and it shines through in Marie Antoinette. She surpassed Lost in Translation by about seven billion points. It is, again, the most expertly written film of the year.My one complaint has been the way the main character is portrayed. You get a feel of her emotions, thanks to Ms. Dunst, but you don't feel like you know her and how she feels about the people around her properly by the end. Its probably some tragic editing mishap, but there is just something missing from the character.It is hardly noticed though. The film is a tour de force. Its fantastic.",Marie Antoinette

I am no movie critic and don't understand much about the fine points of movie making, i may not notice bad acting or lousy work of the director. One thing i know is history. It happens to be that historical movies is my favorite genre and this movie can not be called historical. No matter what they think in Hollywood wearing a costume and riding horses still doesn't make the the movie historical.Marie Antoinette is presented almost as some kind of a village girl that is amazed by the french royal court and the etiquette at the beginning of the movie.The rest of the movie seems to me like a modern teenage party in which all the participants r wearing 18th century clothes. No historical events, no historical accuracy!",Marie Antoinette
282,kg_reid,"Gorgeous photography, lousy script",5,26 October 2006,"Marie Antoinette is a visually stunning, lushly photographed movie with gorgeous costumes, sets and natural scenes. The costumes alone must have cost about $20 million. Some of the scenes are so extraordinary they would make beautiful paintings to hang on the wall. For those virtues it would get 10 stars. Unfortunately, the pace is glacially slow, the acting wooden or worse, and the script, awful. I checked a biography of Marie Antoinette, and the story is true to her life in many regards. Too bad she was a pampered, spoiled brat whose life, and that of her court, was full of the stifling trivial activities we saw in the film: eating dainties, being fitted for new gowns and shoes, playing dice and cards, and gossiping with the girls. None of this makes for interesting drama. Kirsten Dunst plays her as a sweet girl, misjudged by others, but basically a simp. The life of Marie and Louis XVI was just not interesting enough to make a movie about them, except possibly their dramatic end game where they were imprisoned and beheaded, neither of which is included in this film. Dunst is a pretty young woman but an actress who delivers the petty lines of this script like an amateur. Jason Schwartzman, as her dauphin, is even worse. He sounds like a junior high school student in his first drama class.Comparison with the movie Elizabeth (1998), starring Cate Blanchett immediately comes to mind. Now that was a fine movie! Blanchett's top-notch acting brought Elizabeth I of England to life as a sweet young woman who survived mayhem to rapidly grow into a shrewd leader who could protect herself and use the men around her to her advantage.",Marie Antoinette
283,funzo333,A Life Misunderstood,8,17 November 2008,"In Marie Antoinette, Sofia Coppola's latest character exploration delves deep into the mindset of one of the most misunderstood females in history. As this eloquent variation on a period piece progresses, it becomes clear that much of Coppola's own life and torments are projected onto the screen. What we get then, is not a vanity piece by Sofia, but rather an attempt to be understood through the story of another tormented female of her own time's aristocracy. Kirsten Dunst plays the part of Antoinette beautifully; straddling the line between lost teenager, and burdened royalty. She is countered by another of the Coppola's in Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman), who plays the male version of an overly-burdened youth who is thrust into the golden circle of leading his country far too soon. Its not until the third act comes around and we see the consequences of their actions (or inaction) that we really solidify our identification with Marie, and see the true subtle beauty of this film.The film opens with a shot of Marie in a tub, surrounded by delicacies, and being pampered, as she turns and gives a defiant look straight into the camera. It is a needed segway from our own realities into the film, as it is a blatant self-reflexive shot, and causes us the viewer to become aware that we are seeing a study into the character of Marie Antoinette, and not a typical period piece or historical epic. There is one other such shot in the film that keeps our minds on this track. We are truly introduced to Marie's life when she is being exchanged over to France to be married to Louie. In the first of many ridiculous rituals, she meets the Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis) and is required to exchange all her clothes and possessions for new French clothes and possessions. When she asks if she can keep her dog, the Comtesse replies, ""No, but you can have all the French puppies you desire."" The scene is followed closely by the bedroom scenes, where Marie learns the strictness and absurdness of French custom; which leaves her naked in front of 10-15 people while they figure out the order and the hierarchy of who gets to put her clothes on. It is here that we start to get the feeling that Marie is stifled with tradition, and must wear the burdens of history, which will eventually wear her identity thin. Her next encumbrance is to bear an heir to the throne as soon as possible. But seeing how her boring and drab husband is too insecure to face his 'male' problems directly, he avoids it and holds off consummating their marriage for years. This not only brings shame to Marie Antoinette's royal Austrian family (who's mother is played to cold perfection by Marianne Faithful) but an increased sense of entrapment, as she takes the brunt of the blame for Louie's difficulty. Her trapped state of affairs, along with the immense burden of helping to lead a country  Louis XV (Rip Torn) dies prematurely of smallpox, - breeds her desire for an outlet. She can't eat alone, (she and Louie eat at the same times everyday in the same seats at the table with 4 or 5 servants standing around them waiting for orders) she can't go out unattended, (she is only allowed to go to official events. She manages to sneak out to a ball one night, but only because it is a masquerade and they can wear masks), and as we see time and time again, she can't even dress herself. This causes her to utilize the only outlet she can; money. She begins to spend exorbitant amounts of money on clothes, parties, food, and anything her whim of the moment desires. But she is not the spoiled party girl of her time, she is a trapped and inexperienced little girl with no real father figure who is thrust into a position based on no qualifications except who she was born to and who she married.The final act of the film brings the character study together, as we come to realizations about the consequences of her lifestyle, at the same time Marie does. The county is starving, partly due to Louis irresponsibly sending large amounts of funds to help fund America's revolutionary war. When Marie first hears the rumor that she responded to the peasants cries for bread with the quip, ""Let them eat cake."" we realize the pit of distrust that she has unwittingly dug for herself. It becomes painfully apparent that the country has been a lot more concerned with her life than she has with theirs. In her struggle to find somewhat of an individual identity, she had neglected to help her country hold on to it's own. Just as she probably felt at the time, it seems that out of nowhere, there is an angry mob with pitchforks at her door demanding her head. Marie Antoinette had already passed the point of no return as she addressed the crowd with bow of humility that is met with boos, as is unfortunately too little too late for a starving nation. The last shot of this tragic film comes with a still shot of the royal bedroom, ransacked and destroyed, with birds flying in through the shattered windows. This serves to represent a broken royal system, that not only failed Marie by disallowing her to have something of her own to live by; but also failed its country by thrusting two teenagers who aren't nearly suited or fit to run a country, into power. The tragedy of her life resonates with our own knowledge of how her life ends. We don't need to see the beheading, because the most tragic part of Marie Antoinette  her lonely lost life  has already been shown.",Marie Antoinette
284,atopsy_ja,Complete vanity project,3,25 August 2018,"For me, movies, plays, shows must have a point to the story. Even if it's chronicling someone's life, there still must be a point, after all resources are going into this. My time I'd hoing into watching this. What doesn't have a point is. 2hr movie story telling of someone who only played and partied most of their adult life. Even if that someone is a queen. Ridiculous. The part that actually had purpose (about the French Revolution) was a short 10min. Most of that 10min were waiting scenes where nothing was actually happening, such as the king and queen sitting at a table for over 20 secs of us watching some people sent on a mission riding their horses out of the palace grounds another 20 secs. I think we get the point in the first 3 seconds and certainly be the 5th second. The movie was chock full of these 'waiyinv' Scenes, where you're just waiting for something to happen or the next scene and it doesn't come...until 20 secs later. This make vie should've been 1hr 14 min at most. First you tell quite the most insignificant story then you padded it with waiting scenes. Sure that's how you make a winning movie.

That's actually the first thing I thought when I started watching it. I was thinking ""what the heck is with the music""?! - The spoken language: It was a mixture of American English, British English and French. It was weird that Marie spoke American English even though she was from Austria where people speak German. They could have made her speak with an accent or something to make it more believable. Same with the other characters.",Marie Antoinette
286,nerklus,"Dull, vapid eye-candy",3,26 January 2008,"While not the worst movie ever, as some on IMDb have labeled Marie Antoinette, it is not a good film in any sense.The film has some positives: beautiful clothes and settings. There is such a series of shots of gourmet cakes that it is almost pornographic. Part of the aim of the film might have been to display the excesses of Marie. The aim MIGHT have been anything - the only certainty is that the director missed.The movie's major flaw, is lack of a consistency - in message, goals and characters. While marketed towards teenage girls, the film meanders dreadfully. You couldn't care less what happens to the main character. She's beautiful, but that's it. Disconnected scenes, pointless drudgery.I suppose there are worse teenage girl flicks out there, however, most modern ones are a lot more amusing and honest. This is just another Hollywood example of big budgets with no attention to script or story line.Watch something else - anything else.",Marie Antoinette
287,liufrancesca,good not great,6,6 March 2007,"Shedding some light on to the life of one of the most famous spenders in history, I thought this film was OK. It was interesting to see how the french royalty lived, and the decadence was amazing, but the story was a little lacking. I found myself getting a little board. I would have liked to see a little more character development, I still feel like I didn't really get to know the king and queen. The costumes and the scenery were the best part. They looked amazing, Versailles is gorgeous. All the dogs, and cakes, and just food and parties in general were so amazing, I can't imagine living like that. Also, I was confused about the affair; there didn't seem to be any sneaking around, were we just supposed to assume that the king knew a didn't care. I thought this was fairly entertaining, but with a little more of a plot it could have been much better.",Marie Antoinette
288,tollbaby,What the heck was Coppola doing???,2,8 May 2015,"It amazes me that Sofia Coppola continues to have a career, despite her ineptitude. The historical inaccuracies are bad enough, but the bizarrely placed rock music makes this movie a farce. The film ends very abruptly, almost as if they had run out of film, and then the idiotic music starts up again. I honestly felt as though I had wasted two hours of my life watching this film. Kirsten Dunst is as wooden as ever, and Jason Schwartzman, although handsome, is completely wasted in this dud. Someone should take away Sofia Coppola's camera. Her daddy didn't teach her well enough, and she has no business making movies.",Marie Antoinette
289,conall-wylde,Why did I vote so low,1,12 February 2007,"Well... The music of this movie is just plain wrong. You just cannot show the court of Versailles featuring queen Marie-Antoinette and salt the thing with electric guitar, it's not only out of place, it's also insufferable and that's a shame, because if it wasn't for the music this movie could be a real great one, it has a very good photography, the actors are good, but unfortunately none of this manage to counteract the fact that you don't use electric music with a film like this one. It doesn't make it ""modern"", it just make it indigestible. I think that the story could be more interesting too, because if we get the feel of how boring it was to live in this golden cage, it's very possible to end thinking that the movie itself is boring... It's a nice painting, maybe, but it's certainly not a masterpiece, IMHO.",Marie Antoinette
290,philipbn,Stick to what you know....,2,5 October 2006,"My response to this film falls with all those who are observing what a fundamentally weak piece of work it is. Obviously some enjoy it for their various reasons, but I have to agree with many others that this film is poorly done in many ways and on many levels: pacing and narrative are incredibly weak, the music and visuals are annoying (to me), and the historical angle is woefully bad. Poor Kirsten Dunst, to have soldiered through her role in such a disaster! It seems to be me that the film demonstrates that filmmakers only really make films about what they know (not an original conclusion, but this film seems a good demonstration of the general principle). After succeeding with Lost in Translation, clearly Ms. Coppola has a good grasp on subject matter involving rich yuppies living in privileged circumstances in the Reagan-Bush era. Here, I think, she has tried to project this kind of subject matter back onto the late eighteenth century, but, alas, she knows nothing about the late eighteenth century, or the French Revolution, etc. She should have picked subject matter she could get a better grasp on.I hope she's able to recover from this one and follow it with something successful.",Marie Antoinette
291,kilofeq,"historical value - almost none, personal and intimate - definitely",5,18 January 2009,"I guess many people did not appreciate the feature because of its lightness and lack of detail. The film abounds with scenes that were completely unimportant for France and its political doings - it is more a personal account of the lightness of MA's life - well she was only 14 when she got married - how serious could her life get? She poked fun at the whole Versailles traditions and customs and this film is just about that. So if you expect to get intellectually richer, then forget this film, but if you are interested how people used to party in France, then go for it. Even though it was a bit of a chick-flick, I still appreciated the beauty of costumes, lights and just the general beauty of it all.",Marie Antoinette
292,lasker_98,a tranquilizing take on the most indulgent period in history,2,22 October 2006,"Hitchcock once said that film was real life with all of the dull parts cut out. I certainly never believed there was a dull minute in Marie Antoinette's life until this movie.Lost in Translation might be one of the most overrated movies of all time, but assuming that it was as poignant as many critics and audiences felt it was, it worked in a modern Japan, and it had a story.Marie Antoinette is a subject that doesn't work without opulence and indulgence: into the costumes and sets, and into a court where a queen made revelry to distract herself from the pains of an unfulfilled marriage. Coppola assumes that anyone interested in Marie Antoinette has no interest in the court she created, and assumes the audience might respond to the taciturn Lost in Translation formula in a period movie.If adding contemporary music was not tasteless, it did not serve its intended purpose of adding life into the movie. Life might have come from the pain of Marie Antoinette's predetermined life, but instead of a breadth of insights, the viewer is made to suffer through a simple and non-faceted point that she was married to a sexually unresponsive man for over an hour. The rest of the film focuses on the escape of a garden and a child, rather than on the extravagance of Versailles court life. The movie that so long tries to make Marie Antoinette sympathetic does not even give a reason for this attempt. The film sidesteps her controversy with the people of France altogether and misses her beheading, and her imprisonment.Kirsten Dunst, whose youthful voice surely earned her the role, is flat and without range even for a role that required little.For those expecting fantastic costumes, those in Marie Antoinette are predictable. Few are memorable, and many more are simplistic. The fabric is incredible, but there is little detail save for some imaginative albeit limited trimmings.In short, you can't make a movie about anything, no matter how seemingly grand and interesting, without a plot.",Marie Antoinette
293,zatarains80,Excellent...I have a craving for CAKE now!,8,28 October 2006,"The only thing ""wrong"" about this film is that there is no time measurement, especially since I suspect that many are unfamiliar with the time line of historical events--and I wish there had been more identification of Marie Antoinette's entourage and clique...NOW....Sofia Coppola's biopic of Marie Antoinette is wonderful! It follows the young dauphine and queen of France from about the age of 14 until her late 20s when she is captured during the Revolution. It demonstrates Marie Antoinette's isolated life, she is living in a royal cocoon and how she carefully navigates the precarious French court at Versailles.Kirsten Dunst does well in her portrayal of the young queen as she deals with an unconsummated marriage (for seven years); the pressures of needing to deliver an heir; and how her marriage-bed relations could ultimately effect the delicate alliances between France and Austria. Her spending is extravagant but so is her unique situations.Filmed mostly on location in Versailles, it is BEAUTIFULLY done--the costumes are wonderful! I was worried about the ""modern"" soundtrack but that was not overpowering and it was well timed. Check out the recent PBS documentary--it rocks! Enjoy!",Marie Antoinette
294,saniyababinski,lacking in plot,6,7 March 2007,"This movie was not as good as I was hopping. I wanted some character development and a racy plot, but what I got was a lavish tour or Versailles with a whisper of a story. I thought the acting seemed extremely casual, and there was hardly a plot at all. I would have liked to see more intimate conversations. I did enjoy the costumes and the scenery. It was kind of worth watching just for that. I thought all the dogs were really cute, and the cakes and candies look awesome. It made me hungry. I don't think it gave a very good historical portrayal, and it was very strange how everything seemed to be formal yet casual at the same time. The whole idea of the film was a bit muddled. I think it needed a much better story if it was meant to keep my attention for longer than half an hour.",Marie Antoinette
295,Druzilla,My new favorite teen queen!,9,15 May 2007,"I went into this movie not quite knowing what to expect. While I liked Lost In Translation, I thought The Virgin Suicides was a bore. Sofia Coppola also seems to have the critics split down the middle here, leaving half of them praising the film for it's lyrical beauty and the other half screeching ""off with its head"".The movie starts off as Antoinette(Kirsten Dunst) is summoned from Austria as a 14-year-old to be the bride of the future Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). As she crosses the border, she is instructed to leave everything behind. Stripped of her clothes, her friends and even her beloved pug, Mops, she is whisked away to Paris where scrutiny, alienation and ridiculous amount of protocol awaits her.Once in Paris, she is stuck with her mumbling and bumbling husband, who shows far more interest in hunting and locks than he does in her, and the marriage stays unconsummated for several years. The lack of attention from her husband, as well as that of an heir, adds to the pressure of Antoinette, and to cope with the structure and boredom she begins to shop, gamble and hold lavish parties to pass her time.This is where Coppola excels for me. Marie Antoinette is shows as a teenager, one of my favorite scenes being where they sneak off to attend a masquerade-ball. Coppola has made brilliant use of contemporary music, bringing the film into the present, and making it much easier to relate. (the soundtrack is superb btw) The film has been critiqued for not focusing enough on the politics of Versailles, but that was not the focus-point of this film. Antoinette is. Her world, her feelings, her loneliness. The only thing I missed, was during her pregnancies. Many things must have changed for Antoinette during that time, and I wish Coppola could have explored that some more.Now, I won't forget to mention the cinematography, which I loved. Somehow, all the luxury that surrounds Antoinette in this film only makes her isolation stand out all the clearer, and being a woman, I can't help but drool over the opulent gowns that are paraded about the screen. Coppola was also allowed to film inside Versailles. Reason enough alone for many to see this film.Anyways, I loved it. Maybe you will too :) (http://blogs.myspace.com/mskarbovik - Movie/TV reviews, news, etc)",Marie Antoinette

297,helenfurn,Left me tepid,3,9 July 2019,"Marie Antoinette has long been portrayed as one of history's most vacuous twits. Sadly, for me, Coppola not only failed to bring any depth to Marie's character, but actually left me viewing her in a worse light than I had before. She came across as every bit the spoiled, delusional airhead that we have come to expect. There was nothing, in what passed for her personality, that endeared me to her at all. In fact when the revolting peasants turned up at the front gates, I found myself shouting 'Thank God for that!' at the TV screen. Quite frankly this film bored me rigid. The cast is actually fantastic and they certainly all did the best with it that they could. But it just had no depth and really very little story line. The whole thing felt like a squandered opportunity.",Marie Antoinette
298,myzoe66,Trivial,4,18 October 2006,"Very disappointing. I was looking forward to this supposed new and fresh look at the making of - or not trying to make - a period piece. Great idea, bad execution. Forget about the historical inaccuracies and the complete disregard for the political context, the screenplay is simply bad. Poorly written dialog, undeveloped characters, all in all a superficial view of a group of people that presented an incredible rich source of material. While Kirstin Dunst did her best, she was miscast for the very young version of MA and Jason Schwartzman is just totally out of place. Yes, I know, King Louis XVI was supposed to have been only interested in food and hunting, rather inhibited and boring and uninterested in his wife and most other things. But as an actor, you need to make an effort in getting these traits across rather than just minimize your engagement and make everybody think you stink.",Marie Antoinette
299,tryptich2,Spectacular Spectacular,9,18 February 2007,"This gorgeous, thoughtful, weird, smart, almost zanily filmic film is no mere homage to Baz Luhrmann but a direct confident, gutsy expressionist masterpiece. Luscious, detailed, idiosyncratic coloration that really worked. Incredible casting. Couldn't imagine Jason S. could play Louis XVI but he was great, and so was Kirsten Dunst, and everyone else. (Not much technical acting expertise required, however. Seems like this area remains an unknown for Coppola).Coppola had her actors perform naturalistically -- shades of Method umm's, and ahhs -- while bombarding them and us with deliberately heightened visuals (tropicana satins/diamonds/wiggery/palatial splendor) as they are puppeted through the suffocating rituals of court and history. Result: the vaunted ""conjunctio oppositorum,"" conjunction of opposites creating a unified artistic whole.Daring. Entertaining. Enlightening.One could not ask for more.",Marie Antoinette
300,alexbet,Horrible storytelling,1,30 October 2006,"I must say that I was expecting a whole lot more out of this movie - and frankly, a whole lot more could indeed have been put into this movie. Maybe I don't know Mrs. Coppola's ""style""... So it's a little more ""independent/Europpean-oriented"", fine... I can also deal with the fact that you're hearing 70's-like rock music being played in ballroom dancing scenes and that it is used throughout the movie. That's OK, I accept (and respect) that. However, what I have zero respect for is a story poorly told and ultimately, that's what it should be about: the story, and how it moves you back and forth, through the highs and lows.In that respect, the movie does not succeed at all. It does a horrible job at it. Where there could be room to further understand the background of the characters, to understand why Marie Antoinette even goes to France (not all of us have History majors) and to actually see the implications and consequences of her behavior outside of her kingdom of dreams, we are ""treated"" with long, boring, exceedingly visually-descriptive scenes of her day-to-day life, where things happen from one shot to another with apparently little to no connection.Around me, in the theater, people kept moving in their seats back and forth, tapping feet, sighing heavily, almost as out of prayer that SOMETHING would happen and that you could get actually hear Kirsten Dunst talk for more than two minutes at a time which would be followed by five minutes of silence, when frankly, there is so much to be told.So great, we know as much of Mrs. Antoinette's life as we know P Diddy's after an episode of MTV Cribs... But WHO is Marie Antoinette? WHERE does she come from? WHY is she there? And in the midst of her reign, HOW EXACTLY does the public react? And why are we shown a fraction of what we could really see? And more importantly, HOW does she end up in the guillotine? To sum it up: I was expecting a whole lot more depth, and intensity (yes, there is room for that) out of this movie, with a lot more perspectives. A very good and interesting story could be told, and this movie could indeed get a ten star rating. But after what I've seen, a) I'm never again going to see a Sofia Coppola movie and b) I think I'll have to settle for when the History channel does a documentary on the subject. I really think it will be ten times more interesting and compelling than a pseudo-artsy movie like this.Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",Marie Antoinette
301,jackie-613-971127,I wasted 2 hours watching this,3,21 December 2018,"All right, the costumes, setting, hairdos and filming are beautiful. But what would be enough for a photograph misses the mark entirely in a film.
A film needs a scenario. It seems Coppola thought using a Wikipedia page would suffice: it does not.
A film needs dialogs. There isn't a shred of that. Coppola thought perhaps that insipid sentences would convey the vacuity of the life in Versailles: it merely conveyed the vacuity of the film.
And the choice of the music was atrocious. Don't get me wrong: I don't mind the clash between a XVIII century setting with XX century music. But why choose bands whose singer can't hold a tune?
Anyway, that's two hours of my life I'm never getting back!",Marie Antoinette
302,jaimiedlev,Loved it! But don't look for a lot of depth...,9,30 October 2006,"I love French history. I've been to Versailles, and I have tried to imagine what it must have been like to be Marie Antoinette, living in her Petit Trianon and her little hamlet....what kind of person would need to create such a world for herself? What could she have been thinking? I didn't admire her, but I have always been curious as to how she could be so obtuse, and, along with her husband, so blind and politically inept.What I have always come up with kind of meshes with the portrayal in this movie: she married young and naive, then, isolated in her luxurious bubble, progressively lost touch with her people and responsibilities. Not everyone cares about those type of questions, but clearly some of us do. I found it a fascinating character study.Also, I really appreciated the fact that this was a woman's movie. It shows perfectly the loneliness and feelings of defeat Marie Antoinette must have felt in a new country, unable to fulfill her husband's family's expectations by producing an heir. It shows her completely devastated by her first real sexual passion, and enraptured by motherhood. Her friendship with the King seemed true to life, born out of their shared isolation and the shared burden of royal responsibilities. She seemed vulnerable and real, despite the her extraordinary circumstances, and I thought Kirsten Dunst did a fine job (though she was far to pretty and too skinny to be Marie Antoinette--but I forgive them that!).Don't get me wrong. I don't think this is a true to life portrayal. The best part of the movie was the visuals. The parties, food, the beautiful people....I loved the the way becoming a Queen (and gaining some autonomy) allowed her to grow to be a new person. She became a decadent libertine, falling in love, indulging in food and drink and dress. Anyone who has ever visited France and seen those gilded interiors has wondered what it was like to properly enjoy them. Watch this movie--see these parties--now you know! I watched this movie with two other women/girls (we are in our late 20's), and it was the perfect girly fix. It made us all want to get all be-ribboned, curl and tease our hair, and giggle about how cute Count von Fersen was while eating bon bons. If that is what you are hoping to get out of this movie, you will not be disappointed--like us!",Marie Antoinette

304,PhoenixSeraph,Gorgeous movie cut short,10,6 November 2006,"This movie had the potential to be great.I thought I would be put off by the modern soundtrack, but what really annoyed me was that Sofia Coppola cut off the movie. I wanted Copploa to show the grueling, horrible adversity that Marie Antoinette had to go through with her husband's execution, the torture of her children, the horrifying trial she was put through, and to her own humbling execution.It was great up till then...sure, a few liberties here and there, but over all, it was gorgeous. The music, the shots, the costumes, everything...the parts with Louis Auguste and Marie Antoinette's consummation was both hilarious and heart breaking.I was a bit miffed they didn't include Louis Charles...the time line may have been a bit off. I'm pretty sure he was born by the time the French peasants stormed the Bastille. And when Louis Auguste asks Marie Antoinette about the lime avenue...that was actually asked to his sister, Elisabeth.Rose Byrne as Duchesse de Polignac was delightful though! I think she really captured the lively spirit of the Queen's favorite. Mary Nighy was great as Lamballe, and the Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson was hilarious as the aunts. I also really enjoyed Judy Davis as the Comtesse ""Etiquette"".From a historical point of view, I loved how personal Marie Antoinette was and the great attention to detail they paid to her. This movie was about a young woman thrust into a political turmoil way beyond her years. In that, they did a fantastic job. It is people who ultimately shape the way history happens and I absolutely loved how personal this film was.All in all, good movie...but it had the potential to be much better.

Vibrant costumes and elaborate hair styles and little dialog made this movie very well put together.

I was truly proud of Jason Schwartzman's portrayal of an awkward, uncomfortable and not wanting to be married Prince and Kristen Dunst's portrayal of an eager (in the beginning she hugs everyone), not so intelligent, Queen of France. I thought she did a get job getting up in the morning to being dressed by all her ladies in waiting.

It fails to tell her story, glazing over her political interference and underplaying the decadence that enveloped Versailles prior to the French Revolution. But then I suppose realism wasn't high on the list of priorities judging by the scene in the palais Garnier (not built for another hundred years) and the dancing to Hong Kong Garden by Siouxsie and the Banshees. I'm not really sure what the point actually was though, which is the problem. It does look fantastic though and I don't regret watching it.",Marie Antoinette
307,wji222,Coppola's greatest talents shine in Marie Antoinette,8,20 October 2006,"Having had read the biography by Antonio Fraser that this book is based on, I must say that it is a very close representation of Fraser's work but with the visionary ideals of Sofia Coppola. Coppola is known for being a visionary director, she is a queen of understatement, saying much without saying much. Coppola is also an extreme connoisseur of imagery and therefore it is not a surprise that this movie is a plate of visual decadence. However, it would be unfair to say that eye candy is all it is because it is much more than that. Coppola tells a tale of a young woman whose personality, desires, and weaknesses are all very much like ours. In truth, Coppola delivers the message that the much hated Queen of France was in fact, very very human. Antoinette was a victim of fate and destiny, slave to an arranged marriage to France by her domineering and powerful mother (Marie Theresa) and subjugated to be stripped of her homeland and relegated to live in France within the gilded cage that is Versailles. There is the message that despite history's harsh recollections, Marie Antoinette was simply just a girl in a world that was changing, a world that had no place for people like her and she was simply swept away by the tides of destiny. Sitting through the movie I couldn't help but think that there is not really that much dialogue throughout the movie, but that is because one of Coppola's greatest talents is her ability to show emotion through action. Watching this lonely girl surrounded by lovely things in a huge palace makes one reminiscent of a lonely doll forced by fate to be bigger than she was ever meant to be. As for Kirsten Dunst, her performance here far out-rivals anything she has done before. Her innocence literally permeates from the screen to the viewer, it is really that strong. And that is probably exactly why Coppola chose Dunst, because despite the fact that Dunst is not the strongest actress, she brings a sense of lively innocence and haunting tragedy that literally blankets her from the top of her feather coiffed hair down to her Manolo Blahnik shoes. Dunst plays the role exactly as Coppola imagined it to be, and she gives Marie Antoinette a very human like quality. Overall, there will be many who do not like this film, especially those that think Marie Antoinette does not deserve a sympathetic view (like the French). However, it is an extremely good portrayal of a prominent misunderstood figure in history. Dunst gives her strongest performance to date and for the first time, we begin to see Marie Antoinette as simply and very realistically, a human being.",Marie Antoinette
308,Lebowlski,the music?,6,25 January 2007,"In general a nice flick. It gives a balanced view of the royal situation before the french revolution and the scenery and clothing is excellent. The acting is so so, but i don't know if that was because of the way Coppola wanted to present the situation or because she just didn't wanted to deepen the characters whatsoever. Well basically, if it stayed like this it was an OK movie. But the music! WHo came up with the idea to mix classical music and rock?? Worst thing to do ever, even if it was just a tryout. I mean the editor must have had the same feeling that sometimes the modern music did absolutely not contributed to the scene or the movie as a whole. Just so you know before you watch the movie, do not let the music bother you, it's an OK flick to watch overall.",Marie Antoinette
309,horrorfanaticgirl,Pretty to look at not so fun to watch,6,5 March 2007,"As a history fanatic I found this movie right on target with what really happened in the life of Marie Antoinette. As much as I loved Sofia Coppola's previous movies this one was lacking something. The actors and actress were great as well as the setting (at real locations, no less) and the costumes but still something irritated me about this movie. Oh yes, the music! Maybe Sofia was trying to convey some message about how young they were and portrayed their youthfulness through the soundtrack, who knows but it was out of place in such a beautifully filmed movie.Kirsten Dunst was stunning, as usual in this film. She oddly looked like Diana Scarwid in her Mommie Dearest role in a few scenes. The chemistry between her and Jason Schwartzman was minimal, which since in real life the King and Queen were not too thrilled with one another at the beginning of their relationship, this was fitting. But toward the end, there seemed a tenderness toward one another that I thought they played on very well with gestures and looks.I loved Jason Schwartzman's portrayal of King Louis XVI. From accounts the King was quiet, shy, said little to most and loved to hunt. Jason pulled this off perfectly and left you feeling sorry for him toward the end of this movie.Character development was little. Toward the end of the movie I really didn't care what happened to them and the ending might have been fitting so not to dwell on their depressing fate but I still felt cheated in the end and all I was thinking of was how pretty this movie was too look at. And it made me want to go eat oodles of fancy cakes. Some of the actors spoke with an accent while most did not but it did not bother me as much as I thought it would with a period film.Overall I gave this movie a 6 because of the fact that it was such a darn pretty movie!

I spent the majority of the rest of movie wondering if the screen editor would ever work again after the poor editing job I counted at least 50 drops of the sound mike into view during the course of the film.

312,info-73150,A MODERN PERSPECTIVE ON TWO TRAGIC HISTORICAL FIGURES,8,9 May 2019,"I actually rather enjoyed the film. Beautiful art direction. Kirsten Dunst (luminously) portrays Marie Antoinette; a young soon-to-be queen, full of love and yet terribly flawed, a royal with nothing but her bloodline to offer France. The film offers a female perspective on what it must have been like to be a bargaining chip to maintain peace between 2 powerful countries. In the film, Marie Antoinette is not unlike many privileged and wealthy young people today; easily bored, constantly seeking distractions and amusements, and in desperate need of direction, attention, and affection. She is a young woman who appears to have held no real interest in politics--she simply wants to fulfill her duties as wife and mother. At heart, she is a ""country girl"" in many regards. She seems happiest in when in the country with nature and with children. It was insightful to see Marie Antoinette portrayed as a woman with foibles and weaknesses--in the framework of most histories of the French Revolution, she is painted as a conniving villainess. This movie offers a more human perspective on this period of time in history, and reminds the viewer that these two monarchs were just teenagers; terribly ill-equipped to manage the responsibility of ruling a country that was already deeply in debt. I appreciate the viewpoint of this film...it's a fresh portrait of the history of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The contemporary music mixed with classical reminds us that history can and will repeat itself. The films is a cautionary tale against allowing wealth-based leaders to override the needs of a struggling nation. Too much decadence pushed under the noses of the poor will only lead to a revolution.",Marie Antoinette

If you are looking for something that reveals what 1700's France was like through a film, Look elsewhere. The costumes are Hunger Games meets Valmont with a 1980's slang dialogue AND an 80's musical score to match. About 3 historical facts in this film are accurate and the balance is fluff made up by who knows...Sophia Coppola is an idiot, always has been, confirmed by New York Stories back in the day and this takes the Marie Antoinette Cake...literally.",Marie Antoinette
314,razvanu,artistic,7,29 October 2006,"Just saw this movie in theaters. I like Sofia Coppola's style, but after seeing The Virgin Suicides, Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette, I have to conclude that in fact, I just really love Lost in Translation. In comparison to that, I gave this movie a 7. But still! It's worth seeing if you like one of the following things: visually impressive, colorful, artistic movies (like Russian Ark, full of costumes of the times and such); a social, emotionally oriented view of the famous French Queen; subtle humor; a creative rendition of that particular historical time. Those are all characteristics of the film. Unfortunately, those items also make it a fairly slow movie. Now I know Lost in Translation is far from an action movie, and I have no objection to that. But Marie Antoinette is a bit too slow, especially for one who cares more about the characters and plot than about decorum, Versailles and social life at the palace. Though I see the artistic value of this film, and I don't feel I wasted my 10$, I also do not feel that it struck a chord in me. So 7/10 is pretty justified.",Marie Antoinette

Against my own predictions I found it really pleasant, every shot carefully planned to maximise the emotional effect, even if on the other hand Sofia Coppola tries to tel...(read more)l the story from a minimalist point of view, Marie-Antoinette ""the girl next door"". This strange mix between the grandeur of Versailles and an emotional portrait of a girl (by accident the Queen of France) works amazingly well for most part of the movie. Not surprisingly the weakest parts deal with history, but you may argue that in those cases the girl turned queen was in fact losing her plot (and, ultimately, her head.)",Marie Antoinette
316,acburnham,History with a touch of contemporary pop,8,29 October 2006,"Sofia Coppola is a highly underestimated director, in my opinion. She directs this film, like Lost in Translation, with incredible finesse. I'd say she's a better director than her father, but I guess it's an apples and oranges comparison: dad is pretty heavy handed, while S.C. directs with apparent tremendous delicacy. She seems to get the best from her actors, and the creativity of her shot and music selections (tossing some almost incidental contemporaneous references into this period piece) demonstrate an intuition unsurpassed by other current directors in her age group. To this day, Lost in Translation brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it. GO SOPHIA.",Marie Antoinette
317,LeonieBahri,This movie really stayed with me...,7,12 September 2006,"The whole time I was watching Sofia Coppola's take on the famously ill-fated Queen of France I felt like I was missing something. This came close to hampering my enjoyment of the film, but I must admit that it was this sensation that has caused my mind to linger over the aims and intentions of the film long after I left the screening. Coppola has taken a decidedly idiosyncratic stance on Marie Antoinette's years as a monarch at Versailles, and her youthful, teen-aged approach to her subject goes quite some way to reclaiming a much-maligned character.Kirsten Dunst is transfixing as Marie Antoinette, and the film is relentlessly focused on her performance; mirroring the intense focus of the French Aristocracy on their new monarch. There are some great supporting performances (Rip Torn and Asia Argento amuse as the old King and his common lover) and some not-so-great (Jason Schwartzman - an actor I love - is somewhat miscast as the shyly impotent Louis XVI) but what is important is that the support remains as support, never distracting from Dunst's stellar performance.Filmed on location at Versailles, the film has a rivetingly lavish style overflowing in elegance, but never more beautiful than in the sequence where the Queen sets up her own self- consciously romantic idyll in the form of a rustic village in the grounds of the palace. One of the key criticisms levelled at the historical Marie Antoinette is her extravagant spending in the face of the poverty of the French People and the debt of the monarchy itself. This is the one accusation that it is hardest to answer in defence of Marie Antoinette, and yet in displaying the lush surroundings of Versailles in such minutely sublime detail, Coppola makes it obvious how hard it must have been for a girl of such a young age to align in her mind the warnings of the financial state of her country given her by her husband and ministers with the supremely extravagant lifestyle led by all at court. Sofia Coppola brings to the story of Marie Antoinette a vibrancy that is rarely seen in period dramas, and her decision to focus solely on the years at Versailles and not dwell on the path well travelled by dragging on to the Queen's well-documented fate will leave you pondering the social justice meted out to her and her family by the French Revolution.",Marie Antoinette
318,pietterbeek,Well dressed but weak story based on a number of historical events,3,20 November 2008,"Lately on Belgian TV I first saw this movie and than a French documentary on Marie Antoinette. What a relief to see the documentary after this glamorous but boring impression of Sofia Coppola. The movie is mostly entertainment and has little to do with 18th century Versailles. It is rather a compilation of moving pictures, that repeat themselves for most of the time, than the moving story that should have been told based on the same historical events. A story that could have entertained me a lot more than this film that is lost in clichés and superfluous details. Certainly not my way to approach history and in this context to portray an idiosyncratic woman like Marie Antoinette.",Marie Antoinette

I just about walked out of the movie theater because I was just not interested in it. Most of it was her walking around, buying things, petting goats and crying. I don't understand how people liked it. The storyline was not interesting at all. The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because the first fifteen minutes or so was funny, I liked the music that they used ( if they used classical music or something like that I WOULD have walked out), and there was o.k acting from Kate. Nothing all that great though. I really can't see why some people really liked it. It's got to be one of the worst movies I have seen this year.",Marie Antoinette

Instead of smearing her as a self-centered spoiled brat like many interpretations, coppola paints marie as a teenage girl under immense pressure. The candy-coated color palette and incredible costumes and set really emphasize how young and naive marie antoinette was when she was sent to versailles.

Now I'm usually a real sucker for costume epics, especially with some good historical background. This film directed by Sophie Coppolla, couldn't choose a more colorful subject matter than the ill-fated queen of the feckless Louis XVI! My cat could have made a better movie. Half the film establishes Marie as a party girl, overwhelmed yet fascinated with her exalted and obscenely wealthy station. The second half reinforces the first. Nothing happens.Vacuous dialog, with action focused around overdressed fops scurrying along palace halls, rolling in elysian fields, flirting at a masked ball, or trotting along in huge pumpkin like carriages. With none but the briefest mention of some apparently disgruntled peasants, the palace is suddenly seized by the unwashed rabble, the king and queen are quickly thrown into yet another galloping carriage, and............ roll credits. By now you're quite ready for a smashing guillotine scene, but you're denied even this satisfaction! I want 2 hours of my life back!",Marie Antoinette
322,cdwebdesign,"beautiful scenery and costumes, terrible movie",1,1 February 2007,"I had higher hopes for this movie, in that it would at the least have a somewhat captivating story. I did not laugh, cry, or feel any emotion whatsoever throughout this film. The actors and actresses were not bad at all, but rather the screenplay and direction were terrible. It was like a slow starting novel, where you read 30 pages and it's not quite entranced you yet, and you know that just around the corner your patience will pay off. However, in this version, you wait 2 hours for the payoff, and it never delivers. I felt suffocated by the film, and to be quite honest, the credits were a breath of fresh air. I would recommend this film to anyone devoid of emotion, or with an interest in silent films; you may as well turn off the sound. The clash between old and new, with the background music vs. the modern day soundtrack, was odd, to say the least, and the dialogue was worthless.",Marie Antoinette

It's sad that few seem to understand what the director means regarding the movie, what the music means, what everything means. Want to complain about the length of the movie, the lack of character, so on and so forth? ..Do you think it was very fun back then in Versailles? Want to complain about the actors speaking English? ..Would you've gone to see it it was in French?I loved it. I think it was simply beautiful. The clothes, the dialog, the little detail.

324,srooms27,Pass on this Movie,2,13 May 2008,"I started watching this not knowing really what to expect. But in the end I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life. I thought it started out very promising and the story was moving along fine. But then after the couple was married I found it very hard to tell how much time has passed. I thought a week had passed and next thing I know his brother his married and Marie mentions they would look like fools if his brother becomes pregnant before they do. Next scene she is laying around and trying to get the future king to have sex...no go. Then the brother is having a baby. It seemed to be like this throughout. Music montages would go on or a song would play and sometimes it would be just to pass the time of the traveling carriage. Other times a short 10 seconds would pass and three years had passed. then a 20 minute segment on her birthday of nothing but gambling and drinking(which i understand why) but the pacing was simply off and became very boring. Then there were other parts that you think should be stressed like the baby dying...but all that was shown was a mere minute if that. But they kept showing all these random shots of her walking or laying around which did nothing for the story. Then the villagers become restless hold up the king and wife in the castle and a guard walks in covered in blood and says - ""They've come to kill the queen."" Then we watch them sitting eating, nodding, eating, crying. she goes out and bows to the crowd. They yell back. Then they let her go right out the front door and then it ends. Simply just of waste of time, the music didn't seem to fit half the time...just not good. Well except for the first 20 minutes.One thing I did like that actually showed some sort of character development and some plot progression is when she applauded to a play at the beginning everyone applauded with her...at the end no one did. Loved that scene, but that was it.I bought this used for $5 for my wife and I feel like I was ripped off. Not so much the money but the two hours I spent watching it.",Marie Antoinette
325,lifeborrow,Not a historical documentary!!!,9,30 December 2009,"This is an entertaining and pleasure-for-eyes movie. Great picture to make one interested in history, but not a historical one; and, i think, just what this kind of art supposed to be. Yes, Kirsten Dunst doesn't fit the role: her face, smile, eyes, eyebrows (untreated, by the way), teeth, cheeks, chin etc... But the moment she first uttered something rational: ""This is ridiculous!"", i personally realized: this is a real contemporary performance! In that flow she acts precisely! In the combination with appropriate action, music, visuals, cinematography... By the middle of the movie i had a feeling, that it's a pure gem no worse then 'Lost in Translation'. Alas, the ending... A symbolically trivial ending, much disappointing! A very important for the 'ego' of movie's director to logically complete the historical events, but stylistically inappropriate, really.",Marie Antoinette
326,themegabrat,RICH with colour and emotion...,9,5 November 2008,"When I originally heard that Sophia Coppola was creating a film about Marie Antoinette using undisguised American accents to a background of 80s pop, I was appalled. But after vowing I'd never sully my eyes with it, as things often happen... I now own two copies of the movie on DVD and consider it among my selective favourite films.I think a film like this could be very much underestimated because of the youth and vitality in it, which might lead people to assume that it will provide a very basic and immature view on Marie Antoinette and her life. However, this movie has succeeded in not only creating a whole new view on the vilified Austrian turned French Queen but has humanised her for my generation. She is no longer a cruel, middle-aged tyrant who terrorized the French people and cared only for herself but an actual human being. A lonely and lost woman who was taken advantage of and forced into a situation completely beyond her experience or ability at the tender age of fourteen.The movie itself is delicious to look at. The costumes, the music and the sets are almost edible, they are so lustre and rich. The costumes - oh my! They were stunning and Dunst looked glorious - I thought- as the young French queen. Convincing but effortlessly natural.And the emotion was there. The pain, desperation, vulnerability, naivety and loneliness of Antoinette was so colourfully expressed through Dunst's very fresh and natural performance.It is also pleasingly historically accurate. All the little details are there from Antoinette's sore relations with Madame Du Barry to the death of her daughter Sophie and the removal of her from the portrait. I think a sufficient understanding of Marie Antoinette's life is helpful because while I adored the movie and understood every detail, every gesture, every moment, a friend of mine claimed that she 'didn't understand parts of it' which originally caused me to despair at her ignorance but to later realise that if a person DIDN'T have a basic knowledge of Antoinette and the French Revolution some of the details would throw them. But this is one of very few flaws for me. I enjoyed it thoroughly and thought Dunst was at her best as the troubled Queen Marie Antoinette and Coppola did a fine job of naturalising the young Queen and making her flesh and blood.",Marie Antoinette
327,arget_aiedail,"""Less"" than I expected; plot less, emotionless, humorless, pointless, the list could go on...",2,30 October 2008,"The trailer was interesting, but not enough for me to go see it in theater. I found it strange that there wasn't much talking, but thought there would be more in the movie.Boy, was I wrong! The entire film probably had 200 distinguished (and by that I mean ones that could actually be heard, not just muttering in the background) lines! That might have been okay, if it had been a very stylized movie with a PLOT, but unfortunately there is no plot, either. There was *one* point in the movie, which lasted no more than two minutes, where I actually felt something for one of the characters, and felt like the character was feeling something, not just wandering around in a daze of manners and expensive gowns speaking in a bland voice.In my opinion, movies have to have at least two of the following: drama, romance, action, mystery, or a highly convoluted plot. ""Marie Antoinette"" had none of those.",Marie Antoinette
328,budandlou258,Coppola tries too hard to be poignant.,3,5 November 2006,"Last night I went with my mother, my younger sister, and my sister's friend to see Sofia Coppola's latest production, ""Marie Antoinette."" I had seen trailers and thought it would be interesting, especially since I had heard the soundtrack and knew it consisted of mostly modern rock. Two and a half hours later, as the screen finally darkened and the credits started to roll, Mom and I looked at each other with identical expressions of incredulity. We were both thinking the same thing: That's IT?!As we drove home, huffing and puffing, several things crossed my mind:1. Maybe Coppola's budget got cut when they were halfway through production, so they cut the screenplay short (as in, they stopped telling the story halfway through). The extravagant costumes surely must have usurped the budget normally reserved for screenwriters.2. This is not the first Coppola film I have been disappointed with. ""Antoinette"" surpasses her 2003 release of ""Lost in Translation"" only in lag time. I was interested in seeing Coppola's ""The Virgin Suicides,"" but after the disappointment of the other two, I could venture a guess that the reasons the virgins were driven to such an act was due to desperation at being trapped in yet another boring flick.3. During the scene in which Kirsten Dunst is stripped of all Austrian belongings, including her clothing, my mother leaned over and whispered, ""Kirsten Dunst has a weird backside."" I myself didn't notice; I must have been preoccupied with searching for a plot.4. Marie Antoinette did not, as the movie suggests, have an illicit love affair. This was a gaping example of Coppola's inserting falsehoods while skimming through the more interesting facts of Antoinette's life. Lady Antonia Fraser (the author of the biography on which Coppola based her production) would be horrified. In his review of the film, Roger Ebert offered an explanation for the lack of historical details: ""That is because we are entirely within Marie's world. And it is contained within Versailles, which shuts out all external reality. It is a self-governing architectural island, like Kane's Xanadu, that shuts out politics, reality, poverty, society."" But this does not explain Coppola's decision to include the affair, or her decision to gloss over the fact that Louis XVI had a slight (but reversible) medical problem which prevented him from performing in bed. The film was already rated PG-13, wouldn't this have been allowed?5. At two and one-half hours in length, one would suppose the director had ample time to develop her characters. After all, the film covers at least ten years of her life. Instead we see montage after montage of shoes and champagne glasses and little cakes (what WERE those, anyway?). Most of the screen time is used depicting the couple's first few years of marriage. When, ten minutes before the end, we finally are offered something of substance, it is presented stoically. We learn (with no words uttered, of course) that she has lost her baby, but we only see a painting of Antoinette with her three children, then it is replaced by a painting with only two. Any chance of arousing the audience's sympathy with this tragedy is lost. Apparently Coppola thought the shoes were more important.6. I am not impartial to the actors in this movie; I admire the previous work of Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman, as well as many of the supporting cast members. I have seen them in other films and I know what they can do. The fact that I found the two stars completely dull in this film (by the time it was over I felt like bringing out the guillotine for them myself) is not their fault; it is the script. More interesting things happened to Marie than getting dressed in the morning, and we see this at least three times. 7. How much dialogue was in this movie? Most of it was dominated by Kirsten Dunst walking through the palace, Kirsten Dunst looking out a window, Kirsten Dunst looking longingly at oblivious Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI. Were they paying the actors by words uttered? 8. That Marie Antoinette's life was boring is a given. There was little to do, few people to talk to (fewer still who didn't gossip about you when your back was turned), and high expectations for propriety. But a modern audience doesn't need to see Kirsten Dunst walk past gossiping courtiers fifteen times to realize that they are talking about her. Coppola seems to have few points to drive home, but she drives them home with a sledgehammer. It is only a matter of time before the audience loses interest.9. The budget for this film must have been huge. The locations are grand (the French government allowed the crew special permission to film in Versailles), the costumes are amazing. Why more of this budget could not have been spent on adequate screenplay, I don't know.10. Maybe someone convinced Sofia Coppola to include modern music in order to keep the audiences awake.Roger Ebert's rating: A My rating: C-",Marie Antoinette
329,rlavender4,What were you hoping to see?,8,21 November 2016,"I wonder if the low rating on this movie has to do with peoples' expectations. If you were hoping for an accurate, crystal clear historical drama, then you ought to look somewhere else. If you were looking for a well done piece of cinema, then come on in. I'll break my review down into a few different categories. Cinematography: 10/10 this film was beautifully shot. Ms. Coppola was very skillful in her use of colors, angles, clarity, and whatever other magic she invoked to make this movie so visually pleasing. Script: 6/10 The film came off as fairly taciturn. There's nothing wrong with that, but when characters did venture to speak, they didn't say anything particularly profound. Realism: 6/10 I gave it more than a five because I think that the point of this film's seeming disconnect from reality was deliberate and employed for the purpose of expressing the queen's own selfishness and obliviousness. I was bothered by the fact that the film showed little of the struggle that the lower class citizens of France faced -- until I realized that was partially the purpose of the film.Acting: 7/10 I think all the supporting characters did very well. Kirsten Dunst was a good Marie Antoinette, although some of her speaking scenes were less convincing :| I think I'll come out and say it, I don't think she's very good at speaking parts. She is lovely and uses facial expressions to tell her story, but as far as verbal execution, there is much to be desired. Sorry! Jason Schwartzman did an excellent job. I loved his and Dunst's scenes together. This film had many familiar faces and I really enjoyed their performances. Music: 8/10 I haven't checked other reviews, but i imagine that there were some boo-hooers that disliked the director's choice to include rock music. I liked it because for the modern day viewer, rock signifies rebellion, fun, youth and carelessness. WHICH PERSONIFIES MARIE ANTOINETTE. Also, there's a violin piece that's comically used several times which I appreciated. Summary: I think this film is excellent for anyone like myself who enjoys beauty. I would have liked a little more introspection by Marie Antoinette, but I think that the director/writers were trying to keep the film somewhat unbiased by not imposing too much of their own interpretations on the viewer. While not a perfect film, it is a lovely one.",Marie Antoinette
330,mareserenitatis,mixed opinion,5,20 October 2006,"I'm of mixed opinion when it comes to Marie Antoinette. The movie itself was different from anything I've seen before. There was minimal dialog, yet the storyline, what there was of it, was easily conveyed. The passing of time was not well depicted, but there were moments of humor. For almost every negative aspect, there was a positive aspect that could almost balance it out. However, I was highly disappointed by the ending. There was no clear end to what happened. Unless a person had actually studied french history, there was no way of knowing what happened next. There were many sequences within the movie that could easily have been cut in order to make room for a more complete ending. While I was prepared to the leave the theater with mixed emotions, I instead left feeling disappointed due to the lack of closure.",Marie Antoinette
331,ndivita,A soundtrack in search of a movie,1,22 October 2006,"There is no reason to see this movie other than to be able to say you saw it before panning it as the self-indulgent, pretentious claptrap that it it is. I have never seen anyone go from 60 to zero the way this director does from ""Lost in Translation"" to this bomb. Loving attention is given to set and costumes, for sure, but so what? As a movie, as an exercise in visual story-telling, with characters and a plot that matters, it is an abject failure. You end up rather promptly not caring about any of the characters and wishing the movie would end, soon. Even if you step back and try to understand what the director/writer was trying to accomplish, it is hard to believe this hit the mark. The movie is pointlessness and witlessness and visual lard, punctuated by some cool songs that are clearly intended to overcome the pointlessness and witlessness and visual lard. What a shame. I do think I will download some of the songs from the soundtrack. Don't waste your time or money seeing the movie, however.",Marie Antoinette
332,york74,A perfect example of counterhistory,8,21 November 2006,"I finally saw the movie: I really was prepared not to like, but in the end I enjoyed it very much. It's not a movie about the real Marie Antoinette. It's just a personal dream about her and in that sense the film works beautifully in my opinion. I did not find it boring at all. It was a pleasure to watch, like a picture to be framed. And despite its countless inaccuracies, it is even more historically accurate than some would-be historical movies like ""Elizabeth"". And in the end I found some of my personal Antoinette in Coppola's vision. It's a perfect example of counterhistory, which must be watched with an open mind.",Marie Antoinette
333,jsnauwaert,"What a tasteless, meaningless sequence of pics!",2,15 June 2006,"Rarely saw such a pointless movie! Well, that is, if we can talk about a movie in this case. After seeing it, I became rather convinced that the order in which the images follow each other, could be put in any, arbitrary order to obtain almost the same effect (boring!!) as the original 'movie'. The character, as presented in the movie, of Marie-Antoinette, is utterly uninteresting. Hard to imagine why anyone would like to make a movie with as main focus this person. Arriving at Versailles, she very soon gets bored and equally soon gives away to costly forms of escapism: opera (the least costly, I suppose), expensive costumes, hairdressing, parties ... But, what is worse, we as an audience get even more bored than she does. Not one character is strong, pronounced or interesting. Of course, she gets criticism for her egocentric, egoistic behavior that costs a fortune, even considering the wealth of the royal family and entourage at that time at Versailles. And the common people, heating up for the French Revolution - that by the way, is not portrayed in any depth in this movie neither - and suffering more and more from hunger, of course also expresses its criticism on M-A. The thing more than half the time of this far too long movie is spent to however, is on the procreation of the royal dynasty, or rather, on the danger of non-procreation of it, since the consummation of the marriage isn't taking place. For this big problem, M-A is constantly receiving warnings and strongly recommended to put an end to this drama. Perhaps Sofia Coppola tried to make some sexual portrait of this epoque, I am not sure, but it is a fact (well, if we are to believe the movie with respect to this sexual related matter) that precisely concerning this point, M-A is the least to blame, the reason simply being an very inhibited and very clumsy husband (the future king Louis XVI). But, in all cases, the woman, - or in this case the future queen - seems to have been held responsible for the non consummation of the marriage. Well, in the end, the problem is solved, and M-A will give birth to two children, the second being a boy (the dauphin) who will of course be held responsible for the continuation of the glorious dynasty of the Louis, at least, if the French Revolution will not prevent that from happening, which it will. OK, lots more could be said on this movie, but I'll stop here. The pity is not only that this movie obviously painfully failed, but moreover that it failed with a very promising cast. I wouldn't say that Kirsten Dunst is a great actress, but with a total lack of any good or consistent script, she simply didn't get a fair chance. The other actors are even worse off: Sofia Coppola simply doesn't focus at all on anyone else than M-A, so an excellent actor like Jason Schwartzman doesn't even get a chance at all to save something from the total loss. A shame! I hope Sofia Coppola won't make another movie for a very long time now (or not at all), or if she does, that a good script writer will have been there to support her and hopefully a dozen of very good advisors of all kinds.",Marie Antoinette
334,aquabuzz08,Unfair reviews,8,6 August 2020,"I honestly don't get the hate that I see on here for this movie. I can't be the only one that sees that the way Coppola has captured Marie Antoinette is as a sad lonely young woman who is at first unsure of her hold of her place in the society she's been thrust into and so throws herself into her vices and like many teenagers is unaware of the damage her actions are causing and therefore ends up too deep and too selfish to completely give it all up.
I saw one person complain that the film completely ignores the revolution... This person has clearly missed the point of the film being an insular look at a young woman thought by many to be a villian of history and NOT a study of this particular French revolution.
Yes the film ends without a trial or a hint of the family's execution and somebody here thought that was dumb in case the audience didn't know the real truth but honestly, who doesn't go into a film like this without at least some idea of the history or at least the ability to Google it!My only real complaint is that they didn't specify/explain the 'condition' that meant she stayed at her country estate for so long. It seemed like years.",Marie Antoinette

Some details turn out to be quite anachronistic the colors of the clothes, some behaviors and Marie Antoinette who appears like a modern teenager. Anyways the costumes and the scenography are surely worth seeing. Apt for teenagers who get easily bored by watching serious biographies!",Marie Antoinette
336,scottevil76,This years love it or hate it film,9,2 December 2006,"There will probably be no other film this year that will divide its viewers more than Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette. Coppola has made this years love it or hate it film. This film divided the critics at the Cannes Film Festival and few people even booed it during the screening. Some may find this film to be overly trite but in my opinion Coppola has made a wonderful film. She has captured her historical muse with artistic style and has made a provocative film about being blinded by superficiality. Everyone who has stayed awake in world history class knows about Marie Antoinette, who has gotten the rap as one of histories biggest ditz. She was known to have said, ""Let them eat cake,"" when asked how to solve France's famine. Antoinette probably really never said it but the line has made her so iconic. Coppola's film looks at the world though the eyes of this girl and concentrates on her life from when she arrives to Versailles from Austria as a girl of 15. She is greeted at France to a very snooty welcome and goes to become queen of France. In her title of power turns to everything her heart desired. Such as fancy shoes, ridiculous wigs, elaborate gowns and partying till the sun comes up. The script was loosely adapted from an acclaimed biography of Antoinette by Antonia Fraser. Sofia Coppola truly knows how to capture youth, particularly girlhood. She has masterly captured the dreamy side of teenage girls in The Virgin Suicides. Lost in Translation captured youthful loneliness and resulted in a spiritually moving film. Marie Antoinette feels like Coppola combined her themes of Suicides and Translation and portrays them through Antoinette. She goes for more of a simpatico approach and gives some insight of what kind of woman she was. Ultimately Coppola's general thesis of the character of Marie Antoinette is that she was misunderstood and above all just a girl who wanted to have a little fun. Kirsten Dunst stars as the title role. I personally have always found this actress to be very charming and she brings just that to the role of the pampered queen. Dunst brings warmth to Antoinette and you are able to find empathy with her. The supporting cast includes Jason Swartzman as Louis XVI. He comically underplays Louis as being a young man way over his head. Two of the films sauciest performances come from actresses Asia Argento as Madame DuBarry and Rose Bryne as Duchesse de Polignac. These two actresses fit their roles perfectly and are a hoot to watch tear up the place. Coppola beautifully captures the theme of superficiality by using the main center piece of the film to her advantage, which is Versailles. The actual palace of Versailles was used in the film and it's superbly captured. There are extravagant shots of the garden fountains and one particular scene in the Hall of Mirrors, which was opened exclusively for the film. Versailles is used by Coppola to be a fortress protecting its inhabitants from the outside world. Coppola films her actors in Versailles as if they were a box of candies. Everything feels somewhat sweet and stylized. Antoinette and her pose of duchesses are dressed in their finest and parade around the palace like the 18th century pop stars that they were. Coppola also does something very interesting in editing the film. She edits many sequences scored with contemporary rock music. During Antoinette's birthday party New Order's Ceremony scores the scene and the result is breathtaking from a cultural perspective by adding a little of the new to the old. The film opens with Gang of Four's song Natural's Not in It. It's in this scene introduced by the new wave rock song when the viewer gets a reminder that this isn't the average period piece. The films greatest strength is that it captures ignorance beautifully. Marie was blinded by her own silly life that she had no clue what was going on in the world around her and resulted with her literally getting her head handed to her. Coppola takes the approach to skip over the French Revolution and chooses to show the world through the ignorance of Antoinette. What resulted when I was watching the film was that I as well was seduced by its glamour as well. The outside world didn't exist to its characters and I could see how you could easy get raped up in it. The film ends at the beginning of the climax, when Antoinette's bubble protecting her is burst by an angry mob who has stormed Versailles. Coppola chooses not to show her execution and there is really no need to see it. The climax returns to a much needed reality to the film and leaves the viewer in the same bewilderment as its main characters.",Marie Antoinette
337,bluebrando,More like an extended trailer than a movie,2,18 February 2007,"I know a good amount about Marie Antoinette, and have always found her an interesting character in history. So naturally I was excited when I heard there was to be a movie made about her. I watched it with two friends, one of which knew pretty much nothing about Marie Antoinette, or the French evolution. There is no way that someone could fully understand this movie without knowing about the French revolution and Marie Antoinette. The only thing clear in the movie is that Marie Antoinette is upset about her life and attempts to make things better by spending. There is hardly any dialogue. The pieces of dialogue that are in the movie are basically gossip. There are multiple scenes where there are two different groups of people gossiping about different things, the focus constantly switching between the two- it was not very easy to follow along. The modern music in the movie did not work - why would modern music go with a historic movie anyway?? None of the songs ever really coincided with what was going on, except maybe when ""I Want Candy"" was played..which was one of many pointless scenes. One scene showed various pairs of shoes that Marie Antoinette was obviously picking from, and in the background there was (as plain as day) a pair of purple converse. I am sure it wasn't some kind of mistake, so what was the point of putting them in there? Basically, whatever Coppola was aiming for, she didn't achieve. It was kind of like when someone in high school writes a history report at the last minute and just throws in bullshit.",Marie Antoinette
338,obscure_note,artistry orgasm,7,21 June 2007,"Marie Antoinette is simply stunning, stunning, stunning! It doesn't have a lot to tell, and facts-wise, you'd be better off reading the biography. But this movie is great as it delights the senses. I am usually very detached from the environment, but this piece of Sofia Coppola's jolted my senses. In a good way. The decor, the costumes (courtesy of Milena Cananero, the same lady who dressed up the cast of Life Aquatic), and the brilliant soundtrack (chosen specially by Sofia herself I'm pretty sure - the girl has good taste) and the beautiful cinematography (long gaze of the palace, close-up shots of big fat colorful pastries on china's, pretty cards, wine overflowing glasses, among others) all contribute to this artistic masterpiece. Not too mention the amazing acting by Kirsten Dunst. She doesn't explode dramatically like Jolie or act in the stoic way like Johansson, but rather she breathes life into her acting in little subtle moves & expressions, and this to me, is a work of genius. This movie is a work of genius. Caution: not for the cynical.",Marie Antoinette

340,laura-bingham1975,Marie-Antoinette: a fragile frigate balancing dangerously on a bejewelled powdered hairdo,8,1 December 2006,"Sofia Coppola's Marie-Antoinette is a colorful, yet sensitive portrayal of France's best known queen. It is not a complex historical account and those wishing to indulge in all the intrigues of court, political engagements and the celebrated Affair of the Necklace will be disappointed. In evoking the extravagance of the French monarchy, the film's mise-en-scene is rightly excessive. Its gilded Versailles set, its parades of shiny satin gowns, pink ribbons, feather boas, lace embroidered corsets, diamond necklaces, chiffon and all manner of silk or ermine mules, its generous fixation on a festival of patisseries - from ice-blue cream cakes, petits-fours, strawberry and Chantilly choux-pastry to silver coated almond dragees that dance around layers of frothy icing - all contribute to the opulent effect. The film comes nothing short of evoking a multi-layered pastel cream gateau. The main theme is excess and that excess can not buy happiness. The young clique, consisting of Marie-Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), Duchess De Polignac (a very Adjani-looking Rose Byrne), Princess Lamballe (Mary Nighy) is shown scene after scene, indulging in heavy gambling, frigate shows, clandestine masquerade balls, picnics, cream cakes, the latest fashions and competing for the tallest powdered hairdos. The consumerism and sensory overload portrayed in the film parallels our own generation's vain search for comfort and happiness through reckless spending and indulgent living. The modern rock score may even allow young audiences to relate to the youthful insouciance of the teenage royals. But it's not all about partying hard and trying on pretty mules. There are relevant themes of peer pressure, dealing with authority,conformity,rebellion, gossip, sexual education (or discomfort) and loneliness. It is unlikely that a teenager today would relate to Marie-Antoinette's life, but if anything, the film makes her character more accessible. The film begins when the 14 year old Antonia, youngest daughter of Austria's Marie-Therese is escorted to France. At the Rhine border she is publicly stripped of her clothes, family, friends and every other Austrian possessions. We can already emphasise with the painful psychological ordeal that Antonia is forced to endure when she robbed of her identity and newly called ""Antoinette"" by the French. But if stripping naked before strangers can bring any teenager to tears, the hurdles that ensue are none the less daunting. The Dauphine must adapt to the highly invasive court etiquette which sees her tedious morning toilette orchestrated by the decorous Comtesse De Noailles (a hilarious Judy Davis), together with just about any ladies of the court. Overall, the film succeeds in painting the essence of Marie-Antoinette's frivolous yet bored existence in Versailles and her increasingly strained relations with the court. The limited political coverage is well chosen for its relevance today. In one scene, Louis XVI is advised by his ministers to send help to the American revolutionaries simply because France does not want the English to win the war. These few lines are very thought provoking. Here we have France as a super power, riddled with heavy debt, yet playing chess at the world battlefield. I couldn't help but be reminded of one particular super power today behaving in exactly the same way... A further thought provoking notion is that much is remembered of America's role in delivering France during World War II, yet France's enormous contribution towards Americans during the war of independence from Britain is simply forgotten. In particular, I am referring to the countless jokes made at France's expense, exposing the French as weak when they refused to partake in the 2003 Iraq invasion. But putting aside the allegories and ironies evoked, the scene also works in favor of Marie Antoinette's reputation. It works because it reveals a truth about the French Revolution: Marie-Antoinette was a scapegoat. Firstly, the debts faced by the French monarchy were legacies of Louis XIV (who, after all, built the grand palace of Versailles in the first place) and Louis XV. Further, while Marie Antoinette soon curbed her spending and spent generously on charity in her later years, France was still faced with the more pressing financial burden of her contribution to the American war of Independence. In the end, Marie-Antoinette was used as point of reference for those wishing to infuriate the mob. And it worked. Because few things are more detestable than a beautiful, rich and foreign woman.Dunst was highly suited to her role as Marie-Antoinette, not only physically, but she imbued her interpretation with the combined dosage of frivolity, playfulness, secretiveness and strength that one would need to endure (or escape?) the cruel palace gossip, the boredom, and the 7 year long public tirades about her inability to produce an heir. Jason Schwartzmann is convincing as her husband, the weak yet eager to please Louis XVI, a shy, awkward young man who grapples 7 years with impotence.Apart from Kirsten Dunst, I thought the cast was well chosen if underutilised. Louis XV's experienced worldly lover, Madame Du Barry, is the voluptuous and piquante Asia Argento. In her interpretation, she is not far from her role as Charlotte in Queen Margot but with an added dose of worldly vulgarity and maturity. Du Barry's richly dark colored dresses and heavy jewels offer a striking contrast with the light pastel and ribbon attire of the younger court. In one scene, while Dunst struggles with the impotent Schwartzman in a pure white, over-sized dressing gown, Asia is seen purring in saucy red garters to incite King Louis. Du Barry's well thought out wardrobe imbues her character with a sinful, sensual air that make her perceived threat to the young Dauphine all the more believable. I found the dialogue devoid of depth. It may have been intentionally empty, perhaps to make the point that all play and no wit make life in Versailles awfully artificial and boring. I concede that the focus was on the set and main character's life but nevertheless the lack of an engaging script would be the film's weak point.",Marie Antoinette
341,dkbengel,A treat for the senses...if you are blind and deaf.,1,4 July 2008,"Having witnessed the greatness (the true and amazing GREATNESS) of Sophia Coppola's directorial debut (Lost in Translation), I felt near giddiness when finally sitting down to watch her sophomore project. And I state for the record that this film is truly beautiful to look at, with some of the finest costuming and set design I have ever seen. Indeed, Sophia seems to have more than made up for the understated tones and look of her first film and gone in completely the opposite direction in as far as Art Direction is concerned. But here the grandeur and wonder stops.In EVERY OTHER way, this film not only fails but seems to revel in failure like a fat in-bred hillbilly on the Jerry Springer Show. Casting is atrocious, the acting worse and the direction is abysmal (rick music in the last days of the French Monarchy? Really?). Miss Dunst, who is usually a talented and charming actress is in so far above her head that she can no longer see daylight (in fact, it seems to this reviewer that her performance hit rock bottom and started digging for China). Indeed, her French accent was that of a girl raised in New Jersey (the rumor that she found the French accent too taxing seems to be correct) as she plows bravely through (if foolishly) through dialog clearly written for an actress of greater depth. It could be said that she does not so much recite her lines and stumbles blindly through them.Jason Schwartzman is equally ill-cast of the future King Louis XVI. Again, no French accent (appearently it was either beyond the two leads or they simply felt that playing French aristocracy with east coast accent was more patriotic). And again, no acting to be found on the screen what so ever.In fact, I am hard pressed to find even one high note in the entire cast. Molly Shannon? Are you kidding? At times, it was hard to differentiate her scenes in this travesty of art from any number of foolish (but wholly more entertaining) vignettes on Saturday Night Live. And yet, with only half the cast speaking with French accents (the film DOES take place in France, after all), the other half speaking in British accents for no apparent reason (I kid you not) and the two leads speaking accents that did not actually exist at this time and place, Miss Shannon is spared being the worst thing in this flaming bus wreck of a film.Add in the modern day rock music (yes, rock music) and an ill-earned sense of epic story telling and one can easily imagine other films playing in the same multi-plex as Marie Antoinette bursting into flames just from being in the general area of this bomb.In Hollywood, the saying goes, you are only as good as your last picture. For the sake of the many talented people who worked hard on this picture, I pray to God Above that they find meaningful work on a truly wonderful project and soon because, lest that occur, they may end up smelling like this rancid piece of french pastry for the rest of their lives.In closing, I feel justified in saying that this film may be the feel-good movie of the year... if the year is 1945 and you are living through the fire-bombing of Dresden. Otherwise, steer clear at all costs. Who knows; the I.Q. points you save could be your own.",Marie Antoinette
342,morganchaos,"Aesthetically pleasing, but utterly plot less",4,24 November 2006,"I walked out of this movie after the first two hours of pretty pictures and no plot. I hear a lot of people talking about how it's a sensitive portrayal of Marie Antoinette's life and how great a job Sofia Coppola did with it. I am not seeing this at all. Valiant efforts are given by all involved, but it doesn't cover up a vapid, badly written script and some poor casting choices.The movie touches on various events in Marie Antoinette's life, but it doesn't string them together. Many things seem random and disconnected, pointless, or only there for filler.

344,andyniblo,Erm...,1,21 February 2008,"Right, here we go. The fact that i had to give this film a mark out of ten is unfair on my part. 1 is still too much. i feel infuriated and robbed of 2 hours of my life. f*ck you Sofia Coppola. here's why you suck: i don't know which story got shunned out of the way for you to masturbate on film for two hours, but i feel robbed of a possible genius who could have made something of substance and worth. you are not your father. get over it. f*ck even now, your father isn't your father.Coppola masquerades herself as an artist. but there isn't an artist of any kind in her. it's amazing how people who gave a good review to this film have been hoodwinked. suckered. stolen from. the one recurring theme in ALL of her films is that nothing happens and people just walk around for a while. the film has no story. the soundtrack is quite frankly ridiculous and i think that everyone is getting a little bored of American ignorance. but it's OK for US directors to change history to make money. to ignore important periods and events that formed the society in which we now live. isn't it?the American ability to forget is incredible, just as it is incredible that they can't let anything go. really, how many films about African slavery have there been? how many films about the slaughter of native Americans have there been? without a comedic twist might i add.i think that the reason Coppola focuses on such a bland time in Marie's life is because she really doesn't like her. I don't think she understands the character, and i also doubt her simple life experiences. for a film about a woman who probably got more wasted than Keith Richards, the sequences in which these activities are undertaken is devoid of any realism. i don't know how many times little miss Sofia got sh*t-faced and woke up with her head in a public urinal, but if she did it seriously doesn't show here.so, in a nutshell, rubbish, fart, balls and nonsense. excuse the profanity, but there aren't any nice words to describe this film. i suppose thats why we have swears.i don't think I'm alone in stating that the world wouldn't really be bothered if Sofia Coppola literally disappeared. the film going community are simply not waiting for another one of her tedious, repetitive and nauseating wastes of time.",Marie Antoinette
345,ronaldbee,A shallow film about shallow people,3,26 May 2006,"There are deep films about shallow people like La Dolce Vita, there are films that probe beneath the rituals of the court like The Rise of Louis XIV, there are films that are rather sympathetic to Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI but have a political and historical dimension like La Marseillaise, but Coppola's film is a shallow film about shallow people, it reveals only the surface rituals of the court, and is a bubble-head's view of history and politics. The revolution is just 'noises off' in the last ten minutes. However, the film is easy on the eye, less easy on the ear and very easy on the brain.

346,swilliams8251,My DH and I were Mesmerized by the good quality,10,24 October 2006,"I felt so much like a young girl myself, how my younger life came rushing back to me with the portrayal of Ms.Kurnst as the Archduchess, the Princess, the Dauphine and the Queen. Kirstin was perfect, her face so radiantly beautiful, and no guile there. I am surprised that the royal family got her to do tedium things at all...So, the more bravo to MA.I thought I died and went to heaven, to the costuming of the 18th century, Rococo heaven. I wanted to touch, to look at the stitches and embroidery and the undersupport of each and every costume. I wanted to feel the silk, since I knew it was silk, the way the gowns floated, were coloured and broke on the creases. I was mesmerized by the folds and the ruffles, the incredible sheer amount of work, professional and authentic recreation that went into every scene. I particularly enjoyed the blue shoes in the closet....Her little black pugs'name was ""Eggplant"", ""Aubergine"" in French! She looked just like a little fat dog, a little fat eggplant.DH already asked me if I want this film on DVD and you betcha! What I would like to find is a book of sets and costumes and their descriptions from the wardrober. Maybe I will write and ask for them.The filming was first rate. Some of the scenes seemed a bit underlit, even though they were shot outside. Others were bright. I found the beauty of the place was overwhelming. I was in total shock at the immensity of Versaille, and the immensity of the château de Versailles. This is the first time France has ever allowed free rein to shoot there, and boy does it have that POW factor. That is not paintings on the walls, people, that is actual woven silver and gold and blue fabric made for her, with her cipher woven in all over the castle, on chairs, cement swirls, windowsills, everything.I don't think I will ever be able to view Versaille in person, so this was the closest that I can, and it was so different from seeing it in photos and books. I really got a sense of perspective, and depth. I saw for the first time the 100 foot high hedges, and the Neptune fountains. I liked the quietness of Versaille, and it was so secluded from the outside world.I don't think MA was spoiled, she was just lonely and wanting to fit in with the crowd, and having fun. So she gambled away her jewelry, clothing and money. She had to make it up in the long run, and she did. She reformed the household, but it was a little too late for the French people. Poor Louis was such a stumbler, all these ""ifs"" and the royals would still be in like Flynn yet. (possibly).Where did her little son go? I thought I had studied that he was sent to live with a bourgesoise family and made to live a paupers life, but he was still known as Louis XVII, who did have heirs, but where are they? Not in Burks Peerage. I vote this film for Oscars for screenplay, sheer delight and movie ability to transport the viewer to within its realm, Many Oscars for costuming and wardrobe and scenery, set direction, props....Bravo Bravo Bravo. I loved this movie a lot. I am tired of typical movies. Hurrah to Sofia Coppola!!!! love, sheri williams",Marie Antoinette

Get a book if that's your intention.,6,28 June 2007,"This is not the best period piece ever made, but in saying that, it is far from the worst. I don't know what the point is of being a history critic when viewing a movie. All period films can be picked apart by historical falsehoods, but it's pointless to do so. You'll just loose the meaning of an entire movie in the process.Amadeus, my top favorite period piece of all time, is far from accurate. It wasn't meant to be a biography though. Likewise, Marie Antoinette was not meant to be a biography either. It's a story based loosely on a historical queen.

All of a sudden they ban together and stick it out in their home against the angry revolutionary mob. wtf! Ya the shoes and candy scenes are aesthetically pleasing but not enough to make it a good movie. Sofia Copola never gets into her main character's mind. She just treats the character like a child, with no growth, no conflict, no sense of self.

350,rotcohen,Sophia's misstep,6,23 October 2006,"An awkward young girl picks up a camera and captures something extraordinary that stirs the imagination of many and stands in defiance of big budget film-making. Francis Ford Coppola envisioned this future event of cinema as counterpoint to his notoriously traumatic experience making 'Apocalypse Now'. In a strange twist of fate it would be his daughter, Sophia, who fulfills the prophecy. Her second film, 'Lost in Translation', was a note-perfect and affecting work filmed guerrilla-style on the streets of Tokyo. This set the benchmark high for Sophia and perhaps out of a desire to push herself to her creative limits she has since chose to follow-up this minimalist success with something from the other end of the spectrum altogether, a full-on costume drama (in the opulent setting of the Palace of Versailles no less), with her latest feature, 'Marie Antoinette'. The question arises whether she can repeat the success that materialized in her low-budget exercise on this grander scale? In more ways then one 'Marie Antoinette' feels like an act of hubris, an attempt by Sophia to tame the beast of big budget film-making with the lessons learned from her past guerrilla experience that never quite succeeds. Here the historical drama is reinvented, as post-modern flourishes are used to modernize historical events while still partially adhering to some procedural accuracy in the depiction of the court of King Louis XVI, the old and the new sitting side by side in a realm of the impossible made possible by our appreciation of the universal themes they explore. The story of Marie Antoinette is not nearly as interesting as the contemplation of excess that she symbolizes, and Sophia understands this as she gives two-thirds of the film over to the voyeuristic impulse of merely watching the empty riches of aristocracy like a fly on the wall undeterred by narrative constraints. The same convincing conversations that filled the Tokyo clubs in 'Lost in Translation' now fill the halls of Versailles, full of indifference to plot-point storytelling. This two-thirds of the film is a lyrical about-face to the genre, and unfortunately stands out as a blemish due to the remaining third of the film which goes on supposing the tone of historical drama. Perhaps as a feeble attempt to justify the budget and the stature of the subject matter, Sophia half-heartedly fills in the historical context of the story with weakly arranged tangents of drama which by their very presence diminish all that surrounds it, making what could have been a bold revision of our perception of history into a creaky history lesson with frills.The fault I find with the film is not its radical departure from the genre but rather its lack of conviction. A better approach would have been to focus entirely on the trivial in the court of Versailles with little mention of the world outside of it, and follow this Austrian girl's trajectory into a world of great opulence that would titillate our own sense of materialism and draw us into the story and give us a place to contemplate our superficial tendencies. Certainly this was one motivation for the work, but it gets lost in half-measures, unsure of itself, and tries desperately to hold some vestige of historical biography into the narrative, but this hubris becomes amplified by the world of make-believe Sophia has fitted her story into; the historical talking-points sound like the misplaced voices of adults in the realm of a child's make-believe and have the same sort of nonsensical function.Part of the problem is the casting, with the choice of comedic actors like Steve Coogan, Rip Torn, and Molly Shannon to play figures in the court of Versailles it becomes problematic when Sophie decides to shift gears and play the story as if it were historical drama when in fact it is pantomime. Similarly Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzmann as the sovereigns Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI could only exist in a sort of hyper-reality fantasy that Sophie has concocted, and when she gives them historical talking-points without the knowing wink it shatters the illusion and forces us to think of the characters as caricatures of history rather than figures worthy of contemplation. Only Judy Davis seems to know her part in the pantomime and plays it up with relish, while everyone else struggles with the disjointed tone Sophia has set.Despite the riches of visual delight in each frame of this film I was never entirely drawn into the story, I always felt outside of it looking in. The costumes, the music, the make-up, the setting, are of course immensely impressive and there is truly a cinematic vision at the heart of the work to rival any of the greats, however it lacks direction. I admire what Sophia tries to do, and I am deeply fond of her aesthetic tastes but I feel with this film she has made a serious misstep and the film sort of falls apart in the editing process, unsure of where it is supposed to go. Maybe there was some hesitation to follow through on the contemplative route due to the upped ante of filming at Versailles and the specter of big budget film-making. Maybe she lost her nerve. It is really unfortunate, because I do think Sophia represents something important in modern cinema, sort of what Tarrantino did in the nineties, a sort of indie cred that she earned with 'Lost in Translation'. There is something about her, her choice of music, her guerrilla ethos, I don't know, something about her films reminds me of the blogosphere, and the variety of grass root enterprises into art that it has spawned. Maybe I am just enamored with the myth of that awkward young girl picking up a camera and making great art.Grade: C+ P.S. I am hoping it was just at my screening but I was wondering if anyone else noticed the film to be out of focus and slightly bluish throughout?",Marie Antoinette

352,socalledxchaos,One Word... Disappointing.,4,14 February 2007,"I had such high hopes for this movie. I had been waiting for months until it came out on DVD. The previews and trailers made the movie look like it was going to be amazing. Then, I buy it and watch it. How very disappointed I was. I was expecting this movie to be moving, rebellious, dangerous. I was expecting to have my attention robbed by this movie and for me to never want to take my eyes away. But after I told myself that it was going to get better for the 13th time, my hopes were beginning to plummet. There was no structure, no plot outline. It was just a bunch of chronological events compiled together with no flow to the story. I couldn't tell the climax from the rising actions. That is, if there even was a climax. Throughout the film, I barely knew what was even going on because it seemed that there were no explanations or descriptions. And I could hardly make out what some of the characters were even saying because of their whispering tones and the obnoxiously loud background music at times. Plus, none of the characters were even depicted. I knew nothing about them except that some (Molly Shannon & Shirley Henderson) had a tendency to spread childish gossip and others (Jason Schwartzman) were obscurely quiet and boring to the point where I was questioning whether or not they were alive. I found myself very confused. I also thought that the main character (Kirsten Dunst) was someone that I was going to admire or side with. That is what the previews and trailers made you believe. But while I was watching, I didn't understand why she was doing what she was doing and felt no admiration nor sympathy. Perhaps this was just because the movie didn't have enough description throughout. Maybe if more time was spent on Marie Antoinette's character and her thoughts rather than just her actions, then I might've been more on her side. However, this wasn't the case.Although the story wasn't very enjoyable, the atmosphere and settings were quite breathtaking. But it got to a point where I felt like I was watching a National Geographic documentary.If you were expecting a movie about someone being trapped by their obligations to society and breaking free from it all by just being themselves, or a movie that will inspire you by it's dangerous sense of rebellion, then you might not enjoy this one. You'll most likely finish the movie bored, depressed, and disappointed. However, it might be worth seeing because of it's beautiful settings, awesome, modern soundtrack, and it's very well acted parts. But other than that, not much else.",Marie Antoinette
353,jqapac,Marie Antoinette-Artful and Intimate,7,10 November 2006,"Sofia Coppola has directed a masterpiece concentrating on the quiet intimacies of the last royals before the French Revolution. Shot beautifully with an endless parade of amazing costumes, there were very few negatives I would attach to the film. Kirsten Dunst is tantalizing and it is difficult to take your eyes away from her every movement. Jason Schwartzman is quiet, intelligently boring and perfectly cast for King Louis XVI. Sofia adds an contemporary edge to the film through music and language but this doesn't upset the delicate nature of preserving the characters integrity. Hats off to Sofia Coppola. I loved this film. If you love art, fashion, or are interested in the elaborate and intimate nature of the eighteenth century French Royals, you will love this film.",Marie Antoinette
354,oceanblueeyes,Agree & Disagree,7,27 June 2007,"I am basing my comments on those of hafsol.Although I find hafsol's review to the extreme negative, I must say quite a lot of it is true and agreeable. Marie Antoinette was a very extravagant and ostentatious queen, yes, but Coppola's view of Antoinette as being a young princess thrust into a totally different court from the one she was born into is a very good part of the movie. True, maybe Coppola did make Antoinette a very gentle and innocent woman, but then again what was a queen to do surrounded by fortune with a husband barely noticing her? Women need love and affection! The scenery was ultra-superb and the costumes and accessories marvelous...but the songs...hmmmm...could have kept with the era I'm afraid!! I'm not saying Coppola shouldn't have any right to make the historic biopic as she saw Marie Antoinette, but she could have stuck more to the age. But hey, those costumes and wigs were extremely beautiful (altough other wigs could have been included which do not look like white dye applied to the real hair with a lot of hairspray!!) Many keep saying Kirsten Dunst doesn't have a thing good in portraying the Queen. Personally, I like her! Not because I'm some kind of fan of Spiderman or anything, I just liked her. In my point of view Sofia did actually manage to make Kirsten look from a young 14-year-old to a woman. I liked Kirsten in the role. But Asia Argento...Madame du Barry was blonde! Personally I would have actually preferred Angelina Jolie...she has a more seductive and mistressy look and stamina...but anyway. And Jason in the role of Louis XVI...NO WAY HOSE!!! If one sees 'Affair of the Necklace' by Charles Shyer one would see how great a resemblance Louis XVI is in that movie to the real dauphin. As for Jolie Richardson, another triumph in look-alike! I was, in agreement to hafsol's comments, very disappointed with the ending! No guillotine, no Jeanne de la Motte Valois, no Cardinal de Rohan, no necklace...too much interesting material left out! Should Sofia have made a similar ending to her movie as that of 'Affair of the Necklace' would have been grand!!",Marie Antoinette
355,andestrega,A 2 Hour Music Video of Kirsten Dunst in Great Costumes,3,30 August 2021,"A great cast with incredible wardrobe and makeup. Unfortunately, it lacks any plot and storyline, and focuses far too much on the repetitive nature of the start of Louis XVI & Marie's failed romance attempts. Essentially, that's the entire first hour of the film. (Going to bed, no sex tonight, breakfast, go to bed, no sex tonight, breakfast, and repeat... For an hour.)The rest of the film are very stylized glimpses into Marie Antoinette's lavish and extravagant outfits and socializing sessions with her friends, none of which have much dialogue, with various shots of Kirsten Dunst draping herself over couches and beds giggling to a modern 80's punk soundtrack.The story focuses so much on the parts mentioned above, that it completely leaves out any actual storyline, which should have been the French Revolution and Marie Antoinette's part on it.When the story finally starts to get interesting, the movie stops short and ends! I couldn't believe it. I was shocked that in this 2 hours, we did not get to see the end of Louis and Marie's story, which is undoubtedly some of the most interesting parts of the story.It felt like a complete waste of time. =(",Marie Antoinette
356,AaronRichmond,Flows like a nostalgic memory in your subconscious,10,30 December 2006,"I admit, going into the theater I was already a Sofia-fanatic, and I had built up the hype of this film so much, everyone that I knew told me I was doomed for disappointment. I wasn't - I loved this film; and, I'm aware that even though this is true, many people won't like it (it's amazing the indifference Ms. Coppola brings). I'm also aware that in the confines of this small review, I cannot persuade people to love this movie more than they already do, or more than they might hate it, just as I will not be influenced by a seminar on the immensity ""Armageddon"" had on the action genre.As the director's third film, ""Marie Antoinette"" is Coppola's most opulent and lavish film, with the 40 million dollar budget to prove. The cinematography, sets, and costumes shine in the film's afternoon, lazy-daisy atmospheric sunlight. Coppola's ode to nature is apparent from the start to finish. The quaint sounds of the wind and chirping birds give the film an airy, and somewhat angelic, feel (the juxtaposition of these natural sounds versus the painfully structured court and etiquette give light to Coppola's mindset that this is not natural life). ""If we assume man has been corrupted by an artificial civilization, what is the natural state? The state of nature from which he has been removed? Imagine, walking up and down the forest without industry, without speech, and without home."" Rousseau's quote is pitch-perfect in identifying this balance, and is fit beautifully into the film.New York, London, Munich, Paris, everybody talk about Pop Muzik. Yes, I do think M's ""Pop Muzik"" would have worked wonderfully into some of the movie's candy-filled and excessive decorum-fiend montages. I also feel like buying Coppola a copy of a Cocteau Twins album and demanding a director's cut (one that didn't include a Bow Wow Wow version of ""Fools Rush In""). Anyway, the pop music worked. Not only did it put Antoinette's age in perspective, but also allowed a fresh twist on a dulling genre. Although, I do think the original ""Age of Consent"" by New Order would have worked lyrically well over ""Ceremony"" or even the gang of Four track. The classical pieces were wonderful as well (Dustin O'Halloran's piano solos are magnificent in displaying the melancholy of her later life, as well as the echoing sounds of boredom that filled the Versailles halls).""Marie Antoinette"" is an intimate experience. Let the celestial bliss that is the blue-sky aura of the film soak into your senses.",Marie Antoinette

There was not enough acting, did Sophia think Kristin could not handle more words. Maybe, Sophia must have been lazy this time at giving lines. I wish I could get a refund,on the movie. I could have waited for it to be on television, I was very disappointed. The scenes were great, the costumes were great.I felt like I was watching people dressing up and having a party. I could got a bunch of people together a did a role play party on my own. I and the others that came with me, kept watching waiting for it to pick up. Then the end came, surprisingly there was no end. Marie had 4 children, went to prison... Got her head decapitated. I think someone out there could have done this movie better!!! Come on Sophia you wasted money, not giving this piece of life biography more. My advice wait and save a dime see it on Television.",Marie Antoinette
358,aznxheart,Wonderful .,7,1 November 2007,"This movie is beautiful . I do agree that it was kind of boring , the first part of the movie went okay , it when boring once in a while ; but the scene where Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) was running through the gardens, and the birthday party gave a brilliant scene . The music was fantastic too . The costumes were beautiful , and every scene that there was a cake ; I wanted one ! The connection between Count Fersen and Marie Antoinette affair went really well. I couldn't see the connection between King Louis and Marie Antoinette ; they could have had more lines then just staring at each other , but the ending it shows that King Louis had loved for Marie as she had for him, as she reached for his hand, and he holds it . Overall , this movie was boring but BEAUTIFUL .",Marie Antoinette
359,nirvana_83,interesting perspective on Marie Antoinette but a bit ahistoric,6,30 August 2006,"I watched the movie this spring in Paris and was frankly a bit disappointed, although there were some things about the movie that I did like.What I like about the movie is it's new take on Marie Antoinette's life in Versailles. I found it interesting how the movie sought to portray her life from her perspective, as in a young Austrian girl being thrust into the complicated and pompous court life of Versailles and feeling lost and overwhelmed in the middle of it all. From this perspective, Marie Antoinette is portrayed as a young woman like any other yearning for happiness, friendship, fun, and love, and being disappointed due to her somewhat reserved husband and all the intrigues going on at the Versailles court. For instance, I found that the scene where Kirsten Dunst is shown partying with her court friends and watching the sunset together as capturing very well what it feels like to be young and have fun when hanging out with friends. The music and the scenes came together really well to capture the young lively energy that is associated with being young.Even though the movie has drawn the most criticism for its ahistorical nature, the movie capturers well that nothing has changed much in the past few centuries, and that young women have the same needs: to have fun, enjoy fashion, and yearn for love and affection. For instance, the sequences in the film that show all the Manolo Blahnik shows and Marie Antoinette's obsession with fashion reads like a contemporary music video documenting fashion and music.The movie's soundtrack is definitely a gem for those fond of 80's and french classical music and I can't wait for the soundtrack! The movie's use of 80's tune also reminded me of the movie ""plunkett and Maccleane"" with iv Tyler, which managed to merge contemporary electronic music beautifully with costume drama.As mentioned before, the movie unfortunately does lack a more well defined historical context, as Marie Anotinnette seems far removed from the social and political roots that resulted in the French revolution. Much of the era's historical happenings are put in the background although the these are tossed in once in a while.Due to lack of more comprehensive historical consideration and context, Marie Anotinnette is portrayed a bit too sympathetically, as my impression is that Coppola wanted to portray her as an innocent young girl just thrown in the chaos that is the French revolution and having nothing to do with the revolution. Even though I am not all that familiar with French history, it is commonly known that Marie Anotinette's exuberant and lavish lifestyle was instrumental in stirring up dissatisfaction and unrest among the mob and peasants, which ultimately led to the French revolution.my take on the film is: it's a fun movie for those looking for a lighthearted costume drama with cool music but not one for those looking for more serious historical context.",Marie Antoinette
360,ohbogie,Simply beautiful...a visual masterpiece,10,18 September 2008,"""Marie Antoinette"" is probably one of the most underrated, under-appreciated and completely misunderstood movies. It rarely gets the credit it truly deserves, most likely because people who were expecting a history lesson were disappointed when the movie didn't deliver. But Sophia Coppola herself said that ""this movie is not a lesson in history"" and, indeed, it's not. I never had a chance to read the book (by Antonia Fraser) the movie was based on, but it seems that in the movie they intentionally avoided all the better-known facts about Marie Antoinette (i.e. her involvement in politics, her tragic demise), and chose to focus on lesser-known facts of her personal life instead, with the assumption that people already know all there is to know about her. And if you don't know much about the French queen's life (and death), watching the movie could get pretty confusing, because it offers almost no explanation as to which event happened when and why, and who is who at the court, and how they are related to Marie Antoinette and to one another. You really have to KNOW about all the circumstances of Marie Antoinette's life and who were all the people portrayed in the movie in order to be able to understand everything. You have to know about Marie-Antoinette's somewhat unhappy (at least for the first 7 years of it) marriage to the French dauphin and subsequently king Louis XVI, you have to know about her political influence, and her fondness for fashion, opera and other arts, and about her longtime affair with Count Ferson, and that she had four children, two of whom later died. You have to know that Louis XVI had two younger brothers and that they had two wives, with all of whom Marie Antoinette was very close. You have to know who Comtesse du Barry was, and who Madame de Lamballe was, and who the Duchesse de Polignac was, and what the libelles were and what (and where) the Petit Trianon was, and so on. You have to know quite a bit about the history of France, too, at least, of that period. If you don't know any of that, it will be very difficult and confusing to watch the movie, because nothing really gets explained in it, they just throw random facts at you, clearly assuming that you have either read the book or know your history.Those who do not require a history lesson, will probably find this movie delightful - the cinematography is simply breathtaking, the costumes are unbelievably beautiful, as are the sets (if I'm not mistaken they actually filmed at Versaille). The movie is also historically accurate, which is rather refreshing. Another thing that's refreshing is the lovely unconventional soundtrack. I know that some weren't exactly happy about the fact that pop, post-punk and alternative (mostly from the 80's) were used in a film set in the 18th century and expressed their desire for more contemporary music, but I think the soundtrack was just right, it fits the visual perfectly, I can't imagine any other background music being used here. Actually, not just the soundtrack, but EVERYTHING in the movie is just right, there's not one thing that's excessive, or, on the other hand, missing from the movie - the sets, the costumes, the scenery, the music, they all complement each other perfectly, fitting together like the pieces of some incredibly, impossibly, intenesely beautiful puzzle.Another reason to love this movie - the lovely Kirsten Dunst, who is simply amazing as Marie Antoinette. She gives a wonderful performance in this one of so few sympathetic and favorable portrayals of Marie Antoinette. As for me, the main reason I love this movie (aside from its brilliant cinematography, historical accuracy, great performances and kind portrayals of historical figures whose reputations were undeservedly blackened by Jacobinian propaganda) is because I feel that Sophia Coppola not only managed to capture the spirit of the time, she also managed to create this warm, inviting atmosphere. Somehow she manages to make you nostalgic for what you never knew, for this era that is long gone. You look at all those breathtakingly beautiful images on your screen and you just want to be there. French Cosmopolitan called ""Marie Antoinete"" ""plus que un film...un happening"" (""more than a movie...an event (or a happening)""). After watching it, I think I know why.",Marie Antoinette

They get all excited at the idea of playing record producer and completely ignore the dramatic demands of the film.Marie Antoinette is a great example of the complete intellectual laziness of that approach.Instead of making the film fresh and inspiring, the use of pop songs, especially given that this is a period piece, makes the film even more trite and boring than it already was.Add to that that Kirsten Dunst is really not the best of actress in the first place and you have another dud from Sofia Coppolla.",Marie Antoinette

363,losin_grip_666,Hungry for More,10,13 November 2008,"I loved this film, Sofia really worked her magic with this film and left myself and the audience of 25 hungry for more fashion, cake and pale pink dresses. I thought the use of Rock music was such a smart technique and it worked so well in collaboration with the Opera music. The costumes were beautiful, the script was minimal- the expressions on the actors faces and the costumes spoke more than words ever could. I found the movie beautiful and quite sad, the movie had this slight sadness from start to finish. Kirsten Dunst is beautiful and enchanting as Marie Antoinette and I can't imagine someone better suited to the role of someone who essentially would've been an indie fashionista in our time. Jason Schwartzman was really good as well- I thought he played his role well and seemed lost as well which really elevated his character and made it more believable. I think the film is beautiful, evidentally- its not everybody's cup of tea. I think thats its a very modern adaptation of what you'd expect from your normal period piece, this film has attitude and is something worth seeing.",Marie Antoinette
364,chhces,Longest fragrance commercial ever !,4,6 January 2007,"Hi! I'll start for the hardest critic. The real achievement of this movie is that you really understand the character's boredom of living by living it in your own flesh.Since the beginning of the movie its clear that its entirely thought as a woman understanding another woman while writing the script. But while it could be a good point, it becomes a repetitive series of clichés and the plot turns into a mix between soap opera and cheap romantic novel full of misunderstanding and dissatisfaction.Finally, from the artistic side, it tries to disguise the lack of budget with ""artistic shots"", while, if the intention was to create an artistic movie, budget should not be the problem. That can be also applied to the scoring side of the movie.Casting, and performances are OK, if this was a short movie it would have been pretty good one, but at the end ... too many pink macaroons.",Marie Antoinette

It simply drags on and on and totally trivializes the historical events it portrays. A rare miss from the talented Sofia Coppola. I would have liked to leave it at that but IMDb has some ridiculous policy that reviews have to be 10 lines long. No wonder the other reviews I read prattled on so much.

You won't learn much about the french revolution or the social context of the times, apart from the fact that the french royalty lived in complete luxury at Versailles. But Marie Antoinette is a very captivating movie about the personal story of this Austrian girl who ends up marrying the heir to the french throne. The images and costumes are simply beautiful.

I admit Lost In Translation was better, but Marie Antoinette is still a wonderfully unique experience. Beautiful direction and photography, as well as strong performances from Schwartzman and Dunst make this, in my opinion, the second best film of the year, the first being Babel. The music choices, though risky, proved extremely effective in creating the atmosphere of the film. Compared with her other films, Antoinette may be superior stylistically and second to Lost in Translation in depth of the story.A must see for those who can tolerate directors who dare to make films that are different.10/10",Marie Antoinette
370,jan_neptune,Antoinette as seen through Axel Fersen's eyes maybe?,7,24 October 2006,"Everyone either loves it or hates it, and I for one, love it! I believe that Kirsten Dunst is pure magic! This is a movie seen through the eyes of someone who really loves Marie Antoinette, not a detractor. And it should be seen and viewed as such. Since it is narrated by her mother, it may be that she is seen as her mother wished her to be seen.For sure, it is not about a historical event, but rather is a character study. It is like eating cotton candy at the fair! It is all sweetness and light. Nothing of the starving masses...who knows of them anyway as they are just something to do for charity as has been taught so long by the nuns and priests of the church, but in reality, out of sight, out of mind.I love this movie for that reason. It is a study in the Château Du Versailles and its occupants who bring it to life. Sofia did a great job in giving a glimpse of Antoinette as she appears to those who love and cherish her.I recommend it highly...it is fun, charming, sweet, and magical! Beautifully photographed and made my day!",Marie Antoinette
371,petrow-31-127528,Great story told in an incongruous way,7,1 July 2014,"I liked this one because of the theme it tries to dissect. Marie Antoinette was a really controversial figure of the French and European history, remembered mostly as ""the hated woman from Austria"".I was glad that someone actually tried to pry this surface, to uncover the motivations, and reasons behind her actions.The most telling part was the infamous, alleged ""eat then brioche"" quote, which uncovers the deeper depths of the politics, intrigue, disparaging measures and scapegoat finding which was so much a part of the revolution, as the anger and desperation of the lower classes.The theme of the movie served as a perfect base for an excellent history movie. However, it's tone makes it somewhat hard to take seriously - even if I know the target audience was the teenage class. Pity.Still, if it is aired on TV, or your child learns about this period in history class, give it a chance.",Marie Antoinette

It looked nice, but that's about it. I was rather bored between the sparse amount of dialog that mainly centered around crude sex jokes. Seems like Sofia Coppola can't write dialouge too well, she can make it look good though(or at least her set designer can). I kind of understand how people are saying it's good at showing her loneliness. Though I think it was pulled off poorly. It really wasn't worth the 16 dollars we paid for it. I didn't feel as ripped off, but still wasn't worth that much. So if you like sparse sex jokes sprinkled around a constant display of new outfits and food go see it.",Marie Antoinette

Overall if you take simply the plot out of the movie you're left with nothing more that a fictionalization story somewhat accurate but not really about Maria Antonia. It's like Kristen Dunst gets to play dress up for 2 hours and eat strawberries, oh and nothing else happens, say like the French Revolution and their deaths. Even if you say, oh well these were the events leading up to that, no, they're not the events leading up to that. So no, not true. They play MA as if she had no power and no ambition at all and that all of her motives came from a place as innocent as KD would have you seem. Sure. What's troublesome about this old movie is the need for Sohpie Coppola to make everyone believe that MA partied it up and the only reprocess ion from that was that she had to leave her house. She also had an affair and the only repercussions from that were that she and the king lived happily ever after.",Marie Antoinette
374,JustinJHyman,Boring Antoinette,4,17 October 2006,"So, OK. Yesterday I had the great privilege of screening the press showing (attending the press screening?) of Marie Antoinette. First the good news: From what the Ole fashioned Wikipedia (as accurate as we assume it is) has shown me, it was pretty accurate historically. Though, possibly Kirsten ""you got me thirstin' "" Dunst is a little hotter than our heroine, Marie. It was pretty. Lots of pornographic (in the sense that they were indulgent) food shots and plenty of Parisian Haute Cotoure. The bad news? It was long and boring. Turns out Marie didn't do all that much besides gamble and spend money on clothes and apparently gardening. The movie rolls on and on without anything happening and I do mean anything, her young prince husband would not even bed her for several ( a couple?....who can remember) years. The movie finally begins to heat up when Marie takes a lover after the birth of her first daughter. There is some hot Man on Kirsten action that at first makes you not totally regret seeing the movie but then he runs back off to Sweden and that is that. The movie's biggest let down is in the end as it completely washes over Bastille day and the subsequent French Revolution, one of history's bloodiest revolutions but at least there was cheese. There is no trial or beheading. In fact, the movie ends with King and Queen riding off in a coach. Though wait., do i smell a sequel?",Marie Antoinette

If you are an American intrigued with the interplay and influence of the American revolution on the French Revolution, skip this movie! It is an insult to anyone that has any regard for the truth. The amount of historical content in this vapid exercise of costume and frivolity can be summed up in a short paragraph, or a short scene. And Sophia Cuppola (writer/director), I see that your net worth is estimated at 20 million. I think you may be part of the problem. Do you have any concept what it is like to be poor? Why didn't you include in the movie any content about the the obscene contrast between the wealth of the French nobility at the expense of the rest of the population (the 99.99% in Bernie's parlance)? Sophia, you successfully created a movie that captured a lot of teenage eyes, ears, and brains. It is a travesty that you completely wasted an opportunity to show that the significance of Marie Antoinette's life was that she typified the symbolic and literal end of the long overdue death of the Monarchy and the disparate distribution of wealth that made it possible (a concept that is 100% relevant today)! You got one half of the equation, the obscene wealth and frivolity of the court. You completely missed the other half, the desperate poverty (many of them literally starving) of those paying for the excesses of the ruling class. So to put it in Charles Dickens terms, the movie is ""The Tale of ONE City"". By the way, the perfunctory ending that fails to show that Marie and her King were executed is ridiculous!

378,yellowraver05,Excellent!,10,5 June 2006,"I am not really a Sofia Coppola fan, but I did love her work in the Virgin Suicides ( I really couldn't care less for Lost in Translation), but her Marie Antoinette is an experience anyone who loves movies should endure. While on a vacation trip to France to visit a cousin, we decided to go see the film, since it had premiered at the Cannes Film Festival just three days before I got there. My cousin had told me that while the reviews over there had been ecstatic and raves, some of the french press booed at the press screening. To be honest, from that reaction, I immediately thought the movie was going to suck, but then I remembered whatever the critics hate, I end up loving, so I gave it a shot. This movie blew me away! I of course had found out before hand that this film has nothing to do with the revolution, or the beheading of the last king and queen of France. So I went in there with knowledge that I wasn't expecting a boring period BBC dramatization of Marie Antoinette. The film is glorious to look at! The costumes are simply the the greatest costumes ever constructed. We are used to seeing 18th century costumes with wild plooms, and explosive beading and diamonds every where adorned, but these costumes were much more simpler but had a dramatic effect to the eyes ( this is so winning best costumes at next years Oscars). The actors were tremendous particularly Dunst, who whenever I would read threads about Antoinette on here would be bashed because some people said that she cant act, or she could never pull off this role. Believe me, she does (if campaigned right, she could so get an Oscar nomination for this)! She excels as the doomed Queen of France in every way imaginable! She is a frightened teenager in the beginning of the film, trying to please everyone even her overbearing mother (played by the wonderful Marianne Faithful), and you automatically identify with her. Here is a girl who has no friends, no close companions, and while she tries to please her husband, he (jason Swarchtzman, great as always) just blows her off, because he feels that he is not the kind who likes to have sex! So she grows up in the palace of Versailles's, and gets her reputation as a bit of party girl who loves parties, clothes, jewelery, company of women (who wouldn't want that if at 19 become ruler of a powerful decadent country) till finally when she has her children you see her mature and become a loving mother, and a devoted wife. Sofia has made an excellent movie. Sure the script does lack a certain depth to some characters, but remember this isn't your mother's Marie Antoinette. This a new wave Marie Antoinette, and Sofia excels in her vision! But this film isn't for everybody. If you have a problem with rock music used in a period film then you may cringe at some of the moments when the songs are used. Also if you expect to see a full blown bio of the Queen, then you are dead wrong, because this film explores how one minute Antoinette was the toast of France, to the last where she finally accepts her fate as the last and doomed Queen of France. It is a very good movie. I highly recommend it.",Marie Antoinette

380,loucrunch,bored by boredom,4,12 November 2006,"This movie had so much potential. It started well with the changeover from a princess of Austria to a future queen of France and showing us her intimidated perspective as she's escorted into Versailles. And the elaborate -- and ridiculous -- rituals of dressing and undressing. But then it goes nowhere.I was bored by the boredom of it all. The movie was pointless, the characters never developed, we never understood the relationship of MA and Louis, or how her friendships developed. If the point was the belated consummation of the marriage which happened I think two-thirds through the movie, why not end it there instead of fast-forwarding through the last few years of her life? The cinematography and costuming were great, the rest not so much.",Marie Antoinette
381,KingKongSux,Oh my god...,1,29 March 2007,"I watched this movie during a long 12 hour flight from Tokyo to Detroit, and afterwards I wanted to jump out of my seat and into the Pacific Ocean.This was soooo boring.. I don't understand how anyone could rate this thing above a 1.The only reason I watched it til the end was to see Kirsten Dunst get her head chopped off.. And that didn't even happen..Awful.. Just awful.I never thought anything could be worse than King Kong, until I watched this..",Marie Antoinette
382,mike0011,Boring! horrendous!,1,24 October 2006,"After a long and tiring day my wife (25) and I (30) decided to relax and see this movie she thought would be interesting. What a grave mistake! It turned out to be the most boring movie we saw since... ever! A complete waste of 2 hours. The worst part - the feeling of guilt for the lost time. Going home and sleeping would be a more interesting endeavor. The movie seemed to have no point, no plot, or purpose. The brilliance of actors made this a little more bearable, but not enough to get any enjoyment. Oh, and I must mention the music was probably the worst part. The music and songs seemed to have no relationship to the scenes. They did not fit the genre, the rhythm, the time or the meaning. For the first time in my life I actually walked out before the movie ended and went to play the arcades while my wife would finish watching it. BTW , she said the ending sucked too. Absolutely horrendous!",Marie Antoinette
383,acarter01,decadence at its finest,7,15 November 2006,"Marie Antoinette is like a banquet in terms of aesthetics. as Immanuel Kant commented on aesthetics, ""enjoyment"" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be ""beautiful"" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Marie Antoinette does just this. to begin, In the beginning scenes where,at the tender age of 14, she is given away, a rush of sympathy rises for this naive and beautiful young lady. It is indeed poignant to think she was literally stripped naked and thrust into a foreign world. her adaption to this brand new world is both furiously decadent and fabulously seductive to watch being played out. Coppola uses juxtaposition to emphasise her gaucheness yet beguiling charm, the latter of which really develops throughout the film.The soundtrack really adds to this muddled capturing of youth. Siouxie and the banshees compliments the sexy ballroom scene. one wishes they could be a part of this world. the whole production reverberates with a current of sexuality, with the innuendos passed around as idle gossip to the sensual sex scene towards the end. even Marie Antoinette's royal husband bares some element of attractiveness with his growing loyalty to his young wife in the progress of the film. the scenery itself cannot be forgotten. in typical regal style, every scene is filled with lavish mementos of wealth and power. from the royal paintings adorning the walls to the delicious gourmet cakes passed around at the parties, Coppola has let no opportunity for visual flair pass.although the character studies perhaps deviated from history's vision of the characters, Coppola really has painted a lively and powerful slant on all, mostly on Marie Antoinette herself. she is beautiful, kind, witty and a committed mother.as it seems with all Sofia's work, an element of pathos seems to lie beneath the surface. throughout the playing out of the film one cannot help feel this luscious lifestyle will play itself out with horrific circumstances. and so it does. the ending scene, with its beautiful use of light delivers one of the most memorable lines i've ever heard. it certainly stayed. dunst's acting was perfect for her role, with her impish yet reflective nature streaming through. This film really deserves its title. the film is not a comment on history. it is not a comment on the danger of indulgence. it is simply a tale of a delightful young woman in an enviable position who allows us a glimpse into her gorgeous yet sometimes difficult path. as she is driven away at the very end, one is sad to leave the fairytale that was her life.",Marie Antoinette
384,tjpst26,The Never Ending Non-story!!!!,3,20 October 2006,"I didn't know what to expect when coming into the theatre for this movie. The playful pop music, glitz and glamor of the commercial, and pink graphic with her name scrawled in a very informal manner gave me a sense of some indie take on the life and times of the unfortunate Queen. But what you get is something thats just so hard to define. I initially gave it a 1 because the plot seems to go NOWHERE, but after much thought I recast my vote for the following reasons: 1) The music will at times draw you in with a pop tune well timed, and push you away with classical symphony boredom. That push and pull added a layer to the film. 2) Some of the imagery is actually spectacular, and really draws you into a calm lazy summertime feel. 3) There were rare, and brief instances where something was funny, in a sad or odd way.Now for the problems(WARNING SPOILER ALERT): First and foremost the plot isn't even there, it's like a movie about nothing (and not in the funny Seinfeild way). You wait til the end and think that at least the mob will behead her and there will be a neat end to the thing, but she isn't beheaded! Secondly, literally thirty minutes of this film is composed entirely of shots of confections, cakes and candies. It's like one big add for a candy shop! Third, the use of ""pregnanat pauses"" is so profuse, that at times its like a silent movie. Fourth, and probably the oddest of them all, many of the actors don't even try for an accent at all (be it French, British, or Austrian), but then right next to those who speak regular American English are those that toss on a french accent. Worse yet her child speaks only French! It's like some of them simply decided that they would show off that they could do the accent and the others thought, ""meh, why bother"".All in all, a completely worthless waste of two hours of your life; and as strange as it may seem, if you do see it you'll likely have hours and hour worth of material to complain, and think over with your friends. If it was they're goal to make a movie people would talk about they have succeeded. However, they should have specified whether they wanted the talk to be good or bad.",Marie Antoinette
385,soreynolds,Pants!,3,2 June 2007,"Pants Pants Pants, Had to resort to Wikepedia to properly understand what happened to them both. The film was completely devoid of any engagement, and was utterly pants!! Not even worth considered analysis.But since I have to write 10 lines of text I'll fill it with how bad spider man 3 was. Oh, the common factor was... Ms Dunst again! As convincing a spoil to a boy bitten by a spider as she was as the missus to the almost impotent king of France.By the way as an aside I have never come across such a difficult site for posting reviews, I guess this is the downside for low cost, low service. This will be my 4th attempt, the last one got chucked back for the words ""daa dum""",Marie Antoinette
386,nikki_barr44,lacking in real substance but only if viewed from a narrow minded perspective,5,22 March 2007,"Sofia Coppola's previous films have been groundbreaking and recognised as some of the most incredibly shot pictures in history. Marie Antoinette is not lacking in the visual sense at all but it does tend to lack some substance.On watching the commentary and reading what Coppola had to say about the film has changed my mind as to how effective it was.If viewed as a 'period drama' it loses it's quality and becomes boring without enough background or script. But when it's viewed as the perspective of a young woman coping with such changes and such an extraordinary life it becomes clear what Copolla wants us to see in this film.Possible one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen with a breathtaking soundtrack and an eclectic array or sets, costumes, makeup and props it certainly looks the part of that era. Kirsten Dunst has a childlike quality about her acting making her perfect for the role, she captures the character well and as the only medium the audience has to the films plot she copes well.Don't view this film as another 'The Madness of King George', view it as a diary entry made by Marie Antoinette at that time in her life (do your research). In saying that, this may not appeal to all audiences and certainly won't appeal to those who have a short attention span but to those who will like it, will love it.",Marie Antoinette
387,spacedog-11,What the...,9,22 October 2006,This is really quite a good film. While Coppola's Lost In Translation was the most overrated event of it's year it seems Antoinette is going to be the most underrated film of this year. Dunst immortalizes the tragic teenage queen. She embodies this spirit and is being unfairly ridiculed. It is a MASTERFUL performance as is the rest of the cast's!! People who cannot get into this type of film will like this. Reason is the cast is just splendid and the script does not overwhelm with a lot of historical bloating. Do not listen to the haters on this. I guess they wanted a history lesson but me I wanted to be beautifully entertained! Off with Their heads!!,Marie Antoinette
388,clare_phoebe,Intoxicating,10,21 April 2010,"This film seems to have earned a rather bad reputation, for reasons that I cannot really understand. True, it takes some liberties with history (and usually I am a stickler for accuracy!) but in this case it does not compromise the overall message or purpose of the film, instead helping to show Marie Antoinette, the doomed Queen of France, as a young woman caught up in events that are completely out of her control, rather than the almost fairy-tale villain she has become over the years, seen to not care for the starving French peasants and being said to have flippantly proclaimed ""Let them eat cake!""The actors are far better than you may have been led to believe; all of them humanise historical figures who seem to have faded to caricatures of themselves in the centuries since their deaths. They embody the characters and conjure real feelings of pathos: Kirsten Dunst in particular is superb as Marie Antoinette, making the audience really feel her loneliness and sorrow throughout her life as well as the heady delights and pleasures of being Queen of France and having her every whim catered to. The actors use their natural accents, leaving a mix of English, American, Scottish and more, but this does not distract from the film – indeed it is far less distracting than everyone merely assuming the standard costume-drama English accent would have been!This film is a visual masterpiece, with the scenery, costumes, hair and set dressing all contributing to make an intoxicating feast for the eyes that paints a vivid picture of life at the French court, and I feel that Coppola's vision truly captures the almost ignorant decadence and opulence of the French court at Versailles at this time. The film looks like a wonderful fairy-tale, dreamlike, beautiful, elegant and perfect and the music, whilst some criticise the use of modern new wave and pop music, seems somehow to fit in with the scenes used. In particular, I loved the use of Siouxsie and the Banshees' ""Hong Kong Gardens"" during a masked ball and New Order's ""Ceremony"" during Marie's birthday party. Overall, I love this film and whilst it is not the most accurate of films, it captures the spirit of the time and gives a taste of what life at Versailles may have been like. Most importantly, it shows Marie Antoinette as a real person, showing you her life from leaving home to marry a stranger, seeking acceptance in her new country and all the difficulties her marriage and then her husband's ascension to the throne brings and always leaving you feeling terribly empathetic and sympathetic for the poor, naïve Queen of France, who seems to have meant well but been terribly out of her depth.",Marie Antoinette
389,MrSnuffles,Terrible Portrayal.,1,14 October 2007,"Kirsten Dunst never fails to fail. Her role as the Austrian Queen of France was acted with little effort, and carried with a heavy American accent. However it was not just Dunst's lack of talent that ruined the film; it was the lack of plot, the lack of historical consistencies, and the abundant amount of melodramatic shots of Marie walking down the middle of a walkway at Versailles with some pitiful depressing expression born of her own self indulgence. One of the only redeeming qualities of the movie was Louis 16's character which was physically accurate and well acted. The film was successful in portraying that Louis and Marie Antoinette were to young to reign, however that was done so with no plot, and no purpose. One star for effort.",Marie Antoinette
390,aboodfarhood,Ugh! Then UGH!,1,27 March 2020,"There is a historical crime being committed when someone decided that K.Dunst performs as Marie Antoinette, the queen who is/was well known for being one of the most beautiful women in the entire written history of human beings. At least they could have picked some other actress that doesn't look so miserably sorry, someone who can simply SMILE right?!!Now we have K.Dunst, plays Marie Antoinette.... Ugh!!",Marie Antoinette
391,let_them_eat_war21,One of the best movies this year,10,2 November 2006,"Sofia Coppola once again proves that she is not just leeching off of her father's legend with Marie Antoinette. Sure, some may find Marie herself annoying and a boring teenage girl, but that is exactly what Coppola is trying to convey. Many people read their history books and see that Marie was a brainless bimbo that just cared about shoes and was hated by the French. The movie gives a human side showing that she was indeed only a teenager, 14 when she was married to Louis Auguste, and was thrust into Versailles, all alone, knowing not a single person. Even the scene when she has to wake up and endure the marathon of getting ready just shows the ridiculous amount of tradition that no teenager should have to be subjected to. She was bored in an isolated palace with few friends, and so she resorted to the little frivolous pleasures that she could take advantage of.The one thing people fail to recognize is that the movie is not a story about the French Revolution, the ancieu regime or anything you could simply learn in an encyclopedia. The movie is named Marie Antoinette because that's what it's about. So deal with it. If you came into it expecting to see the Bastille stormed, sorry, Marie didn't really have a lot to do with that. And as for the small inaccuracies, no period piece is completely accurate. It's the story that counts, and Coppola definitely succeeds at that.Basically, the movie is visually gorgeous, the acting is awesome, and the soundtrack is pure genius. If you can't feel the emotion and the beauty of the movie, you should check your pulse.",Marie Antoinette
392,yilaydazehra,Fresh Breath To An Controversial Historical Figure and Times,10,11 January 2021,"I loved the acting and style that immediately engulfs you in the historical atmosfere by using modern elements like its music. It was a beautiful experience with a fresh look to what all of us know from history classes, giving the higher importance to characters and their feelings instead of representing political issues of that time. Thank you Coppola for creating this unique movie.
P.S. Loved the converse scene lmao.",Marie Antoinette
393,RiverReeves,"Beautifully presented, hard to follow for first timer's.",7,7 March 2015,"Sofia Coppola shows us a sympathetic view of the ill fated Queen of France in this contemporary and youthful retelling of her young extravagant life. From her early marriage to Louis XVI at 14 to her reign as Queen at 18 and the beginning of the French Revolution and ultimately the fall of Versailles.Those of you who are not familiar with the story of Marie Antoinette or ultimately the French Revolution may find it hard to follow or rather pointless to watch as there is hardly any dialogue or explanation of the reason or cause. Or, to be fair, what she even had to do with it. Unmentioned in the film are her later incarceration, trial and execution.I was pleasantly surprised at Kirsten Dunst's performance as Marie Antoinette as I wasn't expecting much from her at all. She does a fine job of portraying a youthful and fun spirited Marie in her years of decadence and luxury.Beautiful and fun insight into the early life of Marie Antoinette as a young Queen, Mother, Party Girl and Socialite! A personal favourite.",Marie Antoinette
394,CatalinaCougar,What the hell was she thinking?,3,3 October 2006,"Being a complete fan of Sofia Coppola's, it pains me to say this, but I found this movie to be deplorable. I don't care whether she was as sexually emancipated as this version of her life story would make her out to be or whether she was as prim and proper as a Victorian spinster. It's the entire film that doesn't gel for me. I've seen other people rag on The Virgin Suicides or on Lost in Translation, but both of them so far exceed Marie Antoinette that it is hard for me to even type their titles in the same sentence. From the music choices to some of the costume to quite a bit of the casting and to the lack of character development, the whole thing just really does not work.As was mentioned by at least one other user, Sofia does have a tendency to let silence and a certain type of vagary work in her favor in relaying the story she's telling. Obviously, this worked beautifully in Lost In Translation, but she also had Bill Murray there (who is a master of mere facial expression) and the sheer madness and foreignness of Tokyo to boost her style of storytelling while also making it seem subtle yet defined. In The Virgin Suicides, this once again worked in her favor because the story relies on the mystery of these sisters and an enigmatic and ethereal quality through which the boys witnessing and relaying the story to us have toward these girls. To know the precise hows and whys of their lives and demise would be to tell a completely story than the one that is the Virgin Suicides.All that being said, when you get into historical figures, you just cannot wander into esoteric land and expect it to carry a film through. I, personally, want the meat and bones of the person even though I'm clued in enough to realize that after awhile every historical figure gets skewed one way or another. I do not believe that this movie can be defended on the grounds of poetic license. If you want to see poetic license work in a film, I would much more recommend Romeo + Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes. The director made bold choices, made it clear to the audience that he was reinterpreting a very famous work. Granted, the characters are fictitious, but given that Shakespeare wrote them and they've been reenacted for 500 years, they're as close as you can get to historical without having been living breathing human beings.All in all, really a flop in my opinion. And this from a Sofia Coppola fan.",Marie Antoinette
395,lsmelton,Not As Expected,4,22 October 2006,"The soundtrack is the only star of this film. It is clear no one thinks Kirsten can act, as she barely speaks for the entire film. In fact, the dialogue is so insignificant and the music so overwhelming that the entire film feels like an extended music video. Visually, the film is stunning and does a nice job capturing the opulence and decadence of the era. Yet the script and cast do not exude the same. Rather, the weak performances make you almost glad the end is near for these characters. I will easily download this soundtrack to my iPod, but you could not pay me to watch this extended music video again without adding a happy gruesome ending.",Marie Antoinette
396,kmoore91,Lost in Translation,3,22 October 2006,"Marie Antoinette is the Mommie Dearest of historical features. It is a 2 hour revisionist fashion show/travelogue that manages to be historically inaccurate, inexcusably shallow, badly acted, intellectually insulting, anti-feminist, and campy in equal measure. To top it all off, it's technically amateurish as a boom mike was clearly visible in no less than 20 scenes. Yes, you did just read that. In one low angle tracking shot through some grass the upper glare panel of the camera was visible. I kid you not. Because of this movie, I'm beginning to wonder if Lost In Translation was just a fluke. It's almost inconceivable that a movie from a major studio and up-and-coming director could have been released with this many mistakes and such a poor script. Needless to say, I don't recommend paying your hard earned cash to see it. Yet, it may be a smashing success and become a camp classic for the very reasons why I had trouble with it.",Marie Antoinette
397,denial_dalton,A bore.,3,23 October 2006,"I think this film completely misfired. An interesting film could have been made with Marie-Anotinette & the decadence of the French monarchy as subject matter, but instead you are subjected to a couple of hours of mindless vogue-stylishness that looks more like an extended perfume ad than the feature film it occasionally tries to be. Kirsten Dunst looks amazing every time she is on screen, but because of a sparse script, the character of Marie- Antoinette is never one we can grow to care about enough. The soundtrack is ambitious but at times is very lazy in it's execution. The most obvious example of this was with the burst of The Strokes ""Whatever Happened?"". The song was too familiar, and too strong for the scene it was placed in and was ultimately more powerful than any of the scenes that preceded or followed it. I'm not even a fan of The Strokes, but the fact that this 30-second sound-clip was so memorable says something about where this principles film's lay. Style over substance.",Marie Antoinette
398,publisher-35,Off With Everyone Involved's collective head,1,27 October 2006,"From the opening credits to the point where we walked out of the theatre, I sat in annoyed shock. I've only walked out of a movie once before and that was do to a health issue. This time, Cyn and I looked at each other at almost the same time and whispered ""I'm ready to go, are you?"" We gave the movie an hour and a half of our lives which, unfortunately, we will never get back. Is the movie gorgeous? YES. If your life is shoes, dresses, and eating dessert then this is your movie. . .please come claim it and take it home. There's so much ""girly girl"" sweetness in this movie that it'll make your pancreas lock up.Actually, you'll think going into a diabetic coma is a good thing when you attempt to watch the movie.The movie makers attempted to create the avant garde atmosphere created by using popular music mixed into the soundtrack a la ""A Knight's Tale."" They SO missed the mark. Just when I thought the dialogue was the lamest part of the movie, along comes a soundtrack that drives an audible spike into your head.Don't get me wrong, the colors, mood and opulence of the period are well represented but when Kirsten Dunst's Antoinette says ""Wow, I love that color"" when handed some dress fabric (in one of the dozen or so dressing scenes), it kinda' kills any historical representation the movie might have had. Modern English, Olde English, and about six French words are all mixed into the script that has no plot nor makes any point other than Antoinette had more shoes than Imelda Marcos.Discussing the movie over lunch, Cyn and I both agreed that the movie would have worked much better as a color silent movie with an orchestrated soundtrack of period music. In fact, if you go see the movie, fill your ipod with a 1780s soundtrack of Hayden's Paris Symphonies. . . or Mozart , since Antoinette was Austrian anyway. Listen to that instead.",Marie Antoinette
399,rina3525,Wait for the rental release,1,31 October 2006,"I wish I had waited for this movie to come out on rental. It had a few very nice points but was unsatisfactory.Great costuming and I approve of most of the casting! Truly the costuming was impressive, exultant, and the height of opulence. I adore Kirsten Dunst. She cut an excellent figure in this film. The colors were magnificent and often played up her blue eyes, but as striking as the artistry was the timing of the scenes seemed off.The only film I would compare this with is Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes. That film also integrated modern music/ features.Some scenes dragged and others felt disconnected (possibly used to make you feel as Marie did but succeeding in only confusion). The viewer is not brought into the picture but is left out of the loop as to the court and characters. This way you are watching a play in which whispers are the means of communication and though gossip may have been in vogue at court it was difficult to follow who was what and to discern motivation. This way of presenting the material lacked interest and quickly bored me. I say this in comparison with the other period films I have watched. There is also no means of knowing how much time has elapsed unless you want to crack a book while you watch.Worst of all, the soundtrack was completely inappropriate. I could not keep from wincing and wrinkling my nose every time they started in. This music and the behavior of the dance scene would be better suited to a Gothic club. I do not usually go to a period flick when I want to see moshing.The scenes I wanted to see more of or wanted further detail in the dialogue were cut short. The scenes I wanted to see less of were prolonged.Additionally, it would have been nice to see at least in part what happens to her in the end.If you want to see beautiful costumes and a lovely court this is the movie for you despite the rest. Obviously since I have given this movie a one I would take back my time if I could and at least not pay to see this in the theater. A three would have been my vote if the clash between the beauty and the ugly display were not quite so repugnant as to make the whole unaesthetic. Were the less wonderful parts brought up to par this film would merit at Least a six and very possibly more. This may have been better as a silent film. Marie Antoinette is decidedly a tragic picture.",Marie Antoinette
400,venessalewis,Delectable movie!,9,5 November 2006,"Rarely am I delighted enough about a movie to write a review. However, ""Marie Antoinette"" is such a delectable movie that I have to weigh in on it to the chagrin of professional critics everywhere who can't appreciate it for what it is. There are several distinct individual elements that taken as a whole equals a rare and breathtaking VISUAL cinematic masterpiece.If you are a movie snob that concerns yourself too much with dialogue, character development, historical accuracy and plot, well beware, this movie is NOT for you. However, if you want to enjoy two hours of mesmerizing eye candy, a killer soundtrack and a ""close enough"" representation of history, you are in for a real treat.The dresses. This is the single most glorious thing about this movie. I kid you not, Kirsten Dunst trots out at least 40 sumptuous concoctions that look as as delicious as the endless stream of desserts. It doesn't end there. Even extras in the movie were afforded costumes that I would kill to have in my wardrobe. The majority of the budget for this movie was spent on costume design and construction. Whoever is the primary designer deserves an Oscar. It is absolutely breathtaking. There hasn't been a movie this lush and over the top since Gone with the Wind.The desserts. I left the theater feeling like I had eaten a pound of buttercream icing. Diabetics beware...this movie will send you into a sugar coma. I know this isn't an Oscar category, but by God, the baker in this movie deserves some sort of recognition. I don't know how Marie manged to keep her figure....she literally gorges on sweets all day! The soundtrack. The Cure, the Stokes, New Order....come ON, what else do you want?! This music, juxtaposed with her freewheeling, blissfully naive lifestyle was a brilliant combination that made history fresh, exciting and attainable to younger audiences.The history. OK, it wasn't completely accurate, but SO WHAT? It was close enough. Again, I say, the primary goal of this movie was NOT to tell the story of the French monarchy leading up to the Revolution. It was simply to convey the excesses of a young and flaky queen in her beautiful make believe world. And judged solely on those merits, I say Sophia Koppola went above and beyond. I also say thank you. For making a movie so fun and beautiful and sweet and delicious. It is exactly what I expected and exactly what I got. YUMMY!!!",Marie Antoinette
401,jdwilkin,A waste of time & money,1,17 November 2006,"I am posting my review of both the 1938 & 2006 version of Marie-Antoinette.After viewing the new 2006 Marie-Antoinette with Kirsten Dunst last night, I was horribly disappointed. And maybe it was because I recently saw the 1938 version with Norma Shearer. Both movies displayed Marie's wanton extravagance, however that is where the comparison's end. The historically accurate 1938 version entailed her life from her engagement of King Louis XVI to her execution. It was indeed complete in the telling of her faults, the scandalous Diamond Necklace affair, the French Revolution, the failed escape attempt and the demise of the royal family (including Thérèse de Lamballe ) by execution. None of which were included in 2006.All 2006 attempted to do was to showcase the lovely Ms. Kirsten Dunst (of which I am a huge fan).Don't waste your money to see 2006 at the theaters, don't waste your money on pay per view, or DVD rental. Maybe see it when it is free on TV.",Marie Antoinette
402,dwynn10,Yummy movie to look at but little substance,5,9 March 2007,"Sorry to add a pretty late comment, but I just caught it on DVD! I agree with people who decry the lack of dialogue, direction, acting skills, scope, and in-depth characterization. Kirsten Dunst is without a doubt a mediocre actress (and not especially beautiful either). Maybe that explains why she had only about a page of dialogue to carry the entire movie.On the plus side, the costumes and set decorations are magnificent and authentic-looking, certainly much more so than the 1938 MGM version, which also had superb sets and costumes, but in a Holywoodized way. Well, when you have the chance to use Versailles to the extent that Coppola was allowed to, you definitely have a leg up on authenticity! (Btw, has any director ever been granted the same kind of access Coppola was?) The whole movie was like a luscious box of candies in pastel colors! Also, I give her props for using some actual dialogue and incidents (for example, the morning dressing ceremony and the moment M-A and Louis found out they had become King and Queen), and general faithfulness to history, although we don't have any definitive proof one way or the other that M-A actually slept with Fersen the way it was depicted in the movie. Given all that, it irks me that no one caught the error in which courtiers kept addressing M-A and Louis as ""Your Majesties"" when they were still Dauphine and Dauphin. The proper address was ""Your Royal Highnesses"" as was done correctly in the early part of the movie.Because of the lush location shoot at Versailles and the beautiful costumes, which add immensely to the look and feel of the movie, I have to give it a middling 5. Without those assets, I would have gone as low as 3 for all the deficiencies mentioned above.",Marie Antoinette
403,recordplayer,Microphone in the film,5,13 February 2007,"I am not sure why the AMC cionema in Hong Kong at Pacific Place offered this film in a very annoying 4:3 format. Not only did it kill the art direction of the film (actors getting cut off on the left and right side of the film and thus the cropping felt so unnatural) but the goddamn microphone appeared above people's head more than 20 times in the film. Imagine trying to get immersed in a period film when you see a microphone on the top of the screen. I am not sure whether I really like the film now since my experience of it was destroyed by weird cropping. I wrote to AMC, but I can't believe that they are not more careful about this. Ridiculous.Besides all this, I think the film is OK, but the pace is not that good. Sometimes the music went well with the scenes, a new way of looking at cinema music, but I feel some of the songs made me imagine the 80's in a period film... awkward.",Marie Antoinette
404,jblondeau,Dismal,3,2 March 2007,"Were it not for the superb scenes of Versailles this movie would be even more dismal. As it is, both Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman (and others) come off as flat as pancakes in delivery and characterization; it is not a deliberate characterization, perhaps meant to reflect the characters' alienation in the marriage bed, no, this kind of soulless, read-y delivery is just plain bad acting. Because so many elements in it are so disparate the film never seems to converge, but seems to be constantly trying to fly apart. It is not held together by any one thematic or cinematic element. The soundtrack is grating; it's not only what one wouldn't expect, it's an incongruous and anachronous assault, an attempt, it appears, to create a film hip enough to appeal to younger viewers with really short attention spans; it's not classic sturm und drang, rather it's clashing and uncomfortable. Visually, there are cutsie flip-cuts, stop-cuts, and short-shots. All combined, they're the ingredients that turn the film into nothing short of an expensive costume drama bereft of coherency. Dare I admit that I've seen better acting in L.A. garage porn? Forgive me, but skip this film. Cinematography, acting, soundtrack, characterizations, dialog, nothing can rescue this mishmash.",Marie Antoinette

The only redeeming aspect of was the costumes and scenery, everything else was horrible. Kirsten Dunst was not very well suited at all for this character. Her performance came off as very artificial, not realistic at all. The movie's blatant disregard for historical accuracy was pretty disturbing. It didn't focus on the French Revolution at all. That would be like making a film of Abraham Lincon but just leaving out the Civil War. Or maybe I could make a movie about the Titanic but ending the movie before that bad sinking part happens. It's a pity I can't give it negative stars.",Marie Antoinette
406,flopcat-1,What else can I say...,1,26 June 2007,"...that hasn't already been said? Historically inaccurate, poor scripting, poor dialogue, poor acting. While others have commented that it may not have been S. Coppola's intent to create a historically accurate piece, why create a historical piece if you don't plan to make some effort to represent the events accurately? And the musical score? It's great -- if the movie had taken place in the East Village in 1985.Kirsten Dunst's performance in the film is wooden at best. While she wasn't given much to work with in the way of dialogue and character development, still, her performance left much to be desired. Loved the visual aspect of the movie, but basically the movie is all style and no substance. All in all, the film is a pretentious waste of time and money.",Marie Antoinette

I believe that Coppola ought to be commended for composing a fresh and personal pastiche of a young woman's experience in an extraordinary time and place. The value of the film lies in its impressionistic qualities. It is superbly cut with images of lasting aesthetic beauty and a cohesive tone and colour palate which holds it together as something far greater than its detractor's seem to be willing to admit. The performances were stripped of the stiffness usually associated with period representations. The film is exceptional in its ability to render the historical figure of Marie Antoinette with immediacy, personality and empathy. It brings to life Sofia Coppola's own 'pastel' vision of a famous story and thereby invests the story with stunning visual beauty which is at times uniquely coupled with a delightfully effervescent tone. I found the movie highly intelligent and compelling.",Marie Antoinette

Also the characters are a passive, few areas in this movie are not slow. In general too slow even the cinematography doesn't hold the film, that's a mission for plot. Where is the plot?????

But they would have been just as beautiful on a poster, and I wouldn't have wasted an evening wading through this drivel. I spent much of the movie hoping Spiderman would rescue Kirsten Dunst, and me, from the remainder of the movie. It is possible that this movie was so bad that Sophia Coppola should not only be banned from making movies, she should be banned from watching movies.The main source of my disappointment with this film is the annoyingly anachronistic soundtrack. It was like some MTV producers got drunk,fell into a time machine, and vomited all over the eighteenth century. I'm not sure what the music director was trying to do, but it really made me long for the silent era. Here comes the spoiler (although the real spoiler associated with this film is the film itself.): I guess my real objection is that the film doesn't even show us Marie Antoinette marching off to the guillotine.

412,zeronrocket,An amateur attempt at art,3,16 July 2010,"I suppose drawing parallels between the modern teen and the life of a pampered, young 18th century aristocrat is valid, but it was clumsily slapped together in this film. Make no mistake, one feels the full gravity of the young queen's ennui. I was just as bored and annoyed watching the endless series of attempts to amuse herself. If that was the point, then it was achieved within 30 minutes. The rest of the film had me wanting someone to lob off Marie Antoinette's head, just so that the end credits would roll. The choice of music was all part of the jarring effect of the film that perhaps was intended to bring home the idea that these rulers were just kids, but it was distracting. The sound quality was tinny and made the music even more alarmingly out of place. In fact the scene transitions, the story telling methods, and even the accents of the actors were so uneven that almost no part of the film seemed like it belonged together. Rather it looked and sounded like a high school audio visual class experiment. (Now we're going to show time passing through music video montages and now we're going to show time passing by changing paintings and now for something completely different.)Even the acting was spotty. There were some brilliant flashes among the muck. Jason Schwartzman and Rip Torn were wonderfully subtle. Kirsten Dunst was surprisingly inconsistent. She is a gifted actor, but seemed to be punching her time card for some of the scenes. Many of her most important lines were delivered completely flat. When one is forsaking one's only companions and pledging to stay beside one's husband during a revolution, it is unlikely that it would be done with the same inflection and facial expression as if one were reading a prospectus aloud. As if being as bored as the characters in this film weren't bad enough, it was sad to be so disappointed by Ms. Dunst's flat performance. I wish I had missed this one.",Marie Antoinette
413,Steeny14,Truly Decadent,10,19 December 2006,"A perfect portrait of the ill fated queen using a punk soundtrack and beautiful photography in Coppolas almost high school teen movie style translation to capture the spirit of this truly iconic figure who was just a girl who just wanted to have fun. Instantly became my favourite film. I am already a big fan of Sofia Coppola, this film takes her already prevalent themes of fun loving young girls repressed by the systems around her, be it commitment or parents, isolation in their position, rebellion all put across by a punk/indie soundtrack (chosen by Brian Reitzell) and beautiful photography (by Lance Acord). She seems to sum up what it is to be young so very perfectly, to be able to break away from the systems that hold you down and let loose. I see her as one of the filmmakers around at the moment who is carrying on the 'new Hollywood' movement that her dad was a part of during the 70's with the very style that she has. An extremely underrated film, seen as self indulgent and having a very slim plot. They are reading it wrong, it owes more to art cinema in containing the huge plot in the coding, style, photography and mise en scene. The critics will come back to look at this one. More significant than its been received.",Marie Antoinette
414,naomirwatson,Bad Music sinks shaky movie,3,26 October 2006,"You need look no further than the awful use of rock music in a period piece to figure out why Sofia Coppola is one of, if not the, most overrated directors of recent memory.What was she trying to do with those songs? Was she trying to make the story ""relevent"" to younger audiences? Guess what? If you need to stick inappropriate music to make a film relevant, you have a stinker of an irrelevant film no matter how you score it and you might as well do a good job.But Sofia chose to go for the hack job.I can just imagine her and her yes-people meeting and telling themselves how brilliant they were, how insightful and how funny.Next time, Sofia, why don't you hire a couple of honest people to give you feedback? You'll make a much better film and you'll be a much better director for it.",Marie Antoinette
415,Psyche17,Painted Like A Portrait and Just As Two-Dimensional,5,21 October 2006,"There is a scene towards the end of Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette where Marie gives a standing ovation as the curtain falls at an opera only to look around to find unapplauding hands placed politely in laps and cold glares thrown in her direction. I imagine that Marie attending a screening of Coppola's bio-pic would produce similar results. Marie Antoinette does not play as a film of plot and intrigue, but as a series of portraits: Marie in society, Marie with husband, Marie accessorized, Marie gambling with friends, Marie with children, etc. While a portrait may hold special significance to whom it depicts, it will always struggle to hold the interest of the viewer without some kind of story.Coppola gives us a whiff of a story like a French perfume that fades in its poignancy after the first squirt. The main conflict of the film resides in the necessity of Marie Antoinette to produce an heir by the next in line to the throne, Louis XVI, who is less than sexually invigorated. While this storyline might have worked in the form of a raunchy comedy, for a two hour bio-pic drama, it does not produce the desired climax. Part of the problem, I think, comes from the fact that every character lacks arc and depth. Marie Antoinette's stunted state of superficiality is forgivable for accuracy's sake, but not a single supporting character proves him or herself noteworthy or compelling.Like any portrait by Velasquez, Rembrandt, or Da Vinci, Coppola succeeds in creating a picturesque, artistically drawn representation of Marie Antoinette's life. The setting, costumes, and cinematography are beautifully combined to bring a realism to the film that is unfortunately and inexcusably broken by the dissonant chord struck by the inclusion of modern music. Storming through the film's authenticity like the commoners through the Bastille is the distracting conglomeration of French, British, and American accents. I am usually forgiving of inaccurate dialects as long as they are consistent, but in a film centered around French royalty (with a few Austrians thrown in), the discrepancy of accents adds an inappropriate diversity to the company of otherwise homogenous characters.Compounding the problem of dialect are cringe-worthy line deliveries by Jason Schwartzman who seems unable to discern the difference between awkward sexual interaction and awkward acting. Though the intention of his characterization of Louis XVI is to be more or less socially incompetent, his diction betrays nothing more than a verbatim memorization of the script which only creates awkwardness in the audience whose solitary hope for his character is that he will put his prepositions in the right places. As I listened to him speak throughout the film, I found myself transported back against my will to my high school English class where fellow students struggled to read Hamlet aloud, pausing after every syllable of ""to be or not to be"" in uncertainty over where to put the stress. Schwartzman's monotonous recitation of lines immensely less eloquent than Shakespeare's does not excuse, but rather draws excessive attention to his poor performance in this film. Kirsten Dunst is overall convincing as Marie Antoinette, but I do not see her as deserving much recognition come awards season.As I review this long list of grievances with the film, I cannot help but admit that I would have forgiven every last one of them had Coppola only given us the satisfaction of the guillotine scene. I even have a suggestion for the pop song to score it: Alice Cooper's ""Chop, Chop, Chop.""",Marie Antoinette

I came away dismayed that I had wasted my money. I almost left in the middle of the movie, but I wanted to see how it ended. At just over two hours it was painfully boring.Many scenes were actually beautiful. Being on location at Versaille really brought you into that world. Everything looked like a painting. That was the only good thing. There was little to no story and little to no dialog. I felt no emotional attachment to any of the characters. I neither liked them or disliked them. I don't care if there was a conveyed messaged through the silence and cinematography.

417,jdm9717,A great movie for scenery lovers.,3,26 December 2006,"For everyone else it's pretty God awful. A definite double feature for Guantamano Bay. What hurts the most is you get the feeling that this really could have been an awesome movie. It sets itself up for court intrigue, you get no court intrigue. An interesting arranged marriage is made, it's as bland as unflavored oatmeal. This is the time of the French Revolution, the age of Voltaire and Franklin - where are these two giants of the age? Most of all, where are the French Revolutionaries? Instead of just weighing the film down with pregnant yet still-born shots of how beautiful it all was, we should have been given a view of what they were doing to the country. Where is Paris with its masses wallowing in misery? Granted the royals were aloof and completely removed from the needs of the people, the audience is not. When an adviser says they will raise the taxes just a little bit, we the audience need to see and feel the ramifications of it. Where are the people being beaten and incarcerated for the simple crime of being poor? That was the truth of the age. Without that kind of contrast, you get far too many hours of bratty teenagers of a different age enjoying themselves. Ho -and- Hum.If the movie had not remained as aloof to the audience as the French Royalty was to the people of France, it could have been Oscar material. As is? It has a nice soundtrack.PS: The French Revolution happened 13 years after the American Revolution. Granted much of the unrest was caused by military spending, it was not the support of the American Revolution which pushed them over the brink as the movie seems to imply.",Marie Antoinette
418,danstewart25,Let Them Watch Cake!,4,25 October 2006,"Marie Antoinette is the film equivalent of one of those expensive fashion magazines that pepper indie art galleries  packed with achingly hip aesthetics but free of meaningful content. The film traces the life of the last Queen of France from her introduction to the French court until her departure from Versailles. If you're looking for serious history though, you're better off sticking to Antonia Fraser's source novel. Wigs, footmen and finery are more often than not filmed to the strains of 80s pop and punk and a pair of Converse shoes even sneaks onto the screen (though viewers will have to be sharp-eyed to spot them). It's the 18th century, Jim, but not as we know it. Marie Antoinette the film shares the obsessions of Marie Antoinette the character  shoes, cakes, finery and having fun. It even finishes before the dark conclusion to Marie Antoinette's tale  her arrest and subsequent death by guillotine for treason. Sophia Coppola's last film, Lost in Translation, won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay but it's safe to say she won't be receiving any such plaudits for this script. There's barely any dialogue for the first twenty minutes, and most exchanges thereafter are pithy and shallow. Great actors  Rip Torn, Danny Huston, Shirley Henderson  are given nothing much more to do than push the narrative along its slow path. Dunst's role is mainly to giggle, roll her eyes, and run around in period costume. O.C. characters have more depth. Visually, however, the film is stunning. No, better than that: it's luscious. Coppola was given special dispensation to film in Versailles and all the extravagant finery of the palace's rooms unfolds across your screens. When Dunst has a shopping spree  to the anachronistic sounds of I Want Candy by Bow Bow Bow  you go with her, feasting on cream-stuffed cakes, delicately stitched shoes and beautiful, patterned fabrics. The film is an orgy of materialism, filmed with the sharp editing and honed soundtrack of a television advert. All of which makes it difficult to see what point Coppola's making. The camera's fetishises the spoils of wealth and yet we're encouraged to feel sympathy for her as the revolutionaries close in on the palace at the film's end. She wants us to think Marie Antoinette's character was misrepresented  'I never said that!' she claims of the famous 'Let them eat cake!' reports  but shows us enough debauchery to reinforce the common perception. In fact, it's difficult not to see the director herself mirrored in her central character as it was in Lost in Translation  the spoiled Hollywood royalty reaping the benefit of her connections to stuff herself (and her film) with profligate confectionery. Your enjoyment of Marie Antoinette will depend on how you go in. If you're expecting Dangerous Liaisons you'll hate it. If you think you'd enjoy an 18th century hybrid of A Knight's Tale with Clueless, kick off your Converse, stock up on fairy cakes and indulge.",Marie Antoinette

Well, we got the message in the first ten minutes, Sofie, so what else can you tell us?! What is it with these European neo-realists and new-wavers, anyway, making such bluntly obvious trash over and over again? I think it's a joke on the audience, and they're laughing all the way to the bank while we're supposed to congratulate ourselves on our faux sophistication at being able to sit through their self-indulgent crap.This is one of those rare occasions where I intend to take the local video store up on its offer of a full refund for any movie that a customer really hated!",Marie Antoinette

I've read many comments about the movie saying that it's historically inaccurate and that we hardly see any of the ""politics"" of the era, but obviously this film is simply not about those things. We are seeing the world through Marie's eyes, the sheltered life that knows nothing of poverty or reality. We get to experience the decadence of her lavish lifestyle and see the beauty of her surroundings. I loved the mix of classical music and modern music, it made the film seem more youthful and fun; Marie is, after all, a teenager in most of the film. The acting is wonderful.

And it is this realism that is a true art. This realism perfectly represents what life must have been like to the young queen. I just thought it was genius. For those who say it's a shallow movie clearly didn't understand the piece. The acting was also superb. Like the film itself, they just felt so real. Kirsten Dunst was wonderful as the queen, especially in the beginning when she first entered Versailles. Jason Schwartzman was hilarious in his own shy and quirky way.

This is the story of a legendary French queen retold by an American teenager whose relationship with history before the WW2 is ... lukewarm, at best. Costumes are fine. The acting is far from outstanding, but quite plausible in considered frame. However, it's the music, that fits the theme as a fist fits the eye socket, and that all is topped? Buried? by the logical and historical faults. If you want to see an entertaining, yet more historical movie about the period of 18th century, see Barry Lyndon.",Marie Antoinette
436,funnyhoney42,Surprisingly good,9,6 February 2007,"I really enjoyed this film. Though everyone else in my party of five who saw it hated it, I really liked it. It is definitely NOT for people who aren't history buffs or people who don't like artistic films. This was a very artsy movie and I really liked how they expressed events through actions a lot of the time instead of in words. I also thought it was awesome how they actually filmed it at Versailles, one of my favorite places in the world. I loved the music and I immediately bought the soundtrack. The cinematography was outstanding, too, and I'm disappointed it was snubbed for the Oscar nomination. There were some parts that got a little long and tedious, but they were beautiful to look at. I loved the ending; it was so classy and perfect. I didn't expect it to be so funny either; it was quite comedic in some parts. :) Overall, I think you have to watch it as a somewhat of a documentary because I think that's the approach Sofia was going for. It is NOT a huge over-dramatic spectacle. It is a richly elegant and subtle film that is really interesting to watch, if, like I said before, you are a history buff. Or if you are intrigued by Marie Antoinette's life, like me. Both Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman did an excellent job and I can't wait to watch it again.",Marie Antoinette
437,GibsonJ45,Good movie for teens,3,19 October 2007,"Reinterpretations of past events/people/plays can be good... e.g. Romeo + Juliet (1996). This file, however, is for the young and impressionable. The film ""looks"" great, but it is devoid of wit and good dialogue (which made the French ancien regime, if pathetic, at least fun). Nobody has anything to say in this film. Why must so many new re-interpretive films lack good dialogue? (like Pride and Prejudice, 2005) Like the world in which we live live, that which is serious and compelling is reduced to a music video or magazine advertisement.This film lasts too long and has nothing to say. If you're a vapid teen, you'll love this film because there nothing to THINK about... but there's loads to LOOK at.",Marie Antoinette
438,andabittner,Wonderful,9,24 October 2006,"This is a wonderful movie. Sophia Coppola delivers another beautiful introspective film. If you appreciated the understated under-dialogued 'lost in translation' you will love this film. The history buffs may scream bloody murder but let them. The historical setting is a minor annoyance used to give the film structure while the real film is about illuminating Kirsten Dunst as Marie in every aspect of her pampered world. Sophia uses the setting of 18th century France and the character of Marie Antoinette to film an ethereal beauty of great character existing in a world of dream like lavishness and manicured perfection. Sophia clearly chose the project because, like 'L I T' you are left with a feeling of both wanting more and angst, as you really did just miss a wonderful time up on the screen. The raw rock n roll music is a mostly spot on, but occasionally seems a little forced onto some of the more serious scenes. All in all a true delight and a breath of fresh air in the formulaic world of 21st century film making.",Marie Antoinette

But I couldn't. The soundtrack choices alone could destroy any good efforts on the filming project (if there were any). The casting could be worse, but you'd have to try really hard to accomplish THAT. There could be SOME good acting (but I hear that someone has to inspire that to actors...). The script and direction could use someone who actually CAN write scripts and direct movies. It was from the very rare cases when I was tempted to drop watching any story before the end.

I don't think highly of women but let whose be whose for god's sake, they're always going to rip your heart out. I recommend learn to enjoy their ways and chose not to partake in it, that will really screw with their heads.I have been with many women I wanted to be my wife, but all of them had this fake need to appear one way rather than be truthful with themselves and they ended up angering me because they go through the motions but not the emotions of love, I have to say it was my awareness of what was going on that stressed me out, I knew they were whose? I hate women whose with many guy friends, it makes me sad that the guys don't see how ugly they are, if they were good looking they'd be getting some, right?So this movie was one way for me to see how it's just the environment that creates circumstance, let that be a lesson to all you whose out there, do you really wanna be whose or is it you're environment that makes you want to be one?

441,amandagostomski,Dull & Empty,5,15 June 2018,"I was quite excited to see this film because of my interest in French history, but I was disappointed. Coppola's choice to have Kirsten Dunst play Marie Antoinette was predictable. I tried so hard throughout watching the movie to try and see the resemblance between the real Marie Antoinette and Dunst, but there isn't any. Marie Antoinette was a busty woman with a big nose and greyish hair, when Dunst is blonde and skinny. Maybe you could say I'm being picky, but it would've been nicer if Coppola tried harder to find another actress that looked more like Marie Antoinette.With the budget being 40 million USD, you would hope that they would put more effort into the costumes. In ""The Duchess"", which is set in the same time period with the same theme, the budget was 13.5 million euros and they won the Academy Award for Best Costume Design. However, I liked the fact that they filmed in the actual Versailles palace. The scenes, even how slow and boring they were, were aesthetically pleasing.In conclusion, this movie was slow, sloppy and dull. If you like aesthetically pleasing movies, I would recommend checking this out. But if you pay more interest into the quality of a movie, you'll probably be disappointed.",Marie Antoinette

No. I kept waiting, thinking that surely, it would pick up and stop sucking any minute now. No. It was pretty discouraging.There is no plot. What's-her-face (now my most hated actress...

Her husband won't sleep with her for a while. She shrugs and giggles some more and eats pastries. Then for some reason he finally sleeps with her, they have babies, and after some more giggling and swooning she rides off tragically into the sunset or something as the French populace thirsts for her blood. I think maybe one of her kids died but I was half-asleep and really didn't care. That's really it, there's NO PLOT, NO DIALOGUE, NOTHING BUT WHAT'S HER FACE GIGGLING AND SIGHING AND BEING STUPID.

A+ on decors and costumes, but lacks the historical story. Kirsten Dunst failes to prover herself as a 14y old and the mixes of American, English and the children one time speaking french and the other time English confuses the audience and gives people a unhealthy feeling.But if you like Costume movies without respect for a truthfull story, then this might be the best movie you'll ever see.i on the other hand missed the storyline, the most important things in M.A.'s life have been carelessly left out.

I would learn that she did not age in her 20 years at court and she spoke with an American accent. Oh and most importantly, that she listened to rock music.If Coppola was attempting to create a film that documents the boredom and tediousness that was the French court, she succeeded. Fortunately, there is much more depth to life of Marie Antoinette than Coppola offers and only offers, in the last 10 minutes of the film.I found myself checking my watch every 5 or so minutes waiting for this movie to end.

Lots and lots of sex. i couldn't take it anymore and left. the film was horrible, and i don't recommend it to anyone. i nearly fell asleep, and that is rare for me. so as i said, do not go to this movie. you will regret it unless you enjoy pointless and boring movies about slutty queens and their sex lives.",Marie Antoinette

This story never should have been told in this manner. It is without passion or other than cursory insight, either in the life of Marie Antoinette, or the circumstances which led to the downfall of the French monarchy into which she was wed, given slight breath only by Rip Torn's uninhibited performance as the King of France. In fact, it is no story at all, but rather a series of boring, repetitious, poorly realized vignettes. The contemporary music that opens the film, and is used later during the body of the work, makes no sense, a jarring note. Beautiful to look at? Yes. Compelling, moving, worth two hours?

Two young kids playing king and queen. They try to find escape through decadence, but this ends up being not only their demise, but that of the monarchy's. It's a beautiful film that is being torn apart by nit-pickers trying to write a history text book.

They completely missed the point If your going to make a movie about Marie Antoinette then you have to show her full circle they left out some of the most important parts about her! They missed her scandal with the diamond necklace which is mostly a big part of how she was accused of treason. Her trial and death really show how she grew up to be responsible and this movie was nothing but people walking around in period piece costumes. It is really disappointing that they did such a bad job with this movie because it is such a great story. The acting in the movie was not that bad it was actually very good in most parts and refreshingly funny at parts also, tho I think they should check up on a few things before they put it into a movie. The biggest problem as I've mentioned is that they completely left the movie at a horrible spot. Leaving Versailles was just the beginning of what she was to become.

Kirsten Dunst portrays Marie Antoinette beautifully, perfect in every aspect. And Louis XVI is also portrayed perfectly. Scenery in the movie, along with all the visuals is absolutely gorgeous. I think it ended at the perfect time in Marie Antoinette's life, also. The movie didn't drag itself out to show the trials and prison life she had to suffer. The music is also very good, with the prim, proper music playing in the right scenes and the fun music playing out in the happy scenes.

And maybe that is because Sofia Coppola refuses to tie down Marie A to the standard ""biopic"" movie. She doesn't get bogged down in historical accuracy, instead the film is a riot, a romp (excuse the cliché), or just plain fun, not just for party animal Marie, but for us too.Kirsten Dunst actually evokes sympathy as ""The Austrian."" The scene where she breaks down and cries after YET ANOTHER letter from Mum in Austria telling her to get a bun in the oven fast is very powerful. The rest of the cast are no slouches either, especially Jason Schwartzman and Asia Argento. The film looks stunning and the soundtrack...well, I really want a copy.

She was a frivolous, self-involved, and incapable individual and queen. It was a miserable failure at communicating the source from which it was taken. The movie conveyed nothing. It taught nothing. It was utterly worthless. It was as much a waste of time as it was a waste of celluloid.",Marie Antoinette
453,helenhaugland,A wasted opportunity to make a great and beautiful film,5,4 October 2006,"This film has both strengths and weaknesses. The strength being the extravagant costumes and beautiful sets as well as the original and clever choice of music. Pop music accompanying a period drama has the potential of bringing the viewer more closely into the minds of the characters, shortening the distance between teenagers in 18th century France and contemporary teenagers. Although this approach did to some extent work, it also had the opposite effect in that Marie-Antoinettes seemingly easy acceptance to her new role as a French royal became difficult to understand. Some dialogue would certainly have helped. And it is the lack of dialogue that really hurts this film. With all the time, money and effort going into designing the sets, it all seems rather wasteful when the script is so weak. A great opportunity to tell a great story is completely missed! It was really like watching ""lost in translation"" all over again.",Marie Antoinette
454,mulchand1,"Eye candy yes, but perhaps deeper meaning?",6,18 March 2007,"The sets and costumes are outrageously sensual, on the vibrancy of the color alone the movie is worth watching. Probably a bit too clever in its attempts at camera angles, art direction, but certainly vivid and compelling to look at.Although the film does not dwell on it, the point of the rising debt of the country is made occasionally. Could the film not also be looked at as an allegory of contemporary America? Blissfully ignorant of reality in the form of bills that need to be paid? Foreign wars causing huge deficits, yet spending on whatever frivolities demanded, and neglecting the consequences? I am not sure Sofia Coppola's intent was this, but I sure see some correlation here, between Marie and the court and the majority of Americans who cannot find Iraq on a map, yet are urged even yet today by our leaders to continue shopping.",Marie Antoinette

(While there are many suffering and starving)
I like that we are introduced to a more human and relatable woman type. Her struggle to make her family happy and proud by providing them a son prince is to this day a struggle women have to face.

Enjoy it for what it is. The actors/actresses were great and it is a feast for the senses. The costuming is superb. I think that it gives a somewhat fair look of the views about the queen. She was inexperienced and young and was ignorant about the condition of the people of France. She never her whole life saw the ocean. As for the rest of the story there is so much more to tell. After leaving Versialles there were years of imprisonment and depressing events. I like that Sophia decided to end the movie when she did. The movie would have to be MUCH longer in order to tell the whole story. Overall I think this movie is a must see and can't wait to see it again. I'm also looking forward to bonus features on the DVD.",Marie Antoinette

A nice entertaining film, even though the Opera Garnier scenery is not historically accurate. But nicely conducted and well thought on the whole. The costumes are also very nice.The rock and roll music fits also, and gives a youth touch that modernizes the plot. Indeed, i was also amazed at the deprivation of Marie-Antoinette in whole her life. It is nicely cast also. Congratulations.",Marie Antoinette
459,jmb360,A sensory delight,8,27 May 2006,"Based on the recent Marie-Antoinette biography by Antonia Fraser, Sofia Coppola's film focuses on the personal qualities of the character of Marie-Antoinette and thus participates in the character's historical rehabilitation. Antoinette is seen as a respectful loyal daughter, a loving mother, a patient wife, who had to withstand a flood of vindictive criticism since the moment she set foot in the French court. This depiction contrasts strongly with many prior representations of the character in film (""The Affair of the Necklace"" for example), which show her as superficial, selfish and vain.The visuals and auditory elements, which evoke a powerful image of 18th-century Versailles, are the movie's forte. And their effects linger in one's mind (or at least they did in mine) long after one's exit from the theater. As a budding art historian, I was stunned by the intensely lush visual spectacle the film has to offer: the pomp and circumstance of ritualized and regimented 18th-century Versailles. The semi-private world that Antoinette builds for herself to escape Versailles's codified, quasi-totalitarian atmosphere, is evoked through a sequence of fast-moving images of champagne-guzzling, beautifully-decorated cake-eating, and Manolo Blahnik shoe buying. Thus Antoinette's fantasy world is likened to a world recognizable to you, me and Carrie Bradshaw. Some people may scoff at this 21st century world transposed to an earlier time. But as the center of the world in 18th-century Europe, Marie-Antoinette's ""secret Versailles"" would certainly have been as ""hip"" as this, and Coppola has found effective means through sound and image by which to make this hipness accessible.The story zooms in on the character of Marie-Antoinette, played by a ravishing Kirsten Dunst, who arrives at Versailles at the tender age of 14, to become queen of France a mere 5 years later. Coppola emphasizes the loneliness of Antoinette throughout the film: most important is her alienation from the French court by the fact that she is a foreigner (something that made her a scapegoat for all of France's problems during the 1780's). Her powerlessness to ""fit in"" is emphasized also through her sexual alienation from her socially-awkward husband (played by Jason Schwartzmann), her mother's chidings that she has not yet produced an heir to the French throne (and thereby has not secured Austria's political place in Europe), and the bitchy gossip that goes on behind her back at court.Marie-Antoinette is depicted as an intensely personable, friendly and playful person. Coppola fashions a Marie-Antoinette who is a dutiful daughter, a patient wife to Louis (who eventually overcomes his shyness and becomes a loving and protective husband and father), and a caring and tender mother. She is shown as both bold and humble, two qualities which had quasi-miraculous effects on both the court and the angry mob, as is shown in some of the film's most touching moments.Equipped with these ""essential"" personal qualities, the charges traditionally made against Marie-Antoinette fade completely. It is precisely Antoinette's ill-fated attempt at fitting into French court society that causes her escape into a world of idle futility and libertinage. Her escape into the world of ""playing shepherdess"" in her pleasure-house of Le Hameau is shown not as a silly escape from responsibility but as the simple human need to be surrounded by the natural world. This place appears to us as it does to Antoinette: as a refuge from the backbiting, totalitarian regime of Versailles. Even the legendary ""let them eat cake"" statement allegedly made by Marie-Antoinette is discarded as fiction.There is almost no place in the film for the 18th-century reality as it existed outside the bubble-like world of Versailles. This is not the movie's purpose. The end of the film is a bit abrupt: the last image shows the royal family heading to Paris to be imprisoned in the building of the Conciergerie. There is no mention of the guillotine anywhere, which again can seem surprising, but which shows that Coppola deliberately tried to eschew stereotypes and do something different. And it is all to her credit.",Marie Antoinette
460,aquarius57,i kinda loved it!,9,26 May 2006,"i just got from the movie and i got to say that ""Marie Antoinette"" is somewhat.. unexpected!! it's like champagne with grenadine syrup... just UNEXPECTED.. but good!! i am french and i have heard about Marie Antoinette for as far as i can remember! we all know here that she did some scandalous things and she wasn't as nice as she is depicted in the movie, for example, when she bowed on the balcony at the end without a single word, she actually said ""i don't want to say anything to those people"" and she just bowed.. i think it's quite important to show that she wasn't concerned at all about normal people, she despised them. another bad point, is that the movie stops when she leaves Versailles to go to Metz, I wanted to watch the story till the end.. when she is stopped in a tavern, the king recognized thanks to his head printed on a coin, sent back to Paris in the Bastille ( the jail ), how the queen got depressed while staying there ( it is said that she got old at once, her hair turned white )and her death.

Not once during the movie got I sucked into the story and believed what was going on. Not one laugh, not one tear. Every time the rock music played I got drawn out of the illusion that was build up since last time the rock music was played. It was a weird time-span of events, 3/4 of the film was spent on the dresses, cakes and Antoinettes troubles to seduce the husband. The last quarter of the time, spent on giving birth to three children, loosing a child, having a lover, and the beginning of the French Revolution. Emotionless effort! The setting and the costumes were of course great, that's why I gave this move a two... Another thing is how badly this movie is made technically. Even two-three times the microphone is dangling down in the picture... ohh, horrible! Just a big disappointment of what could have been such a great movie of such a dramatic character!

I want to greet the actors' performance who render with panache all the emotion necessary to understand how the historical characters changed and developed until their final accomplishment. Thanks for them having succeed in inspiring what still miss today to Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette in the eyes of (too)many french people : their human side.It brilliantly shows an American perspective of French Royalty upon that turbulent period that took place a couple of years after Marie-Antoinette marrying the French Dauphin. Although splendid, I admit that this film is not really right as far as the political crisis at that time is concerned. And yet, this cliché about french revolution being particularly violent is and will unfortunately remain even in many french people's mind. However, i advice you not to see it especially for the historical perspective but rather for its sumptuous ""decors"" as the marvellous ""château de Versailles"".This film is the perfect entertainment and you will be interested in french history after seeing it, i promise you! If you want to read something interesting, try to get Marie-Antoinette correspondence, especially the letters to her mother, it is really comic and interesting! Try also to find out a almost positive biography of Louis XVI as Jean-Christian Petitfils's Louis XVI and you'll be surprised by what you'll read.

And of course many shots of Versailles which is nice to look at even from a tourist camera. But that's all and too much of that too.I thought it was made for the younger audience but actually it's made for children. Really the worse directing I've seen in a good while and a thoughtless editing to match it. What a waste of money and resources this director has committed, not unlike the actions of the heroine it tried and failed to portray. The characters were not at all developed. The dialogue was at the level of a bad high school play. The storytelling is so blah that you wonder what's all the talk about this Marie Antoinette character about! She is so totally misrepresented and made to be so uninteresting that you really want her to be really bad to at least be there. There is too much weakness in the movie to recount without reliving the pain suffered watching it. Unfortunately I sat through the whole thing hoping that it would finally go somewhere, come to something. But that was a mistake, because watching more of the same repeated shots and scenes just makes them more painful and boring. Take my word, don't waste your time.

When I first the trailer I thought this would be a great biography on the life of Marie Antoinette, I was terribly wrong. Watching this was like watching a documentary on Paris Hilton. It shows no important events in Marie Antoinette's life, not even the affire of the necklace, all it shows is a spoiled brat wasting her life in a palace.

465,thev3,It pays to be FCC's daughter,6,18 March 2007,"Is it me being numb or it just happened that Sophia Coppola managed to make a movie about 18th century France and fill it with 1980's music? Did she watch A Knight's Tale and decided she has talent enough to copy the concept? It pays to be FFC's daughter. I understand that she was not attempting to make a historically accurate depiction but there is a limit for inaccuracy. Some where I heard that she was trying to attract the younger generation by using the music, ... I am glad that she did not get hold of ""the windows, the walls ..."" and the 2k music.From the beginning it is not good, I am finding myself struggling to zone out the music so i can focus on the scene. There are so many stupid mistakes that even with the totally not fitting music you can not miss them. SC had such a great research team that they failed to tell her this: In France the wedding ring is on the right hand!! How many times do you need to see MA waking up, not sexed yet to get the point? Ms. Coppola really does well trying to enter the sex into the movie by showing KD, naked standing in the distance a couple of times. The genius in little Sophia is proved by the scene at 55 min and 55 sec into the movie. Marie Antoinette is choosing shoes and a canvas converse is in her wardrobe! Light blue and white rubber sole, fat laces! Was she in the edit room that day? Did I see a black man teaching Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna von Habsburg-Lothringen AKA Marie Antoinette, queen of France playing music??!!! 120 minutes into the movie so we can see that MA is spending, gambling and at last has a daughter. Everyone in the movie speaks English, but the little girl utters a few French words to make sure you know that they are French. There are so many talented people that can not get the privileges afforded to Ms. Coppola to make a movie and here she is making a new style of movie making. Her attempt to show MA as a person fails at the part of not showing the true tragic moments of her capture, imprisonment and watching her friends getting behead; most of all Duchess de Lamballe, the original person who said; ""then they should eat cake"". Her own beheading was not even the point. KD does a very good job in regards to portray of the naive and shallow MA. One truly great work in this movie that I believe saved the whole darn thing was Milena Canonero the Costume Designer and Make Up & Hair designers, by Jean-Luc Russier and Desiree Corridoni . Brian Reitzell, music supervisor ... What a joke!",Marie Antoinette
466,HARRY_B,Beautiful scenes wasted on bad composition,3,12 November 2006,"Loved parts of the movie, disliked other, left feeling very unsatisfied. Adored the beautiful, lush scenes, which were matched by some sublime acting. The landscape panoramas and interior scenes were equally stunning. Kristen Dunn was great, as was Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI and Asia Argento as Madame du Barry. Rip Torn as Louis XV was admirable in most scenes, but gave more of a performance fitting for TV than the big screen (a bit too deliberate). I didn't like the overall non-story telling tone of the movie. Also disliked the soundtrack, some of the songs were impressive but few added to the overall composition (it mostly felt like I was listening to someone's CD collection that that I didn't really care for). Hated the ending, what a letdown! Perhaps I was expecting too much after tremendously enjoying Lost in Translation.",Marie Antoinette
467,travel_ghost,Not quite...,4,19 March 2007,"I can't seem to shake off the notion that the rock/modern music incorporated in a period film was a total rip-off from the likes of ""A Knight's Tale."" As with Sophia Coppola's style of film-making, this film is riddled with inconsistencies, and useless shots which, if not included in the final cut, may have saved the audience from the agony of sitting through two hours of general monotony. Not even the likes of Steve Coogan can bring this this film up. Honestly, I've never seen this director come out with anything substantial. (Lost in Translation? Please... that too was a fluke.) Yes, she has good command of the terms and processes of making a film, but somehow doesn't hold her own in terms of the actual execution. But then again, everyone is a critic. But this criticism comes from someone who can always see some form of saving grace in any film, n matter how horrible. What saves this film then? The production design, and that's why it scored a 4 in my book. One final note, daddy won't be proud...",Marie Antoinette
468,RhineBlaze,phhhhhhhh... what a beautiful waste of time and effort,1,5 November 2006,"What a waste - such beautiful pictures. So many talented actors. Great locations - and still - lifeless, without historical context. This film had so much potential. But it is shallow. Was there a plot? I really like the period, the costumes, etc. Thought it was an amazing job to bring Versailles back to live. There were quite a few angles the film could have picked up besides the political history or the love story between the Queen and Fersen. But it was only a self-indulgent romp.Ah, but the costumes were great - music superb job. Still - for me films should also be about telling a story! Nevertheless - beautiful tableaux! But in the end I thought - come on guys grab you pitchforks - allons-y...",Marie Antoinette
469,indywar360,if you don't like this movie,10,28 October 2006,"there is something wrong with you. Like Marie Antoinette herself, it seems like frivolous fluff considering the events that take place. But it's done so well. And French Revolution be damned, it's about a girl. It kicks ass. Sofia Coppola shows a lot of style, elegance, and intelligence in a work like this, not to mention humanity and tenderness, and knowing something about what it means to be a young woman. Obviously other movies of hers then come to mind, I think I'll watch them again soon.And Kirsten Dunst kicks butt. I was touched by the work she did anyway, all-around, but especially with that Swedish dude, and when she bids farewell to her good friends. Kirsten, you're the man.Oh, and obviously, Jason Schwartzmann as Louis XVI? wtf? lol. Awesome... so freakin' funny.",Marie Antoinette
470,dantechild,A disappointment. Left me feeling cold.,5,27 October 2006,"I wanted to like this film. 'The Virgin Suicides' is one of my favourite films and I have prob seen 'Lost in Translation' more times than is healthy. Unlike her previous two, this will not stand up to repeated viewings.It captures all the bitchiness and boredom of life at Versailles, but could have done with being about 20 minutes shorter.Its being commented that Sophia Coppola might as well have being making a film about herself and her friends. A little harsh, but true I think, to a certain extent. Most of the dialogue seems as though it where just take word by word from the bitchy, gossip fuelled world of N.Y and L.A's rich elites.The film really beings to drag as they have to deal with the french revolution. Coppola is still a young director, but its clear her niche is not going to be historical drama. (hopefully she will realise this and return to the quiet contemplation of her last two efforts). The film did'not have the script or money to successfully do this final part of the story justice.For my criticism, The final shot of the film however is perfect! It lingers. Probably the only part of the film that does....",Marie Antoinette
471,littlekat_1010,Marie Antoinette,2,2 September 2006,"this movie was completely ridiculous. as much as i like Kirsten Dunst, she just didn't do it for me this time. besides the much unneeded sex and scandal, the director's complete disregard for historical facts is way out of hand. i understand that making a film requires creativity and that some artistic license can be taken, but in this instance it went too far. the costuming was, i will concede, very well done. i am sorry to be so harsh on a movie for which i had such high hopes, but there it is. another classic story completely hollywoodized with no regard for its viewer's knowledge of the truth. the director assumed that no one would know anything about Marie Antoinette and took massive liberties with it. the innocence with which Marie was portrayed was OK at the beginning, but when she progressed into a slut with no idea of how her actions would affect her people, and everyone around her attempted to keep her in the dark, i had trouble keeping my temper. anyone with any former knowledge of the story should not see this if they value history at all.",Marie Antoinette
472,Pretzelmaster,Beautiful,10,14 December 2006,"This film was a beautiful and fantastically accurate portrayal of the ill-fated queen, in a new turn on the story. She is revealed in a light of understanding, rather than dislike. I find it hard to believe that this film has been snubbed by virtually every film awards ceremony, when it is truly the best film of 2006. It was so delightful, I could have eaten it like the supposed cakes which this queen delighted in. Kirsten Dunst, who is universally regarded as a poor actress, actually shines quite well in this role; in fact, Ms. Dunst is often so very natural in most of her roles, that people fail to notice her acting ability, which is excellent, despite rumors of her being talentless. It is an unbearable shame that this movie will be a forgotten treasure in the future.",Marie Antoinette
473,ekstedt68,Converse goes in one scene - goof or on purpose?,8,12 September 2006,"In the scene where Marie Antoinette is going through her shoes while preparing for a big party you see a pair of Converse All Star 1923 Chuck Taylor basketball shoes for about one and a half seconds. The shoes is seen together with lots of shoes from the time era. Its an anachronism. But the question is...Did Coppola put the Converse shoes there on purpose (which I think she did) or is it a goof? Does anyone know?By the way, the film is really really good! Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as Marie Antoinette. And the cool music from the 80s brings life to the film. I think the soundtrack will be fantastic.",Marie Antoinette
474,xadion,Waste of time and space,1,30 October 2006,"If you think this movie will offer you something more than your standard side page blurb in a high school history text you are wrong. If you are wanting to see things from 'just her side' of things- the movie does it- no explanation of anything, nothing gets deep.Its all very pretty though, its one of those ""art for arts sake"" movies- avoid less you like them, the previews imo are misleading to the audience and attempting to draw in people that will not find this movie worth their time- please save your money.The acting is out of place, fitting with its music- both have seemingly random inserts of modern music and modern place acting- yes this all can be excused in the ""its art"" line and vein of thinking- but then again I can bullshit everything and say its my artistic creativeness in seeing everything how my humors flow, but really its all an excuse to cover up this crap.",Marie Antoinette
475,eroclydon-1,A great intimate picture,8,5 February 2007,"I loved this movie because it was such a great portrait of a person - every little thing in the film came together to help portray Marie's state of mind - a sort of disaffected daze which turns into a warm and content mood as she starts to reconnect with life. The soundtrack was a great way to help remind everyone how relevant the story is, I especially liked how the young royal women carried around little dogs - very Paris/Olsen/Britney-esquire. Kirsten Dunst gives her most nuanced performance of her career so far I think, and the always beautiful Rose Byrne has a heap of fun as the slightly vacuous friend in waiting. Overall a great film from a very assured director - can't wait to see what comes next.",Marie Antoinette
476,earthmap,SC has no talent and this film is horrible,1,23 October 2006,"Let me begin by saying that I did not have high expectations for this film because I feel that S.C. has no talent as an actress (essentially ruined Godfather #3), or as a writer or director (Suicide flick was a waste of time and Lost in Translation sucked. Sure, Bill Murray was funny, but SC can't claim any credit for that. He would be funny at a funeral) So I walked into this film after seeing the Prestige, so I would not have to waste my money.That being said, this film sucked. Why? Geez, where do I begin? Ms. Dunst walked through the film. she was the same character she was in Crazy / Beautiful. Not that is is Ms. Dunsts' fault. Obviously, that's what SC wanted, but LIFE WAS DIFFERENT back then! You didn't have to be alive then to know that. There are plenty of journals and plays and books that have been written throughout history that give us an indication of how people behaved. If she grew up as royalty, she should have behaved as royalty. Even Princess Diana was slightly rebellious, but she didn't act like a fun-loving slut at the mall! The first 20 minutes of the film can be edited down to 5 minutes. How many times do we need to see them eating and then sitting in bed? The ""funny"" line about how he will get her pregnant when he returns from his trip ""Things will go swimmingly."") was stupid. This was the 1700s. No one associated SWIMMING SPERM with pregnancy back then. They didn't even know what sperm was.Um .... this film covers 23 years???!!!!! From the time she was 15 until she is 38!!!!!! REALLY? No one ages! No one grows their hair? Nothing changes in 23 years! The directing was terrible. How many times were actors walking in one direction and then there is a camera change and they are walking in the other direction? what was with the SNEAKERS in that shoe scene? NO ONE NOTICED A PAIR OF SNEAKERS????? The cinematography sucked. 1/3 of the scenes were hazy, another 1/3 looked like an Estee Lauder or Palmolive commercial, and another 1/3 were so well lit that I thought they were going to start doing brain surgery! Didn't anyone tell SC that in the 1700s people lived by candle light? HOW ABOUT SOME DARK, MODDY, REAL-LOOKING SCENES? The dialog sucked? I think SC knows she can't write dialog and that is why she kept it to a minimum.Thecasting sucked. I normally like pretty little sexy blond chicks like KD, but she put no effort into the film at all. Obviously I was not there, but the idea of her character acting so ""girly"" is really a disgusting way to portray a historic figure, who everyone knows WAS NOT girly! Um .... she cast a Jewish guy to play a FRENCH KING? Oh, the anti-Semitic Europeans will just love that.simply put, Marie Antoinette was NOT a likable historic figure. She was a spoiled, bratty, self-righteous, obnoxious, self-centered bitch who had no regard for anything or anyone outside of her immediate orbit. That is why they cut her head off. If SC wanted to show that there was more to her than that ... that she was just a dumb-ass girly girl who liked to during champagne and eat pastries than well ... she STILL ScrewEd up this movie because --- there was NO DRAMA, NO SUSPENSE, NO CHARACTER ARC, NO STORY ARC, NO INTERESTING SCENES, NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, and on and on and on.If SC never made a film again it would be of absolutely no loss to the arts whatsoever. She has no skills as a writer or director and does deserve the opportunities she has.Ms. Copolla, has wasted my time! I want my 2 hours back! she has robbed me of my time and my energy and has insulted me and others. She should go and live in daddy's mansion and watch some movies and learn how to make them. I honestly do not feel she has ever seen a movie before. How in the world can she be so out of touch with what a movie is ... and all it can be.She screwed up. This film sucked. Please save your time and money and go see something else.",Marie Antoinette
477,habschat,Brilliant,10,21 October 2006,"Marie Antionette (Coppola 2006) Painting the Habsburg Marie Antoinette in a sympathetic light is a daunting task. For that matter a favorable portrait of any pre-WW1 Monarch, discounting Elizabeth I or perhaps her father, generally draws criticism. This is especially true when said piece is shown in that Monarch's home realm.It should be no surprise the early controversy of Coppola's Marie-Antoinette would be met with strong reaction in France, given Coppola's presentation (though I know it has equally been met with praise.) History has largely taken the stance Marie-Antoinette was a shallow creature who brought on her own destruction, though noting her actions once arrested were dignified.Rather than compare Coppola's work to another film, I would instead compare it to Velazquez's masterpiece The Infanta Maria-Theresa (another Habsburg joined in Royal marriage to the Bourbons.)Velzaquez was the court painter for the Spanish Habsburg's and this work was commissioned to present to potential suitors, namely the French Dauphin the future Louis XIV of France. One can see the how Velazquez highlights poor Maria-Theresa's (few) attributes, yet cleverly retains her homely features. However it is in her eyes we see the sadness, perhaps the young Infanta understands her position in life - to breed a royal heir in some foreign court.I liken Coppola's Antoinette to this portrait. As I have called Velazquez's work a masterpiece, it may very well be after further reflection I call Anoinette a masterpiece.Kirsten Dunst is well cast as Antoinette and carries the film throughout. It is not a baity role, rather complexly subtle (and IMHO difficult to carry off.) Coppola does not turn this into a political piece, instead certain matters which help discourage the Queen of France's popularity are ""mentioned."" The unpopular alliance with Austria, the length of time for an heir, the beginning of the Austro-Prussian-Russian partion of Poland, spending, gossip (etc.) These matters as well as the sumptuous sets and props are mainly background. Coppola's focus is on Antoinette's coming of age.The supporting players are backdrops as well, still several are given an opportunity to shine. Marianne Faithful is wonderful as the Austrian Empress Maria-Theresa, Steve Coogan is excellent as Ambassador Mercy, and Asia Argento shines as the Madame du Barry. Jason Schwartzman, Judy Davis, Mary Nighy, Rip Torn, and Danny Huston also deliver.My opinion is Coppola had a clear vision of what she wanted to present and nails it. :rock on: Easily one of my favorite works of recent years.",Marie Antoinette
478,rogermj71,a lot of missed opportunities,5,22 October 2006,"Overall i felt this was a great first draft...it has the seed of something wonderful and with enough twiddling of the script (and cast?), maybe if she were to go back, re-shoot the entire thing, it might actually be a pretty darn good film. I guess this is supposed to be the final project though, so I give it just a 5.There were a lot of great opportunities with this film, but it seemed to me that Sophia Coppola held back too much, I don't know why--she really let go with Virgin Suicides and Eternal Sunshine, took some risks that worked, but here it seems they all fell flat. The New Wave music didn't work at all in my opinion, I don't know if that is the editor's fault or hers, but where someone like Baz Luhrmann can dazzle with this technique, every musical sequence here just left me baffled, and wanting to remove a lot of those songs from my playlists (I'm afraid I just won't be able to listen to Plainsong by The Cure ever again after her use of it, ugh...same for Souxsie and Bow Wow Wow). I also wanted her to make more bridges between what was happening then and what is happening now, in relation to celebrity, politics, The People, but she never quite went there other than giving these people our butchered language. I don't know, maybe she herself is too wrapped up in that world to make any comment on it.",Marie Antoinette
479,flowercates,Equal Pros & Cons,5,27 October 2006,"Although it moved quite slow (okay - very slow), I loved the sets, costumes, and mood in general. I would like to see it again after I've re-read some of the stats and general story on Marie Antoinette. I think I might appreciate the movie more. I'm a little rusty on my Antoinette history. There were subtle comedic parts as well as very dramatic moments, but I found myself sighing during much of the movie. I recall a moment where we're watching characters walking up the lawn steps to the castle, and this moment seemed to drag on forever. Also, the anticipation of a hot steamy love scene ended in a disappointment for me.",Marie Antoinette
480,jrmousehouse,Pretty fluff,6,25 October 2006,"I guess I had no idea what to expect from this movie. Overall it was beautiful collection of scenes put together with little dialogue and lots of color. The movie was indeed amazing to look at, and Kirsten Dunst was a fine actress for the role. The music was great but I had a hard time accepting it as part of this movie. I understand the reason for the anachronism, I especially thought the Converse high top tennis shoes on the floor during her shoe shopping splurge were too over the top for me. I feel like this movie was just one mini clip after another pieced together with big gaps in major parts of her life. I felt like there was something missing. I expected to see more about the capture of the royal family and the events to follow, however, the movie ended before any of that occurred. I will say that if you are not interested in history itself, and you want to see a fun, interesting and excellently filmed pile of fluff, then go see it. Definitely see it on a big screen if you go, it won't be nearly as enjoyable on your TV. Alas, my 10 year old would have loved it without the suggestive scenes, I bet it will be a big hit with the high school crowd.",Marie Antoinette
481,thebigsmuz,Misleading.,6,22 October 2006,"It was a fairly good movie, up until the end. I had forgiven the complete lack of even attempted accents (ie, Dunst, an Austrian who sounded American, and Rip Torn, the King of France, who sounded like his usual haggard self.) I actually enjoyed the use of modern music during the montages showing the decadence of the young queen's lifestyle. And the movie itself, though a bit underdone in parts, had good acting, and a well-defined and well-executed plot. Until the end.The movie ends with the royal couple fleeing the Palace of Versailles, which is on the verge of being stormed by a mob of hundreds...and the next shot shows the interior of the palace the next day, completely destroyed. And...that's how the movie ends. Not only is it incredibly abrupt, but also inconclusive. Those who don't know the fate of Marie-Antoinette may have actually walked out of the theatre thinking she escaped, and survived the revolution, when in actuality, she became one of the first people to ever be beheaded by guillotine. You'd think that in a movie about the reign of Marie-Antoinette, her infamous death might be included...but it wasn't.Sofia Coppola dropped the ball, in my opinion...as did whoever wrote it (unless that was Sofia, too.) I walked out of the theatre yesterday, wondering why I spent $9.25 to see it. I recommend that people who don't care about history, or common sense, go see this movie, because it is enjoyable overall. Just don't expect a stellar ending.",Marie Antoinette
482,valemj,I would have rather seen The Marine...This movie was awful.,1,23 October 2006,"The screenplay was probably only 2 pages long. There was no dialogue, literally. This movie was a huge disappointment; I wanted to see beautiful shots of Versailles for 2 and half hours I would look pictures up on the internet, but I ended up paying 9 dollars to do so. I felt dirty after I left the theatre, so I went home and took a cold shower. If you want to see this movie, do yourself a favor take the money you were about to buy the ticket with and either flush it down the toilet, or go to a bookstore and buy a paperback novel that interests you. I, like I am sure many other people was expecting witty dialogue and another take historically on the life of Marie Antoinette, but what we got was a boring half-ass effort, which would make Francis Ford Coppola want to change his last name.",Marie Antoinette
483,fotlguy,No masterpiece,6,26 October 2006,When I was half-way into the film I began to wonder how they would tell the whole story in the time that remained. Then of course the film ended with the Louis and Marie Antoinette leaving Versaille with their children for safety. Had the film continued on to their execution it would have included their harrowing attempt to escape only to be recognized and caught at the border. What a scene it would have been. Also Kirstin Dunst would have had to expand her acting abilities to portray quite a different queen dealing with her jailers and bearing up stoically not only with her impending death but with the knowledge of her son languishing neglected after having been removed from her protection. Would Dunst be up to that?No way the film will escape being nominated for the costumes and possibly the sets. What textiles! What an array of shades of blue! One could feel the fabrics. Marianne Faithful was surprisingly good as the august Hapsburg Empress Maria Theresa. It is always a delight to see Shirley Henderson. I thought Jason Schwartzman brought the right measure of languor and debility to the youthful Louis XVI.,Marie Antoinette
484,ohorgasmic,beautiful,10,7 November 2006,"Personally, I was only expecting eye candy and high fashion. And I got that, and more. People keep complaining how this was not in touch with the issues, how it didn't showcase France's political issues at the time--well of course it didn't! That was the whole story behind M.A... she had no grasp of what she was doing, what she was part of. The images, and colors, clothes, even the food--it's all beautiful. Versailles is amazing in person, but this puts it in new light. It's difficult to grasp what life was like then from the little audio devices you get when visiting the palace, and this really put it in place. I love the reflection on her life, and I loved seeing her in a new light, as opposed to being an inconsiderate woman, being a young girl, with no sense of reality, or anything. I loved how France's brutal, strict court is shown, and in general, I thought it was amazing.",Marie Antoinette
485,zenpincushion,"Horribly dull, and anti-climactic",3,22 November 2006,"I was so excited about seeing this movie. I am pf French descent so I have always had a fascination with the story of the young queen. I saw this movie last night and the movie was only partially accurate, but they left out A lot. I was very disappointed because it seemed to drag on the parts when she (Marie Antoinette: Kirsten Dunst) wasn't partying. Iwas mostly disappointed because the movie ended with a riot and people running the royal family out of the palace. Now who honestly wanted to see Kirsten Dunst get her head cut off? ME! Maybe because that is how her ( Marie Antoinette) life actually ended, not by riding off in the sunrise. Ther was so much that was left out. It reminded me of legends and 'Once Upon a Time..."" type stories that Disney has butchered and switched the story around. Although Disney's films are entertaining, save yourself a few dollars, because this one really isn't.",Marie Antoinette
486,philipdore,Complete waste of everybody's time,1,19 October 2006,"I'm sorry, but the impressive camera-work and fancy costumes simply don't address the near-absence of anything resembling a plot, or the paper-thin characterisation. I learned next to nothing about why Marie Antoinette is such an iconic figure, or about the French Revolution. In my view, a major flaw of the film is that there is no storyline taking place outside the Palace of Versailles, so we don't really get to find out much about why the people are rebelling, other than vague mentions about the cost of the war in America and the unpopularity of the Queen's extravagant lifestyle. The French Revolution was one of the great cataclysmic periods of world history, and a film set during that period has no excuse for being so deathly dull.",Marie Antoinette
487,bluefabrik,Don't expect a Hollywood movie!,9,29 October 2006,"I loved to see the movie but hated the audience. As the movie goes away from any known Hollywood format, the deceived audience of the theater I went found the slightly funny jokes of the movie tremendously hilarious and decided that the movie was a comedy and they were supposed to laugh out loud. My advice, if you want to see a Hollywood movie don't go for this one and if you want to enjoy a rare masterpiece don't go on a weekend night or don't go to a big theater. While watching this precious artwork, Stalker (Tarkovski's) came to my mind. There is something in the use of time that makes me compare them. This is definitely a successful fusion of American perspective's with European technique.",Marie Antoinette
488,jmichellepoe,Too Much of the Same Thing,5,20 October 2006,"I saw this film because I am obsessed with French history as well as the art of France. I have a strong background in the French Revolution as well as pre Revolutionary times during the Burbon Monarchy. I think this may be the reason why I didn't care for the film that much. I think she focused too much on the same topic over and over again throughout the entire film... She woke up and got dressed like 3 or four times ate with the king, partied excessively, and did what she did over and over in the movie and the film ends where it really should have began or at least been in the middle of the film when they take the two of them from Versailles to Paris. It was extremely disappointing for me! I don't think the film spent enough time focusing on the state of France during her reign nor her husband really. Most of the film I thought was historically accurate, but could have been elaborated on so much more and still been appropriate for the audience it was intended for, however I thought the ending was where it really started to pick up. I think had we the audience really understood what the state of France was like and how Louis XVI contributed to that we would have connected more so with Marie Antoinette or at least understood her better-- if that makes sense. What I did like about this film was that it very ""hip and trendy"" good music a nice mixture of modern music with classical music. The costume design was opulent and I appreciate that more than anything. I think it's important for younger generations to get in touch with the arts and history and this film if anything does accomplish that very, very well. I think it could have been better, but kudos on those two things right there. If you don't mind an OK script and eh... ending then go see this film strictly for the costumes, music, and direction of photography. Absolutely beautiful...",Marie Antoinette
489,nyquil_kid,Worst Movie Ever Seen....,1,20 October 2006,"When I say this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, I say that knowing I have forty to fifty years left to live. There is simply no way any film I see in the future could possibly be worse than this. This movie was an affront to anyone possessing the slightest concept of taste.First of all, the microphone used to record the actors could be seen _SEVEN_ times - who the heck did the editing on this so called period piece? Please tell me someone was fired for such obviously sloppy work. Secondly, the idea of Rip Torn and Jason Schwartzman playing royalty is beyond stupid - miscast miscast miscast. If Louis the XIV was the ""Sun King"", Jason Schwartzmen played Louis XVI as the ""Thorizen King"" - seriously, did he have a pulse at all? The use of modern language and music defies belief - a sad attempt at creating an avant-garde film; instead they managed to produce a film so bad I wanted to behead myself for wasting 123 minutes watching it.Too bad Mystery Science Theater 3000 is no longer on the air - they would have a field day with this film.And in case anyone here actually thinks this is good - it's because you are a moron.[8F] The NyQuil Kid",Marie Antoinette
490,jaclyn-barron,Disappointing.,3,20 October 2006,"This movie was a major disappointment to me for many reasons. I have always admired Marie Antoinette's courage and the dignity she displayed until her death. As one of 16 children born to Austria's queen, Marie was sent from her family at the age of 14 to marry a shy, chubby boy of 15 named Louis. The movie leaves out how young they both were although much later in the movie it has her at her 18th birthday party and you could hear people in the audience going, no way! she's not that young! It makes them unable to empathize with her because she was not what they had thought. Louis was plagued by a condition called phimosis, which prevented him from fathering children until after he had a minor surgery 7 years later to correct it. The movie simply makes him appear uninterested in sex. However, all of France blamed Marie for the lack of an heir, although the movie downplayed how all consuming she must have found it. Although, in the beginning Marie was very extravagant and a gambler, after the birth of her children she began calming down and became a devoted wife and mother who personally supported all reforms the public demanded. The movie makes her appear extravagant until the very end, ignoring the fact that she had instituted many reforms in order to cut expenses. But the thing about the movie that bothered me the most was that it took lies that the instigators of the Revolution told, such as a supposed affair between her and Count Hans Axel Fersen, a Swedish diplomat, and portrayed it as true. The cinematography for this movie was not up to par. The focus was not perfect; there were scenes in the movie where the point of focus was on the wall, not the characters. There were many static shots. There are several times when the scene is a room, and just the room, for 5-8 seconds and then skips to a new scene altogether. The end of the movie was abrupt, leaving many in the audience going, what...is that it? You see the family leaving Versailles, then you see the mess the mob made of her bedroom (a static shot for about 10 sec) and then thats it. Nothing else. Not even text to state what had happened to the family. (Which, in case you are interested: The family was imprisoned for many years while several revolutions happened in France. After a long period of time, France and Austria went to war. The former king and queen were taken and tried for treason, found guilty, and sentenced to death. After her husband's death, she was driven through the streets in an open air cart, and taken to the guillotine. After stepping on the executioner's foot, she apologized to him. Those were her last words. Her son was imprisoned until he died of Tuberculosis. Her daughter lived, married, then died leaving no children. Marie was 37 at her death.)",Marie Antoinette
491,f517988,Sad,1,21 October 2006,"After over a year of anticipation, I could not even finish the movie. The equivalent to a a trip to the dentist comes to mind. I've always thought the 1938 version could be much improved upon. It remains my favorite. If I had to choose my biggest complaint - it would be the multiple minutes of silence and 'reaction' shots. I almost felt as though I was watching an unedited version. I was hesitant about contemporary music being used as the soundtrack but did not find that to be an issue. There is one consistency between the 1938 version and this one - the inaccurate portrayal of Louis XVI as dim-witted. All historical accounts show him to be a well-meaning and aggressive monarch who was afflicted with depressive episodes. It is disappointing that he is continually mis-respresented.To be fair, I am an historian with emphasis on pre-revolutionaly French history. Therefore I may be more biased than others",Marie Antoinette
492,blondie_429,It needed a little more story,4,21 October 2006,"If you decide to go see this movie I would recommend that you know a little bit about Queen Marie Antoinette before hand. When I went most people did not know that her and the King were killed during the French Revolution. The producers and writers should have added some more history background so people aren't disappointed with the story. The movie was really based on the costumes and props not the historical story of this royal family. I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if they would have put more about the beginnings of the revolution. It is not the worst movie I have ever seen however, it was not the best either. For history buffs, those interested in the story and not the costumes, do not go and pay money to see it. On the other hands, those who like out of this world costumes it might be worth the money. I would not take back my experience with this movie, but I will not be seeing it again or buying it when it comes out on DVD. Good luck in making your choice to go see the movie or not.",Marie Antoinette
493,ritaleonova,Paris Hilton of the 18th century,1,21 October 2006,"Paris Hilton of the 17th century. This basically sums up the content of Marie Antoinette. Sweets, shoes, and silks of many shapes and colors displayed on terrible actors running through an utterly pointless script is essentially the impression this film leaves.The most amusing scenes of the film come in the first twenty minute. At this point little Marie is still getting used to the peculiarities of French society, which are rather ridiculous and offer comic relief from the powdered-wig reality of the rest of the movie. The discomfort between Marie and her extremely awkward, weight conscious husband, at the beginning of the movie is also entertaining. But, alas, all this quickly comes to a close when Marie finally manages to pop out a kid and retires to a devastatingly charming cottage in rural France. From this point forward the movie is a succession of extremely drawn out, ascetically appealing, yet utterly pointless scenes. Look, Marie with a lamb. Oh and now, Marie in a canoe. Awww, Marie picking strawberries. Marie falling asleep to music. Marie bored out of her mind! Seriously, whoever thought making a movie about a bunch of bored people would result in exciting cinema was wrong.You know how many movies have that one, profound, symbolic ""slow scene?"" Well, Marie Antoinette had like 50! However they were neither profound nor symbolic, but just unbearably drawn out. These scenes left an impression that the editor died midway though the movie and was unable to restrain Sophia Coppola's attempts at artsy-deep camera-work.If you're going to see the movie for the ""sex"" and ""scandal"" promised by the preview, you'll be disappointed. The entire conflict of the first half of the film is that Marie Antoinette can't manage to have sex with Louis and thus consummate their marriage. Although in the middle of the film Marie does have an affair with a dashing lieutenant of the Swiss army, the sex scene is so short that if you blink you'll miss it. As to scandal  it blends into the quaint, delightfully charming, overly pink setting and is virtually unnoticeable.Music choice brings this movie over the edge from flat out boring to annoying. Coppola should have made up her mind which century she was doing to draw the soundtrack from. Classical really clashes with 80s music.Instead of paying the eight dollars to see the movie, save yourself the pain and run through the mall at a dangerous speed and maybe a couple of candy and bakery shops while you're at it. The general experience is painfully close to seeing Marie Antoinette.",Marie Antoinette
494,Celeste_Miller,okay we get the point...,1,22 October 2006,"Sorry, but I saw this film last night and it reminded me of Groundhog Day, over and over with the same overly luxurious life. I know that she was trying to show the opulence of the time for Royals, but it got a little disgusting frankly. Having been to Versaille I found it very interesting to see the type of life that would have been lead in such a gaudily decorated palace. I stayed for the whole time because I was looking forward to seeing her head get chopped off; and was even let down on that. Yes, it was a ""visual delight"" for the first few minutes, but beautiful pastries and gowns do not a riveting plot make. Although I will say that I am usually not a Kirsten Dunst fan (with the exception of Drop Dead Gorgeous) she actually did quite well at showing the insipid, selfish nature of Marie Antoinettte. I was dumber for having stayed the whole time. Sorry if you disagree, but that is just my opinion.",Marie Antoinette
495,bernierobe,"Slow, but they stopped too soon.",4,22 October 2006,"If the purpose of this movie was to convey the tedium of living as royalty in 18th century France, it was a success. If it was to portray a more 3-dimensional image of Marie Antoinette than what we get in high school history class, it was a failure. At the end of the movie, she still seemed 2-dimensional. I did think the costumes, makeup and scenery were all splendid, as befitting a big-budget movie. I found the mix of modern and classical music disconcerting. It seemed quite surreal at times, and made the whole movie less authentic . I found myself wondering about the historical accuracy of much of the content (doubts which a quick online history review supports).Much - no, most of the movie focused on court life at Versailles, only briefly alluding to the riots building beyond the royal grounds. When the revolution finally forces itself on the court and the opportunity arises for character and plot development, the movie suddenly ends with a short goodbye and a still of a trashed palace room (I guess that's a spoiler). Maybe the reason they had trouble ending it there was because it shouldn't have ended there. It would be four more years before her execution. Surely, the story did not end at Versailles.",Marie Antoinette

497,Chrishutson353,Great Film,8,22 October 2006,"This was a really good film. I wasn't sure as I was watching it whether I liked it or not and I had to think about the aesthetic presentation a bit to decide, but after much contemplation I've decided it's a wonderful movie. The reason I had to think about it is that the artistic interpretation is unusual.Visually, of course, it was stunning. The movie was filmed on location at Versailles and the costumes were magnificent; and, Kirsten Dunst is her usual lovely self so everything was easy on the eyes. From a historical standpoint the film seems accurate (from the bit I've read on the subject) although its a bit thin on facts.The controversy at Cannes, (and what I had to think about) turns, I think, on the contemporary language and score, interspersed with period costumes, music, and production design. It is that strange mix of flavors, however, that ultimately makes the film special and allows it to convey the spirit of Marie Antoinette and the world in which she lived. It communicates her fundamentally frivolous nature and helps us to understand the way that she was viewed in her own time, by introducing some elements of what we might have seen had she lived today.Good movie, definitely worth the money and sure to win some Academy nods for cinematography and costume design, at least.",Marie Antoinette
498,jakefreekinsmith,Visually beautiful and Stylistically New,9,23 October 2006,"I personally am offended by how many bad reviews i have read of this film.First of all, it's one of the first historical epics I've seen that didn't feature an overabundance of British accents, as if since people weren't going to speak their native tongues, they'd decide to speak British?Second of all, i thought it was an excellent portrayal of how ridiculous court life really was. It was stunning and awkward at the same time.But what really bothered me about many of the critiques of this movie is the fact that they bashed it's lack of dialog. Guess what critics, dialog is NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY!!! I thought not using dialog as a crutch was an excellent choice for this film, and it made the small amount of dialog that did occur so much more insightful and delicious. The dialog was only used when it needed to be and I loved that.But just to warn anyone going to see it, you will crave desserts after the movie.",Marie Antoinette

500,jolie21286,"Marie Anoinette-- beautiful, touching, and fun film",9,23 October 2006,"I went into this film with a chip on my shoulder, expecting the worse of one of my favorite directors, Sofia Coppola. I saw the soundtrack and was immediately frustrated b/c i knew how good this film could be and i felt that the music would ruin it. But then I saw it. Marie Antoinette was beyond and above one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen, coming just behind GWTW. The music made the film so much fun and yet it was still very touching, uncomfortable and vulnerable. Dunst is absolutely perfect for this role and Schwartzman was surprisingly fantastic as Louis. As a history major, the film was not as historically accurate as i would have hoped for BUT the portrayal of the characters was perfect; Dunst was naive and heart-breakingly vulnerable, and Schwartzman was adorably uncomfortable and yet painfully pathetic. As far as the other characters go, Rip Torn and Asia A. were fantastic as Louis and Madame Du Barry and Molly Shannon could have been left out and replaced easily. I honestly think this movie could have not been any more perfect. I highly, highly recommend this movie, it's probably not a movie for everyone, but if you are a Coppola fan, see this movie.",Marie Antoinette
501,c-ranallo,Loved it!,9,23 October 2006,"Nobody could have played the part better than Kirsten Dunst especially with Sophia behind the camera. It might be one of my favorite roles she has done. It's a beautiful but tragic story that seems to be completely unlike society today but only in the fashion sense. The parallel's of how people spent their time in 1700 France and how people spend their time today astounds me. For as little dialog there is in this movie, It says a lot. It broke my heart when they took her dog away (that's just mean!)and I would have liked to have seen more of the Count!!PS - Jason Schwartzman was genius as Loius Auguste.",Marie Antoinette
502,worldstylemag,"Lavish Movie, Little Substance",6,23 October 2006,"Let them eat cake: No, the Queen of France never actually uttered those words, but it was such scandal and speculation that ultimately aided in her death and the fall of the French monarchy in the 18th Century.Sofia Coppola's adaptation of the story aims to update the historical tale with punk music, a royal heiress with a cheerleader accent, and (questionably) Converse sneakers- perhaps an allusion to her transformation from a simple Austrian princess to an extravagant, over-indulgent European Queen. The success of Marie Antionette lies in the lavish spreads of opulence, detailed shots of fine costume, food, sexual encounters, and the extremes of an oblivious aristocratic society. All well and good, but after the first hour, one had to wonder how long this description would continue. What the movie lacked was the growing sense of urgency that the Queen, upon maturing in her royal status, began to display to the people and her court. The film also failed to show Marie Antionette's growing participation in the political direction of the French monarchy. Missing is her highly noted (and disdained) influence on Louis XVI's decision-making.Instead, all we see is a frivolous teenager, who spends most of her days shopping, eating, gossiping, and partying. Only towards the end of the movie, do we see the Queen's loyalty to her king, vowing to stay at Versailles until the bitter end. But even then, her role is limited, playing more the part of loyal wife that influential political force. Because of this, the Queen never grows up, and in a sense remains a child; and thus the movie does the same, displaying the beginnings of something great, but never quite flourishing to it's truly monumental state.http://www.lavishmag.blogspot.com",Marie Antoinette
503,maryan-7,waste of money to watch at a theater,4,23 October 2006,"we went to watch this, really expecting some decent entertainment and fun. the music is chosen well but the story gets really boring as the movie lurks on and on and even if you have developed feelings of sympathy towards the main character, in the last 20 minutes of the movie you really just want to see the credits and get it over with.i have failed to make out a climax in this movie and i personally thought putting a pair of baby blue chuck Taylor's in the scene showing her shoe closet ( i don't really know why i would need an obvious connection to our wasteful lives in the year 2006) was a bit uncalled for.i'm sure there was a lot of great intentions involved in the making of this movie. and i can see that it's quite a task for a director... but whatever she was trying to do, Coppola failed miserably at entertaining me. as most of us know the story of Marie Antoinette makes for a great story, unfortunately the movie doesn't.",Marie Antoinette
504,equine7636,"If you were interested enough to come to this site and read a review, this movie is for you!",8,24 October 2006,"I thought it was a very well put together movie. It wasn't the typical dark period film with horrible acting; on the contrary, it was aesthetically amazing, and portrayed how I somewhat think life in Versaille really was- obviously there were modern clichés thrown in, and the directors own interpretation, and I don't mean to say it was historically accurate (I neither know nor care if it was), but it shows the gilt surroundings and the leisure time very well. It is perhaps a bit drawn out, but you're so distracted by the prettiness of all the scenes that it doesn't seem to bother most people. If you don't have an interest in history, you may not like it as much. Likewise, if you have are a stickler for accurate films you may not like it.There was amazing acting. The script maybe left a little more to be desired vocally, but Dunst managed to portray every feeling in a glance- the last scene in particular. The ending itself.. was a surprise. When it cut to the credits the theater resounded with ""What's?"", but it was still a good movie.",Marie Antoinette
505,donalmacerlane,Brave and creative undertaking by Coppola,8,20 December 2020,"So this movie showed up in my Netflix, and without expecting much I turned it on just to pass the time; however, after just a few minutes, I was completely sucked in. Firstly, this film is a visual feast: the costumes, the palaces; and the gardens are artworks in themselves. Honestly, you could watch this movie just for the luscious imagery and have an enjoyable experience.As much as I loved the imagery, it was the story which really captivated me. I will add that I am a massive history nerd, and perhaps this was one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. Yes, the film isn't 100% historically accurate; however, it is reasonably so. The bizarre rituals of the French court shown are mostly true. The depiction of Du Barry and how she interacts with Marie is also true. The depiction of Louis the 16th later in the marriage is a bit unfair, and admittedly I feel showing him as more competent(which he was) would have contributed better to the film. Despite the exact historical of events not being the goal or intention of the director, the film is actually reasonably historically accurate.People complain about politics and the American war of independence not being involved enough because those were key contributors to the outbreak of the French revolution. For me though, this view is unfair, normally I'd be happy to pick up a book or watch a documentary on the causes of the French revolution, but this is not about the French revolution, it is about a girl in the springtime of her life being forced to live far away from home, to man she does not know, surrounded by people judging and criticizing her every move and on top of that having the weighty pressure of conceiving an heir just to maintain her position.Marie isn't necessarily a likable person, but there are few among us who would have behaved differently in her shoes, and the fact we are shown that is the reason I loved this film. It takes the woman we know frozen from time in her portraits and pumps warm blood and emotion into a person who is reduced to a caricature in popular culture.The choice of music goes along with this perfectly. Personally, I think it was one a very brave creative decision to include rock music, but one that really pays off. The critics will say it is an anachronism, yet I think they miss the point. The music is modern and is high-tempo, yet Marie is an historical figure from days gone by. By playing the modern-day music, the director reminds the audience this was a real person whose hay days of youth were just as vivid as ours. It took guts from the director to make that call, and she did take flak for it, but I feel it is undeserved.Including the music is a creative decision that gives this movie flair and real feeling. If you want an exact historical duplicate, try a portrait gallery, and don't get me wrong I enjoy portrait galleries, but what this film is, is a well-made artistic impression of Marie Antoinette and her time in Versailles. It challenges our assumptions, builds empathy and is visually beautiful. If that doesn't constitute art, I don't know what does.",Marie Antoinette

Richelieu?).Not that you see any of that, nor the way in which these events affected Marie Antoinette's behaviour, attitudes or life.It's under-scripted, bereft of purpose (saving banal posturing from the lead - poor Kirsten Dunst has nothing to work with), lacking editing and falling guilty of the worst cinematic crime: being entirely unengaging.And despite the clear investment in costume, the film still looks cheap and lacks any discernible elegance (anyone who argues that this is the point must have a different idea of opulent pre-revolution France to me).It's a horrible film, based on only the flimsiest writing and serves only as an enormous ego-vehicle for the director.Going back to the plotting, if somebody made a film about Hitler and chose to focus entirely on his road-building projects, we would savage the piece as indulgent, selective and stupid.

507,gypsyrose012,Great form of public history,8,28 October 2006,"As a history major working on their masters, I have am well versed in European history and the French Revolution. Though this film does take historical liberties and express primarily one side of this story, I think that it is an excellent example of public history. It is beautifully made, and portrays the glamorous side of royalty as well as the awkward formal rituals of life. Though scholars will certainly disagree with many elements of the film, it does serve a great purpose for the study. This film will open many people's eyes to early 18th century European history, and make them went to go and learn more on the subject. Take a class, read a book and just genuinely be excited. In a time when many feel that History is a lost cause, I think that is a great thing. For those that are going to see the film and expecting a great historical and factual drama, then you will possibly be disappointed. However, if you go in there with an open mind, and appreciate the director's portrayal of these historical figures as real people then you will not be disappointed.

The cinematography was beautiful, Kirsten Dunst a sympathetic lead, and the period setting worked well. But then the movie dragged on without apparent purpose. The garden sequences signaled a whole long boring second half to the movie. Coppola seemed to be so concerned with pretty shots that she forget to keep a plot going. She even managed to spoil Dunst's likable Marie Antoinette by the end of the movie, which was profoundly disappointing in itself. The movie would be much better if it were about 45 minutes shorter. With twenty minutes to go, I found myself checking the time on my phone to see how much more I would have to sit through. I figured, ""there is no way this can all be wrapped up in the two hours the movies is listed at"". But I was wrong--Coppola decided that wrapping up the movie was contrary to her goal of an empty pretty film, and she simply put in credits after a final scene. Resolution? Of course not.

It gave it a more modern feel and completely changed the story. It's too bad that the movie didn't end the way the actual story ended with the queen being beheaded.

515,redheadedtrumpet,in the report,3,5 November 2006,"Marie Antoinette SummaryMarie Antoinette was a very interesting movie. It had its boring parts, like most historical movies do. The movie started in Austria in the 1700's with Marie Antoinette as a 14 year old. After that, she was informed that she was to move to France to marry the future king Louis XVI. As soon as she had met her husband, they got married. They barely talk to each other for weeks. At first, when sitting down to eat, Marie Antoinette tries to start a conversation with her husband, so she asks him about his love for locks and keys. He completely kills the conversation. In the morning, Marie Antoinette is greeted by her many new family and friends who strip her to nakedness and dress her. At that point, she says ""This is ridiculous,"" and then the woman dressing her replies, ""This is (normal)"". (Marie Antoinette). An example of repetition in the movie was this happening oh so often throughout the film. As the movie continues, Marie Antoinette begins to get to know her husband a little bit more. One night in bed, he tries to have sex with her, but because he is a nervous scared young man, he backs away before it actually happens. After that, they do actually start to talk more, and become more like a husband and wife. The second time King Louis attempts to produce an heir, he actually does, but it turns out as a girl. All the while, Marie Antoinette is spending money, more money than France can afford, on things that the French believe are not needed, such as oak trees. One day, before Marie Antoinette has had her first kid, she decides to go to the opera in Paris. When it is over, she stands up and claps, but to her surprise, no one else is clapping. After about a minute of her clapping and the rest of the people at the opera wondering what she is doing, everyone else starts clapping. Later in the movie, she goes back to Paris, and attends another opera. At the end, she stands up and claps and nobody joins her. This is a symbol of the French people's hatred toward her because of her spending of their money. When King Louis XV became sick and dies, Marie Antoinette says ""Dear God, protect us, we are too you to rein"" (Marie Antoinette). Well, God did not protect the couple for too long, because the people of France revolt and chant ""Kill the Queen"" (Marie Antoinette), repeated. Eventually, Marie Antoinette, her husband and her kids escape and leave France. At the end of the film, Marie Antoinette looks back upon her oak trees and realizes what she has done to France. I think that Marie Antoinette a very well written movie, for those who could understand it, which would only be the very well literate portion of the population.Marie Antoinette CritiqueIn my personal opinion, Marie Antoinette was a substandard attempt of replicating what might have really happened in the 1700's. It was a waste of 40 million dollars and lots of time. I would give it 1.5 out of 5 stars, because of not realness, poor acting, and poor setting. The only reason it got the 1.5 stars out of me is because of the few funny parts in it. I believe that the director focused too much on her getting pregnant and having her first child. Even though this was her main purpose, this is not all that the movie focused on. I think that the film played too much 80's music; I was expecting Classical from a film of this subject. Like the music, the film was more funny than it was historical. Marie Antoinette did foreshadow today's society: cheating on men, sex, alcohol, and spending too much money. I think ending to the movie was absolutely horrible. The movie just ended, with no facts about Marie Antoinette, no showing of ""funny"" scenes throughout the movie, not even to say what happened to Marie Antoinette. The screenplay tried to cover too much information in too short an amount of time. After all, Coppola (the writer and director of the movie) did try to cram Marie Antoinette traveling from Austria to France, marrying King Louis XVI, the birth of her first child, her cheating on her husband for an Austrian man, the death of King Louis XV, her son, and her mother, and her being stormed out of France all into one movie. The film also jumped around a lot. This made it hard to understand one scene before it moved on to the next. Judging from the amount of people in the theater, not many people would like to see this movie. There was only about 30 people in the house, and, out of those, 8 were English students wanting extra credit. After the movie, I heard one person that I do not know say, ""(she) could have watched better TV at home"" (random person at the movie theater). I am going to have to agree with this person about the movie Marie Antoinette.",Marie Antoinette

France as a whole was stewing in desperate poverty and starvation. The intolerable living conditions eventually result in a revolt and creation of a nation of iron democrats.

The plot was practically non-existent, the music was bad, the lead actors/actresses showed no effort of getting into their characters, and the director didn't even seem to have a point in making the movie, unless he simply wanted the world to know that Versailles was one giant frat party. The only part of the movie that might have been redeeming is if they had actually showed Marie Antoinette being beheaded. I maintain that if you had listened to this movie, without seeing it, you would think it were a terrible, watered-down, modernized version set in metropolitan America. I seriously think they only kept auspices of the time period because the actors wanted to wear the ""cool"" costumes and shoot in palaces.",Marie Antoinette
518,gabrielladilauro,FANTASTIC!,10,10 March 2021,"Sofia Coppola's famous film ""Maria Antonietta"" shows us the figure of Queen Marie Antoinette, Empress of Austria and wife of Louis XVI, king of France. The film director offers us the figure of Marie Antoinette as a teenager of the 21st century that finds in luxury the way to escape from the limitations of court life, and from the carelessness of her husband who doesn't make her feel appreciated. The highlight is when the sister-in-law gives birth and she feels inadequate because she was unable to conquer her husband's passion, so she started crying . She spends her days between gossip, the search for flashy hairstyles and satin shoes, between her shoes there was a pair of converse, which make her a girl of the contemporary age who want to feel as an adult and that tries to adapt to the court life as a queen. She is defined as ""the Dauphin"" she is much loved by the people, in fact after a theatrical show she was very excited so decided to applaud, a revolutionary gesture that, at first time shoked every spectator, after everybody followed her doing the same. She spends her evenings drinking and gambling to escape from boredom, from the monotony time of court life and to feel free from the social role. She founds the way to relieve his soul through the transgression, secret love encounters, escaping from the palace to go to a party in Paris. During the film the queen grows up from a young girl and becomes a woman, and after years of excess, of frivolity, of waste, the people revolt, hate her, accomplices its foreign origins, and so the people begin to call her with the nickname ""madame deficit"". At the outbreak of the Revolution, the people gathered in Versailles inveigh against the queen, who has the courage to go out on the balcony alone and bow to the angry crowd. Then she will be forced to leave Versailles forever with her children and husband. The film is enriched by pop and rock music that express the teenger spirit of the queen.
I love this film because the atmosphere is very amazing, the customs of the protagonists are the dream of each girl and also the location is particular, I advise this film to all people that love empire style.",Marie Antoinette
519,Webmaster-2615,"If you like to watch slide shows of different types of shoes and cake, then this is the movie for you!",4,16 November 2006,"Quite frankly, it was horrible. I give it score of four out of ten. The movie is about the life of Marie Antoinette, but there's a slight problem: she had no life. When a large portion of the two hour movie is a slideshow of different types of shoes, you begin to wonder why you're wasting your time watching it. I want those two hours of my life back. The only somewhat exciting part of the story, the French Revolution in which Marie is killed, was completely left out of the movie. The movie was historically accurate, and very ""artistic"" but it dragged on and on and on and left me just waiting for the movie to die. Don't worry about spoilers - nothing happens in this movie so there's nothing to give away. Here's a basic plot outline of the main events in the story:First Marie Antoinette eats cake inside. Then Marie Antoinette eats cake outside. Then Marie Antoinette eats cake on a boat. Then Marie Antoinette rides in a carriage. THE END.And that lasted for two hours. And to make things worse, they played corny 70s disco and polka music almost the whole time, music that did not fit the mood or story at all.This is probably the only movie I've ever seen where I actually felt bad for the producers after seeing it. They sank hundreds of millions of dollars and years of time into it, and got nothing. I would be very surprised if they made even a little bit of profit off this movie. This movie threw hundreds of millions of dollars down the drain when they could have been spending the money producing a good movie that would make a profit. It is indeed a very catastrophic and unfortunate blow to the movie industry, and the companies that made the poor decision to waste their funds on producing this film will take years to recover from the loss.",Marie Antoinette
520,justinsond,Different point of view,9,20 November 2006,"I think that this movie was great...we got to see the point of view from Marie Antoinette instead of from another view. Some say this movie makes her look like a hero but I don't see this at all! It follows her point of view from leaving her comfort and almost casual lifestyle as royalty in Austria to the prude and proper royal life in France. She seems to liven up the French royal court and to enjoy life. Yet at the same time while she was enjoying life and being excessive the common people of France were hurting, and with media twists Marie was the one pointed with the blame. Overall a great film for a feel of the late 18th century in France and the culture of the royal family!",Marie Antoinette

Only the fashions have changed...Sweet spoilt little Marie-A in her pink bedroom with her cute doggy - something of the JonBenet-image about her? - then she's transformed to another pointless existence, teen queen of Versailles, party animal on the loose, no brain cells required.

522,celineheusdens,An allegory of adolescence,8,9 May 2021,"Fair warning: This film is not historically accurate. It doesn't go into French history, politics or the revolution. Although anyone can enjoy this movie, it was mainly intended for teenage girls and young women.Marie Antoinette was born into extreme wealth and is most famously known as the last queen of France. She was also just a girl. When she married Louis XVI, she was only 14.This is a story about Marie Antoinette the girl, not the queen.It's a beautiful film that tells its story a little differently. Not by appealing to our intellect, but our emotions. It won't make you think so much as FEEL everything that's happening on screen. Coppola achieves this with a bittersweet soundtrack and dreamy visuals, shot with so much care and attention to detail, it almost felt like I was there.Dark undertones throughout remind us that all is not as it seems. Underneath the onslaught of pretty things, towers of macarons and free-flowing champagne, virtue goes to die.None of this is said aloud or dwelled on by the characters. The story progresses at a rapid pace with quick cuts from scene to scene taking you on a rollercoaster ride of emotion reminiscent of adolescence.This film is not for everyone. It wasn't meant to be for everyone.But for those of us who know the feeling, it's quite the little masterpiece.",Marie Antoinette
523,pollardw64,This movie is very majestic in its scenery and pageantry But.......,4,4 December 2006,"This movie is very majestic in its scenery and pageantry. The historical accuracy, is highly praisable . The casting crew made an excellent choice of Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette. The casting of the other cast members was equally well chosen. Ms. Sofia Coppola has done an overall marvelous job in directing the movie, making sure it all fell together nicely. This reviewer, however, felt let down by the sound track. The movie very inappropriately inserts rock music into the main title, and at various scenes throughout the movie. Not only were these rock selection inappropriate, they were louder then the main level of all other sound parts of the movie. Some of the sound track was great with compositions that were time era specific. One can only hope that Ms. Coppola will rethink the inappropriateness of these rock selections in this otherwise superb movie. I most however give it a failing mark as the sound track has got to be the back bone to the entire movie. This sound track on the whole weakens the movie through it's distracting nature.",Marie Antoinette
524,saint_cyr_g,Marie Antoinette,8,9 December 2006,"I first heard about Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette in early July, and ever since I have be eagerly waiting its release. I was first in line on opening day, and was not disappointed. The costumes, the music and the performances were all masterful. What is most captivating about this film is how relatable it was to the audience, (or at least me). The camera work and the sometimes slow moving plot helped to show the true extent of the boredom faced by the young queen. By making Marie a relatable character Coppola was able to create a human face on a highly misunderstood historical figure. This was greatly enhanced by Kirsten Dunst, who gave a radiant performance. She captured the spirit of a young girl trapped in a world in which she had no control. Dunst was able to make the audience care for Marie from the very first frame to the heartbreaking ending. For all of these reasons Marie Antoinette is a true work of art. Coppola's vision is both beautiful and captivating, and should be seen by all.",Marie Antoinette
525,joseywiesmen,"She married at 15, became queen at 19 and it took her 7 and a half years to consummate her marriage.",8,18 February 2007,"Anyone who has ever heard the name Marie-Antoinette is bound to know two definitive things: First, her infamous and false ""Let them eat cake."" line and second for her untimely demise. Of course the film does not touch the subject of her death (which seems to make a lot of people hate the film and regard it as historically inaccurate) the whole point of the movie was to show a different side of Marie-Antoinette, which has rarely been seen before. Not to portray her court proceedings (which in themselves are quite interesting) or her beheading. Sofia Coppola's goal was to show an unseen side to a famous monarch so mistreated in her time and throughout history. One must remember that this young queen was indeed YOUNG when she married and took over as the Queen of France. Many responsibilities, including producing an heir with what seemed an uninterested husband, lay on her shoulders. I find that most complaints about the movie revolve around the many parties, shopping, and overall ""teen"" perspective if you will. Of course Marie was also known for being the Jennifer Lopez of our generation. She broke style boundaries for her time and was after all a teenage girl. Another touchy subject would be the musical score found throughout the film, which is relatively 80's rock music. Personally I loved the movie. The perspective was fresh and original, the costumes delightful, the cinematography beautiful and as for the music? I liked it. I find it added something new to a film that tried to tell a young woman's story with a new perspective and bring it to a more relating base with today's generation, whether young or old. When watching the film, you feel as if you can connect more with the character than you would otherwise with historical films. Don't get me wrong, I'm very stringent when it comes to historical accuracy, but for this movie, I felt as if I could let it go. I didn't care if they didn't have accents (a big for me), or if the musical score wasn't in keeping with traditional; I felt as if I could let that all out the door and watch Marie's story through her perspective as a young struggling woman. The whole seemed to make her more natural, more human than historical films tend to otherwise glorify and put their characters on immortal pedestals. The music and the partying (which she was famous for) just seemed to make her more like a teenage girl from today's generation which also really helped relate to her struggles. Others might argue that this was only a marketing ploy (the music, that is) to lure teens into seeing a historical film that contains many historical inaccuracies. If you want a film with historical inaccuracies why not watch King Arthur. Frankly, whether you liked it or not, is not the point, and you shouldn't let others influence your opinion. Rent it, hate it, love it, doesn't matter, it's what you take away from the story that counts. Mistreated, misjudged, hated?you have no idea.",Marie Antoinette
526,stranomostro-1,Not ready for the major league,4,27 December 2006,"Sofia Coppola tries the ""big jump"" to the major league of cinema, but fails. This is not at all an awful movie, but is evidently too ambitious for the current skill of our good Sofia. The first 20 minutes are excellent, then the movie starts to drag on too much, the soundtrack is excellent from the musical point of view, but is sort of randomly arranged with no clear ""idea"" behind it (for example: ten seconds of The Cure while king and queen descend the stairs, then an abrupt stop and the music changes, very badly done). Actors are good and there are many good ideas, everything is shown and very little is explained, for example. But the one, real, major flaw of the movie is... Asia Argento... She can barely speak, let alone act. We get rid of her early in the movie, but it's never too early... Not a fully accomplished movie, I'd say, Sofia looks for Greenaway, but all she finds are hints of Baz Luhrmann. She is not yet a great director, I'm afraid.",Marie Antoinette
527,theboywholived,so cool; you get it or you stick to documentaries.,10,16 January 2007,"This is a ground-breaking and modern film. Coppola has created a film that is original and clever, removing baroque music and the French language to humanise Marie Antoinette and bring the whole scene out of the documentary world. The clothes are fantastic, the music extremely original; it is all just a vision of a world of wealth and fun. So many people have said that ""oh, I don't like the different accents"", but why should they all have French accents or posh British accents (mind you, there's no Cockney)? Kirsten Dunst's accent has been used to humanise Marie Antoinette from a woman of history into a girl of our modern age; it subconsciously clicks in one's head that this Versailles is not a history book, this Versailles is a dream world. Everything is an eclectic mix of the past and of contemporary life. It is SO COOL, that you either are conservative and stick to the BBC pride and Prejudice documentary style, or you dare to break the rules and indulge in Coppola's avant-garde invention.

I would have complained immediately to the seller if I were not a publisher and have been told that from 2003 cutting heads in pictures was the ultimate fashion. When our designer made our book on a well known ballet dancer, she cut hands and the top of heads. I corrected this practice since hand movements are very important in ballet. There are some fashions I will not succumb to, for example cutting my husband's penis with the ultimate designer's scissors or crushing his balls with the last designer triumph of a hammer. Either there is something wrong with my DVD or Sophia Coppola is very chic and modern.

529,pointyearbowtwanger,REALLY BAD: serious decline in IQ points,2,2 January 2007,"Although I felt that Soffia Coppola was taking a very interesting angle with the way she filmed Marie Antoinette, I must however add that the movie just plainly SUCKED. Now, I'm usually an easy pleaser; I like all of those corny films that get Cs and Ds and usually just ""go along with it"" so to speak. However, the film was just terrible. For one, the directing was awful and the producing wasn't much better. One particular aspect that I loathed was the strange cutting of the camera from a certain angle to another without a transition. Now, I understand, that Coppola was attempting to display a more modern tweak to a more historical film angle. However, I believe that the strange filming deeply affected the connections between each scene to the other as crucial parts were omitted. For example, towards the beginning of the movie, as Marie Antoinette is looking out of her new French chamber window and sees the fountains in front of Versailles. However, instead of cutting to her face, to the fountains and back to her face, the camera just went from the face to the fountain and then to a dog. As a viewer, I would have liked to see something a little more personal, like Marie's reaction to the grandeur of her new home.In addition, the music was also terrible. I understand that Coppola was trying to be all ""edgy"" and modern with all of her techniques but could she have chosen MUSIC? Because, the ""music"" in the film sounded a lot like my lovely, but terribly off key Aunt Eva when she sings Chinese opera in the shower. And let me tell you, Chinese opera consists of mostly nasal whistling and high pitched wailing; an accurate description for half the songs used in he film. For example, in one scene, Marie and some friends are in a carriage when a song begins to play. And good lord, what a song it was. The audience in the theater all began looking around at one another with a stark and obvious look of, are you kidding me? I mean if the singer could have their song used in a movie, then at this rate I'll be the president of Mexico (with my great and highly talented Spanish skillsburrito anyone?).At long last I am done with what I consider a very thorough bashing of the film, Marie Antoinette. I part with you dear reader (Ms. Thompson?) with only a warningif you value your IQ points you'll walk away from the movie and go see something more intelligent. Like the crazy singing Asian on Youtube; hey, it'll only cost you 10 IQ points compared to a potential 30.Busily chugging down a variety of vitamins and proteins in an effort to regain a record loss of 70 IQ points (the reliving of the horrors of this movie cost me some).-Clover Chang Grade: F----------- (need I say more?)

530,bobman_and_superjim,Why I believe she butchered a great tale,1,18 January 2007,"The music was acceptable, and the acting was acceptable. Nobody would argue that either was great and it didn't receive any nominations, despite Marie Antoinette being a very famous historical story. From the beginning, where the story was suddenly lumped in, and the entire directing was uncomfortable (her passing into France from Austria) to when she was shoe-shopping and eating a lot (which was badly placed and poorly modernised); from when she had 4 children but the film seemed to think she only had 2 (though the paintings suggested she had 3 but one died, as did happen) to when Bastille Day was ignored despite the references to it...The historical side of things were put aside, and were based on inaccurate reports of Marie Antoinette's life. Not only that, but the music was poor, the depth of character portrayal was poor, the way that Marie Antoinette felt towards her children was not even shown and despite being a great fan of Marie Antoinette's life, and an avid reader, I can not bear to watch this film a second time.1/10 is my rating for the film, taking into account the level of accuracy, music quality, sound quality, clearness... but perhaps I'd give it up to 4/10 if I knew nothing about her life.

531,clautinez,do not waste your time,2,16 January 2007,"I was absolutely bored from the first to the last minute of the movie. For me, there was no story line WHATSOEVER. OK, a film doesn't have to have a story to be good - but there wasn't anything that entertains you or makes you think or does SOMETHING to you. It doesn't even have a special atmosphere like Lost in Translation or The Virgin Suicides. There is no character development either. Kirsten Dunst acts like... well, like a human being. She laughs, she breathes, she walks and so on. No real dialogues, no real acting, no nothing. Absolute nothingness. Marie Antoinette was a new experience to me - no movie I ever watched had that effect on me, not even those painfully predictable Hollywood comedies bore me THAT much.

533,jenny2007-1,Laughing... red of frustration.,3,29 January 2007,"Where to start? As many viewers, I had high expectations about this movie, after all, so much money involved into fabulous costumes and sets HAD to come with a good movie overall, right? I started to have a strange feeling about it from the very first minutes. I understand Coppola wanted her movie to have an actual feeling, but COME ON! Where in the world does she think a royal princess moves around with undone hair on the day she will be ""handed"" to her royal husband's representatives (not to mention the hairstyle itself, typically layered 21st century)? Where in the world has she seen any princess grab a cup of tea as if it were a dollar mug ? (forget about the raised little finger, we are talking not holding the handle at all!). A Dauphine would surely be bowed to deeply the first day she arrives in her castle and the subsequent days too (the film shows a crowd of onlookers almost mocking her and not bowing in a total absence of conventions). So that the audience can understand this poor girl very easily just in case they were dumb, conventions are very heavy for her, but the courtesans are free to disparage her openly in the corridors and never bow in her presence. COME ON! She was going to be the Queen! Being a courtesan was all about showing a good face and acting differently behind curtains only. Criticizing her openly would have been a courtesan's political suicide, not worth the pleasure of talking openly.I felt strangely into one of the 10210 series with a bunch of rich kids only knowing how express themselves with typical American mannerisms. French DO NOT tap someone's shoulder when they hug if they ever hug, they do not open they mouth wide and roll their eyes up when someone wins at a game (MA's friend). If I am not mistaken, I think I even saw a spelling mistake in De Nouailles' name when they play a game with names of people written on their forehead, the ""a"" seemed missing... ! (This is actually something that could have happened at the time as spelling was horrible with these people, but I doubt the movie did this on purpose).From 10210, we sometimes jump into a sort of reality TV that could have had Paris Hilton in it with : ""Wow! I Loooove those shoes!"" (great we were saved from a ""that's hot"" comment). Sometimes, it felt like the making of a photo shoot by Vogue of people in 18th century costumes taking poses in a sunrise. But never did it feel like a Versailles located in France on the verge of a revolution (it seems helping the Americans in their revolution was much more crucial to these silly politicians at the time, or again, is there something wrong with the director?!)Anyway, even though the focus of the movie was not on politics, overall, the movie felt as if Coppola stopped short of entering any issue specifically because she would have needed to study or would have missed the fun of showing food and shoes again and again. They ate cakes, the food was amazing, yes, of course, it was one of the most splendid courts in the world, but don't we get it after 5minutes? Couldn't she show a bored queen any other way? It feels that Coppola is taking us with her on her own discovery of the royal fasts, not one minute has she thought that a lot of people already knew about these basic and generally known aspects of that court. Getting a little deeper into one or two subjects may have given her movie a true direction AND actually taught something to her audience, but I guess - sadly- we will have to wait for a more intellectual director for that or get back to history books. The three points are for the costumes and sets.",Marie Antoinette

If this is how Marie Antoinette truly acted I would have murdered her before she was even crowned Queen. I felt the pastries in the movie were better portrayed and acted than the so called thespians.

I also had a group of friends that went to it in the theater and they all had basically the same comments.I understand the desire to draw a ""younger"" audience than usually watches a movie of this type. However, I think that by pursuing the lowest common denominator they seemed to not only driving away people that normally like this type of movie, but they are doing it so poorly that they are also killing any desire for people that watching this style of movie for the first time to watch another.

The movie follows Marie Antoinette as she's forced to marry Louis XVI; a loveless marriage and what's worse he doesn't even want to have sex with her. At least an hour of the movie involves Marie Antoinette trying to get knocked up but her husband just won't notice her. After she finally does push out a kid the rest of the movie just involves lots of parties and scenes of Marie Antoinette in fields. I could never really get lost in the history of the since the soundtrack is made up of a bunch of crappy modern rock songs somewhat similar to A Knight's Tale and half of most of the actors were too recognizable and felt out of place (I mean Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI).

537,scdees,Marie Antoinette-a disappointment with flair,4,17 February 2007,"Sofia Coppola's rendition of Marie Antoinette was disappointing in that it really lacked substance. There were redeeming facets in the staging of the sets and the elaborate costumes, however, even though it is understood what Ms Coppola was trying to do, the movie fell short of the goal. We saw girlish rendition of an allegedly misunderstood young woman who was propelled into the role of Queen at a very early age. While one could sympathize with the plight of a young woman in today's world, during those years youth was not as immature as it is today and royalty was schooled in the manners expected of them. This young woman literally ignored her adviser, took no interest whatsoever in the political world of which she was a part through her status as the wife of King Louis XVI. She made no effort to learn of the French protocol, to determine the issues and quality of life of the people,and in her deliberate ignorance created a hostile environment for herself and her husband. Ms Coppola's attempt to show the Queen as a poor misunderstood child failed in part because she deliberately omitted a plot to the movie that would substantiate her perspective. Kirsten Dunst has talent, but she has not yet found a suitable character to display her talent. In her role here as in previous roles she is portrayed as an ingénue with blond curls and a Gidget mind.",Marie Antoinette
538,wodey20,Thoughts on Marie Antoinette,7,24 October 2006,"(View this review and others by me at http://yalldontevenknow.typepad.com) Saw Marie Antoinette today. Theatre was packed with twenty-something hipster types all excited to see Sophia Coppola's latest style-over-substance flight of fancy. I have to say, though I enjoyed both films, I actually preferred Marie to Lost in Translation, simply because I think the latter is every bit as simple as the former, but the former is more comfortable with its simplicity (And for the purposes of this review, simplicity isn't a bad thing.) As I was walking out of the theatre after the show, I heard one hipster girl say to another, ""That was the dumbest movie I've ever seen,"" which I think was unfair. Lost in Translation was not actually that smart, if you think about it. It was well written, and emotionally sincere, and incredibly stylish, but its central ideas--that modern culture can be alienating, that ambition and success are often contrary to happiness--are actually fairly simple, and for people who enjoy movies that express brand new ideas, kinda dumb. But the intelligence in Coppola's films is in the way they articulate a particular feeling. Could a book, or a play, convey the actual feeling of alienation and emotional stagnation in quite the same way as these films? Marie Antoinette's central idea, I believe, is that it is as absurd for a modern post-Populist audience to condemn the real Marie for behaving as she did as it is for the same audience to blame a person for remaining in a cycle of poverty. Both have few if any models for another way to live, and thousands of forces keeping them where they are. The movie captures the intrusive, oppressive reality of Versailles life, where it is next to impossible to be alone, and where protocol stands in the way of meaningful interpersonal relationships. It also, more than any other movie about disaffected rich people, successfully shows how having anything you could ever want can get very boring very quickly. Dresses are pretty, pastries are tasty, champagne flows and certainly lightens moods, but because they don't have any real adversity to rub up against, people have next to nothing to talk about. That the film is less than half dialogue--its most critically assailed aspect--is Coppola making us feel the utter emptiness of Marie's life at court. Watching this boredom on screen can and does make you feel bored at times, but it only helps us empathize with Marie, which seems to be Coppola's singular aim.Sophia Coppola, I think, has very interesting things to say about style in both Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette. Both of these movies take advantage of visually stunning settings--modern-day Tokyo, and 18th century Versailles--and both delight the viewer with some of the most gorgeous imagery ever committed to film. But both show the coldness of style when there is no substance below it, and the inhumanity that disconnect engenders. Contrary to what Marie's detractors say, this theme seems to me to be enough to make an entire movie. It was enough for me--who is essentially living paycheck to paycheck in New York--to have visual proof of the dusty chestnut ""Money doesn't buy happiness"" that wasn't didactic or condescending, but emotionally true.I just wish Kirsten Dunst were a bit more talented as an actress.(View this review and others by me at http://yalldontevenknow.typepad.com)",Marie Antoinette

Poor lighting and sound, and Miss Coppola didn't do her job on this movie, refund me please. Sometimes it seems that they had problems to get the actors something to say. The hole story is VERY thin and the the story that remains is told very bad. Is the film about Versailles or about Marie ????? What about Maries death ? And the death of her son and husband (the king)??I really hope that Miss Coppola does something better with her life than this kind of movies.BAD BAD BAD.Johan, Sweden.",Marie Antoinette
540,phyliss6,Not worth the time to view it!,1,23 February 2007,"One of the most disjointed, inaccurate renditions of an historical figure, coupled with a sophomoric attempt to inject contemporary music into a period piece. Who is responsible for letting this make it to the big screen? It rivals Dumb and Dumber in its execution. No credible dialog...no story worth telling...lousy acting...an excuse to create lavish costumes and orgies of food in a magnificent setting. A wasted opportunity. Unfortunately those who see this film without first knowing the history of that period will come away with a distorted impression of the French people. Hopefully they will leave with a better idea about how certain Hollywood executives are allowed to rewrite history, using it as an excuse to have great time filming in France. For shame.",Marie Antoinette
541,loteisner,History at,9,24 February 2007,"There are several examples of the undeserved critical response to MARIE ANTOINETTE that concern Sofia Coppola's use of contemporary music and the film's historical obligations to OUR expectations. The 80's soundtrack captures quite well the spirit of teenage oblivion as so genuinely portrayed by Kirsten Dunst. That reviewers expect the character of Marie Antoinette to understand its place in history exposes a larger form of historical misunderstanding.When Ms. Coppola's film doesn't satisfy a modern understanding, based on misperception, is it the fault of the filmmaker or the reviewer? It's as if characters are to act like adults when in fact they are not. It may also be likely that Coppola has given the viewer a more complex vision of a famous historical period. It is the story of the seduction of opulence, the oblivion to the realities outside Versailles and the vitiated wealth of kings that form the core of this film.",Marie Antoinette
542,amberkujak,Boo to Ms. Coppola,3,25 February 2007,"This movie is good for background noise and thats about it. Like most people I agree costumes and scenery are beautiful. However, scenes are drawn out and boring, also Coppola did a TERRIBLE adaptation of Antonia Fraser's book. I have never been a fan of Coppola's work and don't think I will be after this. Marie Antoinette's character was poorly constructed. People should know that she was NOT raised to be Queen of France originally her sister was supposed to be Queen but instead was married off to the King of Naples. Antoinette and her sisters had schooling but only that they would be proper in dancing, riding, and other such things. They were not raised to be responsible for the people they would one day rule over. Marie Antoinette in particular was not ... her mother had no interest in her until her other sisters were married off! Coppola had many other things that bothered me including the ending, Marie Antoinette never getting older, and the fact that she had THREE living children NOT two. (She had two sons and one daughter) Bravo Kirstin Dunst and Jason Schwartzman! All though they had a terrible director they did what they could!!!",Marie Antoinette
543,the_mindless_man,Not so great...,3,10 March 2007,"I will tell you upfront, my wife was more interested in seeing this film than I was. However, I am a fan of Kirsten Dunst. However, I am not a fan of this film. We found very few moments of actual 'plot driven' dialog. I felt that most of this movie was spent trying to showcase the wardrobe selection and the architecture from that time period. Otherwise, it doesn't appear to have much more than that to offer.The good things: this movie does feature a large cast, a fancy and always varying wardrobe, and an eclectic combination of actors. For the first little while of the film you will be blown away with how many people you actually know. One of them that surprised my was Rip Torn.The bad: Not enough plot, weird music. The soundtrack for this film has a really strange feel to it. It seems almost like you should expect to hear 'Rock Me Amadaues' to begin playing at any time.Overall, this film was a strange experience for me that left me rather unsatisfied.",Marie Antoinette
544,carmen-beer,Unique vision of Versailles by Sofia: a bubblegum dream,7,19 March 2007,"I liked the movie, it's a not masterpiece, but it is definitely memorable.First, the photography is beautiful, there really are some beautiful shots. The soundtrack somehow fits perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is amazing in the part and the actor that does Louis Auguste is really good too. Though many people felt the plot was empty, I kinda liked that. It's true, nothing major happens and changes M.A's whole life, except at the beginning when she is forced to become the future queen of France and abandon Austria and her family. Sofia dared to write a script which escapes from the obvious ones, where everything that happens is calculated , so that the average audience is satisfied and doesn't complain about seeing something that 's different. In this film, you really feel the boredom of her life, and how she felt trapped in this little world outside reality that was versailles. I liked the fact that the picture only focuses on Versailles, and nothing else. It's not a historical, political movie. It's a bubblegum vision of the palace. Also, I really enjoyed the pop touch added to the life in Versailles, with the champaign, the candy, the card games, that did not affect the spectator's belief in the truthfulness of it all, something that ''A Knight's Tale'' couldn't possibly achieve. I give it a 7 because, for me, an 8 is already a very good movie, But it's simply a GOOD movie.",Marie Antoinette
545,michaelchase,"A visually stunning, artful masterpiece.",9,26 April 2007,"This movie was absolutely jaw-dropping to watch. The cinematography is just incredible; not just the camera-work, but the fact that every single shot felt like it was a moving Michaelangelo painting. I literally was so overwhelmed by the sheer perfection of some scenes that I felt almost guilty for not being able to look at the shot longer. The visual stimulation is really just incredible.Kirsten Dunst does perfectly as Marie Antoinette. She carried the entire film on her back and did so with nonchalant, graceful ease. It also goes without saying that the costumes and hair are surprisingly unique and fresh, especially for period movies.One thing the movie has garnered some attention for, and rightfully so, is the soundtrack. The use 80's-retro and modern music like The Strokes worked seamlessly with the aloof, carefree style Marie Antoinette conveys.There is no denying that a story with some degree of actual depth was lacking. The significance of what was happening to France at the time, the French Revolution, went pretty much unnoticed. However, if you read Coppola's interviews and get an idea of what she was trying to accomplish with Marie Antoinette, you'll know that this wasn't meant to be a historical retelling of the Revolution. The movie was about her as a person. Not necessarily her life, either - just her. Period.One specific scene that I thought helped to redeem the movie in the way of actual depth (probably taking it from an 8 to a 9, for me at least) was the balcony scene, when Marie Antoinette spreads her arms along the railing and bows her head to mob below her, as they go silent.If you appreciate style, beauty, and anything at all visual and artistic, I highly recommend watching this movie. However, make sure you do so with an open mind. The film's style is somewhat unconventional - don't expect a deep storyline, and pay close attention to detail, and you should be very pleased.",Marie Antoinette
546,Katnipfiend,"Pretty scenery, not much substance",5,10 May 2007,"OK, so it had a bit of historical accuracy if not tons (the scene of Marie Antoinette trying on shoes and having a pair of sneakers laying on the floor comes to mind), but my biggest problem with the movie was the lack of substance. The movie focused on Marie's early life and lost out on what might have been the best chance for substance in dealing with the change of a young girl coming to a foreign court as queen and how she matured from a frivolous young princess to a devoted mother. Instead, the later years of her life where she actually had something to contribute to the world were just sort of glossed over.The scenery was pretty, the use of modern music interesting, but for the most part it was all eye candy and no substance at all.",Marie Antoinette
547,Shoeboxmoonpiebandaid,Horrific,1,16 January 2010,"The casting was absurd, the acting shallow and contrived, there was no plot or dialouge. I get slow moving, quiet films like Sophia's last success- Lost in Translation, but at least the characters were admirable there, the relationships substantial and the story was very witty and funny. But here- Nothing actually happens. There is no love, humour, romance, challenge, obstacle to overcome, building of relationships, depth of character, growth or change. The movie is supposed to focus on the character of Marie Antoinette, but we don't actually find out anything about her. What is this movie actually about? A giggly, clueless, naive teenage girl who jumps in a carriage from Austria to France with her miniature pet dog like some Paris Hilton, goes to the woods to meet the perverted king while surrounded by a few old gossiping whores, then meets her fiancé who is a complete bore and speaks 2 words during the entire drawn out piece of crap movie. The first hour is about Luis continually rejecting her sexual advances and how everyone including her own mother is disappointed in her as a result- blaming her that she can't inspire sexual desire in him. As if any heterosexual, red blooded male wouldn't want to bang a gorgeous blonde virgin. So she becomes increasingly upset and the scenes switch between the morning ritual of getting dressed, sitting beside Luis and dining in silence, and at night watching as he coldly rejects her sexual advances yet again. Eventually she 'rebels' and starts indulging in shoes, clothes, pastries, parties and a few sexual flings. Then finally Luis has sex with her and immediately in the next scene the child is born. There is no growth in their relationship at all- it's just as shallow and pointless as before. The next time we see her daughter she's about 6 and they are running around in the garden. This is the only time you see them 'bonding' if you can call it that. She seems to show more affection towards the baby lamb in the garden than her own child. In this scene it's pretty obvious she still hasn't grown up at all. She's still the same flighty, stupid brain dead giggly little girl. There is nothing compelling about her character that makes you want to delve deeper, or explore further. What you see is what you get- hair, clothes, shoes and giggling. She continues her party-hard lifestyle even as a mother and one day finds out her own mother died. The scene almost immediately after that is her giving birth to another child. WTF?! And before you know it there's a loud banging on the door and they have come to execute her. Why you ask? They don't say. That's just it, they don't say anything! Oh and what the heck is with the accents? They are in France for God's sake and the accents are all mixed ranging from east coast American to British. It makes no sense! Seriously, I was throwing things at the T.V. Thankfully they didn't talk much so you didn't have to hear it much. And the 80s punk music fits in really well too. This has made me think of Sophia as a talentless hack. If you want to watch a movie about Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Nicole Ritchie dressed up in 18th century costumes drinking champagne, eating, trying on shoes, engaging in shallow gossip and playing with poodles- then sure. Otherwise please for the love of God stay away from this piece of garbage. That's 2 hours of my life and about 20 points of my IQ I'll never get back.",Marie Antoinette
548,Selena-Burke,One of the most beautiful movies I've seen,10,5 July 2007,"I'll be honest. This is one of those movies that you'll either hate, or absolutely love. I don't know many people who are on the fence when it comes to their love/hate for this movie (however, I've never met anyone who didn't love it). From beginning to end it appealed to me, and being a person who doesn't tend to watch a movie more than once (with rare exception) I found myself watching this one over again as soon as the credits began rolling. There is so much eye candy to take in and subtle bits that you don't catch the first time around, that if you love it the first time through, it's worth watching again, and again. I can see why some people wouldn't appreciate this film, as it's a bit eccentric, but not so much as to separate the viewers from the history upon which this film was based. It's fun, quirky, filled with delightful acting and definitely for those who color outside of the lines (I quite appreciate the departure from forcing actors to strap on fake French accents for the sake of making it ""closer to reality"" because I'm often times extremely distracted by bad accents). I didn't much care for Lost in Translation, but this was a super hit for me and became an instant classic in my library. You must see this film for yourself!",Marie Antoinette
549,amneris-4,"Hypnotic, in a very bad way.",1,20 December 2007,"To begin with, I've never been impressed with Coppola. Lost in Transition bored the hell out of me. But this one was so bad I actually watched it to the stupefying end.I've just been reading several books about Marie Antoinette but couldn't find anything in the picture that comes close to Marie. She loved gambling, spending money, having a great time and flirting with Fersen, with whom she may or may not have been lovers with. She was apparently clueless as to what people may deduce about her closeness with her female friends. I doubt she was a lesbian but her relationship with Polignac certainly sent out alarms of the worst kind. No mention in the film of the scabrous and vile pamphlets printed about her and her friends.She did love her children; she did (in her own way) act concerned about the plight of the people (which didn't stop her from spending).She was devoted to her husband, even as he grew bigger and bigger in girth. There is a real story here of missed opportunities, anger growing by the poor over lack of bread and watching the elite have everything. The Revolution is completely lacking here. The Fall of the Bastille was a momentous event but you couldn't tell from here.Marie rose at the end when their lives as they knew it were over. She died with dignity, as did Louis.Read the biography by Antonia Fraser and other books about her. But skip this movie. Coppola should never be allowed to make a movie again. And I should never be weak enough to watch one of her movies should she be allowed to make one.And poor Gluck's music was left out. Whatever she was, Marie understood and loved great music and was a champion of Gluck, especially at the premiere of Iphigenie en Tauride which the audience didn't get and Marie stood up and applauded forcing the audience to do the same.",Marie Antoinette
550,smknoff,Faaabulous!,10,8 August 2007,"Love love love this movie!!! Besides the fun raucous energy of the 80's soundtrack and the prevalence of 'macarons,' which brought about a craving for LaDuree, of course, the little gems of lavender Converse high-tops in the Shoes and Cake scene delighted me to no end.Kirsten and Jason accurately portray the anxieties of being so young and forced into marriage. She depicts perfectly a 15 yr old's fear of separation when her pup Mops is taken from her at the Handover Ceremony, and then her frustration and confusion at the physical and emotional distance of her new husband at the dining table when she is in the Strawberries dress and the pink fur-trim costume.Jason even has the voice of someone who prefers to keep to himself and who is a homebody, but after a while their characters become friendly and his desire to please her is evident. For example, the bedroom scene when he is reading the book about the wooden locks in Egypt and she is eating her candy shows they have reached mutual contentment to be in one another's lives but to keep their separate passions. Then the scene at the Parisian Opera where she causes all to clap, he smiles sideways at her. After this he calls her 'My dear' and 'My sweet' and wears the biggest smile when his young wife is jumping about and most happy. In the scene when he announces to her that she's birthed a Dauphin, their mutual joy couldn't have been better acted out by anyone in the business.Hats off to Sofia for a moment that sprung tears to my eyes. During the coronation scene I heard windchimes, thinking it an interesting background noise. All of a sudden the music breaks into the Cure's Plainsong as the scene changes to the King and Queen prancing down an exquisitely plush navy velvet staircase. The music alone was enough to make the tears come - one of my fave songs I'd forgotten about - but the clothing in soft golds and ivories against the navy velvet was SO beautiful, and of course all this set against the typical Parisian grey sky... perfection.I thank all involved with this film. It has already provided weeks worth of entertainment for me and I can't wait to watch it again. Vive la France!!",Marie Antoinette

I'm supposed to write 10 lines, but there isn't enough to write 10 lines about. We couldn't wait for this movie to be over...however we did rush home to research Marie to flesh out the many voids left by the movie. What happened to her kids? Where was the French army? Etc. Character development was minimal and the pace was agonizing...perhaps to make you feel the same way she did, but never the less. I selected this movie and had to make it up to my husband by agreeing to go see a war movie with him. A movie need to be more than visually appealing. And even that wasn't a given. There were moments of very annoying jumpy, hand held camera work. I'm done with you Sophia Coppola.",Marie Antoinette
552,bradsau,An utterly misguided attempt at a period piece,3,7 October 2007,"This was hands down, bar none one of the worst attempts at a period piece I've ever had the displeasure of suffering through. From the grating American accents and American style dialog to the jarring, incongruous modern pop music that littered the soundtrack to the quintessential American girl Kirstun Dunst (I normally enjoy whatever Dunst does, but really, only the most blindly loyal fan of hers could have enjoyed this miscast appearance) in the lead role, this movie irritated me like few others I've ever watched. Perhaps I just simply didn't 'get' what Coppula was shooting for (a parody of some kind?) but this failed for me on just about every conceivable level. Yes, the set designs and costumes were beautifully done, but those alone do not a period piece make.",Marie Antoinette
553,stephenielynn76,Who ever didn't like this movie is an IDIOT!,10,17 September 2007,"First of all, to all you anal retentive accuracy buffs, this movie was not intended to be an historical rendition of the language, accents, or exact events of Marie Antoinette. This was an artistic, creative and musical interpretation on the idea of her. If you are a dull, snooty dolt then of course you will be exasperated that Kirsten Dunst talks like an American teenager. THAT WAS THE POINT! You probably also don't get Picasso, but guess what, he knew that both eyes don't really belong on one side of the head. IT'S ART! It's also a statement, a social and political point of view. So many young Americans today are more concerned with their love life and their wardrobe than the tragedies of the 3rd world happening around them. And even those who are aware have no real power to do anything about it. Yet so many radical extremists would love to behead every Britney Spears loving, Converse wearing tween, as a symbol of this country's extreme wealth and failure to do any good with it. It's easy to hate the young and the rich. It's much harder to identify with them and even care about them, yet Coppola and Dunst accomplish this wonderfully. I was enchanted from the beginning. Also, this movie spoke to me as a woman. It illuminates the very essence of being a girl, of wanting a dream life away from the emotional turmoil of reality. Struggling to please her family, forced to sexually pursue an immature Peter Pan type, always having to look her best, constantly criticized by her public. It spotlights the spirit of innocence and kindness that is also naivety and stubbornness. It is not important whether or not this was truly the way the real Marie Antoinette was. It's just about life, a real internal personal daily life. The music goes so well with the filming of action, it is really more like an extended music video, and Coppola's images are breathtaking and magical. I thought the post punk sound with the baroque images was just awesome! Historically, it actually is more realistic than most history books, in highlighting that the true decision makers of French foreign policy at that time were the advisers, not the royalty themselves, who really had no clue what was going on outside Versailles and were just trying to live up to what their elders and the court expected of them. Marie Antoinette probably never even said, ""Let them eat cake"", which is what makes us all dislike her when we first read about her in high school. This was more likely what the tabloids of that time were saying about her, using her as a symbol of wealth in the face of so much poverty occurring in France. Leave it to the press to stir things up. That's what makes her eventual downfall so tragic. It was completely out of her control, she was absolutely oblivious. The mob psychology of the French masses being unleashed on the delicate royalty, the scene I was dreading, is, thank god, not actually shown in the movie. It does though, make me think how truly sad it must have been for her, at the end, for her children and herself to fall prey to such violence and bloodshed. Such a horrible shock after such a beautiful life. Coppola didn't need to show the beheading that occurred years later, after imprisonment and attempted escape. We can all imagine that, we've seen gore before. What you rarely see, that she so masterfully created, was beauty: a young girl living that dream life of champagne and pastry, giving us a taste of what it might have been like to be a teenage queen. And also a sweet message, in that in spite of all her wealth and power, all she really wanted was a simple country life, in her little village with her little farm and her children and her friends. And for so many of us, isn't that secretly all we want too?",Marie Antoinette
554,tiary27,One of the biggest disappointments I have ever seen...,2,22 October 2007,"I am just outraged at how this movie that could have been an Oscar nominee turned out to be much more like a train wreckThe movie was exquisite with very good taste in what scenery and costumes are concerned and even some of the acting however this film is very far from great . It is true that the director wanted to accomplish a fresh new approach to a wonderful story like the Moulin rouge effect however I don't think that she accomplished this at all, lets face it , the music was vulgar and very out of place. The plot is shallow and has LOT'S of flaws and at the end it all just came out to this: She left Austria, she got married, she spend some money, she had some children, she got exiled, the end. No point and sadly no plot.I think most readers would agree with me that there must be a better way for a director to spend $40,000,000. I think I will give this movie 2 out of 10 for their efforts, mediocre yes, but not the worst ever seen.",Marie Antoinette
555,janusvanas,good film,8,27 September 2007,"I believe that this film is a great representation of Marie Antoinette as character. The film starts by showing her innocence and childish youth even though Kirsten Dunst looks a bit older than 14, for the first part of the film. Throughout she plays a marvellous character as she resembles the beauty and charm that Marie Antoinette had.The director also uses colour in a dazzling way, show the progression in stages in the life of Marie Antoinette, the same goes for the music. In the beginning more bright and luminous colours are used, to give you an idea about her struggle to fit into a new type of society as she gets used to the life at Versailles.At the same time as she calms down, lighter softer colours were used establishing her as an understanding character, as she also accepts her fate. Near the end of the film, where her life is thrown into turmoil and despair, black is used along with heavy music to signify the heaviness in temperament and character.The film illustrates Marie Antoinette's life as it gives an idea how she might have perceived it. How she experienced her role as queen and the Versailles society. Even though it is a historical story, I feel that her life is a good example of classical tragedy, where the protagonist brings down their own fall through their own tragic flaws. In her case it is her extravagant life style even though the cause of this is her, unhappiness being in an fruitless marriage and her ominous life at Versailles. The director tries to explain all these aspects in the film.The film also tries to show the outrageous ways in which the French Aristocrats reveled. This is done by showing the extravagant events and, by the use of brilliant dialogue.The film is a good depiction of the life and times of Marie Antoinette, even though there are some minor mistakes in the film.",Marie Antoinette

I hated it.I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie.It is stupid.It stinks and i never want to see it again.The movie was so slow. It didn't really have a plot.Nothing happened throughout the whole movie.They didn't explain things properly. Then in some parts they dragged it on and on.I feel as if i have been cheated of 123 minutes of my life and i will never get it back.I feel angry at the fact that i sat their and watched this useless movie and it was so horrible.This has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life and thats something.,Marie Antoinette

I was also quite shocked about the lack of historical accuracy...Marie Antoinette's life is a great story to tell and clearly the director completely failed to do so.

558,nighthwk1,One of the most shallow movies I've ever seen,1,23 October 2006,"I saw this movie last night and was severely disappointed. While the scenery and costumes were done well, there was very little character development or plot.Characters spoke in modern American English with a limited vocabulary (not even a fake French accent), the music was distracting and felt very out of place in nearly every scene, and because of the lack of character, I didn't care what happened to anyone. And it feels like it's about four hours long.Sofia earned some respect from me with Lost in Translation, but seeing this movie makes me think that it was all because of the actors, not her direction.",Marie Antoinette
559,vongole,dull dull dull dull dull dull,1,4 November 2007,"Apart from the lovely costumes and settings, there is very little to recommend this film. I think Sofia Coppola must be a closet fashion designer or interior decorator - one thing for sure - she can't tell a story with moving pictures and has no depth of understanding to communicate.We must live in a sad culture if this sort of thing passes for good movie-making: jumping from one mind-numbingly boring scene to another with no sense of continuity, no exploration of character, no attempt to build a cohesive whole.Kirsten Dunst looks lovely throughout the movie, but fits in to the background of late 18th century Versailles about as much as a Valley girl at Buckingham Palace.Clothes, shoes and dressing up seem to occupy most of the first half of the movie - and the second half plods boringly along to the inevitable end - although the story reins up before the Royal family actually visits Madame La Guillotine. No insight into the power struggles of Europe, Royal life, Marie Antoinette's character, the French people or the French revolution.Just in case anyone might criticise the movie for being vacuous - why not throw in some Rousseau? Bucolic scenes of Spiderman's girl - I mean Marie Antoinette - reading Rousseau and getting close to nature. So deep, man, I was blown away.Louis XVI is played by Jason Schwartzman. Well! Was he badly-cast or badly-directed - or was he given absolutely nothing (i.e. from the script) to work with? At any rate, here was a man who ruled France, went to the aid of the American revolution, and became Louis le Dernier (Louis the Last)... surely not such a boob as portrayed in this movie. Through Louis, absolute monarchy came head to head with popular democracy - and the man had a chance during the Revolutionary constitutional reign, (17891792) to come to some form of compromise. He sank into depression, left many decisions to Marie Antoinette and ultimately failed. He was abandoned by almost all of the reigning monarchs of Europe, and was left to his fate at the hands of the Revolutionary council. There, maybe, is some meat for a film... but not in this version... Dresses and shoes and food delights... To add insult to injury, along with her choppy, non-sequential presentation (I can't call it story-telling), Sofia Coppola has to show us just how ""edgy"" she is - and backs up some truly aesthetic cinematography with ""hip"" music tracks. How jarring! Not cool. Okay, so endless Mozart might have been predictable - but it would have been beautiful - and even then, there are other composers besides Mozart.The S.Coppola formula: get Daddy's help, round up all your friends, go have a big party at Versailles, play dressing up, shoot some cool static scenes in costume, then go home. Afterwards - see if you can cobble together the ""cool"" scenes to make some sort of movie - add some ""edgy"" music - et voilà!It's quite clear you don't need any talent to make it in Hollywood - just be an uber-cool Hollywood princess and indulge your fantasies about an Austrian princess. Oh, and having Frank for your pop can't hurt either. Did she even read Antonia Fraser's book?So that was 123 minutes of precious life mostly wasted. I would like to get the time back. I liked the costumes, the shoes, the shots of Versailles but that in no way compensates for the tedium of the movie, and my annoyance that someone as evidently untalented as S. Coppola gets more than a dime to make a movie - something she really is not competent to do.",Marie Antoinette

There is little dialogue in this visualize stunning movie. I don't think I have ever seen a story unfold as nicely as a visual not a verbal story. I think the critics would have liked it better if Marie Antoinette had been portrayed in the historic stereotypical manner  the high spending queen that brought France down. (When in doubt blame the woman.) It could have then been followed by lots of mob action scenes and a good, dramatic beheading  after all, blood and guts sells!.

561,jasonwromano,A Great New Classic,9,10 December 2007,"Marie Antoinette -2006A true classic, it has been a while since a movie has been made to such caliber. Marie Antoinette accomplished a great deal not only was it able to take a classic story from 17 hundreds and make it historically accurate, but it managed to be creative as well. To compare, Marie Antoinette is at the same creative level as the award winning Amadaous. Marie Antoinette stars Kirsten Dunst as the famed Marie Antoinette. The film starts with her as a girl of 14 being wed to the French Louis XVI and moving to the extravagant Versaille outside of Paris. The film then goes through the life of the French queen, the life of parties and excess. Ending with the historical end of that french era. Not only is the theme incredibly interesting, but the way Sofia Coppola the writer and director went about it could make a lazy Sunday into a roller coaster, so the two together combine to form a masterpiece. For example in the soundtrack choice Sofia Coppola used modern music that while had a feel of the classical age, the film took place, also had an up beat modern tone that created a greater connection for the audience in 2006. The music also helped with the atmosphere of parties, fun, and the ""let them eat cake"" ideal of the french nobility.The imagery as well was helpful in creating the desired feeling. With the time appropriate clothing matched with the vivid color it was hard not to feel engulfed in decadence. With all the pinks, blues, yellows, silvers, and golds of Versailles compared to the grays of downtown Paris it was easy to foresee the building tension between the classes in France that would eventually lead to the downfall of the royal family.One interesting and different fact about this movie was its approach on the life of Marie Antoinette. She was the main character after all, but history for the most part portrays her as being distant, stuck up and basically hateful to anyone under her. In the movie however you end up sympathizing with her, and it is not because facts are changed, most of the movies is held to accuracy they just were able to portray Marie Antoinette in a sense that although she was Queen of France, in a way that you can relate to her.All in all with the acting, cinematography, creativity and beautiful detail this movie easily makes it into the category of recent greats.",Marie Antoinette
562,gratifying,Visually beautiful.,7,30 December 2007,"When I first saw the advertisement for this film, I thought it looked very promising and it really appealed to me from a visual point of view. Upon watching it, I realized a few things, although they might not be so true. Sofia Copolla appears to like the directing styles of Baz Luhrman, in a way. Her use of modern music molding in with music that would fit into that time period. It was slightly confusing. However, it was slightly refreshing to be able to sit down and watch a period film and relate to it because of the types of music chosen. The only thing that makes it sloppy is the mixture of the two types.Visually, I was stunned by this movie and I don't think Kirsten Dunst has looked better in any other film she has been in. The lighting and the clothing colour choices were flattering on each of the characters and I didn't feel melancholic just watching it. Aside from the strange music, I think this is the kind of movie where the actors can get away with performances that are just ""OK."" This let it down somewhat and I wish that they had put a little bit more effort into it. In saying this, the acting wasn't bad at it was convincing enough for me to watch.I liked this film, but it just needed a little something more.",Marie Antoinette
563,v_radovanovic,One of the worst films I have seen in quite a while,1,28 December 2007,"As per the subject line, I did not enjoy this film or even any aspects of it. There was very little character development, the plot, while supposedly based on history left out the most important elements and it was about as entertaining as watching paint dry.Truly an abysmal attempt at what could have been an excellent film.If this should find its way to Sofia Copola (and I hope and pray that it does) ........... ""In future, if you feel the need to blow some money on a production that primarily contains some upbeat modern music, busty costumes and an excessive amount of partying please stick to something more suited to your criteria.

It is well depicted according to history if you know about French history and have been to Versaille.I have read books like Marie Antoinette by Stefan Zweig 'The Portrait of an Average Woman"", but the movie is more close to Marie Antoinette, ""The Journey"" by Antonia Fraser. The movie really takes you to the past, you can feel it. I congratulate Sofia for her art in showing history in a manner that we could really understand who was the fascinating girl named Marie Antoine,Arduchesse of Austria and later Queen of France.Waiting for your next masterpiece!",Marie Antoinette
565,floridajudy,Eye Candy,3,25 August 2011,"And like candy neither nutritious nor particularly satisfying. I bought this film at Walmart from the $5 bin, and feel as if I were overcharged (I'm only glad I didn't pay even more to see it in a theater). How a movie with this kind of talent wound up such an unholy mess is baffling.I suppose the point was that Marie-Antoinette was just an unlucky teenager, but she comes off as vapid as those fashionably dressed adolescents wandering the mall with iPod buds jammed in their ears. You can make a decent teen comedy out that kind of material: it doesn't work so well for creating a tragic heroine. Likewise, deliberate anachronisms can make for successful comedy, but they're downright off-putting in a historical drama. This movie can't decide which it is.The costumes and sets are dazzling - as I said, eye candy - and some scenes are memorable. The one where Marie crosses the border is brilliant. But the occasional times this movie gets it right just highlights its deficiencies.",Marie Antoinette
566,beelse,Crab,1,4 January 2009,"The worst piece of crab, me and my wife have ever seen! The guitar pop music was terrible and didn't have anything to do with the movie or that time. Whole movie is covered with cream and pink sugar and it sickens me. The story raped history, big time!! The scenes are too long. Filming actors lying on a bed and staring out of the window or rowing a boat are just too boring to watch. The scenes repeated themselves just too darn much. And there's no guillotine after almost 2 hours of painful waiting. I just can't figure out why this kind of ""art"" won Cannes award in 2006. The movie is meant to thirteen year old girls and you could make the same kind of bullshit from Paris Hilton. Do not pay for watching this!!!!",Marie Antoinette
567,xb10,Yikes!,1,3 April 2008,"Wow, where do I start? Simply stated, the marriage of 18th century France and 20th century eighties crap-rock was embarrassingly painful. Dunst, Molly Shannon and Rip Torn lent the picture a general tone of silly ""unbelieveableness"" (yeah, I make up stuff too) this picture was like Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton dropped acid and said ""Oh my dog, I just had an idea. Let's totally make a movie about that France chick that got her head cut off in France like 500 years ago"". At any rate, the blame rests at the feet of the douche-bag that green-lighted this abomination. This movie was lazy, trite and jaw-droppingly agonizing. In short, I'm glad this movie sucks so badly because it shows how vapid, insignificant and worthless Hollywood has become. Hopefully someone will rediscover the lost art of movie making.",Marie Antoinette

What is that about. is that a joke?? Good movie but that ruined it for me. Am I the only one who has noticed that? or did they have sneakers at that time?

569,iamsooooosleepy,a very entertain 2 hours,9,21 July 2008,"when i was going to watch this film i was sort of looking forward to it but i also had my doubts. id heard of how it got booed at cannes and i understood why, marie had an American accent, for someone so influential in countries history, i thought it was extremely stupid and was yet another americanisation of something foreign just so it can sell in the states. what got my hopes up was sofia coppola, who i believed can do some great work. i was in for a shock though, the movie was great, the cinematography is superb, from long beautiful shots of versailles to cleverly angled shots made to accentuate the marie and her emotions (be it happiness or sadness) and the excellent presentation, it won the best costume Oscar for a reason, and versailles is all authentic, and there is one of the best soundtracks I've heard featuring excellent post-punk tracks, but its coppolas way of storytellin that steals the show, every scene marie speaks in conveys something about her personality, making us fall in love with her and stick with her even when she does something wrong, its a fantastic job by coppola. if u haven't watched it yet, rent it.",Marie Antoinette
570,belaine04,Surprisingly different,7,14 October 2008,"When I first heard Marie Antionette was coming out, I thought "" Another history movie"". I am still young but I have always loved the French Revolution. I think the movie was a brave choice is how it was done. I agree that the factual points in the movie aren't very accurate which can cause disappointment. I feel as though this movie went deeper into more than what we can read in a textbook. It shows more of her struggles as being queen and just being young and having a forced marriage. I think it's a movie that younger people can relate too. It's not like watching a ""history movie"". This movie caused me to go and look up more on Marie Antionette. If you are going to watch the movie looking for a bunch of facts and historical items then you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a movie that will tell a different story about Marie Antionette then I suggest you give it a watch.",Marie Antoinette
571,thatjamiegirl8,sugary sweet,10,31 October 2006,"I adored this film. From the minute it begins It is as though they covered everything with sugar and gold leaf. Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as is nearly everyone involved! (I am so glad they didn't try to teach everyone to use French and Austrian accents.....sometimes it is painful and embarrassing to watch) The film was like a dream, slow and bright in the sweetest of ways. Sofia Coppola is truly amazing in her ability to capture the secrets of the young girl's heart. If you are seeking a historical biopic look elsewhere...this is more of a beautiful wash of colors. The cinematography is breathtaking, the characters are endearing and puzzling. The updated music subtlety brings a breathe of fresh air and pokes a bit of fun at the lush a overly lavish Versailles. This film is certainly not for everyone. It is the fantasy of every young girl who has ever dreamed of being a princess....the palaces,the parties,the ornate dresses and jewels and lush fields full of flowers just for her. (My husband would have hated every minute of it.) There is definitely a storyline to the film...but not so much as one would expect or even hope for. It's content is mostly just colors,textures,fluffy emotions and another bite of cake! Even though I would have enjoyed a meatier script with more historical reference, I appreciate the take Sofia Coppola took on the story in a more abstract way....sort of painting it as a picture. A very beautiful picture indeed.",Marie Antoinette
572,smccaskie,Modern and Uncommitted,3,13 November 2008,"I like the costumes and the hairstyles and that was about it. Both the dialog and the sound track were too uncommitted to be considered either modern or period. One moment, you're looking at fluffy pink colors (Pink Cons...Really?) listening to Bow-Wow (not that ""I Want Candy"" is modern) and next we're listening to some sort of period music over a formal reception. I get where they are going with it but, I really would have liked it if it were a period piece like ""Dangerous Liasons"" or a modern take on the same such as ""Shakespear's Romeo & Juliet"". Pick a direction and go with it but, this half and half thing makes me dizzy...",Marie Antoinette

This may have been Sofia Coppola's intention, but if so, why, in God's name, why? Making a period drama that avoids evoking the period is like making a comedy that doesn't contain laughs or a horror movie with no scares. The whole insipid thing plays out like a bunch of college students romping around Versailles in expensive (Oscar winning!) costumes to a rock soundtrack.It's hard to imagine anyone bungling the story, such as it was, any more thoroughly without blowing up the sets. Godawful.",Marie Antoinette
574,telmapereira_lx,You just have to see it in the right light,9,2 February 2009,"I've just seen this movie, and really liked it. I understand that it is not a historical movie in its essence, so people should not watch it looking for a biography of Marie Antoinette. I think the movie really allows us to see (I'm risking the cliché) a queen as a real person, and to connect her actions to ours today. After all she was a very young queen in a cotton candy world. The costumes and scenarios have an amazing twist to it, adding to the idea that this is a metaphorical movie, and I think it accomplishes its function - to entertain and to give people images of dream and joy and candy and shoes and pastel colors and...rock and roll! So if you don't take it too serious and you just watch it lightly not thinking too much about the history, you can really see and enjoy the person inside a young queen. In all, a very bold and intelligent option made by Sofia Coppola, that has to be understood for just what it is.",Marie Antoinette
575,eassae,What the?,1,1 April 2009,"I really had no expectations for this movie, as I had heard nothing about it. With in five minuets of the movie starting I was wondering if the movie was supposed to be an ironic comedy. When Jason Schwartzman made his first appearance I actually burst out laughing. I really don't know if I was supposed to or not. It's all down hill from there. The music is generic and has nothing to do with the scenes, Coppola needs a lesson from Baz Luhrman. The camera work and lighting are mediocre at best, especially with what they had to work with. The dialogue was written for someone in grade school. I just really can't believe people got together, spent tons of money and made this movie. I usually don't like registering for forums and giving out my e- mail, and I see that others have felt the same way, but I had to express somewhere how bad this movie is.",Marie Antoinette
576,gahandstuff,This movie was a disappointment for me and I was so hoping for it not to be.,1,1 June 2009,"As a young girl at the age of 13, I read my first book about Marie Antoinette and fell in love with her. The book was a historical fiction made into a diary about Marie Antoinette and from then on I was always reading about Queens, and above all Marie Antoinette. Before the movie Marie Antoinette came out I had read Anton Frashers book and was glad the director was using this book for the bases for her movie. Before the trailers came out for this movie I was trying to see what the movie would look like. When I saw the trailers I began to get worried for this was nothing like the book Anton Frasher had written or any other book I had read about Marie Antoinette. What ultimately killed this movie for me was the inaccuracy of the fashion; the ridiculous use of color in the costumes and the sound track aka film score. I'm a history person and in this movie Marie Antoinette's life was depicted as a gum ball masquerade only out for the cake. To me this movie was a sell out to little teenage girls with no idea of history or any inclination of who Marie Antoinette was. Marie Antoinette's life had so much sparkle, mystery, suspense and yes color that it didn't need any extra fluff. I just hoped for a movie that would take this persons life seriously but instead it was a mockery and waste of time and money.",Marie Antoinette
577,philpastaga,Is there a message ?,1,3 June 2006,"I don't want to enter into the historical debate. This film is not a historical movie. By the way it is quite funny to see the new attitude of Sofia Coppola not insisting too much now on her ""certain vision of Marie Antoinette real life"". Anyway, my comment is not there but on the movie in itself. What was the message ? Where is the scenario ? Why using the real Castle of Versailles if at the end Sofia did not make any effort on the quality of her technique : nothing on the colours (outside the poor scene on the ""sunrise close to the lake""), nothing on the image (I don't ask for a genius work on each scene but at least where is the novelty created in Virgin and Lost in Traslation). Where is the Sofia's touch ?????? In the flows of champagne, the excess of pink and the amount of cakes ? Boring, a long and boring suite of Vogue and Variety articles. Actors are so ridiculous because too much somes caricatures that you cannot believe in the story, get inside, share a certain idea of a teenager life... Nothing ... empty... from the beginning to the end. At least thank you Sofia for all the money spent for our Castle of Versailles museum... it will be used better. Americans are the biggest private contributors to our dear monument (and thousand thanks for that)but in general they prefer to organize dinners not stupid movies :=))))). One lesson from that movie ? Yes ! Real life (and real history) is much more interesting that this huge artistic error !!",Marie Antoinette
578,TheTechie,Did anyone watch this before they released it?,2,18 October 2006,So the question stands to if someone actually watched this movie before it was sent to theaters. I work at a movie theater and had to preview it before its release to audiences and it looked more like the cutting room floor hits the big screen than any kind of a movie! There were no less than 27 separate boom mics visible. Add to that a bunch of partially closed shutters used to keep glare off the lens. At one point more than half the shot is black due to one of the shutters! Did our theater just get a really messed up print or is it that bad? The movie itself was a bit slow. But you really felt for Antoinette. I really wanted to see it for the design and in that aspect I was not disappointed. The costumes and sets were beautiful!,Marie Antoinette
579,eadon,What a waste of time,2,30 September 2007,"I wanted to see Marie Antionette ever since I learned it was being made and Kirsten Dunst was starring, and being a broke college student, I just now gained my opportunity and I have to say that I don't think I've ever been as disappointed in a movie.There are only 3 short bits of dialogue that further the story in the first 29 minutes. Those 29 minute can be summed up in 3 sentences. Fance and Ausria want to be allies, so Marie Antionette is to be married to the Dauphin. She travels to France and meets her fiancé and his grandfather Louis XV - who makes a historical comment about her breasts. She and the Dauphin are married and nothing happens on their wedding night. There's the first half hour of the movie minus the fluff of explaining French Court protocol.Oh and RIP TORN as Louis XV!?!?! WHAT was she thinking? Don't get me wrong, it's not that I dislike Rip Torn, but in a costume drama? As a /king/? What a terrible choice.I'm not going into the music anymore than to say - if you're going to use rock music for a period piece, at least use it through the /whole/ movie. Don't use classical sounding (if not period accurate) music for the first 45 minutes (give or take) then use distracting 80s rock for 20 minutes and go back to the classical for the rest of it.So after wasting 2 hours of my life she doesn't even /finish/ the story! Just a final shot of the royal bedchamber in careful ruin (so they didn't do any actual damage to the room, only the furniture they brought in). What /was/ that shot about anyway? Is that how Sofia Coppola shows that the woman she wasted my time over died a terrible death, along with her husband and children? The only redeemable characteristics were Dunst's and (occasionally) Schartzman's performances.It's unfortunate that once a story has been done, it usually doesn't get re-told for many many years. This was such a waste of a story that has the potential to be a good film. Not to mention what it must take to be able to film in Versailles - that's not likely to be done again for a long time.This movie reminded me of whipped cream - lots of pretty fluff to look at, but no real substance.",Marie Antoinette
580,mgurbanzadeh,"its about the feeling, not understanding",9,17 June 2011,"I loved Marie Antoinette, and I can understand why this movie has so many haters. Marie Antoinette is a very feminine, light movie, that Im sure logical, looking-for-facts male population of the world would never enjoy watching. Firstly, the absence of the plot, makes the movie one room for feeling.It is the feeling of the place and the atmosphere which is a goal of the movie, not the actions themselves, that led to certain consequences. Commenting on one of the previous reviews I read, I can say, I don't think Marie Antoinette even needed this explanations, and portraying the Louie XV particularly right. It was not about him, the movie was about the age of reigning teenagers in chic and glamour of hidden rooms, It was about this age of beautiful dresses of the high society, overspent in lush. I love how Coppola shows this thru the visual beauty. We see a teenager, brought up to be married away, coming to a foreign country, prepared to be something, she doesn't really know what. So, she vanishes in the fun life of gambling, dresses, friends, gossip. And, she lives in this bubble of a world, where she doesn't really know what real France is, she doesn't really see what ordinary people live like. This underlines very well, how kings and queens of the time were distant from their people. About music: I loved the touches of the contemporary music to the XVIII- century France. We all understand it didn't look that way, and events weren't that simple and light.But the music, it just gives this feeling of taking the events out of the past and putting them on for now.Different accents, different styles of music, make up, and all that mixture in one big beautiful mess just makes this movie pleasantly bizarre. Its just as simple as that. Its not about the understanding,its about feeling it. I don't believe this movie could be better than it is. Enjoy",Marie Antoinette
581,evilbarbie1,Sadly Didn't Live Up to My Expectations,4,21 December 2013,"Although I enjoyed the film, and the music (I liked the modern music twist especially Adam Ant mixed in with a costume drama) I wasn't wild about it & felt distracted throughout the film, ninety five percent of the time, due the English & American accents, of all the French characters. If you are paid handsomely for a leading role, I think you should endeavor, to at least learn the accent, of the nationality, that you are playing. Especially, if you do not have the added stress, of having to speak the foreign language. A French Queen with an American accent,is just not credible, in my humble opinion. As an Ex, History of fashion student, I liked the costumes, hair & makeup, but for such a dramatic life, the whole thing seemed to lack drama, and felt it lacked lustre, especially the disappointingly weak ending.",Marie Antoinette
582,taylke,Being Marie Antoinette,8,22 October 2006,"Upon reading all the terrible comments about this movie, even though I am an admirer of Sofia Coppola's work, I had a strong fear that I would get disappointed with it. But, I was wrong! It was beautiful, everything was so pure and realistic. A great art work combined with great directing! I entered through a door and landed in Marie Antoinette's head, where I was able to see the world through her eyes. After 123 minutes, instead of being dropped into a ditch beside the New Jersey Turnpike, I was sitting in a movie theater with 100 other people who were fascinated with what they just had experienced.The story is about a little girl who is traded by her family as a merchandise to the French and has to spent the rest of her life living imprisoned in Versailles. She is forced to give up almost every right of choice and live by third party instructions. She has some never fulfilled slots in her heart, such as joy, sex and love. As a young woman she will seek ways in the boring every day life to forget about her pain, loneliness and seek proof of her existence.This is an intelligently depicted story, which will reflect Marie Antoinette's world in your current being. The point is definitely not, if she was good or bad, shallow or deep, if you are still discussing about that, then for sure you didn't get anything about the movie. Maybe you should stop watching Sofia Coppola movies. Only thing that matters here is what she had to live through and how these affected her feelings. If you are expecting to see a historical movie then don't watch it, but if you want to watch the story, of an innocent girl in the cruel world, with punk rock vibes, pink cakes, manolas and champagne, this is the right address, enjoy!",Marie Antoinette
583,kernkampj,Lousy movie!,1,29 October 2006,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Kirsten Dunst sure is pretty, but she sure can't act. Reminds me of Kevin Costner when he tried to portray Robin Hood without even a trace of a British accent. The director put in way too much artsy stuff and way too little story. If you really want to know about Marie, don't go to see this movie - what little of the real Marie it presents is highly distorted from the historical record. Oh, by the way, the French Revolution also happened at the same time in history presented in the movie, and, apparently Marie and Louis had something to do with that event, but it's hard to discern that in this movie, as well.

I think this film is very reflective of its main character, pretty to look at with no substance whatsoever. My thought about ""Lost in Translation"" was that the film would not even have been watchable without Bill Murray and his dry comic touches. Well, this film did not have Bill Murray.I'm sure she will be praised for her Sex Pistols-like titles and her use of rock and punk music in a period piece. But the thing is, it's been done before, and done better. ""A Knight's Tale"" did it fairly recently and to a much better effect. I think Coppola also struggles with her father's problem with cutting things out (Apocalypes Now:Redux). I think if this film was (at least) 30 minutes shorter it might have at least had a chance at being a semi-enjoyable time at the movies.Character pieces without character don't do much for me. At least her cinematographer will be able to find work in the future.",Marie Antoinette

Her progression from eagerness, disappointment, compensation and the end, which we all know.",9,26 May 2006,"A hauntingly beautiful film about how deep disappointment finds an outlet in ""creative"" frivolity. The combination of rock music and the rituals of Versaille never ""shocks"" thanks to the mastery of the direction. There is also a solid mastery of pacing. The slow progression of the film never bores; it reveals in time. The glory of Versailles is not shown at the beginning but only as the film and the psychology of its heroine develop. The films owes a lot to the leading actress and way she is shot. The close-ups of the expressive face of Kirsten Dunst communicate the whole range of emotions behind a women eager to please and to do well, but who is trapped and inwardly anguished and disappointed. Rarely have we felt so close to a famous woman so far back in time. The film also masters the art of depicting ""historical clichés"", such as MA playing milkmaid, very convincingly. I was wonderfully surprised by this unusual film, and will see it a second time.",Marie Antoinette

Even if some parts became dull, you still couldn't help but stare at all the beauty in ever sense. The music gave the movie a refreshing twist, the costumes were delightful to look at and the deserts made you want to fly to a famous french restaurant to order the most expensive sweets. To appreciate this movie you have to look at it from an artistic point of view and from Marie Antionettes point of view. She was only 15 years of age when she ruled France and she did what most teen girls would do with a large fortune, spend it on clothes and food. This movie let me look at her ruling as queen from a different perspective and helped me notice that she was just a teenager not a queen.",Marie Antoinette

Generally I like Kirsten Dunst movies, and I am a fan of Jason Schwartzman but this movie just seemed to drag on and on. It was not a slow moving as the horrifically long and boring Lost In Translation but there were several segues that went on two or three times as long as was necessary. The movie also relies far too heavily on scenes with barely any dialog. Not that this movie should have been saturated with dialog but sometimes a little extra explanation goes a long way. I knew what was happening but it was annoying to watch it with a friend and have her asking why different things were happening because there was no on camera explanation of it. It also ends quite abruptly and does not close the story well. Of course everyone knows what happens but it would be nice at least have an epilogue.

590,msvodicka,Leaving Versailles,5,9 July 2012,"As Dunst plays Marie Antoinette, the character is not at all Austrian, nor even European. She is distinctly American. This was a conscious choice made by Coppola which the viewer is invited to puzzle out—if, that is, they have the stomach to sit through a lengthy montage while Bow Wow Wow's ""I Want Candy"" plays almost in its entirety. Equally puzzling, Marie Antoinette ends with the unseen mob (played by really obvious sound effects) carting the royal family away from Versailles and onto Paris. I don't think it is unreasonable to say that most viewers expected the film to end with Marie Antoinette's famous beheading, (I, myself, expected such an ending), because whether one knows very much about the French Revolution or not, they certainly know that Antoinette's life ended under the blade of the guillotine. For some, this was probably why they watched the film in the first place; this is the ""ending"" that everybody knows, and probably, everybody wants. Andrzej Wajda's Danton has a gruesome and satisfactory ending simply because it ends with the fall of the razor that we all anticipate and desire.Dunst's blatantly American portrayal, coupled with this particular ending, strongly hints that the film is not at all about Marie Antoinette. I was not enjoying Marie Antoinette very much until I stumbled upon the revelation that the film is actually about modern-day America.Coppola took a page out of Brecht's book and wrote about the present day by placing it in the past. This is a very intelligent choice (also used by Wajda for his film), because—like Marie Antoinette herself—the American public does not want to be confronted for two hours about their own wasteful extravagance and crippling debt. This would have been every bit as off-putting as a play about WWII would have been in Brecht's time, because people go to theatres to ignore their modern troubles, not revel in them. Both Brecht and Coppola knew they had to diffuse their critique through the means of historical placement (Brecht with his Thirty Years War for Mother Courage and Her Chidren and Coppola with her American Marie Antoinette) in order to make their message more palatable to the public. Unlike Brecht, Coppola is very subtle with her intentions. She's so subtle, in fact, that most comments I've heard and read about Marie Antoinette balk at the American accents and the pop music soundtrack without ever beginning to ask why they were included. Obviously, it would have been very easy for Coppola to create a more accurate movie; these elements of her film have nothing to do with ignorance of historical fact, for she is writing without accuracy in mind. Instead, she's writing toward a specific design that guides her into, through, and from Versailles.Ultimately, the dramatic question is centred around this locale, Versailles. The entire movie takes place there, excepting for a few short scenes, and the film ends when the royal family is forced to leave its grounds. For the people of France, Versailles and Marie Antoinette, herself, came to symbolise all the wasteful extravagance and debt France would come to know. For us, watching Coppola's film, the palace and the woman can symbolise just the same thing. Jason Schwartzman plays almost too well a dithering and passionless Louis, who could either be seen as a U.S. banker, or, more appropriately, a governmental figure who is appealed to when his ""Madame Deficit"" is running short of funds. Despite being accurate to the historical record we have, the scene where Antoinette is told that she's spending far outside her budget, and her glib response that she'll just ask her King for more money—money France doesn't even have—is far too reminiscent of the U.S. Government's bloated borrowing record and its numerous, recent bail-outs, which were in the air long before they occurred two years after Coppola's film was released. We ask ourselves, ""when will all this gross materialism, buying, and needless formality end?"" The answer is, ""when it has to."" The end of all of it is forced upon Marie Antoinette, and not chosen of her own volition. The same, the film seems to say, is true for America's credit crisis: it will not end because America wants to become fiscally responsible—instead, it will end when America has absolutely no choice in the matter.When the film is viewed with this parallel in mind, it becomes quite apparent that Marie Antoinette could not possibly have ended with death. For it to do so would run too far afield of its objectives. America's fate is not going to be assassination, but it will, eventually, have to leave Versailles in total disgrace. Right now, the general feel of Coppola's film is that it is a cute, kitschy romp from the mind of a woman who couldn't bother to do proper research. I believe Marie Antoinette will not always be viewed as such. Although I personally dislike much of the film, I cannot deny its important and crucial role as being one of the only artistic critiques of the modern- day problems that few other artists would like to discuss. I'd not be surprised if Marie Antoinette rose in prominence a few decades from now, after our woes have been traded for new ones, and we can start laughing at the old ones.",Marie Antoinette
591,historiclincoln,History lovers will adore this film,9,29 August 2012,"I loved this movie because it follows so closely to Antonia Fraser's intriguing portrait of Marie Antoinette. If you are a history lover, particularly French history, you will find this a pleasant film. However, being based on a book doesn't mean it's historically accurate; Ms. Fraser's account is only one woman's opinion of what Marie Antoinette was really like. But if you read her book & liked it, you will love the adaptation of this. The film is art on screen, filled with gorgeous colors and couture worthy of Academy awards for design. The film's score & musical variety add to the warmth of this film; I had to run out & purchase the soundtrack shortly after seeing this for the first time. Sofia Coppola herself chose some of the tunes on the soundtrack. All in all, this is ranked up there with my Top 25 favorite films of all time. If you're looking to escape for an hour or two, try this movie!",Marie Antoinette
592,michael-843,do no miss this movie,10,26 November 2006,"You've made another enchanting movie and it's not an easy one ... love the way you take your time and let the camera linger. Some might say your story doesn't contain enough action and it's all just a visual smörgåsbord ... entirely untrue. Most everyone knows MA's true story and that's why your decision to stay completely away from the inevitability of their tragic fates makes every moment so increasingly charged with tension. Simply marvelously done. Less is More. My impression is that your movie didn't get the attention it deserved. Viewed an Academy Screener (shame on me this movie needs a big big screen) and thought I'd be watching the Paris Hilton take on being Marie Antoinette, which was hardly the case. Maybe the advertising campaign went a bit astray. Love the bookends of beginning and ending with Versailles. Keep up the good work.",Marie Antoinette

594,diane10981,Just awfully done,1,24 September 2012,"I'm a huge fan of period dramas, historical fiction and anything that is (even if loosely) based on fact. However this film was just painful to watch, it was visually stunning but it was very badly executed. The story was only just apparent in a disjointed sort of way, there was barely a script to string it together and I found several things hard to reconcile to that period. You couldn't relate to the characters and you didn't really care what happened to them, which is bizarre because they were based on real people, real events, things shook history - very disappointing.It felt very Americanised an an uncomfortable mix of period and present. If you like historical films - don't bother watching this one!",Marie Antoinette
595,rreedd20,Sorry Sofia,3,6 November 2006,"Sorry, I was extremely disappointed in this film. I enjoyed the costuming - although the shoes were over the top - somewhat too modern Manolo... The makeup was pretty good except the aging of Kirsten Dunst was ridiculous. But plot? Helooooooo. I mean this is a period drama. It's built in. But there was just all this wandering around. Nothing to describe - who was who. If you don't have a history degree you are just watching pretty people. I have read some interesting comments here and there about this film and while I don't disagree with every rave reviewer... I really worry about this ""genre"". I don't think every historical fiction would be turned to a farce or played out like Masterpiece Theatre. I think you have to play to a current audience tho. The pace was so slow I could have snoozed thru entire sections and not missed a thing. To me one of the marks of a great film is that you get wrapped up in it forgetting the actors and you learn something - it just didn't happen for me in this picture. I used to live in France. I have been to these places - Many Times. They are glorious. The photography was flat. Was everything filmed at sunrise or sunset? And the birthday sunrise? Puhleez. Where was the sun or did they just float an orange light over the water. Ugh. There was relatively little explanation of where they were. I didn't at all get the size of the place from the photography. The palace is huge they had these carriages leaving off the back side and only once showed you the grand front courtyard. It was a miscarriage of the beauty of this amazing palace. With the French Government allowing you in to do this work it is sad that it wasn't better represented. There are just too many things I took issue with. Vignettes strung together with historical verbiage do not a ""movie"" make. Better luck next time Sofia.",Marie Antoinette
596,Goochie_Goo,Marie Antoinette brought to life,9,29 October 2006,"Instead of being merely a conveyor of historical chat like a character in a BBC docudrama, Kirsten Dunst's Marie Antoinette comes to life in Sophia Coppola's wonderful film. Thankfully, this is not another schoolmarmish retelling of a story so well known. Coppola manages remarkably well to stick to historical reality considering the condensation and editing necessary to make a movie, but this is a film that wisely takes for granted that we already know the basic tale. The focus early in the film is on the natural reactions of a teenager who was sent to France as a last-hour substitute after two older sisters died, thrust into a hostile, demanding situation for which she was pitifully unprepared. It continues with her efforts at coping, touches on the maturity brought on by motherhood, and shows her fortitude as it begins to develop within the drama we have seen and read a thousand times. It is sumptuous! Complaining about it being sweet and tasty is like biting into a cream puff and whinging that it should have been fish.My only criticisms: An intermission and another hour would have been swell. I guess I'll just have to see it twice to get my fill.",Marie Antoinette

598,leonstoffel,The essence of Rococo,8,11 January 2013,"This movie, I think, is widely mistaken for some kind of High-school teen movie integrated into a historical setting. It is not.The movie shows the experience of Marie Antoinette; her naivety, boredom and disregard for the stiff rituals of Versailles. The film is not historically accurate (especially the music), nor is it very politically engaged or does it have an amazing story-line and plot. What it does have though, is an amazing amount of overwhelming atmosphere, throughout which you get to experience the late-baroque decadence very effectively, like no other movie (perhaps along with Amadeus)has captured it. The melancholy is what makes this movie shine, bordering on boring, this movie captures the almost painful, dreamy, romanticist sentiment of Rococo. The story-line is as vague and dreamy as Marie Antoinette herself. It is a follow-up of different atmosphere's, almost like the movie is as desperate for some excitement as Marie Antoinette is. Everything in this movie is perfectly dosed to match this dreary melancholy - Tools like silence, music and the aesthetic cinematography are directed at this one goal: to capture the essence of Rococo- decadence as the unsustainable ending to court-culture in France, all this throughout the life of Marie Antionette, as the personification of this phenomenon. Certain details refer to the philosophy of Rousseau, and ""the sublime"", all slowly working towards a sense of renewed aesthetic principles, leading towards Romanticism in the decades after. This shift in philosophy is highly sensible throughout this movie. Another extremely interesting feature to this movie is the music. The decision to leave the Rococo music out of it is in my opinion absolutely genius. Not only because choosing music purely because it's from that particular time is in a way very degenerating; disregarding it's expression and seeing it purely as representing a date or theme, ignoring the fact that the music of that time does not have the same impact now, as it would have had back then. The music chosen for this movie generates exactly the right atmosphere for the scenes it is attached to. I especially loved Aphex twin's 'April 14th' in this movie, it has this dreary melancholy that the movie is all about. Like I said, this movie is not trying to be historically accurate, but rather atmospherically, and aesthetically accurate. To most people the ending seemed rather sudden. To me it's the most perfect ending imaginable for this movie. Not only does it resemble the end of the totalitarian reign throughout Versailles, but it's also as mysterious, romantic and aesthetic as the entire movie is, creating the perfect dreamy ending to a dreamy movie, leaving you behind contemplating on the beautiful, but also awkward and sometimes painful melancholy of this movie. Yes it is somewhat dreary, but that's the entire point this movie it trying to make. It's a movie that focuses primarily on an atmospheric experience, which is in my opinion superior to script, story, history etc. Are all these concepts not mostly ""guidelines"" of movies, to generate feelings and emotions among it's audience?This movie is fantastic for the more introvert, dreamy types, like myself, who enjoy a slow-paced movie to contemplate on. This movie may just overwhelm you with it's aesthetic beauty.",Marie Antoinette

600,pieinface77,you people are stupid,8,27 November 2006,"For all of you stupid clowns that talk about how this film does not deal with the many intricacies of French history, I have this to say: THE FILM IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY. It is told from the very myopic point of view of Marie Antoinette, who knew very little of what was going on outside of Versailles.Also, some people complained about how anachronistic the use of 80s music was in the film. You people are also idiots. Picasso once said that art does not mimic nature. Art and the thing it represents are entirely separate entities. Similarly, this film cannot and should not attempt to capture the ""authentic"" feel of 18th century France. What Coppola does do, successfully, is capture certain timeless feelings and emotions. One way she does this is through the use of music that fits the culture of excess that surrounded the French aristocracy.I didn't love the movie, mainly because I found it difficult to connect to. A situation like the one in which Marie Antoinette finds herself is very far removed from the reality of most people's lives.",Marie Antoinette
601,SlimedVenkman,New Generations of Film,10,28 September 2006,"There is only two words to sum up this amazing film... cinematic poetry Sophia did it again. It's been so long since I've sat in a theater and felt the riveting emotional range I felt tonight. This film was absolutely stunning and sophisticated. Rather than producing another biopic (which we all know are popularly contrived ""gems"" of the film industry for odd some reason), Marie Antoinette takes a fresh turn in a completely different direction. Rather than following a historical Plot line,Antoinette tells a much more personal story of a girl becoming a woman,in a cold world (Versailles). The story was laced with such subtle touching moments and great character portrayals of the young king and queen of France... What a beautifully rendered, intimate portrait... out with the biopic... in with MARIE ANTOINETTE !!!",Marie Antoinette
602,Darthette,About a girl.,8,3 November 2006,"Perosnally, I loved it. Very much my sort of film. The decadence, the old world charm, with the modern edge. Sofia's done it again. It will most definitely be an addition to my DVD collection. Its had its fair share of critics, but some people took from it what they did, and didn't understand what Sofia was presenting us. I loved the transitions in Marie's character. From confused young Dauphine.. to accepting her world in the way she did, which was of course, spending lavish amounts of money on frivolous things. But a lot of girls can relate to that. I mean, obviously, we don't have the resources a queen would have. But this modern world is all about comforting yourself with consumer goods, as we have more disposable income. It all seems so empty and selfish. But in Marie's case, her life was pretty empty. Behind all that decadence.. she has a gawky, austere husband, who did love her, but in his own uncomfortable way. Other characters could have been developed more. Such as the relationship between Marie and Count Fersen. And of course, the queen's favourites. But I suppose they had to behave in such a manner becoming to a typical young woman's circle of friends, read: giggly, gossips and a penchant for shoes. This film was not about French History, Europe, the Revolution.. it was about a girl. The girl that lends her title to the film. Yes, it was superficial, it was about gossip. There are plenty of other films out there about the revolution, and if thats what you wanted to see here, well then, you were disappointed. It is about a girl trying to adapt into a world quite different from her own, yes it reeks of americana.. but aren't most modern teenage girls/young women's like that today? It is a beautiful film, every frame stuffed with elegance, luxury, decadence. The Dauphine was surrounded by it. If it was a film about French History, Europe, the Revolution, the ancien regime how popular would it have been? This is Sofia Coppala we are talking about here. Sofia is taking liberties here, transporting the superficiality of today's world into the world of Antoinette. Ans it IS the world of Antoinette, it is the world around her, it is the people around her. It is her day to day life. It is not the story of France's revolution. It is portraying Antoinette as your average (well, not so average) young woman, with a love for shoes of course. This was a story about a girl.",Marie Antoinette

It was actually a very beautifully written and performed movie.I have to admit the movie was exactly what the trailer portrayed it to be. The trailer had slammin rock music in it and so SURPRISE! There was rock music in it. The trailer advertised the clothes, the jewelry so SURPRISE! It was in the movie. I for one cannot understand for the life of me how people can expect anything from a movie than what they see on their home TV screen. And I certainly can't understand why one would complain about it once they see it. Because hello everybody knows nowadays you can watch a trailer and know a movie and this was exactly what happened in Marie Antoinette. So I give the movie 8 out of 10 not because it only portrayed shoes and champange as the plot because that is what I expected, but because there were parts of the plot that I did not understand and that is no ones fault but my own. So see the movie, if you like the trailer, you'll like the movie.",Marie Antoinette
604,cnohe,Possibly worst film I have seen in 10 years,1,30 December 2006,"What a disappointment! I saw it at the $2.50 movie, and that was about $3.00 too much. I had heard that the French had booed it in Cannes, and now I see why. I like an eccentric film, but this film was all over the ballpark. It seemed to lack focus and point of view. It also borrowed from Groundhog Day or Run Lola Run, but the use of the repetition technique did nothing to advance the story as it did in the other films. The use of contemporary music was a fine idea, but poorly executed - and thus the constant switch back and forth between the visuals of the period and the music of today was just peculiar - and in many ways detracted from the exceptional beauty of the costuming. The grainy photography also detracted from the film. Kirsten Dunst, whom I usually enjoy, had one facial expression for most of the movie. Rip Torn as the King was appalling. In my opinion, the movie was demeaning to all parties existing and historical, and a disappointing mess. Lost in Translation was a superb film, and I expected much more from Sofia Coppola.",Marie Antoinette

The costumes are stunning and the way Sofia has framed it is a bit of fresh air in what could have been an exceptionally dull typical historical movie. I was really looking forward to this film as I've been reading about it for over a year and I found that while it didn't exactly fit what I was expecting, it was a really enjoyable film. Try not to let your dislike of Kristin ruin this movie for you, and take it for what it is, a beautiful film. Sofia has done a lovely job whether or not it's an accurate picture of the young queen.

There has never been a movie that I felt inclined to comment on. There has also never been a time during a movie where I felt like leaving in the middle of the movie. I went to this movie expecting a chick flick with a few things that make it a decent movie. What I got should not have ever been made at all.

607,EchoBunny,Only In Dreams..,7,28 June 2006,"I have seen this film yesterday after a lot of hype up and waiting since in my little town everything comes out a month after the release date. I was looking forward to seeing this movie..a lot. But I must say that the trailers I had seen and the film have a completely different feeling. This isn't a bad film but I think that it well get a lot of criticism for not being historically accurate, not serious enough, being too long, being 'unfinished'... but those are not he bad points of this movie. The style is original and Sofia Coppola succeeds at showing Marie Antoinette's personal side. Her suffering through gossip and humiliation by her husbands lack of 'interest' in her etc. She succeeds in showing Marie Antoinette as a naive girl in the beginning..who hugs her first lady, cries at parting with her dog and announcing that the morning ceremonials are ridiculous. We see Marie Antoinette at the beginning trying to fit in with the strict life at Versailles but further on it's clear that with the gossip following her she stops caring and starts to have fun her own way which leads to her ruin. The negative points of the film is that Sofia Coppola uses the same techniques, the same scenes through out the movie. The trying on of shoes, the hairdressing, the patisserie dishes and the champagne. We see Marie Antoinette frolicking around in the grass too many times. Sofia Coppola apparently tried to show a girl out of touch with reality who lives just to have fun..to escape the wagging tongues of Versailles. But if that was her point the film should've ended long before. This is a biography of Marie Antoinette...even though not a completely serious or historically accurate one...but if Sofia Coppola is trying to show this French queens personality and human side then I can assure you there was more to her than the frilly lace, the satin shoe, the bakery department and the champagne. Marie-Antoinette was a mother who cared about her children and was involved with them..though we hardly we see this in the film except the sequence of her and her daughter on the farm. The relationship and the feelings she had for her husband aren't very clear and his for her aren't very much elucidated. This is a visually beautiful film but I think Sofia Coppola could've delved deeper into this rich personality. In the end you're left with the impression of stepping out from a hazy rose petal fragile dream that from someones tumultuous life. But a dream that's still worth seeing.",Marie Antoinette
608,vespajason,"Great movie,",10,20 October 2006,"Those who are upset about historical inaccuracies regarding this movie should probably stop trying to make our pasts out to be something sacred. Human history is filled with lots of varying accounts of the same stories--In Plato's day, the stories of heroes were reworked in several ways to produce the desired moral. And do you think King Cymbeline of Shakespeare's play really banished a guy named Posthumus to a Renaissance-based Italy? History is ours to cannibalize, and I say anyone non-living is fair game, because at that point they are the equivalent of a folk tale--they have some place in the collective conscience, but unless you knew them personally, what's the difference? Sofia wanted Marie to tell us something about youth, womanhood, isolation and expectations and did so admirably. Add to that a killer soundtrack, lovely costumes, a little bit of humor, and magnificent natural photography, and I say it's a grade-A movie.It's not a documentary, doesn't try to be one. I think Sofia has perfectly characterized how from Marie's perspective, her indulgence was a good way to ignore the absurd situation she was put into, but at the same time demonstrates how this behavior, in a real, historical type sense, pretty much helped to destroy the country in it's own little way. Cute little bit of duality there. Great flick, in other words.Not the best of the year, looking back, but still a strong picture. Maybe in my top fifteen.",Marie Antoinette

You can even say that about some of the cast, they seem very out of place and bored. About Kirsten Dunst, she's perfect for the part as a naive and immature princess that suddenly became queen of France. She's very dull making the film last forever.

612,ChicagoFilmLover,Beautifully Terrible,3,24 November 2006,"For whatever reason, I am giving in to my urge to articulate my dislike for this film. I went to watch the film holding plenty of doubts, but I tried to give it a fair chance to see what it had to say. Luckily, I saw it for free.I will start with the things I enjoyed about this film, the most obvious is it's superficial reasons. The costume design, set design, cinematography, and editing were superb. Everything in this film is so succulent and pleasing to the eye, that I am very close to forgiving the film for it's problems. But just like a beautiful commercial trying to sell you a piece of junk, I am not easily persuaded.My main problem with the film is it's implications, politically and philosophically.First of all, I am bothered that this film is very clearly trying to make a large viewing audience sympathize with a selfish, materialistic, negligent person holding a lot of power. The film does this by using beautiful imagery as it's means of attack. It is an obvious contrivance, and it was just too far of a stretch for me. That is the film's biggest failure. This film may have succeeded if it went more in the direction of criticizing the character, but it glamorizes her actions and interests to imply her as a heroine. It does so not through words or story, but by making a visual connection with the character to beauty, therefore implying that she (as a person) is beautiful.Second, I am not interested in the fact that this film implies that people have little control of their actions. The film implies that Marie has little control of her life and is being led along through the story rather than making real choices, important choices. The most important choice she seems to make in the whole film is to cheat on her husband with a war hero. This is NOT a character driven script. I can almost forgive her for her actions, because she is a teenage girl. But rather than considering her as a character with impulses to give up control, I view the script as being contrived to communicate this message. The film seems to be propaganda for rich people. Sympathize with negligent rich people who hold a lot of power and abuse it for their own excess. Why? I because they have no control of their actions, they just do what people advise them to do. They have no accountability they are born into it. What else could they do? I also hate that the angry mob outside her palace are not characterized at all. They might as well be the ""evil"" Indians in old cowboy movies. Or demons. There is no characterization of one impoverished French citizen. You can barely even make out a face in the crowd, just pitchforks, torches, and grunting chants. This is incredibly terrible, and sends a negative message to society. As if people who protest and revolt are terrifying demonic people rather than logical human beings. I also thought the soundtrack failed. And I am a huge, HUGE fan of Siouxsie and The Banshees, Gang of Four, The Cure, New Order, etc. At best, the soundtrack was an interesting juxtaposition. Maybe because I was familiar with all those songs, I got incredibly distracted and taken out of the film every time a song came on. The songs are great by themselves, but put into this context it didn't work.Bash me and spell check me all you want, but this is my point of view.",Marie Antoinette
613,jhill25,Marie Antoinette,3,3 November 2006,"This movie was beautifully shot, however I was expecting more from this film. Costumes and sets will win awards, I wouldn't hold my breath for any others. As a history buff I feel short changed. I feel the movie had begun to pick up the pace then just ended. The last line is good and I get she (Coppola) was trying to portray the lives of luxury and folly the court lived (which she did), but this should also have taken you to the hours of agony and anguish this woman was put through, the loss of her children, and her courage right before her death.

614,buttonsamy,Kirsten plays Marie Antoinette beautifully!,8,19 August 2006,"I got the chance to see this film recently, and I loved it. Sofia Coppola did an excellent job making the novel into a film, and making the film totally interesting and engaging for a modern audience.Let me stress: the historical accuracy of the film was not done too well. There are many scenes in which I was banging my head thinking: ""If only they had done this instead!"" Although, I wonder how much of it was done intentionally. You can tell from the trailers that the music is NOT historical, instead, it is a mix of modern pop and rock music that manages to fit and blend into the scenes wonderfully. It was a little difficult to get used to, but overall was a good idea.Kirsten Dunst is fabulous as Marie. Hollywood has a reoccurring theme of older actresses playing younger characters, but Kirsten pulls this off magnificently. She has a very young face, and looks the part of the innocent and childish Antoine. As the film progresses, we watch Marie grow up, and Kirsten manages to achieve this wonderfully. Her character is always very childish and playful, and she is perfect in the role.The costumes and sets were exquisite! Rarely have I seen such opulence in a film. The original Marie Anoinette with Norma Sheerer was an over budget film that had totally obscene costumes, so I expected something similar. However, the costumes were pretty right on, except that Marie would have worn larger panniers, (those hoops on her hips) that would have forced her to walk sideways through the doors. Her wigs would also have been larger and more...excessive, but overall, I thought the costumes were lovely. I love the colors! The sets were gorgeous as well, filmed mostly in France, this film was decadent. Versilles was gorgeous! The food was absolutely delicious, I found myself eating tons of Godiva chocolate after the film! This is a great adaptation of the novel, and a highly engaging film that tells the true story of Marie Antoinette. She was highly criticized as a queen, but this films seems to really show what the courts were like, and how impossible it would have been to do any better. Besides NOT seeing her be beheaded, this film totally captured my attention and had me giggling all the way through.",Marie Antoinette
615,leesiepotter723,watching this movie was my greatest happiness,9,21 October 2006,"This film, simply put, is a modern classic. Although it's taken place in the 1700s, I loved how they played punk rock when they showed Marie gambling, partying, or just being wild. Also showing her and her friends wearing bright colors and wearing things different from most others was a great way of showing her individuality and modernism of her time. My favorite part in the movie was when she found out that she wasn't the first to have a child. She is very composed until she shuts the door into her room. You then see her break down and cry and just...melt. The camera makes it look like she is in a very small space with nowhere to go. But then the camera goes back and you see she's just sitting in the corner of a rather large room. I found that to be really symbolic and so fascinating. I must admit they did a fabulous job with the camera work. a MUST SEE in my book!",Marie Antoinette
616,adrianrf,Pretty vacant. The worst movie I've ever seen...,1,24 June 2007,"I can't believe that I actually gritted my teeth and hung on all the way through the painful anachronistic soundtrack, empty-headed dialog, non-existent plot, and vacuous acting, hoping against hope that surely no-one could mangle the intrinsic drama of Marie's infamous trial and execution. Sadly, this was a far from worthwhile sacrifice.Apparently Sony Pictures put a $40M budget into this turkey, and on the surface, it looks like they grossed a positive 50% return on their investment. What that says about current audience tastes is nothing less than horrifying.Anything good to say? Costume design was very good; the scenery was of course magnificent, since it was shot largely on location.But whatever portion of the budget was earmarked for a script and a screenplay must instead have been snorted up the principals' noses, or blown on fireworks, or something, because it was lost completely without trace. The dialog is so excruciatingly bad and appallingly delivered, it's actually a minor relief that there's so little of it. No background is established; no social or political context is established; characters are parachuted into the ""story"" without a word of introduction or a moment of communicative interaction. It's hard to tell whether Coppola either intentionally takes giant liberties with the biographical facts of Marie's life, or simply has no clue about the egregious mistakes her film makes. The film overall is so awful, the latter seems likeliest. Along with failed ""kitsch"" effects, the film's excellent visuals are utterly polluted by a crap contemporary soundtrack that completely jars against the scenery.I'm left with a cliché I thought I'd never descend to: Sofia Coppola just took 123 minutes of my life from me, and I want it back!",Marie Antoinette
617,speakermonkey,Good movie,9,1 June 2007,"OK first off...If you take this movie seriously you must have something wrong with you. Secondly this retelling was meant to be light hearted for Generation Y. I supposed that if you do not fall into the generation Y category you wouldn't appreciate this film. Thirdly this film was I think, portrayed as a teen movie. You know like ""can't hardly wait"", ""10 things I hate about you"", list can go on. I quite enjoyed this movie it was very stylish and fun. I think key word ""fun"". If you want a serious retelling of the story please do not watch this movie. You will be disappointed then you'll make an annoying response. I am sorry to those who may think I'm harsh, but I am very tired of people reading into movies too much. I think people need to try and have fun with movies again. Movies are suppose to take you on a journey to escape from your current reality and that just what this movie did. I don't care if this is a poor retelling, thats not why I watched it. Again please don't watch this movie for historical accuracy watch it to have fun and be entertained. If you want historical accuracy watch a F*****G documentary. Oh yeah Kirsten Dunst was wicked hot in this movie. Nothing like 1700's fashion.",Marie Antoinette
618,australo9,A break from the Norm,8,13 April 2007,"It seems that there was a vast difference between what people expected to see in this film and the actual end product. After reading various books on Marie Antionette, I myself did wonder how Coppola would portray her. I am an avid watcher of Historical dramas and have to say that the originality of this one was incredibly refreshing. Believe me, the film is so much better if you have read the history, as in most cases some situations are more factual than others but the idea behind the film which was to portray Marie Antionette's journey from her betrothal to the King of France to the start of the revolution is achieved very well. Im not a huge fan of Kirsten Dunst but was pleasantly surprised at how she made the part her own, Coppola's films will never be mainstream, despite what happened to Lost in Translation. The costumes were fantastic and the soundtrack (which I, at first was slightly worried about) is excellent and quite strangely fits well into the film. I can see why the French might not have liked it but it was about time that a more real look of Marie Antionettes character and influences was portrayed on film.",Marie Antoinette
619,victoriagdeb,"""An excellent way of giving life to the story of the last queen of France, Marie Antoinette""",10,25 August 2014,"I really liked how Sofia Coppola, the director, has communicated with this movie the incredible and exiting story of the last queen of France. This movie is based on a book and she, the director, perfectly gave it life in this brilliant movie. I personally think that the soundtrack and the clothing of this movie were really well chosen and that the point of view of the story was really open minded. They did this movie in the real palace of Versailles, which makes it a lot more real. The cast was also really well chosen, Kristen Dust was perfect as the character of Marie Antoinette, a 14-year-old Austrian Princess that has to go marry the future king of France (Louis XVI) to close the alliance between France and Austria, with her stunning expression and amazing way of acting.When you watch ""Marie Antoinette"" you feel like it is a really romantic and exiting story with all the beautiful dresses, the incredible food, the amazing castle of Versailles, the diamonds, the Champaign, the breath-taking parties  but at the same time, when all the sparkle ends, that it is also a really dramatic movie.",Marie Antoinette
620,asmlaszlo,"unfortunately, a big disappointment",5,22 August 2006,"I went into this movie with high expectations/hopes, despite the fact that the film wasn't well received at its Cannes premier (I loved Sophia's first two movies, and my husband and I figured that the snobs at Cannes were touché with a Hollywood take on French history; my husband is French, btw). The film was bad, and poorly made (let me stress poorly). I could see the microphone in almost every scene. My husband noticed the microphone first (because he always notices little details/mistakes), but I started noticing it as well (which means it had to be bad because I never notice anything like that). There is even one scene where you can see a man holding the microphone reflected in a mirror. It was so bad, it was ridiculous; we almost thought it was a joke. The only reasoning we could come up with to explain this sloppy editing is that they didn't have the budget to shoot take after take at Versailles.The acting was horrid; the story was a bore (or lack of story). The only thing going for it was the scenery/costumes. Plus, I liked the realism. (I hate gloried/romanticized epic historical biopics, and thankfully, this wasn't one of them). The soundtrack was modern (with some baroque music thrown in for kicks), and this didn't work at all (although it was kind of cool to hear the Cure during their coronation ceremony); the music sounded forced, like it was stuck in there just to make the film seem 'original'. I could go on, but it's been a while since I saw it, and it's no longer fresh on my mind (I saw it in France during its opening week).",Marie Antoinette
621,westwall-145-275285,No idea what this movie is about,6,23 December 2020,This movie simply has no storyline. It's like glimpses of her life in France. The scene of having meal at the same dining table repeats over and over again like 10 times. Nothing propelled a story forward. The ending was just a quick wrap up. Nothing explained.,Marie Antoinette
622,attraction_rules,Marie Antoinette review,8,23 October 2006,"Personally I loved it Sofia Coppola is criticized by many for not having much dialog which can, in theory, be a hard task to keep the movie flowing with out it (which i think i experienced a bit of in Lost In Translation) however the visuals in this movie did a gorgeous job of this along with quick editing in a fresh 'jump cut' manner. I so enjoyed the lack of self indulgent monologues or drawn out professions of love or despair, instead you are allowed to insert the emotions you feel so deeply through the editing, the visuals, and expressions of the actor, Also with the little dialog it is almost as if you are invited to be a spectator, like a close friend to the movie's subjects and analyze them as you might guests at a party. Kirsten Dunst was much better than i had hopes for, subtle and believable and i particularly enjoyed Jason Schwartzman's Louis XVI. Over all loved it, Gorgeous visually and just an over all beautiful movie",Marie Antoinette
623,blinovaes,kind of movie you want to review again and again,10,10 August 2017,"I like everything about this movie - actors, plot, decorations, costumes, music etc. It is not overloaded with many dialogues which makes the movie more intriguing and fascinating. The way the story is presented motivated me to read more about European kings and queens of those times, to dive deeply into this amazing epoch.Definitely recommend!",Marie Antoinette
624,nabaclish,Costume Pic!,9,11 November 2006,"Really great cinematography; beautifully shot. The acting was superb... conveying emotions with expressions and gestures; there weren't that many lines in the movie, but the story and character development was still very easy to follow.My only complaint was that the spoken parts was very hard to hear at times, but I do love the realistic dialog and the ""fly on the wall in Versailles"" perspective that the audience gets.Kirsten Dunst really shines in this historical piece. When outlandish fashions and extremely formal customs of 1700s France bewilder and annoy Marie Antoinette upon her arrival to the French court, the audience can totally sympathize with her isolation and alienation. We feel happy when she finally begins to fit in, and sorry for her when she runs into challenges with her marriage. The blend of modern music with Renaissance was very refreshing. Not quite as jolting as the soundtrack in _A Knights Tale_, but more easily to identify with then a completely harpsichord and opera-laden period piece.",Marie Antoinette
625,lottajava21,The Good and the Bad,4,25 March 2007,"It is visually a beautiful movie in every aspect (even down to the food), and the casting was well done. The movie stays true to history with a current modern appeal. However, the director wastes a lot of time getting to the real interest of the story (or even getting to the story). For example, we see many repetitive shots of the process Marie goes through to get dressed each day, and many scenes of Marie and Louis going to bed at night and not consummating the marriage (we get it - didn't need to see it over and over). There was no value added to the constant repetition in this movie. Why not illustrate more of Marie Antoinette's life? There was so much more. As in ""Lost In Translation"" and ""Marie Antoinette,"" the director's immaturity is quite clear. There is not much story, no flow or consistency of how we got from point A to point B, and hmmm, what's editing? There is too much concentration devoted to the speculation of the main character's personality and not enough to the story. It's like watching something that is directed by a teenager utilizing truly gifted professionals for the rest - a diamond in the rough with the ""rough"" being the direction. Everything else is done with excellent clarity and detail. I give costume, set and cinematography an A - the idea of how the director wanted to portray Marie Antoinette was creative (mixing the 1700s w/ modern flair,) but the actual application of how it was put together was very weak. I stayed with it simply for the costumes and the set direction (and I was waiting for the historic ending but it never came - disappointing).",Marie Antoinette

627,calcoll4,Dragged out mishmash,5,7 November 2006,"Hard to enjoy the slow pace of this historical? (Marie had a fling?) piece. The costumes and scenery would be the saving grace of this 2 hour movie. Mixing the period piece with modern music has been done before (A knight's tale)and does not perk up the movie at all.Dunst manages to keep ones attention for awhile but 2 hours is a long time specially when the story has been told before. What were the long blackouts for? It does nothing but prolong the droning. There just was not enough to keep watching. Almost napped in the middle of it all.Very unsatisfying movie. People in the theatre wondered aloud ""Thats it?"" What a waste of resources. Just like the royals squandering the French people's taxes. (There was that idea that the royals help pay for the American revolution, though.) Oh well. It was a dreary rainy day, anyway.",Marie Antoinette
628,cloudcentral,Critics are too harsh,9,20 October 2006,"I read reviews only AFTER i see movies because I hate critics. This time what I saw was no different, I loved this film. The more I think about it the more I liked it.The only reviewer that I would even consider reading before a go to a movie would be the Onion's AV club. The only reason is, is that I'm used to what they say and I can sift through all the crap. Although I did not read the AV club before-hand, they do make light of the really notable things about the movie, such as Sofia Coppola's directing skills, but they weren't thrilled about the movie as a whole, being too much like a normal period piece that has to check off every major point in the history of Marie Antoinette. But this wasn't what concerned me, All over I have been hearing the complaints about the rock, punk, and new-wave soundtrack laying on top of the film. It frustrates me, because this only means that Sofia Coppola took a creative way to express pretty much a child queen. And I didn't think that it was in any way too distracting from the movie.Another reason why critics lower this movie is because of Kirsten Dunst's role. I did see how they could have thought that her ""flat line-readings"" took away from it, but it felt as if that feeling went away after at least 10 minutes into the movie.",Marie Antoinette

An inherently exciting thing? The end of the movie was even boring.This movie never has a climax (much like the King of France) none of the characters are round. I couldn't give a crap about any of them, AT ALL.",Marie Antoinette
630,tonino-nibbio80,Good but it didn't deserve the Golden Palm nominee,6,11 January 2007,"Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette is not the usual melodramatic-biographical movie about an important historical personage. It is a descriptive and sometimes funny analysis about a young girl become queen.The movie is divided into three parts and this is very interesting: the desperate conquest of her husband, the libertinism and the crisis.Sophia Coppola is a very original director and Kirsten Dunst is a great actress.It is difficult to judge it badly but the Golden Palm nominee is another thing.",Marie Antoinette

I loved the soundtrack, I loved the sets, I loved the idea.... Vision and reality, like cold-fusion, require proof-of-concept. I cannot fathom the amount of money spent to film/produce this movie, but every cent was misspent. This was an absolute failure in everything but the soundtrack, sets and costumes. The only saving grace of this movie was seeing Kirsten Dunst and listening to the background music. This movie is an absolute waste of your good time.

634,hafsol,Terrible,1,22 October 2006,"Sofia Coppola's ""Marie-Antoinette"" is one of the worst films I have seen in recent memory. She tries to make Marie-Antoinette out to be some innocent and light-hearted woman who was forced into becoming a queen. Coppola does not make the fact that she loved to spend millions on her material possessions (while the masses starved, no less) a bad thing at allit's what any 20-something year old spoiled monarch does, so it's probably easily justifiable, especially coming from the eyes of someone who grew up on her father's laurels. Only could someone like Sofia Coppola make such a self-indulgent film that tries to empathize with a queen so completely out of touch with her own subjects. I sympathize with Marie-Antoinette that yes, she was incredibly young when she became queen. I don't know how much of a monster she was or wasn't, but I know she was excessive in everything and did not do the best that she could have. An attempt to humanize her isn't an evil attempt, but to make her out to be a martyr is ridiculous. I know a lot of accounts describing her negatively are exaggerated, but this is no better..People have been praising the film for its aesthetic merits. Wouldn't it be arguable that it's all too easy to create a pretty movie when the film takes place in extravagant parties in 18th Century Versailles? I found all the soft pinks, greens, and blues to be a bit too much by the end of the film. Half the shots weren't even necessary..Being an American film, the actors were American. That's a given. But then parts of the French Court had English accents, others American, Marie-Antoinette's daughter spoke English and perfect French, but Marie-Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst, that is) herself couldn't pronounce a French word if her life depended on it. Regardless of accents, the limited dialogue and acting was generally bad. Not to mention that there were whole conversations that went unheard because of overpowering music.Is anyone else tired of hip directors basing the soundtracks of their movies off their Top 25 songs on iTunes?Kirstin Dunst is a mediocre actress, I've always thought that. Jason Schwartzman (another son of, surprise?), not who I'd imagine as Louis XVI. Molly Shannon?The movie isn't about politics, it's about Marie-Antoinette. However, when the film did decide to discuss politics, it always talked about funding the American Revolution. Why not spend those few minutes discussing something more pertinent to the film and subject at handmaybe the fact that the Estates General was going to meet for the first time in 175 years? That was one of the biggest events that led to the French Revolution...With the amount of money spent on rights obtained to film throughout Versailles and all the lavish costumes, you'd think they could spend some money to make Kirstin Dunst look like she actually ages.If Coppola wanted to create a portrait of a courageous Marie-Antoinette, maybe she should have followed her to the Conciergerie until her execution in 1793. Coppola crafted a film that loosely follows 19 years of partying, she might as well show the last (and most important) 4 years of her protagonist's life. The ending Coppola provided is just a cop-out.There were just too many bad things and inaccuracies in this movie to list. l'Opéra Garnier wasn't built until the 1860s under Napoleon III's Second Empire. Converses?The movie was also incredibly slow and tedious. The narrative structure was all over the place. To have 3/4 of the movie be a gigantic party and then nonchalantly throw in the fact that the masses were angry and calling for change is just bad story telling.Lame.",Marie Antoinette
635,mhouse123,a simple review,1,20 March 2007,"I could take my time and say what everyone else has said but why bother? This movie has nothing redeeming to offer whatsoever. No story, bad acting, bad pacing, no ending, no information, nothing. I didn't pay to see it and I still feel cheated, like Sofia Coppola should pay me back using federal minimum wage standards to compensate me for my time. And I was actually curious about it and wanted to see it. If you don't really want to see it please don't wastes your time like i did. I don't need to discuss the VH1 rejects soundtrack that threw up all over this film enough has been said about that. My buddy Matt from Texas has a one size fits all review for movies like this, ""What a steaming pile of Pooh"".",Marie Antoinette
636,asoncrant,Very entertaining,9,26 December 2006,"I found this to be a great interpretation of the life of Marie Antoinette. Kirsten Dunst was very charming as the leading lady. The film contains just the right amount of humor and wit in the right places. There are some AWESOME cinematography shots and the period costumes were gorgeous. One of my favorite scenes was the montage of Marie Antoinette selecting fabrics and shoes. Curiously, there was a pair of light blue Converse sneakers in the closet in one of the shots. At first, I thought that this may have been a blooper. But as I thought about it, the sneakers may have been included intentionally to add dimension to this ""artful"" film. The film is a slightly modern and ""young"" take on this historical figure. The soundtrack includes recent pop tunes and the actors speak in ""today's"" language, for the most part. This is definitely worth watching.",Marie Antoinette
637,Bolingbroke-Design,A superb historical biopic showing the boredom of life in the 18th century French Court,10,23 October 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed this excellent film. It was a sumptuous feast for the eyes; the costumes and settings were superb which was not surprising as the director was afforded the rare privilege of using the actual location of Versailles. If the costume designer doesn't get an Oscar nomination there is no justice! Also the food stylist was amazing, I have never seen such beautiful cakes.At first I found the American accents of most of the cast rather anachronistic but I soon forgot them as I was swept along by this meringue of a film. Although there was little plot that only helped emphasis the boredom and constraints of the French court and one only had sympathy for the teenage Queen when she broke free and lived life to the full accompanied by New Romantic music which helped emphasis her youth.However it was very historically accurate and I take my hat off to Sofia Coppola for that, I can't wait for the DVD to hear her comments over the film.",Marie Antoinette
638,frankieb_23320,cliché,2,23 February 2007,"I can't tell you how disappointing this film is. The acting is horrible and the casting ,excluding Miss Dunst, is worse. If Madame Du Barry, for instance had been depicted the way she actually was instead in a stereotypical totally predictable way for a woman of her background the relationship would have been so much more interesting. Madame Du Barry was considered ravishingly beautiful. She had impeccable manners and taste as she had been primed as the royal mistress for years by those who had plans to gain from her position. Therefore, because of her beauty, manners, and taste she was all the more hated by those at court because her background did not reconcile with how she appeared. She never treated people unkindly or ungraciously as depicted except for one off handed comment she made about Marie Antoinette being a ""red headed child."" In contrast the film depicted her in the most brash and vulgar way as well as being totally unattractive. She was a courtesan but she was a high class courtesan. The music was also dissonant with the setting and time and proved jolting if not totally an anachronism. I am all for making history relevant but not for rewriting it. I could go on but you get the gist.",Marie Antoinette
639,karashead,Bad editing,5,16 August 2020,55 mins into the film Kirsten Dunst is trying on shoes and obviously forgot to leave her modern day footwear in the change room. You can see a pair of faded blue Vans are discarded amongst the fancy shoes.,Marie Antoinette

It was constantly skipping over time periods and it felt like they left out a lot of scenes. Likewise the ending was just awful. I sat there for 2 hours and felt like nothing ever happened. How is that possible? On the other hand, the costumes were beautiful and it was cool to see 17th century France, but there was no story! It is sad to say, but my favorite part of the movie was the first 5 minutes or so. I absolutely loved her little pug dog, but he wasn't in the rest of the movie. I watched this movie with a group of about 5 of my girl friends and we all agreed that it was a waste of our time since we left feeling worse than when we went in.",Marie Antoinette

642,lzeppelin18,Coppola establishing her visual style,8,22 October 2006,"As soon as I heard That this movie was being penned by Sofia Coppola, I knew what to expect. She delivers another extremely visual movie which is driven by a loose plot. It has many of the same elements of 'Lost in Translation' which the savvy movie-goer will instantly recognize. I will say that I enjoyed the movie, especially the soundtrack. Some of the acting left a bit to be desired (Marianne Faithful as Marie's mother)but this was tempered by solid performances by the usually overtly-smiley Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman. The sets and costumes were amazing. If anything, see this movie for the music and the visual indulgences.",Marie Antoinette
643,cinematikk,"Good Idea, Bad Execution (no pun intended)",3,23 October 2006,"Much like its titular subject, ""Marie Antoinette"" seemed to have run out of money in its final stages and suffers from a terrible ending. Coppola continues her exploration of beautiful bored girls, and to her credit, no one does boredom like Sophia Coppola. I like how she compares the opulence of 18th century France to 1980s US/UK. But the film doesn't have the zippy pacing necessary to pull off what was intended to be a fun and frivolous ride. Instead we are left with a tedious and frivolous ride...a disappointing combination considering the wealth of talent involved in the production. On top of that, I will never understand the decision to end the story with Marie's exile and not her execution. We're not even given a HINT of what's to come! No arrest, no explanation of her treason. Sure, many of us know what happened in the end; we don't need to see the guillotine drop. But honestly, if you came into this film without any knowledge of the full story, you would probably leave thinking, ""How sad! Paris Hil---, I mean Marie Antoinette had to leave behind her pretty palace and all those cakes and shoes!""",Marie Antoinette
644,disusedgrave,Nothing to do with history,9,25 February 2007,"Everyone has given this movie such a bad rep, stating that it totally goes against history. This may be true, but what we are watching is not history, we are watching a very young girl thrown into a life where she is expected to be something she isn't, I don't care what people think I believe Marie Antoinette regardless of her extreme spending while commoners were suffering, was just a very confused girl, I believe this was another amazing movie by Sofia Coppola and that when watching it, don't look at the history, look at the beauty and divine quality of the film, the costume design and music is amazing, if you want history watch the history channel, if you want a divine and tasteful story, watch Marie Antoinette.",Marie Antoinette
645,dezinewiz,Astonishing!,10,19 November 2006,"I DEFINITELY think that anyone in to history should see this film! Every element and aspect was true to the period. There were some very nice stylistic choices made with some of the music to drive the film. They con-temporized it a bit, and it worked beautifully. If you know the history, you understand that she was beheaded in the end. In the film, such does not happen - literally. What does happen is quite uplifting.It had a richness and a decorum that is rarely seen in historical pieces today.The story is certainly one of sad circumstance. Every player, as far as the audience is concerned, was a good person, and had good intentions. It is simply unfortunate that the pair were too young to rule, and being brought up in a bubble, away from the rest of the world didn't help matters where the country of France was concerned.As far as the couple's innocent mindset, the country of France may have well been the likes of a county fair.Be that as it may, history is history. The story was luscious, and it kept my eyes glued to the screen!I can't wait to see another gem such as this come out of the viewpoint Sophia Coppola!",Marie Antoinette
646,mewmeowm-1,severely disappointed,2,21 October 2006,"From the preview this movie looks unique and appealing. However I saw this movie yesterday,and it was pretty much a dull film with very little plot. Along the lines of it being accurate to her life I pretty much didn't expect it to be very accurate as it is based off of the Royal Diary books put out. But this movie was very dull and totally low on the character development! It seemed like they were trying and failing miserably at fitting all of Marie Antionettes life into a period of a couple hours. The movie has tons of scenes with music and the camera zooming in on Dunst in various positions. Here is Dunst sitting on her bed... Here she is looking out the carriage.... Here she is standing there... I mean come on! Dunst is a good actress! But Copalla does not give her enough words, enough depth and enough time to develop in the movie! The music was odd because it frequently switched from classical 1700's music to our generation music leaving the scenes a bit miffed up. The only thing impressive to me was the costumes and elegance that surrounding dunst in this. But what is a movie without a lot of dialog or characters? Count Ferson in this movie must say as few as 2 sentences in this and makes Antionette seem silly to like him as it doesn't express his freverent loyalty and love he held for her. Certainly not worth the 15 dollars I spent to see it, even as a huge Antionette fan!",Marie Antoinette

It was directed and written by Sophia Coppolla! So when the movie came out, I dragged my boyfriend to see this movie. After 20 minutes I was already bored. There are too much details! You see a bird fly for 2 minutes, then it's a sheep eating for 5, then it's Marie-Antoinette going up the stairs for 3 minutes! People say this movie is eye candy, and they're right. The costumes are amazing and the places are just as wonderful. But seriously, the movie could have lasted 15 minutes and you would have not been lost at all!

I consider myself a cinefil, regarding number of movies of different kinds I've seen in my life so far. Someone here wrote, this movie will get more appreciated in the future. I agree. Don't understand negative reviews about historical inaccuracies if French education association awarded the movie. Also, you often have documentaries on the subject on tv, if you want. There I found out, that king demanded all of the aristocracy to move to Versailles after it was built, to surround the king and entertain him. Maybe this also contributed to revolution, if this remained the case 100 years later, because the ""upper management"" was removed from different parts of France and maybe this also showed in economy? Just my thought.. From first time I have seen this movie, I remembered especially the excellent dinner scene at the end, when royals were dinning in mortal silence, still following court protocol, while the angry mob on the other side of windows was shouting for their heads. It makes you relate to that moment in history, how the disliked couple must have felt..The modern soundtrack is very innovative approach and probably also brought more youth to the cinemas to see historic drama. The birthday party scene stands out. Kirsten Dunst is lovely and witty with her facial expressions in this role. She should have received some awards for it. She's shown also in Fargo she's an interesting actress..Pitty Sophia Coppola doesn't make more movies, I very much liked Lost With Translation as well.",Marie Antoinette
649,teenageriots,Beautiful,10,31 October 2006,"Sofia never seems to amaze me. I never once doubted that this film would be beautiful. I mean, after all, Sofia did direct it. I have been a huge Sofia fan for quite awhile, and I had been waiting for this film it seems like forever. I have read numerous amounts of reviews all calling this film ""superficial"", ""boring"", and ""only pleasing to the eye."" Well, if you think this, I guess it just didn't strike the right chord like it did with me.I'm not going to repeat what has been said 100 times, about the costumes being beautiful, etc etc. Yes, they were beautiful, and Sofia really knows how to set a mood just by colors. There was something very beautiful and very sad about this film, seeing Marie spending her teenage years in Versailles and then at the ending, leaving the one place we spent the whole film. This movie is very poetic and lyrical, most people will dislike it. It isn't a straight shooting history film, instead, it has charm and a certain magic to it. The modern music was a fantastic idea, especially in scenes where Marie can't stop thinking about her lover, and The Strokes start playing. Or when Marie and her friends stay up to watch the sun rise while my favorite New Order song was playing.This is definitely not a film for your average film viewer. There is beauty in the silence. Looking back on the film, I can't remember Marie talking a lot, but I can remember her speaking through her actions or eye contact.Fantastic, wonderful, and dream like. Thank you Sofia.",Marie Antoinette
650,elainexjohnson1,Marie Antionette is a don't see,2,24 October 2006,The movie was boring and historically inaccurate. It contained not plot but scene after scene of rich people partying or Marie Antoinette and Henry the XVI awkwardly trying to have sex. This movie could have show an interesting insight into the life of these famous monarchs but instead made their extremely interesting lives seem dull and useless. The acting was good however for what little the actors had to work with. It seemed that more money was spent of costumes and scenery than finding a competent writer to portray the life and times. Also the movie should have shown more about the french revolution because that is when things really got interesting and it would have made the movie more fun to watch.,Marie Antoinette
651,home-at-sunrise,Faults with the film,7,25 September 2006,"It seems odd that a lot of the users who posted about this movie and took issue with historical accuracy went on to list ""flaws"" that were actually some of the only historically accurate details in the film. Reviewers also have come across as ignorant; Louis XVI is panned for his unwillingness to consummate his marriage, eliciting statements about how ""ludicrous"" the film is for such a move, when in fact he was unable to do just that owing to a medical issue that Marie's brother eventually convinced him to have repaired. Though often cited as a loving husband, Loius' mettle as a king is in much doubt, perhaps not so much through incompetence as through unwillingness. He was generally known to be a non-confrontational and occasionally unconfident person, avoiding bloodshed even during the family's flight from Paris, when it would have saved them all at Varennes. It's more likely that this particular trait is misrepresented in the film as bumbling rather than disinterest, a fault of the director rather than the historical researcher. Madame du Barry is fairly well portrayed in spite of the outcry at how ""vulgar"" her character seems. When one looks at her parentage, upbringing, lifestyle and general behavior at court and towards Marie Antionette in general, one gets a pretty striking image of just the sort of cold, opportunistic and sometimes uncultured individual she could be. Certainly the fact that she delighted in making Marie Antionette's life utter hell has never been a secret, no matter how sympathetic (or unsympathetic) the researcher has been to the queen. Once again, it's not historical inaccuracy that damns the film here, but the fact that as viewers we are once again given ""half the story""; due to the film's odd choice of timeline omissions, we're never allowed to see du Barry redeem herself by offering aid to the king and queen (as she in fact did after the storming of Versailles). Thus, we see her as the overblown caricature of a mistress rather than the real, flawed human being that she was. All in all the individual characters are portrayed characteristically in a decent fashion, but seem to lack any depth to what was a promising skeleton of their personalities. Marie Antionette's character especially holds promise, but we never see much of the humbling and maturity that took place with the real queen; thus, it's hard to appreciate the changes in Dunst's portrayal. This seems due to the fact that the director falls short of developing the woman on a more accurate and speedy timeline, choosing to end the film before we are afforded the chance to see some of Marie's most selfless and dignified moments. Paring down a bit of the glittery self-indulgence in order to get us closer to a satisfying maturity of the story would have been a welcome move. On a similar note, choosing not to show the final act of Marie's life, in my opinion, does a great disservice to us as viewers, but more importantly to the woman herself. Yes, it's sad and bloody and it really rains on the pink and champagne-filled parade that Coppola was going for, but it reminds why, in the end, the queen is such a celebrated and tragic figure. It wasn't just her initially unhappy marriage, or the gossip, the often misplaced public hostility, or the indignities she endured during imprisonment...it was all of those elements, taken from onset to conclusion, and this film simply fails to deliver on that score. The movie is certainly worth at least one trip to the theater; the actors do an admirable job with what they are given, which isn't too shabby taken all in all. Go in with reasonable expectations and a heads-up on the films limitations, and you'll likely find the film an enjoyable (if somewhat narrow) experience.",Marie Antoinette
652,silent_hill105,"nice screenplay, good acting, horrible storytelling and music",2,20 January 2007,"This move was so boring to watch that i nearly walked out the cinema on multiple occasions.. I wish i would have done that because this was a totally waste of time. Imagine big brother but in the 1700. No engaging story, no red line and they are playing rock n' roll music in it. The actors did what they could and they did it well but the director should have written the script not her 10 year old son. I actually demanded two new tickets after seeing this movie and i got it trough. See, even the cinemas confess the absolute waste of time this movie is.",Marie Antoinette
653,rezaforoughieh,Disapponited,4,10 February 2019,Sofia Coppola has mistaken the 1700s Versallis with a modern day high school in Vegas. All the dancing to rock music and sniffing cocaine like that completely sways you off from the historical element. I was expecting Marie-Antoninette to take out her cell phone and take a selfie and upload it on her instagram!,Marie Antoinette
654,s_laughl,beautiful but meaningless,6,25 September 2006,"I was so blown away by Lost in Translation in 2003 that I was really looking forward to Marie Antoinette, and I was thrilled to discover when i was in Paris this summer that i could catch it before it opened in North America. While the film is beautiful looking and witty with its pop punk soundtrack, I was ultimately disappointed. I couldn't understand what Coppola was trying to say about Antoinette showing what felt like a hundred scenes of her trying on shoes, wigs, and frolicking in the grass. Are we suppose to pity her, like her, or hate her? Kirsten Dunst performance while strong in Coppola's first film The Virgin Suicides is incredibly weak here as she herself seems to have no idea how she's suppose to play the queen. And while I love Jason Schwartzman in wacky indie movies like Rushmore and I heart Huckabees I just didn't feel like he had the acting chops required to pull off this pretty serious role. I think that Coppola should avoid big flashy films like this in the future; small personal pieces are definitely what she's best at.",Marie Antoinette
655,pretty_sassy_michigan_ch,I Loved This Movie and It's So Good For Teens.,8,20 February 2007,"I Loved This Movie and It's So Good For Teens. I think is was wonderfully made for young teens to learn some history with out being so bored. Picking Miss Kirsten Dunst was such a wonderful idea since so many you people just love her. I am sure I will be re watching this movie over and over for awhile. I think everyone should see this movie and should be shown in history classes also. This movie is so full of color, life and history and so so wonderfully made. I wish more movies were made like this for younger people to learn so much about history. I think Kirsten Dunst should play Catherine The Great next or maybe a young Queen Victoria.",Marie Antoinette
656,UnsightlyJello,I enjoyed it,10,26 June 2006,"To those who keep giving it harsh reviews remember this, Sofia Coppola has a more contemporary view on directing. I've seen Lost in Translation and so seeing her name attached to this it drew me in. I enjoyed, the mix in the music between rock and classical was excellent. If you're obsessed with the Life of Marie and you must have every little detail exactly as is then don't see it and don't complain on here about it. I loved Louis and especially the last scene where she says good bye. I believe Sofia captured Marie in a way that anybody who goes to see this will be able to relate. Ms. Coppola was trying to show how Marie was a child thrust in an adult's world, she was under prepared and felt abandoned and so she turned to other things. I believe Sofia did an amazing job and I plan on buying it once it comes out on DVD.",Marie Antoinette
657,chrisdmorton,"Irritating music, hollow acting and terrible directing make this film a nightmare.",1,18 April 2007,"The music used, (some sort of horrible trip back to new wave '80's), helped completely ruin this film. It took all credibility away from what could have, and should have been an epic film. This project was simply put in the hands of the wrong director. With such a library of interesting and important historical facts to work with, this director has thoroughly made a mess of things. Bad, hollow acting, irritating music used completely out of place, and a complete loss of oversight from the director have made this the worst film I've seen all year. What a nightmare. I simply had to stop watching after roughly 70 minutes, and wash the experience down with a cold beer.",Marie Antoinette
658,suzz_lucy,Acting is ho-hum - Set and Costume is AMAZING,7,19 February 2007,"To be brief the story is good. The acting is OK, nothing too horrid or Oscar worthy. The Sets, props, and clothing are just beautiful. The way in which the film was shot is remarkable. It has a sort of modern look to it, but it doesn't go overboard. It is still a period piece. Kirsten Dunst doesn't speak with an accent of any kind. She speaks as if she were living in the time period but it just seems as if she is reading lines and not truly speaking them as Marie Antoinette. Jason Schwartzman is good as King Louis. He looks, walks, eats, speaks, and acts the role. He was a good choice as far as cast goes. It was OK to sit and watch to say I have seen it, it isn't something I will watch again just because I have some free time.",Marie Antoinette
